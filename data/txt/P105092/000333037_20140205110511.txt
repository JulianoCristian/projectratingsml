F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve utilization of selected
community-based health and nutrition services for children under the age of two and
pregnant women in the selected districts.

                                                                                               vi
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
Although the PDO remained the same during restructuring, all PDO indicator targets
were revised based on updated information about baseline levels. In addition the
intermediate outcome indicators were revised, in that some were added, others dropped or
their targets revised, in accordance with the actual implementation status, modified
implementation arrangements and to reflect changes in the prioritization of activities.

1.      Country context. At the time of preparation Ghana had sustained economic
growth at almost 6%, combined with progress in reducing income poverty, a decline in
the poverty headcount by 7 percentage points since 1997, as well as improved food
security measures. However despite this, socio-economic and regional disparities
remained. This was seen in the strong urban-rural differential in poverty indicators and
substantially higher severity and depth of poverty in three northern regions, which were
also victim of the 2007 floods, and parts of the rural coastal zones. Insufficient
investment in human and social development, indicated by the gap between Ghana's
Human Development Index (HDI) rank (138 in 2003) and its gradually increasing GDP
per capita rank (121 in the same year), resulted in the stagnation of health and nutritional
outcomes, such as infant and under five mortality rates, despite a continual expansion of
health service delivery. The Government of Ghana (GOG) had identified decentralization
as essential to achieve better service delivery, but had still only made limited progress,
due to challenges such as local capacity issues and the high complexity of managing such
decentralized services, as well as the poor state of transport, especially rural roads, and
communications infrastructure.

2.      Nutritional situation. Undernutrition in children under five in Ghana was
unacceptably high at the time of appraisal with 22% stunted, 18% underweight and more
than three quarters of children suffering from anemia. The prevalence of stunting was
significantly higher among children from rural areas, from poorer households, and whose
mothers were less educated. Regional variation was also considerable with children from
the Northern Region being almost three times more likely to be stunted than those from
the Greater Accra region.

3.      Relationship between child mortality, malaria and undernutrition. Malaria
remains the most common cause of childhood deaths in Ghana (26%), of which
undernutrition contribute to about half of these deaths. There is a significant, negative
symbiosis between malaria and nutritional status. Undernutrition in children under 5 is
highly prevalent in areas where there is a high malaria burden.              Micronutrient
deficiencies maybe contribute to a significant portion of such morbidity/mortality.
Conversely, malaria negatively affects the nutritional status of children as well as
pregnant and lactating women. Malaria infection has been associated with anemia,
underweight and stunting, especially among children under two, and therefore, in order to
break the vicious cycle, preventative actions for both undernutrition and malaria were
needed to reduce the persistent high levels of infant and young child mortality.

4.      Malaria control efforts. The National Malaria Control Strategy (2008-15) in
Ghana, albeit still in draft at appraisal, recognized insecticide treated net (ITN) utilization
as one of the most effective measures for preventing malaria. Despite efforts of ITN
distribution in 2003 and the first large scale long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs)
distribution in late 2006, coverage remained low and hence poor availability and


                                              1
utilization of LLINs was identified as a key bottleneck in the fight against malaria and
associated child mortality in Ghana.

5.     Institutional arrangements of the Health Sector. In Ghana the responsibilities
for the health sector, resulting from a purchaser-provider split enacted in 1996 and
implemented in 2002, are divided with Ministry of Health (MOH) responsible for the
oversight and control of policy formulation and monitoring and evaluation of progress in
achieving targets, and the Ghana Health Service (GHS) responsible for the delivery of
services through its operations at four levels: national, regional, district and sub-district.
The National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), established under the National Health
Insurance Act in 2003, is responsible for the implementation of the national health
insurance policy which ensures access to basic healthcare services to all residents.

6.      At lower government levels, the District Assembly (DA) is the primary provider
of public services, including primary and community-based health care. Whereas the
District Health Management Teams (DHMT) are responsible for organizing and
managing the local provision of health services including the preparations of annual plans
and budgets according to guidelines and budgetary ceilings with fiduciary management
by Budget Management Centers (BMC), the principal forum for planning, coordination
and review of action is through the DA Social Services sub- Committees. The DMHTs
are represented in the DA committees to coordinate and provide technical support and
advice on health issues in the District. The Regional Health Management Teams (RHMT)
plays an intermediary role between the central GHS and the DHMTs, providing technical
support, supervision, and referral services.

7.      Policy and program environment. Beginning in the 1990s a number of
cooperating partners, including the United Kingdom, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the
European Commission joined with IDA in a sector-wide approach (SWAp) which
included: (i) pooling resources in a common health account managed by the MOH
parallel to GOG budget resources, and (ii) using Common Management Arrangements
for planning, budgeting, institutional arrangements, procedures for procurement, financial
management, and M&E. The project supported priority areas in the MOH program of
work. Other partners also contributed to the project including UN agencies (UNICEF,
WHO, WFP) as well as the Micronutrient Initiative. In recognition of the significant
impact of the nutritional situation on development and economic growth GOG, through
the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ghana Health Service (GHS), spearheaded the
launch of ‘Imagine Ghana Free of Malnutrition’. This multi-sectoral strategy addressed
malnutrition as a developmental problem in the context of the Ghana Poverty Reduction
Strategy and the second Five Year Program of Work (5YPOW II) of MOH. The National
Malaria Control Strategy (2008-15) identified improved coverage of INT as a strategic
goal, and the importance of both nutrition and malaria was underscored in both the 2006
National Health Policy, the 2007 POW and the draft 5YPOW III (2007- 2011).

8.     Rationale for World Bank involvement. The World Bank had provided a
Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) to the GOG for a Community-based Poverty
Reduction Project consisting of 3 components including a Community Based Nutrition



                                              2
and Food Security Component (CBNFSC). The CBNFSC identified innovative ways to
improve the nutritional status of children in the beneficiary communities through an
integrated community-based approach for basic health and nutrition service delivery.
This approach included the use of community volunteers, community committees and
growth promotion platforms, efforts which were sustained by the communities even after
closing of the project.

9.      When the time limited IDA 14 Supplementary Funding for Africa became
available in early 2007, this presented a unique opportunity for the World Bank to
provide earmarked support to the nutrition and malaria related priority areas in 5YPOW
III. This further enabled the World Bank to continue its support of the SWAp while
capitalizing on the experience and lessons learned from CBFSNC and thereby ensuring
an increased focus on the delivery of key nutrition and health services in agreement with
the Human Development and Service Delivery pillar of the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

10.    The Project Development Objective (PDO) is “to improve utilization of selected
community-based health and nutrition services for children under the age of two and
pregnant women in the selected districts” (Source: Financial Agreement).

11.      Progress toward attainment of PDO was measured by the following PDO
indicators:
    (i) Proportion of infants under six months in the intervention areas exclusively
         breastfed in the past 24 hours;
    (ii) Proportion of infants 6-9 months in the intervention areas receiving semi-solid
         and/or solid foods in addition to breast milk in the past 24 hours;
    (iii)Proportion of children under 2 years in the intervention areas with diarrhea who
         received oral rehydration therapy; and
    (iv) Proportion of pregnant women and children under 5 years in the intervention
         areas who slept under a LLIN the night preceding the survey.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

12.     During restructuring it was determined that the 2008 Demographic and Health
Survey (DHS) for Ghana better reflected the actual baseline of the project. Subsequently,
while the PDO remained the same, all PDO indicator targets were revised accordingly.
This, in particular, affected PDO3 and 4 given that initial estimates of baseline values
were based on old data (DHS 2003) or data not representing the entire population (NMCP
2006). For Component 1 (% of communities in the target area with functioning
community health committees) there had not been a baseline original target value, with
information subsequently developed to provide a cumulative target value. For
Component 2 (enhanced care of pregnant women, lactating mothers, and improved
micronutrient intake in target group), the original baseline target was modified as a result
of the project restructuring. For Component 3 (reduced burden of and damage due to



                                             3
malaria infection), there was no baseline available at the origination of the project, but
one was developed as part of the project restructuring.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

13.      The project targeted pregnant women and children less than two years of age in
all districts in the Northern, Upper West, Upper East, Volta and Central Regions and in
one area each (district or sub-metro) in Western Region, Accra and Kumasi. The aim was
to reach a minimum of 65,000 pregnant women and 300,000 children under two. The
project also targeted children aged two to five years through the support for selected child
survival interventions such as vitamin A supplementation, deworming and LLINs, while
the general population, initially expected to benefit through support for salt iodation and
food fortification, benefitted from LLINs based on a change in the bed net distribution
policy in late 2009 from targeted to universal distribution.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

14.     The PAD listed three components and their specific objectives, all of which were
fully integrated into the 5YPOW III and in agreement with the human development and
service delivery pillar of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).

1.6 Revised Components
N/A

1.7 Other significant changes

15.     Modification of scope and funding allocations. During restructuring the scope
of the project was slightly modified to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of the
investment. Changes primarily included the expansion of monitoring and evaluation of
community based services at the expense of activities supported by other DPs or
considered to be less central for the attainment of the DPO (see table 3). Based on these
changes, funding allocations changed slightly, with increased allocation for Component 1
from US$2.2 to US$4 million.

16.     Adjustment of institutional and disbursement arrangements. In order to
improve ownership and accountability of the project, coordination and day-to-day
management responsibilities of the project were taken over by GHS. The oversight of the
activities continued to be provided by the Technical Committee (TC), however now
under the guidance of the Director General of the GHS and with membership limited to
technical staff. The GHS Department of Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation
(GHS-PPME) became the secretariat of the TC while the director of GHS-PPME became



                                                           5
the day to day manager. The flow of funds was revised in line with the changes in the
institutional arrangements. These changes further allowed GHS to designate project funds
as earmarked funds and thus ease the tracking of expenditures at district level for more
effective reporting.

17.     Implementation schedule and extension of closing date. The implementation
schedule was changed several times. First after the 2007 floods, in which implementation
of affected regions were prioritized, and later during restructuring, in order to allow for
catch up of delays before further scale up in the other regions was pursued. Further, in
February 2008 the GOG changed the second-level administrative sub-divisions which
resulted in the creation of 32 new districts nationally including 12 additional districts in
the project regions. Although these changes were merely administrative and did not affect
the total target population of this project, restructuring did provide the opportunity to
include these administrative changes into the implementation schedule. Finally, in order
to provide sufficient time for “catching up” the project was extended by one year, hence
the new closing dates of March 31, 2013.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

18.     Large existing base of knowledge. Global consensus based on a strong evidence
base emphasizes the importance of delivering a comprehensive package of direct
nutrition interventions, called Essential Nutrition Actions, rather than tackling individual
aspects of the conceptual framework for nutrition in isolation. Therefore the project
focused on improving the utilization of community-based health and nutrition service
provision of such proven cost-effective interventions to prevent malnutrition and malaria.
Specific evidence was also available from Ghana and from comparable country settings,
including the experience and lessons learned from the CBNFSC, together with best
practices in community nutrition. Although more detailed analysis of the barriers to
accessing such services and/or impacting the behavioral outcomes of receiving such
services could have been useful, it was assessed by both the team and by senior
management that the evidence base available was sufficient for undertaking the
investment.

19.     Readiness to implement. To a large extent the systems, methodology and
materials which had been developed for the CBNFSC were utilized to ensure readiness to
implement including the use of regional and district committees to coordinate, provide
clearance, technical assistance and review performance. The approach taken was for
project start-up to begin slowly with additional time for the project to mature in the first
year as reflected in the initial implementation plan however the potential need for
additional GHS Nutrition Department (GHS-N) staffing to implement the project was not
addressed at the outset.

20.    Implementation arrangements. Based on broad consensus it was decided for the
project to utilize and strengthen the existing institutional arrangements for health in
Ghana at all levels. This meant that the overall oversight at national level would fall


                                             6
under MOH-PPME leadership, who at the time also happened to be the strongest senior
level champions of nutrition in the GOG, with day-to-day support from a multisectoral
Technical Committee (TC), while GHS was overall responsible for service delivery, in
accordance with the existing CMS and MOU for the sector.

21.     Below the national level, the existing Regional and District Advisory Committees
(RAC, DAC) including the Social Services sub-Committees, would be utilized while
existing Community Heath Committees (CHC) or the newly formed Community
Implementation Committees (CIC) would be responsible for the implementation at
community level.

2.2 Implementation

22.     Project management. With the departure of the director for MOH-PPME shortly
after effectiveness, the overall leadership of the project at national level suffered,
resulting in a lack of proactivity, insufficient accountability for meeting the project
schedule and sub-optimal communication channels between MOH and GHS. Whereas
initial efforts to address these shortcomings had little effect on downstream
implementation, the more comprehensive Rapid Results Approach undertaken in April
2009 was successful in building leadership and program management skills needed to
accelerate the achievement of results. More specifically, based on the deliberations
emanating from this process the GOG team identified the following needs for change in
their management of the project: (i) project management style, from a nutrition-centric to
a more operations centric style with a focus on leveraging the existing processes and
resources; and (ii) a separate political versus strategic leader, including clear roles and
responsibilities for both. The identified change in implementation arrangements needed at
central level was subsequently addressed during restructuring, and a rapid acceleration in
the implementation of activities and subsequent achievement of results was seen. No
change in project management at regional, district or community level was required at
any point of the project.

23.      Implementation roll-out. According to the initial implementation plan, roll out
of the activities at district level was envisioned to commence in only the 4 districts which
had previously implemented activities under CBNFSC in order to allow the project team
to fully utilize the lessons learned. However, based on serious flooding at the very
beginning of the project in the three northern and less accessible regions, the
implementation plan was changed and 19 districts in the worst affected areas, with
increased needs for health and nutrition service delivery, were decided to be reached
within the first year. Given the dependence on a cascade system of support from central
to district level, the decision to reach three regions outside of the CBNFSC meant that
additional support to local governments was required from central level simultaneously
with technical inputs for the procurement of key goods and services. The high workload
caused a delay in timely delivery of technical specifications by GHS-N, which
subsequently resulted in a lack of sufficient commodities (registers, weighing scales and
communication materials), an obstacle to both initiate and maintain implementation of
activities at community level. This was partially resolved by temporary solutions such as
borrowing supplies from UNICEF, and fully resolved with the additional technical and


                                             7
contract management support for GHS-N shortly after restructuring. Issues with poor
logistics management and the subsequent inability to account for LLINs procured in
2007/8 and 2009 resulted in a decision to hold any further distribution of nets. The
completion of a technical audit and the development of an improved LLIN tracking
system completely identified and resolved all such issues.

24.      Implementation at community level. The delivery of services at community
level was influenced by several factors: (i) physical access especially during raining
seasons; (ii) extent of ownership/involvement of district and sub-district staff; and (iii)
the commitment of communities especially community volunteers. The issue of poor
physical access is inherent to most community based projects as they generally aim to
reach the most underserved communities. Similarly one of the community selection
criteria used by district officials in this project was “hard to reach”. The project mitigated
the impact of physical assess through the provision of vehicles and motorcycles for
district and sub-district levels respectively, however some areas remained very difficult to
reach nonetheless, even with 4 wheel drive vehicles, during raining season however this
was due to lack of paved roads and hence outside the scope of this project. Strong
supportive supervision of community services by district and sub-district level was
ensured through repeated sensitization of district level staff, the provision of vehicles and
the inclusion of a specific supervision budget in the district plans. Some of the best
performing communities were endowed with Community Health Nurses (CHNs) who
were able to draw in additional support from colleagues across sectors such as the
agriculture extension officers. At community level, the enthusiasm and commitment of
volunteers was essential for the delivery of services. While limited funding of inputs and
incentives were found to be insufficient by volunteers, this was managed well by
introducing creative solutions for rewarding volunteers by the districts and communities
themselves. For example, some districts spend the limited “transport” funds available to
enroll volunteers into the National Health Insurance Schemes, rather than paying them
directly and thereby providing better value for money. Other districts requested additional
funding from the DAs to support the volunteers with t-shirts or by instituting awards for
the best performing communities. Similarly some communities rewarded volunteers for
their work by exempting them from communal labor and levies.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

25.     Design. The M&E system design was strong, and well aligned with the strategic
priorities of the sector. It consisted of the following components: (i) baseline and endline
surveys conducted at district level; (ii) routine data collection at community level,
collated at district levels, and monitored at regional level; and (iii) standard quarterly,
semi-annual and annual reviews; and a midterm review. Overall the methodological
soundness of the arrangement was good, relatively easy to implement and allowed for the
existing systems to be utilized and strengthen, hence also ensuring long term
sustainability. The PDO indicators chosen were relevant and independently verifiable.

26.    Implementation. An electronic register (eRegister) database system, able to
capture a broad range of transactional data from community level and link such outputs to
the outcomes captured in the District Health Information System, was developed and


                                              8
piloted and is currently being implemented by the GHS. The project also hired several
data entry clerks at district level and purchased servers for the storage and centralization
of data, as well as supported post campaign survey on LLINs distribution thereby further
strengthening the overall M&E system for the delivery of community-based services.
Challenges with respect to the timely communication of routine collected data and
monitoring reports featured throughout the project, due to suboptimal communication
structures and challenges with transport and other logistics especially at district and sub-
district levels. Measures taken included the use of centrally dispatched data collection
teams to ensure availability of essential data for decision making; continual sensitization
of local government authorities regarding the need for improved monitoring and
supervision; and refresher training to district health management teams and community
volunteers. The system became widely used, found reliable, and relied on by the GOG
and Development Partners to monitor the Millennium Acceleration Framework (MAF)
on MDG5 currently being implemented to speed up the achievement of the maternal
mortality target by 2015.

27.      Utilization. The aggregation of routine collected data at sub-district levels made it
initially difficult for the districts to identify individual poor performing communities,
thereby the utilization of routine collected data for decision making at district level was
somewhat reduced. However this problem was fully overcome through the development
of the eRegister system which allows district to tease out the performance of individual
communities from the sub-district averages, thereby significantly improving the ability of
Local Government Authorities (LGAs) to make informed decisions in the future once the
system is implemented across the country. Further the routine collected data was fully
utilized at central and regional level to evaluate district performance and improvements
made and assess the need for additional support in order to improve the delivery of
community-based health and nutrition services. This level of data management is being
taken on board by other partners such as UNICEF, a sign of increasing confidence in and
reliability of the system.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

28.     Safeguards. The project was classified as category C and triggered only one
safeguard triggered namely Pest Management (OP4.09) due to the use of insecticide
treated bed nets, however no separate pest management plan was required given that the
national medical waste management plan followed the WHO guidelines for medical
waste disposal and use of insecticides. LLINs safeguard measures were implemented by
GHS-NMCP in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other
agencies including a strategy on safe disposal or recycling of nets. No social safeguards
were triggered by the project. The project was pro-poor as its focus was on the regions
where poverty and poor health status is highest.

29.     Financial Management. An in depth financial management (FM) report at the
end of the project concluded that the FM systems in place provides the necessary
assurance that the Bank loan proceeds has been used for the intended purposes and the
quarterly progress reports including procurement, physical and financial progress, and
annual audit reports can be relied on. Throughout the project FM arrangements were


                                              9
rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory with only minor issues identified; no
qualified issues or accountability issued were raised in audit reports. Issues with slow
disbursement were resolved with the change in implementation and project management
arrangements and the subsequent enhanced overall project implementation as well as by
the above measures for more speedy replenishment.

30.     Procurement. The initial procurement plan signed during negotiations was
revised and cleared during the restructuring phase. Procurement arrangements were
slightly downgraded to moderately satisfactory eight times. Issues with procurement were
resolved through a range of actions including the change in project management, frequent
procurement clinics for both procurement and technical staff on the write up of TORs and
the consultant selection process, addition of project staff in GHS-N and the revision of
activities during restructuring and as a result the project closed with one of the most
exemplary procurement records in the World Bank’s portfolio in Ghana.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

31.      Continued WB support. The Government has already addressed the post-
completion next phase with a Bank-financed US$68 million follow-on operation to be
negotiated in the coming months. This new operation, which aims to improve the
utilization of community-based health and nutrition services for women of reproductive
age, especially pregnant women, and children under the age of two in the entire country,
builds on the lessons from this project by utilizing identical implementation structures
while further enhancing the focus on results by utilizing financial incentive for
performance. More specifically the proposed follow-up project will: (i) increase the
availability of high impact health and nutrition interventions; and (ii) address access
barriers using the existing community-based health service delivery strategies and
communications channels to inform, sensitize and motivate care-givers, community
leaders and other key audiences. This next World Bank operation will continue to
strengthen the delivery mechanisms for community health and nutrition services
established under the project; further enhance multi-sectoral coordination and
collaboration; and continue to improve ownership and accountability of all stakeholder
efforts towards improved maternal and child health outcomes.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Overall Rating: Substantial

The project is highly relevant to the country’s development objectives, global priorities
and the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy. The overall relevance is rated Substantial.

32.     The relevance of the objectives of the project is rated High. Ghana signaled its
commitment to scaling up nutrition services in March 2011 by joining the global Scaling
Up Nutrition (SUN) movement and establishing a Cross Sectoral Planning Group on
Nutrition under the National Development Planning Commission, Office of the President.
The current National Malaria Control Strategy (2008-15) identifies improved access and


                                           10
utilization of ITN as a key national strategy for malaria reduction and outlines clear
targets for universal coverage. Further the new 2013 -2017 strategic plan for the health
sector currently under preparation is expected to include emphasis on maternal and child
health including nutrition and malaria prevention. The project is highly relevant to the
Bank’s priorities and development objectives. Its Health, Nutrition and Population
strategy aims to support country efforts to control priority health aspects, such as
nutrition and malaria, through health systems strengthening and strong results focus. In
June 2013 it was announced that the Bank would triple the direct financing commitments
for maternal and early childhood nutrition in FY13-14 and provide additional funding for
technical and analytical support to countries with a high burden of undernutrition. Further,
the Bank new Ghana Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) seeks to address the multiple
challenges to improve the delivery of basic services and hence the objective remains
relative.

33.      The relevance of the design is rated Substantial. The strengths of the design
include: (i) an appropriate choice of interventions based on sound technical priorities
fully consistent with global recommendations for scaling up nutrition and the Ghana
application of it to the country situation; (ii) a strong results chain with appropriate
indicators plausibly connecting the development objective with the planned
activities/inputs, outputs, processes and outcomes; (iii) the use of existing structures for
implementation at regional, district, sub-district and community level; and (iv) good
anticipation and mitigation of any exogenous factors which could potentially interfere
with the results chain. In addition the project supported strong partnerships with other
development partners supporting Ghana’s nutrition and malaria efforts.

34.    The relevance of implementation is rated Substantial. The project was
implemented using the existing structures for delivery of health services in Ghana with
delivery of services through the regional and district health management teams, and local
government authorities as the primary provider of services. At sub-district and
community level the project utilized and strengthened existing structures, namely the use
of Community Health Workers and Nurses (CHW/CHN), community authorities
including Community Health Committees (CHC) and community-based volunteers.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Substantial

35.     Achievement of the PDO is rated Substantial, as measured against both the
original and revised targets in accordance with the ICR guidelines. The achievements
seen under this project against the revised targets are summarize in table 4 and detailed in
the sections below. For final outcome ratings, separate outcome ratings against original
and revised PDO indicators’ associated targets are weighted in proportion to the share of
actual disbursements made in the periods before and after the approval of the revision. In
this case such a revision was made as part of the July 2010 restructuring, at which time
36% of the project funds had been disbursed.

36.     The MOH/Ghana Health Service developed a robust data management system
that responded to the data needs at community level (see paragraph 25-27 on M&E). The
Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) survey was used to strengthen district-level
monitoring and add evidence for decision making to improve implementation. In addition,
a summary end line survey was added to the design when it became clear that the next
DHS initially scheduled for 2013 was no longer going to take place. The end line survey
findings are consistent with the program monitoring data findings. It should be noted that
the MICS (2011) could not be used because: (i) different sampling methodologies hamper
comparison of data; and (ii) MICS data look at district level aggregates, not project
intervention areas. The causal relationship between the four PDO indicators and the
intermediate outcome (IO) indicators is described in Annex 3 together with a more
detailed analysis.

37.     PDO 1: Proportion (%) of infants under six months exclusively breastfed in
the past 24 hours. According to the project administrative data, weighted according to
number of communities of the 5 regions which implemented the community-based health
and nutrition services in all districts namely Northern, Upper East, Upper West, Central
and Volta regions 1 , 84.5% of children under the age of six months were exclusively
breastfed. This surpasses the original target by 69% and the revised target by 80%.
While improvements were seen in all regions the target was not met by in the Central
region, principally because they did not implement activities in some districts until very
late in the project and hence had limited time for impact. Given the relative limited
number of Central Region communities then this has little impact on the significant
achievements seen in the other regions and hence the overall impact.

38.     PDO 2: Proportion (%) of infants 6-9 months receiving semi-solid and/or
solid foods in addition to breast milk in the past 24 hours. According to the project
programme data, targets were surpassed in all regions, on average 93.5% of children aged
6-9 months received appropriate complementary feeding and continued breastfeeding.




1
  Also, although the project was also implemented/piloted in one district/sub-metro area each in the Western, Greater Accra and
Ashanti regions, then given the low geographical coverage of the project in these regions combined with the lack of project
administrative data from two out of the three regions, then these districts are not included in the analysis. However given the relative
limited number of communities/beneficiaries targeted in these areas then their omission from the analysis should have limited effect
on the overall results.




                                                                   12
39.    PDO 3: Proportion (%) of children under 2 years with diarrhea who
received oral rehydration therapy. The use of ORT in children under two years of age
during diarrhea was significantly improved during the span of the project with the targets
surpassed in all regions. On average 73.5% of children less than 2 years of age receive
ORT when they have diarrhea.

40.     PDO 4: Proportion (%) of pregnant women and children under five years of
age who sleep under LLINs the night preceding the survey is carried out. Over the
life of the project the utilization of LLIN significantly increased. According to MICS
2011 36% of pregnant women and 46% children under the age of five were utilizing
LLINs in the project regions, surpassing the targets by more than 50%. Given that the
data used to access progress on this indicator (MICS 2011) was collected prior to the
completion of 7 out of the 10 planned regional mass-distribution campaigns it can be
assumed that overall impact is likely even higher. This is because in the 3 regions which
had completed the campaigns prior to the data collection, namely Northern, Eastern and
Volta, an average improvement in LLIN utilization of 53% and 68% was observed in
children and pregnant women respectively, whereas the same improvement was only
20% and 26% respectively in the project regions overall.

41.     Improvements in infant feeding and uptake of health services likely
attributable to the project. It is very likely that progress on the first three outcome
indicators is to some extent attributable to the project. Although overall improvements in
infant feeding and use of ORTs have been seen in the years prior to the project, there are
indications that progress at a national level has been stagnating during the lifespan of the
project (see Annex 3, figure 5), hence less likely that achievements seen in the project
targeted regions are due to overall nationwide progress. Second, over the lifetime of the
project relatively more pregnant women and young children received health services, as
indicated by the proxy indicators IO 5, 6, 7. Although the administrative data at the end
of the project records very low levels of vitamin A supplementation in children these
levels were likely caused by supply issues during the last campaign rather decreases in
the demand for the service. Recorded levels of antenatal and child vitamin A
supplementation in 2012 were significantly higher, as well as vitamin A supplementation
post-partum delivered through routine services continued to increase during the last year
of the project (see Annex 3 figure A3.6).

42.     To establish if the increase in utilization of services in the project regions over the
lifetime of the project (2007-2013) could be attributable to the project, an analysis using
comparable survey data (DHS 2008, MICS 2011) was conducted in the three northern
regions, which had started implementing sub projects by the time the data collection for
MICS 2011 started in August 2011, compared to national averages. Given that MICS
2011 did not include an indicator for vitamin A supplementation postpartum (IO7), only
analysis of antenatal service delivery (IO5) and vitamin A supplementation of children
(IO6) was done. The analysis revealed that the increase in the proportion of women who
had received 4+ antenatal visits was higher on a national basis than in the 3 northern
regions (see Annex 3 figure A3.7). However this indicator is not very sensitive to change
as it captures a 2 year period, and it is quite likely that any potential improvements in



                                              13
project regions would not be seen given that by the beginning of that time period only a
very limited number of communities had started implementing community based
interventions2. The same analysis also revealed that the relative improvements in the
proportion of children aged 6-59 months who received one or more vitamin A
supplements in the past six months was significantly higher in the project regions versus
at national level. This is good indication that the achievements related to PDO indicators
1, 2, 3, and the related intermediate outcome indicators were attributable to the project.

43.     Improvements in utilization of LLINs likely attributable to the project. The
evidence for improved utilization of LLINs is supported by the significant improved
access to LLIN (IO8) seen over the lifetime of the project. Given that data was not
available specific for households with children under five the data for all households
were used as a proxy and the progress on this indicator, combined with the knowledge
that the majority of regions had not yet started or completed their campaigns by the time
the survey was collected, gives sufficient evidence to conclude that the intermediate
indicator (IO8) for access to LLIN was also met. This is further substantiated by the
results of the post hang-up survey conducted for the project which reported that 66.2% of
all households interviewed had received LLINs between 2010 and 2012. Improved access
was possible because of the increase of LLIN supplies available nationally to which the
1.5 million nets contributed by the project (IO9). While an estimated 5 million nets were
needed to ensure universal coverage in the project regions, given that women of
childbearing age (14-49 years) and children under the age of five make up about half of
the population in Ghana, it is reasonable to assume that the project financed LLIN
correspond to approximately two thirds of the needs for pregnant women and children
under five in the targeted regions. This combined with the fact that LLIN use was also
promoted by the community volunteers in the project areas provides assurance that
achievement of PDO 4 can, to a great extent, be attributable to the project. This analysis
on attribution takes cognizance of the contribution of other malaria partners involved in
the LLIN hang up campaign for universal coverage.

44.     Other achievements. The project reached a total of 391,198 direct beneficiaries
61% of whom were women (IO11) with key health and nutrition services, including
81,667 pregnant women (IO10) and 309,531 children under the age of two years of age
(IO10), in a total of 55394 communities. Improvements in community-based service
delivery was aided by the improved supervision and support provided by the DHMTs
(IO1), improved technical capacity of health workers (IO3) and community mobilization
including the identification and training of 20,496 community volunteers and the
establishment of community committees (CIC/CHC) (IO2). Further, through the
development of the National Nutrition Policy (IO4) the necessary direction on the way
forward for nutrition in the country is provided together with the evidence to build case


2
  According to the Midterm Review annex 3 and compared to the fact that 2843 communities in the three northern regions
implemented activities at the end of the project, only 138 communities, equivalent to 4.85%, had started implementing interventions
by September 2009, corresponding to ~2 year prior to the collection of MICS 2011.




                                                               14
for food security and nutrition, communication, advocacy and policy discourse at the
national and community levels. In addition, the project, which targeted the most affected
districts, contributed to mitigating the impact of malaria and nutrition deficiencies,
thereby improving the health profile of these districts.

 45.   Overall achievement result. Given that the project PDO targets were revised
during restructuring, in order to rate the achievement of the project an aggregated
achievement of the PDO was calculated in accordance with the ICR guidelines.
Achievement of the original objective, based on the weighted achievement of each
element is ¼* (1.22+1.28+0.94+0.87) = 1.08 or 108 percent. The progress was therefore
rated Substantial against the original PDO. Achievement against the revised objective,
based on the weighted achievement of each element is ¼* (1.06+1.26+1.24+1.57) = 1.28
or 128 percent. The progress was therefore rated High against the revised PDO using the
revised targets.

46.     The aggregated achievement of the PDO, based on the separate outcome ratings
against the original and revised project targets weighted in proportion to the share of
actual disbursements made in the periods before and after approval of the revisions (36
percent and 64 percent respectively) is calculated as (0.36*108) + (0.64*128) = 38.88 +
81.92 = 120.8 percent, which represents a full achievement of the aggregated targets.
Therefore the project’s overall efficacy is rated as being Substantial (see table 5).
Restructuring of the project contributed significantly to the overall eventual contribution
of the PDO through the changes in implementation arrangements and subsequent
improved project management and the revision of targets while the tightening of the
scope and the extension of the project by one year to allow for “catch up” also
significantly contributed to the project’s success.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial

47.    This project contributed to Ghana’s development through the following
mechanisms. First, it improved child survival by decreasing the incidence of stunting,
anemia, and malaria. Second, it generated long-term economic benefit by increasing the
size of active and productive labor force who can potentially contribute to economic
growth and poverty elimination. Third, it promoted equity by targeting areas that suffered


                                            15
from malnutrition problems. Fourth, the project contributed to improving the health
system efficiency in Ghana by strengthening institutional capacity to make evidence-
based decisions. Finally, it helped prevent unnecessary use of health care and reduced
needed care for people with less cognitive development as a result of childhood stunting.

48.     Evidence is available on the significant economic benefit of investment in types
of health and nutrition interventions financed by the project. The most recent empirical
estimates of the negative effects of stunting on worker productivity and adult earnings
range from about 10 percent per year3, to as high as 20 percent per year4. Anemia is
associated with a 2.5 percent of reduction in wages. Productivity losses at the individual
level are estimated to be more than 10 percent of life time earnings, which at the macro
level can lead to a 2‐3 percent loss in GDP.

49.     Results from the economic analysis during restructuring concluded that this
project is a sound investment. Benefits estimated for the analysis included increased
lifetime earnings from reduced stunting, anemia, and iodine deficiency and Vitamin A
deficiency. Other benefits included those from lives saved through use of LLINs and
exclusive breast-feeding. Wage information was used to estimate future income flows of
children who were saved through this project 5 . The net present value of the project
investments was estimated to be about US40 million even with a discount rate of 5
percent. The benefit-cost ratio was estimated to be 2.81, meaning US$1 investment will
yield US$2.81 benefit (See Annex 4 for details).

50.     The conclusion from previous analysis remains valid, and indeed, is likely to be
an underestimate. The analysis used standard methodology for economic evaluation,
comparing cost and benefit taking into consideration time effect. The assumptions
(summarized in Annex 4) used are based on global literature and are commonly accepted.
The results may have underestimated the real benefit and efficiency of the project for two
reasons. First, conservative assumptions were chosen when the evidence presents a range.
Second, the analysis did not include benefits that cannot be easily translated to monetary
values, e.g., system efficiency.

  Human capital methodology has been commonly used to estimate economic benefit related to human development. Although there
are concerns about whether all the saved lives will have been employed, it is also worth noting that children saved through current
investment will only enter the labor market after more than 10 years. Prospect of job market may be promising given the strong
growth of economy in Africa continent. More importantly, average wage also reflects the situation of unemployment, which to the
extent makes the concern less of an issue.




                                                               16
51.     Although it is ideal to use recent outcome data to confirm the previous conclusion,
it remains a challenge for many developing countries where routine data system is weak.
With the absence of reliable administrative data, Demographic and Health Surveys
(DHS) are commonly considered the gold standard for measuring child health outcomes
(e.g., under-5 child mortality). Ghana DHS 2008 was conducted after project approval
and the results were used to update project baseline values. The 2013 DHS has been
delayed and it is possible that the survey will be withdrawn. Outcome data is available
from two Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) for 2006 and 2010, however, the
period between 2006 and 2010 is not sufficient to capture the full effect of the project, in
particular the significant achievements made through the later stage. In addition, project
effect cannot be accurately estimated using the MICS results, since there is no aggregate
estimate available for the project areas.

52.     The data at output level indicates that outcome may have improved more than
expected, because many indicators measuring coverage of essential health and nutrition
interventions have exceeded their targets. For example, the proportion of infants under
six months who are exclusively breastfed in the 24 hours has increased from 72. 9 to 84.5
percent, exceeding the target of 80 percent. More than 90 percent of infants between six
and nine months received semi-solid foods, exceeding the target of 74 percent. About
1.55 million bed nets (1.3 million estimated at appraisal) have been distributed through
the project, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the needs for pregnant women
and children under five in the targeted regions. Consequently, the proportion of under-
five having slept under treated bed nets almost doubled during the project period, with
the target exceeded by 50 percent.

53.     Despite a one-year extension of project implementation, the project has been
implemented efficiently. It has successfully expanded coverage of key health
interventions at a large scale, achieving more than expected without additional resources.
Implementation challenges were addressed in a timely manner to avoid any subsequent
negative consequences. The Bank team responded to the government’s requests to change
implementation arrangements, which caused rapid acceleration in the implementation of
activities. Following restructuring, technical and contract management support were
provided to GHS-N for them to deliver technical specifications of procured goods in a
timely manner, ensuring availability of commodities in facilities.

54.    In conclusion, despite constraints of outcome level data, the efficiency of this
project is substantial based on: i) the results from previous economic analysis that
remains valid, ii) the results from output data analysis, and iii) the efficient project
implementation, achieving more than expected results without additional resources.

Overall outcome rating: Moderately Satisfactory

55.    As discussed in section 3.1 the projective objective, design and implementation
were relevant both before and after restructuring. A change in senior management within
the MOH PPME department resulted in poor project management and poor
implementation which ultimately led to the restructuring of the project to change the
implementation arrangement, reassess the targets and allow for additional time.
Ultimately the project overcame the initial implementation issues and surpassed all of the
four PDO indicator targets. It also achieved most intermediate outcome indicators and
surpassed the number of beneficiaries of the project. Lastly, the objective of the project
was achieved at the cost assumed at appraisal with an estimated 2.3 fold return on the
investment.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

   (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

56.    The project improved the capacity of local governments and communities to plan,
budget and implement community based nutrition interventions and reached 5,394
communities with selected interventions. Though pregnant women were obvious project
beneficiaries of the project, the role of community volunteers/growth promoters gave
preference to women and ensured a minimum of 50% female participation. Also gender
balance was specified in the sub-project manual for the formation of the community
implementation committees.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

57.    The most significant institutional contributions were at levels below the central
level, namely the capacity of local governments to plan, administer and supervise
community based interventions both within and outside of the health sector. While
coordination for nutrition across sectors could have been improved further, e.g. through
more effective engagement of the District Assemblies, and improved mobilization of
community leaders and the Community Assemblies, the use of community committees
for coordination was to some extend effective while the identification, training and
mobilization of community-based volunteers for service delivery significantly enhanced
the capacity of communities to improve their nutritional situation.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

58.    A beneficiary survey was conducted using a combination of qualitative and
quantitative data collection in a total of 2,520 households across project areas. The
perceptions and experiences of beneficiaries were very positive although limited
awareness was found in Kumasi metro in Ashanti Region given late implementation of
the project only 3 months prior to the survey. The survey highlighted that the project


                                           18
significantly benefitted the target populations with: (i) improved utilization of antenatal
services, bed nets, growth monitoring and health education; and (ii) perceived improved
health and pregnancy outcomes; as well as (ii) improvement in related skills, such as
hygiene practices and ability to identify danger signs in young children during illness.

59.     The survey indicated that in most project areas community participation, mainly
through the use of community volunteers, was good and specifically mentioned activities
included the dissemination of health education, distribution of health commodities (such
as LLINs, anthelmintic drugs and vitamin A supplements), and growth monitoring.
However the survey also found that some barriers to access and utilization of services
existed. These include high attrition rates; illiteracy and lack of motivation by the
volunteers; financial constraints of families to implement newly gained knowledge on
optimal feeding and care of young children and pregnant women; commodity supply
issues including vitamin A capsules; and the fact that not all communities within a district
were covered by the services. Other issues raised include the impact of certain social and
cultural beliefs and practices; poor communication skills (e.g. scolding) by health facility
staff; and issues of access especially in the most rural communities in the raining season.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

60.     Capacity and ownership. Technical improvements in approaches to community
services are likely to be sustained. Although the project suffered to some extend from
issues of limited ownership by local government and communities, indicating a risk that
the momentum gained and efforts achieved could be lost if efforts are not sustained,
given the focus and high levels of political support on decentralization in Ghana and an
ever increasing recognition of the importance of nutrition, the risk to the development
outcomes is moderate. This is further substantiated through the declared interests of the
GOG to invest further within this area and the fact that a follow-on investment with the
World Bank for US$68 million will be negotiated in the coming months, coupled with
other donor partners continued commitment to support nutrition and malaria efforts in
Ghana.

61.     Leadership of community based interventions. Given the diverse determinants,
both indirect and direct, of malnutrition going forward there may be uncertainty as to
which sector or entity should lead on the implementation of a comprehensive package of
community services. While greater clarity exists with respect to malaria, and the
importance of multisectoral action for nutrition is critical, there is need to ensure that
sectoral roles and responsibilities are not lost as more and more sectors get involved in
the scale up of nutrition interventions.

62.     Fiscal space. Although the commitments for nutrition and malaria interventions
in Ghana have been stated in various policies, strategies and events, limited funding for
such activities remain. However, despite limiting fiscal space within the health sector,
there is sufficient awareness within Ghana, the Ghana Government and health sector



                                            19
entities, reflected in the new health 2013-2017 strategy being prepared, to advocate for,
and obtain significant funding for nutrition and malaria prevention. Further the budgetary
demands for the recurrent costs of the project were estimated to be modest (~1% of the
overall health budget) ensuring long term sustainability of the investment. Therefore the
risks to development outcomes in future are considered to be moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.     The Bank team was comprised of staff with a range of skills and knowledge,
operational experience, nutrition and malaria technical expertise, and country specific
knowledge. It effectively capitalized on the relevant knowledge and lessons learned from
the previous CBFSNC, discussions with relevant stakeholders at all levels, and the sound
relationship with the MOH and GHS based on the previous HSPS project. While a more
in-depth analysis of the factors influencing the utilization and access to key nutrition and
health services as well as the impact of barriers to behavior change might have been
desirable, the decentralized arrangements were sufficiently well suited to deal with
implementation flexibility needed to accommodate contextual and cultural differences
across regions and districts. While the team should have been more aware of and address
the challenges in establishing a formal institutional arrangement for the coordination of
nutrition such as the proposed Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee on Nutrition and
Child Survival, a multi-stakeholder platform, the Cross-Sectoral Planning Group (CSPG),
has now been established, thanks in part to the project, under the National Development
Planning Commission.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

64.     The Task Team managed to use preparatory and supervisory resources to great
effect, including proactively accessing trust funds from different sources. With regular
supervision missions together with the strong day-to-day engagement of the co-TTL
based in the country office, the team was able to provide extensive support and timely
inputs to the client. For instance, when the flooding crisis happened shortly after the
project effectiveness mission, the team quickly responded to a GOG request and assisted
with the development of an operational strategy to assist the flood affected districts. The
team noted the delays in implementation immediately and worked to support the client to
resolve the issues, urging intensive remedial action on the part of the government project
team. Although the team had its reservations, it agreed to scale up flood affected regions
based on a detailed action plan with clearly established responsibilities and timelines.
When it became clear that that the change in implementation strategy was not functioning,
with major delays in getting data from the flood affected areas, the co-TTL met weekly
with the newly formed GOG Implementation Task Force to assist in getting
implementation back on track. The team further encouraged government to contract out


                                            20
some of the activities including the preparation of the sub-project manual, to speed up
implementation.

65.     The team sought to improve project implementation by facilitating the Rapid
Results Approach to build leadership and program management skills and thereby
accelerate the achievement of results. This process led to the identification of the GHS-
PPME director as the new overall project manager as well as more defined roles and
responsibilities of the individuals in the government project team. Although the
expectation was that this would expedite the implementation of various pending activities
at national level and lead to a faster pace of downstream implementation, this was not the
case. When implementation had still not improved two years into the project, the team
conducted the Mid-Term Review early to pursue project restructuring. Continuous Task
Team supervision resulted in quick identification and resolution of any
misunderstandings regarding the restructuring process by the new project manager. The
Bank team also decided to employ a field based implementation consultant to provide
intensive support to the government team on a daily basis and the TTL conducted
monthly follow up meetings with the client beyond the regular scheduled missions until
the project closed.



(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall the Bank team provided a Moderately Satisfactory level of support and
supervision during the design and implementation of the project.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.     Government involvement and political commitment to the project was extremely
good during preparations - when the initial project manager departed shortly after project
effectiveness momentum and staff commitment suffered. The management of the project
remained weak until after restructuring. Although various measures were taken, including
increased frequency of technical and management review meetings, measures for
improved accountability; and increased flexibility in the utilization of district allocations,
implementation continued to be slow. Even the reassignment of day-to-day project
management from MOH to GHS did not result in immediate improved implementation.
Significant improvement of ownership was seen during the last half of the project (2011-
2013). The GHS-PPME led the government team and improved performance
dramatically and ensured better technical and management support was provided to the
relevant technical departments. The leadership, dedication and ownership shown by
GHS-PPME together with improved provisions for supervision to the government team
also influenced ownership at regional and district level including the active involvement



                                             21
of the Regional Coordination Committees and the District Assemblies in the project
besides the Regional and District

67.     Health Management Teams, sometimes planned but remained very limited in the
first half of the project life. GHS-PPME also took action resolving issues hindering
implementation such as the limited supply of commodities identified earlier in the project.
As a result project performance improved significantly and a considerable scale up of
community-based health and nutrition services was seen in the two final years of the
project. For instance, in June 2010 only 10% of the targeted communities provided such
services, by March 2011 the proportion had increased to 51% and by the end of the
project 97% of the targeted communities implemented the key health and nutrition
services supported under this project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

68.     The performance of the implementing agencies under GHS was in general
influenced by great dedication by the core team but constrained by insufficient human
resources and capacities, especially within the area of contract and project management.
This resulted in delays in delivering planned actions and activities. The strong dedication
and strong sense of ownership of the project by key staff meant that they themselves were
reluctant to request assistance for various tasks, such as the development of the public
education materials which were done without input from the health promotion officers
(despite the fact that these staff were experts in communication). While the need for
additional technical support should have been identified by the technical staff themselves,
this should have been a GHS-N project management responsibility.

69.     After the decision was made to provide additional administrative and technical
support especially to GHS-N, the development of key policies and strategies also moved
forward. The technical team under the NMCP also ensured the strengthening of the
coordination mechanisms and distribution channels for LLINs and ensured that the
required safeguard measures were finally taken through the development of a national
strategy for the safe disposal/recycling of nets in collaboration with the Department of
Occupational Health, GHS and the implementation of this strategy in collaboration with
EPA and other agencies.

70.     No major issues with respect to procurement or financial management were
encountered although contract management remained suboptimal through the life of the
project resulting in delayed submissions by consultants.

71.      While the government team ensured that basically all of the targeted communities
(97%) and more than the targeted number of beneficiaries were reached, initial delays in
implementation left the team scrambling during the latter part of the project to reach the
final communities only a few months before closing. Implementation became more
focused on the achievement of specific targets rather than achieving integration of
activities under the project with that of other projects or initiatives. That said, overall
integration of the project was good such as in contributing to development of the various


                                            22
strategies/policies, development of the national monitoring system for community based
health and nutrition services and the development of the eRegister to name a few,
contributed significantly to the sector overall.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.    The Government maintained strong political commitment to address nutrition and
malaria concerns at community level, and made regular and timely counterpart
contributions to support the project. Ultimately all PDO indicators were met, despite
poor project management in the first half of the project which resulted in many
communities not receiving services as early as might have been planned or possible,.
Based on these considerations, the overall performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

73.      Support for specific priority areas alongside overall SWAp contribution. The
project was innovative in the use of an existing financing modality to direct more
attention to neglected areas in the POW while still fully entrenched in the broader SWAp,
thereby building upon the progress of using national systems and procedures and
strengthening institutional capacity to achieve health outcomes, without regressing to
project specific funding. Similarly, the use of Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS), a
random sampling methodology to identify whether supervision areas (districts, sub-
districts) were meeting project specific targets, combined with overall strengthening the
M&E system at all levels, highlights how it is possible for earmarked funding to
introduce innovation while contributing to the SWAp as a whole.

74.     Effective use of incentives for community volunteers. One of the lessons
learned under this project is the need to effectively utilize limited funding of inputs and
incentives for volunteers to deliver community-based services given the overall high cost
of providing incentives to such a large cadre of people. While as the financial inputs on
their own were found to be insufficient by most volunteers, examples of more effective
use of these funds and other incentives was seen across districts and communities such as
the enrollment of volunteers into the National Health Insurance Schemes, the exemption
from communal activities and levies and priority treatment at health facilities. However,
in order to further optimize the inputs for community volunteers in the future links to
performance should also be considered.

75.     Timely Restructuring. The initial implementation arrangements for the project
constrained its progress. The restructuring greatly improved the management
arrangements and helped move the project forward. Because of the implementation
constraints, the task team moved the anticipated date for the mid-term review forward in
order to get to the restructuring earlier. Proactive supervision clearly led to improved
project performance. In hindsight, this restructuring could even have been done earlier.

76.   Importance of local ownership. The leadership, dedication and ownership
shown by GHS-PPME together with improved provisions for supervision to the


                                            23
government team positively influenced ownership at regional and district level. This
also facilitated improved data management through the strengthening of e register.
Community based health is now a cornerstone of health delivery system in Ghana.

77.     Other. It should be mentioned that while the addition of a sub-metro areas of
Accra and Kumasi in the Great Accra and Ashanti regions to the project was done
especially to draw on lessons learned based on implementation in urban settings, late
implementation of community-based health and nutrition services in these areas means
that such lessons have still not been identified at this time.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

78.    The Government team appreciates the efforts by the WB team from the proposal
development through to the end of the project, including the preparation of the ICR.
Throughout the project, the task team leaders and the team of consultants provided
guidance and advice indicating the wealth of experience in handling such projects. For
example guidance on early planning for the preparation of the ICR was very helpful.

79.     The scheduled missions, though seemed disruptive at the time, sometimes helped
shape the progress in implementation especially for the initial part of the project when
performance started declining. Both task team leaders who worked on the project
provided much support but were also firm on deliverables. The CPPR workshop, held in
2012, was also very educative and a good opportunity to share experience with other WB
project staff.

80.     The Government team appreciates the efforts in completing the ICR. Government
team was very involved throughout the preparation. The main comments from
Government team on the ICR were that: (i) the end line survey be used to inform the
project performance evaluation; and (ii) program data play a key role in the analysis to
guide continuous improvements in the quality and completeness of program data
collection and management.

2.1. The project was organized around three components and the following presents
the outputs from each component.

Component 1: Institutional Strengthening for Coordination, Implementation and
Outcomes (US$ 4.0 million)

2.2     The specific objectives of this component were: (i) to develop effective inter-
sectoral coordination, ownership, and accountability for nutrition towards the
establishment of a coherent national program; and (ii) to strengthen the MOH and GHS to
effectively coordinate implementation of the community-based health and nutrition
program supported by the project. (Source: PAD)

2.3.     The intermediate outcomes for component 1: (i) improved health sector
ownership, leadership and accountability for nutrition and child survival outcomes; and
(ii) nutrition mainstreamed in cross-sectoral operations; are shown in table A2.1 together
with the associated intermediate results indicators.

2.4     Establishment of coordination mechanisms at all levels. Although the
establishment of a formal national inter-ministerial coordination committee was dropped
as an activity during restructuring, multiple coordination mechanisms were established
both at national level and across sub-national levels. At the national level the Technical
Committee (TC), functioned throughout the project life, frequently meeting with active
participation and productive inputs from members. It was initially chaired by PPME-

MOH and subsequently by PPME-GHS after restructuring with members from Ghana
Education Service (GES); Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA); Department of
Community Development (CD) under Ministry of Local Government, Rural
Development and Environment (MLGRDE); Ministry of Women and Children’s Affairs
(MOWAC); and Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP).

2.5     In each of the 5 project regions Regional Advisory Committees (RAC) were
established, based on existing social sector sub-committees and chaired by the Regional
Coordinating Director of the Regional Coordination Council (RCC). They were
composed of regional directors from GHS, Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA),
Ghana Education Service (GES), Child Health Department under Ministry of Women and
Children’s Affairs (MOWAC), Department of Community Development under Ministry
of Local Government, Rural Development and Environment (MLGRDE), as well as the
Regional Planning Officer from Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP)
and a regional focal person for the project. These committees coordinated the district sub-
projects, provided technical assistance and reviewed all of the proposals, budgets and
performance of the district sub-projects.

2.6     Similarly, in each of the 77 project districts a District Advisory Committee (DAC)
was established, based on existing social sector sub-committees, and chaired by the
District Chief Executive. Members included the various heads of Ministries, Departments
and Agencies drawn from the Social Services Sub-committee of the District Assembly
(DA), namely health, agriculture, education and community development. The DACs
were responsible for planning, budgeting and overseeing the sub-projects including the
development of annual district plans of action. In order to provide additional support to
the district, GHS also developed together with key stakeholders specific guidelines for
community level planning and budgeting which were subsequently included in the
overall planning guidelines provided to all districts from MOFEP.

2.7      The project reached 5394 (97%) of the targeted 5584 communities, 23.1% of
which managed to have functional Community Implementation Committees (CIC), many
of which were established based on existing community health committees. These CICs
facilitated the identification of the community volunteers, also known as the “community
growth promoters”. The CICs hosted regular meetings with sub-district staff such as the
community health officers (CHO) and nurses (CHN), to whom they also provided
monthly progress reports to, and organized periodic community dunbars (meetings), to
discuss progress and any pertinent issues.

2.8    Development of key strategies to mainstream nutrition across sectors. To
mainstream nutrition into the multisectoral development agenda, key strategies and
guidelines were developed. This included preparation of the milestone National Nutrition
Policy which will guide planning and implementation of future nutrition activities in
Ghana and is currently awaiting adoption as a cabinet paper. A companion document, the
national Nutrition Advocacy Strategy was designed to guide activities for improved
awareness and responsibility across sectors and at all levels has been implemented in part
under this project. Preparation of the school health and nutrition curriculum was dropped



                                            27
during restructuring however the project instead significantly contributed to the
development of a comprehensive Community Service Delivery Strategy which addresses
three major challenges: multiple service delivery mechanisms, volunteer standards and a
data collection system at community level.

2.9    Development of a national Vitamin A Supplementation Strategy. Vitamin A is
recognized as one of the highest priority micronutrients for child survival. The very
important Ghana national strategy, on how to ensure twice-yearly distribution of vitamin
A supplements in a post- National Immunization Days (NID) era, was one of the key
outcomes of this component.

 2.10 Development of a broad electronic monitoring system for a range of
community based health and nutrition services. In order to develop a monitoring
system which could capture relevant information at community level and make it
accessible to a range of stakeholders, GHS developed an electronic register database
system (eRegister) which captures a wide range of program data from community level
and links the outputs to the outcomes captured in the District Health Information System.
The project thus produced a means to provide critical information to benefit the broader
health sector. This mechanism has been adopted and is being used by a broad range of
health partners in the country

2.11 Improved project management capacity of GHS. The project enhanced the
GHS working environment, an element with a bearing on staff productivity. Before
project support GHS-N facilities were extremely poorly equipped making it very difficult
for the staff to work efficiently. Project inputs improved internet connectivity and
provided for printers, scanners and computers. Additional skilled contracting and
technical personnel were provided as well as project financing participation of key staff
in relevant management training and courses.

Component 2: Community-Based Health and Nutrition Service Delivery (US$11.9
mill)

2.12 The specific objective of this component was: to scale up community based health
and nutrition services for children under two and pregnant women based on a
community-level package of Essential Nutrition Actions. (Source: PAD)

2.13 The intermediate outcomes for component 2: (i) enhanced care of pregnant
women, lactating mothers and young children; and (ii) improved micronutrient intake in
target group; are shown in table A2.2 together with the associated intermediate results

2.15 Improved community level capacity for delivering nutrition and health
services. Each of the 5,394 communities had a minimum of one community volunteer
identified for a maximum of 25 children under the age of two who was trained to become
a “community growth promoter”. In total 20,946 volunteers were trained, equivalent to


                                                                29
one volunteer per every 15 children. The reason for the increased number trained was due
to the fact that not all community children participated given the distances covered by
some communities, and the inaccessibility of such services, for example during raining
season, in some communities. In some other cases volunteers dropped out, some because
of low morale, others because of relocation, resulting in the need to identify and train
new volunteers as community growth promoters.

2.16 Regular growth monitoring. In each of the communities the trained growth
promoters organized regular child growth promotion sessions. During these sessions
children were weighted and their progress (or lack thereof) discussed with
mothers/caretakers. The sessions also included counseling on good infant and young
child feeding practices, promotion of vitamin A supplementation, importance of adequate
iron intake and iodized salt, deworming, LLIN use as well as hygiene and environmental
sanitation practices. Caretakers of children who were ill or overdue for vaccinations were
encouraged to take their children to the nearest health facility for appropriate action.
Similarly pregnant women were strongly encouraged to attend antenatal care services and
in doing so the project increased demand for health services and utilization of health
facilities. Home visits were conducted especially to follow up on children who were
growth faltering or not attending growth promotion session. By the end of the project
more than three quarters (76%) of participating children and their caretakers attended the
community based growth promotion sessions regularly, defined as attending a minimum
of two sessions in the last three months, according to administrative data collected.

2.17 Improved uptake of antenatal care services. During growth promotion
sessions, mothers and caretakers were informed about the importance of regular
attendance of antenatal care to help ensure improved future pregnancy outcomes. During
the course of the project the utilization of such services increased in the project areas; at
the end of the project an estimated 83% of women with children under the age of two had
attended a minimum of four antenatal care visits in her last pregnancy.

2.18 Improved demand for vitamin A supplementation. Over the lifetime of the
project the demand, as indicated by the increased uptake, of twice yearly vitamin A
supplementation for children age 6-59 months improved, as well as increased demand
and uptake of post-partum supplementation for mothers. However, at the first few months
issues of stock outs, and hence unavailability of supplies, resulted in a marked drop in the
proportion of children under five years of age who had received a dose of vitamin A in
the last six months, as seen in annex 3 table A3.6, despite the increased demand for the
service from communities. Nonetheless, the proportion of women who received vitamin
A supplements post-partum improved steadily throughout the life of the project and
remained high. This indicator is a longer-term measure and hence is less influenced by
the stock-outs experienced at the end of the project. In sum, the project resulted in
improved demand for vitamin A supplementation.

2.19 Implementation of advocacy and communication activities. As part of the
activities undertaken by each district, various advocacy and communication activities
were undertaken. These included sensitization sessions at community level with the aim



                                             30
of creating better awareness of the importance and impact of such community based
nutrition and health services, and enhanced ownership and community engagement in the
project. Activities also included group education on selected key messages based on the
national package of Essential Nutrition Actions (ENA) 6 , such as the importance of
exclusive breast feeding, directed at community and household decision makers such as
fathers, grandmothers, mothers in- law, and religious leaders, in addition to mothers. At
national level a video highlighting the experiences and success of the project was also
developed to generate understanding and knowledge of the importance of community
based nutrition and health services and their potential impact on key health outcomes.

Component 3: Malaria Prevention (US$9.1 million)

2.20 The specific objective of this component was: to increase utilization of long
lasting insecticide treated nets in order to reduce malaria related morbidity and mortality
among children under five and pregnant women. (Source: PAD)

  ENA is a set of affordable and highly effective nutrition interventions delivered at health facilities and in communities to improve the
growth and micronutrient status of children. These essential actions protect, promote and support the achievement of six priority
nutrition behaviors: (i) exclusive breastfeeding for six months; (ii) adequate complementary feeding starting at about six months with
continued breastfeeding for two years; (iii) appropriate nutritional care of sick and severely malnourished children; (iv) adequate
intake of vitamin A for women and children; (v) adequate intake of iron for women and children; (vi) adequate intake of iodine by all
members of the household.

the overall national program. The NMCP was also supported by other donors including
the President’s Malaria Initiative, UNICEF and the Global Fund. During the first years of
the project bed nets were distributed, according to the national distribution policy, at a
subsidized cost to pregnant women and children under two through campaigns and/or
through various community outreach programs, antenatal clinics and Child Welfare
Clinics or other routine public health services. The oversight and overall responsibilities
of the activities fell under the GHS National Malaria Control Program (GHS-NMCP)
while implementation was done through the decentralized Health Management Teams
(HMT) at regional, district and sub-district levels.

2.23 As agreed the LLINs funded through the project were included in the larger pool
of nets managed under NMCP together with inputs from other donors with distribution
based on needs rather than geographical limitations. This meant that project regions
already supplied with nets did not receive direct support from this project, but that nets
instead were diverted to other regions. Due to procurement delays the 700,000 nets were
procured for the 2007 National Maternal and Child Campaign were distributed as
vouchers of which 84% were exchanged for nets in early 2008. (see table A2.4).

Overall number procured       700,000


 2.24 In 2009 an additional 200,000 nets were distributed through the regular health
delivery system. Neither staff from NMCP nor any of the Regional nor District HMTs
were able to provide any information on the number of nets sold, versus LLINs still
available or whether intended beneficiaries were reached. Although additional nets were
procured in 2010, then these did not get distributed until all of the previous nets had been
accounted for through a technical audit.

2.25 Around the time of the midterm review of the project and the preparations for
restructuring, GHS changed the ITN distribution model from subsidized distribution to
free mass distribution through regional door-to-door hang-up campaigns, as a means to
achieve the national target universal ITN coverage. Therefore the subsequent 450,000



                                                          32
LLIN purchased with funds from this project, were distributed through successful
universal hang-up campaigns, carried out by community volunteers through a door-to-
door hang-up exercise.

2.26 Revision of the routine LLIN distribution system. The change in distribution
policy led to the inclusion of a new activity under the malaria control component one
designed to ensure more long term plans for LLIN distribution in Ghana. This was
accomplished with project support in the development of a revised and enhanced routine
LLINs distribution system. This system, consisting of distribution of LLINs during the
first ANC visit, with the second measles vaccination (at ~18 months of age) during the
expanded program of immunization and through schools when entering grades 2 and 6,
will allow GHS to better monitor and sustain progress in achieving universal coverage
through the door-to-door hang up campaigns, and to allow LLIN promotion at
community and health facility level to build on improved, and sustained LLIN access.

2.27 Improved tracking of the distribution of bed nets. In the early stages of the
program, the lack of information on the amount and utilization of funds collected and bed
net distribution, led to the expansion of the M&E component for the NMCP during
restructuring of the project. The project gave support to the development of an improved
LLIN tracking system to address weaknesses in the existing logistics management
system. While the initially planned insecticide resistance monitoring was dropped as it
was supported by others and fell outside the main focus of the project. Staff from the
Regional Medical Stores and the District Health Management Teams (DHMT) was
trained on how to use the new system as well as trained in general logistical management.

2.28 Improved utilization of LLINs in Ghana. Over the life of the project the
utilization of LLINs improved in general in Ghana. Because national data (MICS 2011)
was collected before the regional Universal Coverage Campaigns were initiated or fully
completed in the majority of regions including Northern, Upper East, Upper West,
Central and Western regions, it is not possible to accurately assess whether there was
increased utilization was seen as a result of the promotion of bed nets by the project-
supported community growth promoters and community health workers.

2.29 Improved safeguards management for bed nets. With support from the project
the Occupational Health Department under GHS developed a national strategy on the safe
disposal or recycling of insecticide treated bed nets.

Annex 3. Analysis of the PDO and intermediate indicators

3.1     The relationship between the various PDO and intermediate indicators, also
known as the results chain, is depicted in figure 1 below. Given the causal relationships
between PDO indicators 1,2,3, and intermediate outcome (IO) indicators
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11 and similarly the relationship between PDO 4 and IO 8,9 indicators,
then these will be discussed in that order.

Project Development Objective 1: “Proportion (%) of infants under six months
exclusively breastfed in the past 24 hours”. (Achievement of revised target: 84.5/80 =
106%) – Achieved

3.2.   Improvement in exclusive breastfeeding rates. According to the project
administrative data, weighted according to number of communities of the 5 regions
which implemented the community-based health and nutrition services in all districts
namely Northern, Upper East, Upper West, Central and Volta regions, 84.5% of children
under the age of six months were exclusively breastfed. This surpasses the original target
by 69% and the revised target by 80% (see figure A3.2 below).

   Figure A3.2: Exclusive breastfeeding prevalence (%) in project regions at start and end of project

3.1 While improvements were seen in all regions the target was not met by in the Central
    region, principally because they did not implement activities in some districts until
    very late in the project and hence had limited time for impact. Given the relative
    limited number of communities in this region this has little impact on the significant
    achievements seen in the other regions and hence the overall impact.

3.2 The planned DHS 2013 did not take place and given issues with the quality of the
    endline survey, project administrative data was used instead for this as well as for the
    other outcome indicators. Also, although the project was also implemented/piloted in
    one district/sub-metro area each in the Western, Greater Accra and Ashanti regions,
    given the limited project geographical coverage in these regions combined with the
    lack of project administrative data from two out of the three aforementioned regions,
    these districts were not included in the analysis. However given the relative limited
    number of communities/beneficiaries targeted in these areas their omission from the
    analysis should have limited effect on the overall results.


Project Development Objective 2: “Proportion of infants 6-9 months receiving semi-
solid and/or solid foods in addition to breast milk in the past 24 hours” (Achievement of
revised target: 93.5/74 = 126%) - Achieved

3.3 Improvement in appropriate feeding practices of children age 6-9 months.
    According to project administrative data the targets were surpassed in all regions, on
    average 93.5% of children aged 6-9 months received appropriate complementary
    feeding and continued breastfeeding (figure A3.3 below).

who received oral rehydration therapy” (Achievement of revised target: 73.3/59 = 124%)
– Achieved

3.4 Improvement in use of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT). The use of ORT in
    children under two years of age during diarrhea was significantly improved during the
    span of the project with the targets were surpassed in all regions. On average 73.5%
    of children less than 2 years of age receive ORT when they have diarrhea.

3.5 Progress seen likely attributable to the project. First, while other factors might
    also have had impact, significant progress on the first three project outcome
    indicators is attributable to the project. For example, while improvements in infant
    feeding and use of ORTs occurred in the years prior to the project, national level
    progress stagnated during the lifespan of the project (see figure A3.5 below). It was
    therefore unlikely achievements seen in the project regions were due to overall
    nationwide progress, but rather due to efforts of the project.




   Figure A3.5: Trends in prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding, timely complementary feeding practices
   and use of ORT in Ghana (1988-2011)

3.6 Secondly, over the lifetime of the project relatively more pregnant women and young
    children received health services, as indicated by the proxy indicators IO 5, 6, 7.
    Although the administrative data at the end of the project reflect very low levels of
    vitamin A supplementation in children, this was likely caused by supply issues during
    the last campaign rather than any permanent decrease in the demand for the service.
    In fact levels recorded in 2012 were significantly higher and the levels of vitamin A
    supplementation post-partum delivered through routine services continued to increase
    during the last year of the project (see figure A3.6 below).




                                                 37
     Figure A3.6: Proportion (%) of pregnant women, new mothers and children under five receiving key
     health and nutrition services at start and end of project

3.7 To determine if the increase in utilization of services in the project regions over the
    lifetime of the project (2007-2013) could be attributable to the project, an analysis
    using comparable survey data (DHS 2008, MICS 2011) was conducted. The three
    northern regions were chosen because they had started implementing sub projects by
    the time the data collection for MICS 2011 started (August 2011), versus overall
    national averages. Given that MICS 2011 did not include an indicator for vitamin A
    supplementation postpartum (IO7), only analysis of antenatal service delivery (IO5)
    and vitamin A supplementation of children (IO6) was done.

3.8 The analysis revealed that the increase in the proportion of women who made 4+
    antenatal visits was higher on a national basis than in the 3 northern regions (see
    figure A3.7). However this indicator is not very sensitive to interventions made
    recently because it captures a 2 year period. As a result it is quite likely that any
    potential improvements in project regions would not be reflected given that at the
    beginning of that time period only a very limited number of communities had started
    implementing community based interventions7. The same analysis also revealed that
    the relative improvements in the proportion of children aged 6-59 months who
    received one or more vitamin A supplements in the past six months was significantly
    higher in the project regions versus at national level.


7
  According to the Midterm Review annex 3 and compared to the fact that 2843 communities in the three northern regions
implemented activities at the end of the project, only 138 communities, equivalent to 4.85%, had started implementing interventions
by September 2009, corresponding to ~2 year prior to the collection of MICS 2011.




                                                               38
   Figure A3.7: Proportion (%) of pregnant women and children under five receiving key health and
   nutrition services (IO 5,6) at start (DHS 2008) and end of project (MICS 2011)

3.9 Therefore there is good indication that the achievements related to PDO indicators
    1,2,3 and the related intermediate outcome indicators were attributable to the project.


Project Development Objective 4: “Proportion of pregnant women and children under
five years of age who sleep under LLINs the night preceding the survey is carried out”
(Achievement of revised target for pregnant women: 36/25 = 144%) (Achievement of
revised target for children: 46/30 = 153%) - Achieved

3.10 Usage of LLINs has significantly improved. Over the life of the project the
    utilization of LLINs significantly increased. According to MICS 2011 36% of
    pregnant women and 46% children under the age of five were utilizing LLINs in the
    project regions, surpassing the targets by more than 50% (see figure A3.8 below).




                                                 39
   Figure A3.8: Progress on the use of LLIN and ITN by pregnant women and children under five

3.11 The data used to access progress on this indicator (MICS 2011) was collected
    prior to the completion of seven out of the 10 planned regional mass-distribution
    campaigns and it can be assumed that overall impact is likely even higher. This is
    because in the 3 regions which completed the campaigns prior to the data collection,
    namely Northern, Eastern and Volta, an average improvement in bed net utilization
    of 53% and 68% was observed in children and pregnant women respectively, whereas
    the same improvement was only 20% and 26% respectively in the project regions
    overall (see figure A3.9 below).

   Figure A3.9: Improvements in use of ITN by pregnant women (PW) and children (<5 years)

3.12 The evidence for improved utilization of LLINs is supported by significant
    improved access to LLIN (IO8) seen over the lifetime of the project (figure A3.10).
    Data was not available specific for households with children under five and therefore
    data for all households were used as a proxy. The progress made on this indicator,
    especially given that the majority of regions had not yet started or completed their
    campaigns by the time the survey was collected, gives sufficient evidence to conclude
    that the intermediate indicator (IO8) for access to LLIN was also met. This is further
    substantiated by the results of the post hang-up survey conducted for the project
    which reported that 66.2% of all households interviewed had received LLINs between
    2010 and 2012.

   Figure A3.10: Trend in utilization and ownership of ITNs in project regions versus national averages

3.13 Improvement in access was made possible through the increase of LLIN supplies
    available nationally to which 1.5 million nets were contributed by the project (IO9).
    While an estimated 5 million nets were needed to ensure universal coverage in the
    project regions, then given that women of childbearing age (14-49 years) and children
    under the age of five make up about half of the population in Ghana, it is reasonable
    to assume that the nets financed under this project correspond to approximately two
    thirds of the needs for pregnant women and children under five in the targeted regions.
    This combined with the fact that LLIN use was also promoted by the community
    volunteers in the project areas, provides assurance that achievement of PDO 4, to a
    great extent, is attributable to the project.

3.14 Other achievements. The project reached a total of 391,198 direct beneficiaries
    61% of whom were women (IO11) with key health and nutrition services, including
    81,667 pregnant women (IO10) and 309,531 children under the age of two years of
    age (IO10), in a total of 55394 communities. The improvements in community-based
    service delivery was aided by the improved supervision and support provided by the
    DHMTs (IO1), improved technical capacity of health workers (IO3) and community
    mobilization including the identification and training of 20,496 community volunteers
    and the establishment of community committees (CIC/CHC) (IO2). Further, through
    the development of the National Nutrition Policy (IO4), the Ghana roadmap for
    nutrition improvement in the country is provided, along with the underlying evidence
    to make the case for food security and nutrition, communication, advocacy and policy
    discourse at national, regional, district and community levels.

Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis

4.1. The World Bank (IDA) financed Nutrition and Malaria Control for Child Survival
    Project (MCCSP) aimed to improve utilization of selected community-based health
    and nutrition services for children under the age of two and pregnant women in
    selected districts. It supported: (i) strengthening institutional capacity of relevant
    central, regional and district governments to bring cross-sectoral coordination and
    collaboration for effective and efficient management of results; (ii) creating demand
    for and expanding community-based delivery of selected health and nutrition services
    directly related to health and nutrition outcomes; and (iii) accelerating provision and
    promoting the utilization of LLINs for malaria prevention. The Bank financed the
    project in the amount of $25million during the period between 2007 and 2013. It is
    estimated that about 91 percent was spent directly planning and delivery of
    community-based health and nutrition services.

Project Development Impact

4.2.This project contributed to Ghana’s development through the following pathways.

              o First, it contributed to improving child survival by decreasing the
                incidence of stunting, anemia and malaria. According to WHO,
                malnutrition is the underlying contributing factor in about 45 percent of all
                child deaths and this can be prevented through improved nutrition
                practices. A recent World Bank study in Kenya demonstrated that
                increased ownership of insecticide-treated bed nets in endemic malaria
                zones explained 58 percent of the decline in infant mortality.

              o Second, it generated long-term economic benefit by increasing active and
                productive labor force who can potentially contribute to economic growth
                and poverty elimination. With improved nutrition status, more children
                will survive into adulthood and work more productively as a result of
                better cognitive development. The most recent empirical estimates of the
                negative effects of stunting on worker productivity and adult earnings
                range from about 10 percent per year8, to as high as 20 percent per year9.
                Anemia is associated with a 2.5 percent of reduction in wages.
                Productivity losses at the individual level are estimated to be more than 10
                percent of life time earnings, which at the macro level can lead to a 2‐3
                percent loss in GDP.

              o Third, it promoted equity by targeting areas where malnutrition is more
                prevalent. In all the five fully-covered provinces, the prevalence of

               stunting was higher than national average. This is a proxy measure for
               targeting poor population as poor people are more likely to have
               malnutrition and malaria. The project was also timely adjusted to cover the
               districts in the areas worst affected by serious flooding.

           o Fourth, the project contributed to improving the efficiency of program
             implementation in Ghana by strengthening institutional capacity to take
             large-scale outcome improvement actions. For example, the MOH /Ghana
             Health Service developed a robust data management system that
             responded to the data needs at community level. Although not quantified,
             this greatly helps the country’s capacity in making evidence-based
             decisions and realizing potential efficiency gains.

           o Fifth, the project is also associated with other benefits such as prevented
             downstream losses from high use of health resources, required extra care
             for people with less cognitive development as a result of childhood
             stunting.

Justification for pubic intervention


4.3.Working with the public sector through this project is economically justified since: (i)
    it focused on high impact and cost effective nutrition and malaria interventions which
    are a public good, enabling better use of the finite resources; (ii) the presence of
    positive externalities through the consumption and/or production of goods and
    services that would otherwise not have been consumed; (iii) addressing market
    failures arising from imbalance between the knowledge of the supplier and the
    knowledge available to the consumer (information asymmetry); and (iv) having
    partnership with private sector is not practical in the target areas given their limited
    availability.


Cost-benefit Analysis

4.4.Although it is ideal to use recent outcome data to confirm the previous conclusion, it
    remains a challenge for many developing countries where routine data system is weak.
    With the absence of reliable administrative data, Demographic and Health Surveys
    (DHS) are commonly considered the gold standard for measuring child health
    outcomes (e.g., under-5 child mortality). Ghana DHS 2008 was conducted after
    project approval and the results were used to update project baseline values. The 2013
    DHS has been delayed and it is possible that the survey will be withdrawn. There are
    data available from two Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) for 2006 and
    2010. This period is not enough to capture the full effect of the project, in particular
    the significant achievements made through the later stage. In addition, project effect
    cannot be accurately estimated using the MICS results, since there is no aggregate
    estimate available for the project areas.



                                            44
4.5.The results at output level, however, indicates that the outcome may have improved
    more than expected, because many indicators measuring coverage of essential health
    and nutrition interventions have exceeded their targets. For example, the proportion
    of infants under six months who are exclusively breastfed in the 24 hours has
    increased from 72. 9 to 84.5 percent, exceeding the target of 80 percent. More than 90
    percent of infants between six and nine months received semi-solid foods, exceeding
    the target of 74 percent. About 1.55 million bed nets (1.3 million estimated at
    appraisal) have been distributed through the project, accounting for approximately
    two-thirds of the needs for pregnant women and children under five in the targeted
    regions. Consequently, the proportion of under-five having slept under treated bed
    nets almost doubled during the project period, with the target exceeded by 50 percent.

4.6.Despite a one-year extension of project implementation, the project has been
    implemented efficiently. It has successfully expanded coverage of key health
    interventions at a large scale, achieving more than expected without additional
    resources. Implementation challenges were addressed in a timely manner to avoid any
    subsequent negative consequences. The Bank team responded to the government’s
    requests to change implementation arrangements, which caused rapid acceleration in
    the implementation of activities. Technical and contract management support were
    provided to GHS-N for them to deliver technical specifications of procured goods in a
    timely manner, ensuring availability of commodities in facilities.

4.7.The results from previous economic analysis remain valid based on the following
    ground.
           o The previous analysis used the standard World Bank methods for
               evaluating projects where investment costs of resources used are
               compared with the stream of economic benefits, where stream of benefits
               and costs are discounted to present values using a discount rate to
               represent the opportunity cost of capital in the country.
           o The assumptions used by the previous economic analysis were either
               based on Ghana specific health parameter or global scientific literature,
               with average or conservative estimate chosen when there is a range.
           o Although not being quantified, it is expected that similar or even stronger
               results may come out of the analysis if data were available. The previous
               analysis was based on the target results specified in the project design. As
               the report shows in other sections, many indicators have exceeded original
               targets. It is therefore possible that the project has achieved greater
               benefits than being estimated previously. In addition, the analysis did not
               include some benefits that cannot be easily translated to monetary values,
               e.g., system efficiency.


Summary of previous cost-benefit analysis

4.8.At appraisal, the cost-benefit analysis concluded that, at 5 percent discount rate, the
    net present value of the project investments was estimated at about US32.3 million



                                            45
   with an internal rate of return estimated at 22 percent and a high benefit-cost ratio of
   2.4. The results were robust to changing discount rate as 10 percent, halving the
   assumed effect of controlling anemia, iodine deficiency and malaria, or halving the
   assumed effect of exclusive breast feeding.

4.9.The analysis was updated at restructuring to reflect changes in flow of benefits due to
    implementation delay. The analysis showed that the benefit-cost ratio as 2.81 with a
    net present value of close to US$40 million.

4.10. The methodology used in this project analysis was the standard World Bank
    methods for evaluating projects where investment costs of resources used are
    compared with the stream of economic benefits. This was the standard cost-benefit
    analysis, in which the stream of benefits and costs were discounted to present values
    using a discount rate to represent the opportunity cost of capital in the country. This
    analysis used 5 percent discount rate, but a sensitivity analysis using 10 percent is
    also estimated to assess the impact of higher opportunity cost of capital.

4.11. The direct beneficiaries of the project included about 50 percent children under 24
    months (about 600,000) in the Northern, Upper West, Upper East, Volta and Central
    Regions, totaling 300,000. Pregnant and lactating women in these areas were also
    beneficiaries of the project. Likewise the 1.3 million LLINs financed by the project
    were distributed to all regions in the country, as part of the NMCP.




                                            46
4.12. Benefits estimated for the analysis included increased lifetime earnings from
    reduced stunting, anemia, and iodine deficiency, reduced vitamin A deficiency, and
    lives saved from malaria intervention using LLINs, and economic benefits from
    exclusive breastfeeding derived from increased child survival. Human capital
    methodology was used to estimate future income flows of children who were saved
    through this project and will survive to adulthood10.

4.13.       Key assumptions used by previous economic analysis:
               o An earnings premium of roughly 10% (for stunting avoidance), and 4%
                   (for anemia avoidance) was applied as the effect of increased productivity
                   potential.

                 o Based on Levin et al (1993), severely impaired persons due to iodine
                   deficiency were 25% less productive compared to unaffected individuals.

                 o The relative risk of diarrhea mortality of partial versus exclusive
                   breastfeeding for infants between 0-5 months was 3.011 and the relative
                   risk for morbidity was 18.0.

                 o Daily production of breast milk for exclusively breastfeeding mothers was
                   0.750 liters per day and 0.51 liters for those partially breastfeeding12. The
                   value of breast milk was estimated using the value of substitutes—
                   artificial formula---at about $1 per liter.

                 o Given that contributions under this project was only for a small part of the
                   overall vitamin A supplementation program in Ghana, the benefits
                   estimated for purposes of this analysis was assumed at only a fraction of
                   the overall benefits of the vitamin A supplementation program.

                 o For benefits of the malaria control, this analysis used the value of the
                   reduction in the number of deaths of children under five as a result of the
                   distribution of the ITNs in the areas covered by the project. A mortality
                   prevention rate of half accounted for by this project in the targeted areas is
                   assumed.

   Human capital methodology has been commonly used to estimate economic benefit related to human development. Although there
are concerns about whether all the saved lives will have been employed, it is also worth noting that children saved through current
investment will only enter the labor market after more than 10 years. Prospect of job market may be promising given the strong
growth of economy in Africa continent. More importantly, average wage also reflects the situation of unemployment, which to the
extent makes the concern less of an issue.

Annex 6. Beneficiary Survey Results

6.1 In order to assess the views and perceptions of the direct beneficiaries in the
intervention areas and the institutional stakeholders of the NMCCSP to provide feedback
for project improvements, a Beneficiary Survey was conducted in March 2013 in 2
district each from the Northern, Upper East, Upper West, Central, and Volta regions as
well in the district/sub-metro area in the Western, Ashanti and Greater Accra regions.

6.2 This was done through focus group discussions, key informant interviews and a
questionnaire administered to the target direct beneficiaries based on the random
sampling of 30 clusters from each district, from which 7 households were randomly
selected. A total of 2,483 caregivers responded to administered questionnaires and 632
individuals were sampled and included in the focus group discussions while a total of 120
key stakeholders were interviewed as key informants.

6.3. Key findings – in general. In general the project was very well received and
beneficiaries reported satisfaction and gratitude for the services provided directly in their
community. The intervention with the highest perceived benefit was the distribution of
LLINs while deworming was seen as being the least beneficial service delivered. The
overall conclusion of the survey was that the project should be scaled up to cover all
districts and regions in Ghana and sustained over a long period to help significantly
improve the nutritional & malaria situation.

6.4. Key findings – behaviors. The survey reported that 73.6% of women had attended
4+ antenatal visits during their last pregnancy and 73% of the child growth cards
examined were reported as “being up to date” indicating a good utilization of services
provided. Further 62.3% of mothers and 60.8% of children were reported as having slept
under a bednet the previous night, while 77% of all households visited were reported as
to having bednets hangings based on observations.

6.5 Key findings – barriers. The following barriers were reported as contributing to a
reduced access and utilization of services: (i) high attrition rate, illiteracy and lack of
motivation by volunteers; (ii) financial constraints by families to provide the more
nutrient dense foods to the pregnant women and children; (iii) issues of stock-outs
resulting in insufficient supply of LLINs and vitamin A capsules; (iv) limited coverage,
in that not all communities were implementing the project, access issues related to poor
roads and long distances to health facilities; (v) project vehicles not always available as
being utilized for other operational activities; and lastly (vi) impact of cultural and
traditional practices e.g. in a district in Upper East region it was reported that pregnant
women should hide their pregnancy while mothers with children under two years of age
should not be brought out in public.

6.6 Lessons learned. The following was mentioned as lessons learned: (i) project
benefitted the selected communities; (ii) importance of using implementation strategies
which are responsive to varying to socio-economic contexts; and (iii) strong influence of
traditional authorities and male household heads especially in the three northern regions.
