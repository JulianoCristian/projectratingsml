                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve utilization of selected community-based health and nutrition services for children under the age of two and
                         pregnant women in the selected districts.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The delays encountered during the first two years of the project have now been fully overcome and project scale up has reached its intended targets resulting in improved
                         performance of project development indicators. The project now reaches a total of 77 Districts in the six target Regions, trained more than 2,000 health staff and close to 10,000
                         volunteer growth promoters. Approximately 2,500 communities are implementing growth promotion strategies. All the four PDO indicators have already attained or surpassed their
                         end-of-project targets for four of the six project beneficiary regions. More than 600,000 children under the age of 2 are benefiting from the project.

                         Component 1 on institutional strengthening for coordination, implementation and outcomes: the project has completed the development of; (i) the National Nutrition Policy (NNP); and
                         (ii) the Nutrition Advocacy Strategy; while (iii) the post-National Immunization Days (NID) Strategy for vitamin A supplementation (VAS) is at an advanced stage. In terms of the
                         intermediate indicators, two of the four indicators on supervision and the development of a National Nutrition Policy (NNP) have met the end-of-project target and the third indicator on
                         the number of health staff trained is on track to meeting the target.

                         Component 2 on Community-Based Health and Nutrition Service Delivery is seeing considerable progress: this Component is at the heart of the project and the Ghana Health
                         Service (GHS) has worked hard to strengthen its performance. The various steps of introducing community growth promotion in the Districts through orientation workshops, training of
                         health workers, planning and budgeting of activities, training of volunteer growth promoters, and baseline surveys, have been institutionalized and program roll-out has been taking
                         place smoothly. Overall, this project Component is well on track to attain the majority of targets of the intermediate outcome indicators with two of the three intermediate indicators
                         having met or surpassed the end-of-project target while the third is yet close to being achieved.

                         Progress on Component 3 on Malaria Prevention has been steady such that the intermediate indicators will meet their targets. The first indicator on the proportion of households with
                         at least one long-lasting net has already attained its target, while the second indicator on the number of bed nets purchased and distributed will be met by November 30, 2012 when
                         the delivery of four hundred and fifty thousand malaria bed nets would be completed.

                         Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) is being institutionalized from the community level up to central level, and the quality of information has improved. Timely communication of
                         monitoring reports still remains a challenge which is not just limited to the community nutrition program. In response to this challenge, the Ghana Health Service (GHS) is setting up a
                         consolidated electronic District Health Information System, which ultimately can make original data accessible to all stakeholders in the health sector. The system is under
                         development and incorporating the M&E systems of the various programs.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         (i) In order to improve the functioning of the oversight committees at the district and community levels, the Regional Health and District Health Management Teams will carry out
                         massive sensitization programs for the district chief executive officers and community leaders about the importance of the program and their participation in it.

                         (ii) With support from the World Bank, the project implementation team will develop participatory mechanisms to strengthen collaboration among key actors at the district and
                         community levels, and improve community participation in M&E processes. The participatory monitoring process will also aim to enhance accountability and responsibility of key
                         players in the delivery of the project activities at the community level.

                         (iii) The computerized monitoring and evaluation system was rolled out to all project districts by November 30, 2012.
