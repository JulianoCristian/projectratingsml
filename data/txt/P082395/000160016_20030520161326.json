took\n            office January 15, 2003, is undertaking a new program to\n            establish macroeconomic stability and the conditions for the\n            resumption of growth and the reduction of poverty, following\n            one of the worst economic crisis in recent history. Both the\n            World Bank and IMF are providing financial assistance to\n            this effort. Concurrently, the Government has committed\n            itself to protect and enhance social sector spending and\n            program efficiency in the immediate term, and initiate\n            reforms in key social sectors -health, social protection,\n            and education- to provide a regulatory and institutional\n            platform for medium and longer-term structural improvements\n            in those areas. This project would be the first phase of the\n            Bank's support to achieving these goals. The HDRL, like\n            the overall program would focus on three critical aspects of\n            social service reforms: (i) protecting and enhancing\n            Ecuador's public sector investment in social sectors by\n            supporting rationalized institutional budgets and financing\n            for key social programs; (ii) increasing the efficiency and\n            effectiveness of social programs through refocusing program\n            objectives, improving targeting of social services, raising\n            consistency in their administration, and promoting resource\n            sharing among institutions; and (iii) enhancing the public\n            consultations, transparency and accountability in the\n            implementation of social programs."}, "docdt": "2003-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
