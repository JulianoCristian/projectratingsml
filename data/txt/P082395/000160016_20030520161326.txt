Obiectives 
and 
Description: 
The 
Government 
of 
Ecuador, 
which took office 
January 
15, 
2003, 
is 
undertaking 
a 
new 
program 
to 
establish macroeconomic 
stability 
and 
the 
conditions 
for 
the 
resumption 
of 
growth 
and 
the 
reduction 
of 
poverty, 
following 
one 
of 
the 
worst 
economic 
crisis 
in 
recent 
history. 
Both 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
IMF 
are 
providing 
financial 
assistance 
to 
this 
effort. 
Concurrently, 
the 
Government 
has 
committed 
itself 
to 
protect 
and 
enhance 
social 
sector 
spending 
and 
program efficiency 
in 
the immediate 
term, 
and 
initiate 
reforms 
in 
key 
social 
sectors 
-health, 
social protection, 
and 
education- 
to 
provide 
a 
regulatory 
and 
institutional 
platform for 
medium 
and 
longer-term structural 
improvements 
in 
those 
areas. 
The 
HDRL 
would 
be 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
support 
to 
achieving 
these 
goals. 
The 
HDRL, 
like 
the 
overall 
program 
would 
focus 
on 
three 
critical 
aspects 
of 
social 
service 
reforms: 
(i) 
protecting 
and 
enhancing 
Ecuador’s 
public 
sector 
investment 
in 
social 
sectors 
by 
supporting rationalized 
institutional 
budgets 
and 
financing 
for 
key 
social 
programs; 
(ii) 
increasing 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
social 
programs 
through 
refocusing 
program 
objectives, 
improving 
targeting 
of 
social 
services, 
raising 
consistency 
in 
their 
administration, 
and 
promoting 
resource 
sharing among 
institutions; 
and 
(iii) 
enhancing 
the 
public 
consultations, transparency 
and 
accountability 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
social programs. 
i 
Page  6
Benefits 
and 
Risks: 
The 
HDRL 
would 
have an 
immediate benefit 
for 
several 
of 
the 
groups whose 
well 
being 
would 
be 
most affected 
by 
reductions 
in 
social 
sector spending, 
namely: 
mothers 
and children; 
school- 
aged 
children; 
the 
elderly 
and the 
poor. 
With 
the 
loan, programs 
to 
provide 
health 
care 
services 
to 
over 
750,000 
mothers, 
nutrition 
supplements 
for 
about 
76 
percent 
of 
primary 
school children, and 
income 
security 
for 
about 
4.5 
million 
poor 
and 
elderly 
would 
be 
preserved. 
Indigenous 
peoples 
are 
heavily 
represented 
in 
these 
groups. 
In 
the 
medium 
term, 
further 
measures 
would 
be 
taken 
to 
assure 
the 
financial 
sustainability 
of 
such 
social 
safety-net 
programs, 
through 
removing duplication 
in 
complementary 
programs; 
improved 
targeting 
to 
reallocate 
budgets 
for 
pensions 
and 
income 
support; 
and 
to 
improve 
the 
coverage 
and 
quality 
of 
social 
insurance programs. 
These 
latter reforms should 
have the 
effect 
of 
controlling 
the treasury 
cost 
of 
the 
social 
safety net. 
An 
additional 
broader and 
less 
measurable 
social 
benefit 
will 
come 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the increased 
credibility 
of 
social 
sector 
management 
that 
would 
accrue 
from 
the 
transparency 
of 
the 
management 
process 
and 
the 
empowerment 
of 
beneficiaries and 
stakeholders 
to 
participate 
in 
program 
evaluation 
and 
in 
shaping 
the 
future 
of 
these 
programs. 
Achieving 
these 
benefits 
will, 
however, 
face 
risks. 
The 
social 
programs that 
have 
evolved 
over time, 
including 
a 
recently 
instituted 
but 
poorly 
targeted cash 
transfer 
program 
(Bono 
Solidario) 
have 
developed strong 
and 
potentially vocal 
constituencies. 
Other 
stakeholders 
including 
teachers, 
program 
administrators, 
and 
segments 
of 
the business 
community 
may 
have vested interests 
in 
maintaining 
the 
status 
quo 
with 
respect 
to 
legal 
protections 
of 
employment 
status, 
program survival 
and 
business interests. Such factors 
would 
create an 
environment 
in 
which 
building 
and 
maintaining 
commitment 
to 
and ownership 
of 
reform 
will 
be 
difficult. 
In 
addition, the 
variety 
and 
scope 
of 
the elements 
of 
the 
reform 
program 
present 
technical 
and 
managerial 
challenges, 
beyond 
those 
hitherto 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Technical 
Secretariat 
for 
Social Development 
or 
Secretaria 
Tkcnica del Frente Social 
(the 
implementing 
agency). 
Therefore, 
maintaining 
a sound basis 
for 
debate 
and 
decision- 
making 
and 
timeliness 
in 
implementing 
the 
sequence 
of 
reforms 
may tax 
the capacity 
of 
the Secretariat. 
Finally, 
the Ecuadorian 
economy 
itself 
continues 
to 
be 
open 
to 
shocks 
owing 
to 
its 
dependence 
on 
oil 
revenue, 
its 
open 
trade 
position 
as 
a 
dollarized 
economy, 
and 
its 
debt. 
Dramatic 
changes 
in 
these 
factors 
could 
compromise 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
Government 
to 
address 
social 
sector 
reforms 
in 
a measured 
and 
rational 
manner, 
owing to 
distractions, perceived 
costs 
and 
rising 
social 
tensions. 
GOE 
will 
mitigate 
these 
risks 
through 
a 
number 
of 
measures. 
First, 
it 
will 
maintain 
a 
continuous 
process 
of 
dialogue 
and 
public 
participation 
in 
key fora 
in 
which 
the Government, 
civil 
society, 
and 
the professions 
can 
exchange 
information 
and 
reach

Disbursements: 
Poverty 
Category:

Number: 
Map: 
consensus 
on 
competing 
agendas. 
A 
program 
of 
studies 
and 
analyses 
to 
permit 
dialogue 
to 
take 
place 
on 
a 
technically 
objective 
basis 
would 
support 
this 
process.  These 
efforts 
would 
be 
complemented 
by 
the 
Bank’s 
own 
dialogue 
with 
representatives 
of 
the 
civil 
society. 
Second, 
the 
Technical 
Secretariat 
for 
Social 
Development 
(STFS) 
would 
be 
provided 
with 
resources 
for 
research and 
programming activities 
to 
strengthen 
its 
capacity 
to 
monitor, 
evaluate 
and 
manage the 
various 
actions 
comprising 
the program. 
Lastly, 
to 
mitigate 
economic and 
financial 
risks, 
the 
Government 
is 
participating 
in 
an 
IMF 
program 
and 
is 
undertaking 
a 
companion Bank-financed 
fiscal 
adjustment program, 
through 
which 
it 
will 
be 
strengthening 
its 
capacity 
to 
respond 
to 
shocks 
by 
replenishing 
the 
oil 
stabilization 
fund, 
increasing 
the 
share 
of 
non-oil 
fiscal 
revenues, 
diversifying 
non-oil 
exports, passing 
laws 
to 
increase 
labor 
market 
flexibility 
and 
encouraging 
private participation 
in 
key 
investment 
sectors. 
In 
addition, 
to 
help 
mitigate 
its 
debt- 
overburden 
risk, 
the 
Bank 
is 
assisting 
Ecuador 
in 
resuming 
bilateral 
debt 
rescheduling 
agreements 
with 
the Paris 
Club 
and 
preparing 
a comprehensive 
debt-reduction 
strategy. 
US$50 
million 
immediately after 
loan 
effectiveness, 
planned 
for 
July 
2003. 
The 
second 
operation 
is 
expected 
in 
May 
2004, 
and 
the 
third 
operation 
is 
expected 
in 
May 
2005. 
The 
Bank would 
provide 
a 
total 
of 
US$250 
million 
financing 
for 
the 
three 
phases 
of 
the 
Human 
Development 
Reform 
Program. 
The 
proposed 
loan 
is 
directly 
focused 
on 
budget 
protection 
for 
priority 
social 
sectors 
and 
on 
improved 
targeting.

The

an “austerity 
decree” 
and 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
IMF 
to 
improve 
the 
fiscal 
and external 
balance 
has 
prompted 
the Government 
of 
Ecuador 
to 
request 
assistance 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
to: 
This 
Memorandum 
describes 
the 
first 
of 
a three

new 
government

Help 
mitigate 
the 
adverse 
shock 
of 
some 
of 
those 
austerity 
measures 
by 
providing 
budget 
support; 
and 
b. 
Help 
in 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
number 
of 
structural 
reforms 
in 
the 
social 
sectors that 
will 
occur 
concomitantly 
with 
structural 
changes 
in 
other 
areas 
like 
tax 
reform, custom 
reform, and 
civil 
service 
reform. 
3. 
The 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
program 
will 
be 
built 
around 
the 
protection 
of 
key 
social 
expenditures and 
the 
implementation 
of 
initial 
changes 
in 
some 
key 
social 
assistance 
programs, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
administration 
of 
Ecuador’s 
health 
care system 
for 
rural 
workers, 
to 
increase 
the 
level 
of 
protection 
of 
vulnerable 
groups. 
It 
will 
also 
assist 
in 
the 
design 
of 
structural 
reforms 
in 
selected 
programs 
in 
the 
social 
sectors. 
The 
second 
and 
third 
phases 
have 
a 
medium term 
horizon, 
and 
will 
prepare the 
ground 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
further 
structural 
reforms 
that 
will 
result 
in 
more 
efficient 
and equitable 
provision 
of 
basic 
social 
services. 
In 
that 
sense, 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
program 
stresses 
the need 
for 
immediate protection 
of 
vulnerable 
groups 
and 
starts 
the 
slow introduction 
of 
changes 
in 
the social 
sectors, 
first 
in 
the 
areas 
and 
programs where 
outcomes can 
be immediately 
influenced, 
and 
then setting 
the 
stage 
for 
changes 
in 
other 
areas 
and 
programs. 
4. 
program. 
Many 
of 
the 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed are 
complex 
and 
long 
term 
in 
nature, 
and 
as 
such, 
the three 
phases 
described 
in 
this 
document 
will 
only provide 
medium term 
interventions 
that 
set 
the 
ground 
for 
longer-term 
changes 
that 
will 
occur 
in 
the 
future, 
with 
support 
from 
additional 
operations. 
The 
Program 
has 
three 
main 
objectives: 
(i) 
to 
protect 
public 
spending 
in 
the 
social 
sectors 
in 
general 
and 
in 
specific 
priority 
social 
programs; 
(ii) 
to improve 
the 
efficiency 
and 
efficacy 
of 
basic 
social 
services, 
improving 
access 
and 
coverage 
and 
achieving 
a 
better 
targeting 
towards the poor; 
and 
(iii) 
to 
increase transparency, 
improve 
governance 
and 
accountability 
in 
the 
social 
sectors. 
It 
is 
likely 
that 
the 
reform 
process 
will 
extend 
well beyond 
the 
life 
of 
the present

THE 
POLITICAL 
AND 
ECONOMIC 
SETTING’ 
5. 
Ecuador 
is 
recovering 
from 
the 
worst 
economic crisis 
in 
recent history. 
The 
economic 
crisis 
of 
the 
late 
1990s was 
the 
worst 
in 
Ecuador’s recent 
history, and resulted 
in 
an 
increase 
in 
poverty 
levels, 
higher 
levels 
of 
unemployment 
and 
inflation, 
and 
a 
drop 
in 
GDP 
that 
has 
been 
estimated 
at 
between 
5 
and 
13 
percent 
by 
different 
sources. 
The incidence 
of 
poverty 
in 
only four 
years 
(1995 
to 
1999) 
increased 
from 
34 
to 
56 
percent 
of 
the 
population. 
Both 
unemployment 
and 
inflation 
rates 
went 
up 
significantly 
during 
the 
crisis, and 
with 
it 
the number 
of 
families requiring 
social 
assistance. 
6. 
Benefiting 
from 
a 
positive external environment 
characterized 
by 
high 
petroleum 
prices, 
low 
international 
interest 
rates, 
and 
significant 
flows 
of 
family 
remittances, 
GDP 
grew 
5.1 
percent 
in 
2001 
and 
an 
estimated 
3.0 
percent 
in 
2002. 
Average 
annual 
inflation 
fell 
to 
38 percent 
in 
2001, 
and 
reached single 
digits 
by 
late 
2002. 
The 
recovery 
is 
explained 
by 
the 
increase 
in 
domestic 
demand 
(particularly 
private 
demand), 
stimulated 
in 
turn 
by 
high 
petroleum 
prices, 
growing 
remittances, the increase 
in 
nominal 
minimum 
and 
average 
salaries 
in 
dollars, 
which 
practically 
doubled 
between 
April 
2000 
and 
October 
2000; 
and 
a gradual 
reactivation 
of 
private 
credit, 
consistent 
with 
recovery 
of 
the 
banking 
system. 
Construction 
of 
the 
new 
pipeline 
for 
heavy 
crude 
oil 
has also attracted 
significant 
inflows 
of 
foreign 
investment. 
For 
its 
part, 
the 
initial 
inflationary 
impulse, 
followed 
by 
a slow deceleration 
of 
inflation, 
fits 
into 
the 
pattern 
observed 
in 
most 
dollarized 
economies: 
in 
the 
medium 
term, the domestic 
inflation 
rate 
tends 
to 
be 
determined 
by 
international inflation, 
but 
in 
the short-term, lags 
occur 
in 
relative 
price 
adjustment 
due 
to 
the 
control 
of 
certain 
managed 
prices 
belonging 
to 
the 
basic 
basket, 
and 
to 
the 
post 
crisis reactivation 
of 
domestic 
demand. 
7. 
The 
main 
challenge 
for 
Ecuador 
in 
the 
short 
term 
is 
to 
implement 
a 
fiscal 
adjustment 
to 
generate 
fiscal 
surpluses 
and 
a 
sustainable 
external 
debt 
level, 
without 
neglecting the 
social sectors. 
At 
present the 
fiscal position 
in 
Ecuador 
is 
frail, 
as 
the 
primary 
surplus 
has 
been decreasing since 
the year 
2000, 
the 
public 
external 
debt 
is 
the second 
highest 
in 
Latin 
America 
-about 
60 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
and 
expenditures 
are 
extremely 
rigid. 
Much of 
Ecuador’s 
revenue 
is 
tied 
to 
the 
international 
price 
of 
oil 
and 
while 
this 
has 
risen dramatically, 
it 
has 
not 
produced 
sufficient 
revenue 
to 
cover 
domestic 
and 
international 
obligations, 
leaving 
relatively 
few 
resources 
for 
social programs 
needed 
to 
provide 
services 
to 
a 
growing 
number 
of 
the 
poor. 
The 
primary 
surpluses 
of 
the 
Non-Financial Public 
Sector (NFPS) 
have 
decreased 
from 
7.7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2000, 
to 
4.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002. 
Primary 
surpluses 
have been almost 
exclusively 
the 
result 
of 
an increase 
in 
both 
petroleum 
and 
tax 
revenues, 
which 
have 
fluctuated 
irregularly 
between 
2 
and 
nearly 5 percent 
of 
GDP. 
Spending 
on 
salaries 
and 
on 
goods 
and 
services 
has 
almost 
doubled 
compared 
to 
pre-dollarization 
levels-from 
about 
US$ 
1 
billion 
and 
US$0.5 
billion, 
respectively, 
in 
1999, 
to 
about 
US$2 
billion 
and US$0.9 
billion, 
respectively, 
in 
2002-and 
capital 
spending 
remained 
high 
at 
6.4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002. 
8. 
In 
2003, 
Ecuador 
has 
total net financial 
requirements 
of 
about 
US$2 billion, which 
after 
including 
already scheduled 
financing, 
leaves 
a 
gap 
in 
financing 
of 
US$0.7. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
the 
social 
sectors 
need 
to 
be prioritized, 
as 
public 
spending 
is 
still 
below 
Ecuador’s 
historical 
levels 
-particularly 
in 
education 
and 
health. 
This 
section 
borrows 
heavily 
from 
the 
companion 
Fiscal Consolidation 
and 
Competitive Growth 
Adjustment Loan, 
being 
prepared 
simultaneously 
with 
this 
operation.

9. 
term 
measures. 
The government 
of 
President 
GutiCrrez 
which 
took 
office on 
January 
15 
announced, 
after 
only 
three 
days, 
a 
plan 
of 
“Economic 
Ordering 
and 
Human 
Development”. 
The 
goal 
of 
that 
plan 
is 
to 
reduce 
poverty, 
increase 
fiscal 
revenues, 
achieve a sustainable 
debt 
management 
system, 
and 
implement 
a 
number 
of 
reforms 
in 
the 
social 
sectors 
as 
well 
as 
the 
tax 
and social 
security 
systems. 
Among 
the austerity 
measures 
announced 
were the 
following: 
The 
new 
Government 
has 
an 
ambitious 
reform 
agenda 
that 
extends 
beyond 
short- 
a. 
Freezing 
of

rates 
for 
regular 
civil 
servants

b. 
Cutting 
of 
overtime 
allowances; 
c. 
Reducing 
the 
president’s salary 
by 
20 
percent; 
d. 
Reducing 
by 
10 
percent the salaries 
of 
government 
appointees 
with 
monthly 
earnings

e. 
Reducing 
by 
10 
percent the 
number 
of

in 
the

including 
on

the 
use 
of

and 
cell

and a 
prohibiting 
the purchase 
of

and 
furnishings; 
Selling public

assets 
not 
in

and 
Gradually reducing 
the 
number 
of 
public 
sector 
officials, 
until 
reaching 
an 
optimal 
labor 
force 
size 
The 
Government 
has 
also 
signed 
a 
Stand-By 
agreement 
with 
the 
IMF. 
In 
it, 
the 
Government 
agreed 
to 
adopt 
measures 
aimed 
at: 
(i) 
resolving immediate 
liquidity 
pressures 
and 
regularizing 
arrears 
left 
by 
the 
previous 
administration; 
(ii) 
tightening 
the 
fiscal 
stance 
to 
recover 
from 
the 
slippages 
of 
2001 
and 
2002; 
(iii) 
protecting 
the 
poor 
by 
stabilizing their income 
levels 
and strengthening 
social 
programs; 
and (iv) 
improving 
the 
flexibility 
of 
fiscal 
policy 
and 
prioritizing 
expenditures. 
Some 
of 
the 
measures 
contained 
in 
the 
Government’s 
IMF 
supported 
Program 
have 
already been 
implemented through 
the 
austerity decree described 
above. 
Other 
measures 
include: 
an increase 
in 
spending 
on 
social 
assistance, 
efforts 
to 
strengthen the 
social 
security system (actuarial 
studies), 
and 
an 
improvement 
in 
the 
targeting 
of 
the 
gas 
subsidy.

1. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
a 
number 
of 
structural reforms have 
been 
announced. 
The 
Government 
is 
preparing 
to 
send 
to 
Congress 
a number 
of 
draft 
laws 
covering 
a 
unification 
of 
the 
civil 
service 
salary 
scale, 
customs 
reform, 
tax reform, 
elimination 
of 
the 
distribution 
of 
utilities 
services 
from 
public 
sector companies 
to 
their workers and 
the 
introduction 
of 
other 
measures 
tending 
to 
increase 
revenues; 
social security 
reform 
and 
health 
care 
reform. 
12. 
in 
the short term. 
Early 
this 
year, 
the Government 
increased 
the 
price 
of 
gasoline 
of 
between 
3 
percent 
and 
24 
percent, 
which 
resulted 
in 
a 
higher 
inflation 
rate and reduced 
the 
purchasing 
power 
of 
the population, 
particularly 
the poor. 
The 
Government’s macroeconomic 
program 
supported 
by 
the 
IMF 
also contemplates 
to 
reducing 
the 
level 
and 
tightening 
the 
eligibility 
of 
the 
gas 
subsidy, 
some 
of 
which 
is 
now 
targeted 
to 
the 
poor 
-in 
a 
very imperfect 
way.* 
Some 
of 
these 
measures 
will 
impact 
on 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
groups 
in 
the population

Public 
spending 
in 
the 
social 
sectors 
has 
decreased 
sharply, 
especially 
in 
health 
and 
education. 
In 
2001, 
spending 
in 
education 
was 
about 
2.8 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
while public 
spending 
in 
health 
was 
below 
2 percent. 
In 
spite 
of 
a 
partial 
reversal 
in 
the year 
2000 
of 
a decreasing 
trend 
that 
started 
in 
the 
1990s’ 
these 
levels 
are 
low, not only 
for 
international 
standards 
-Bolivia 
for 
example, 
spent 
3.6 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
health and 
7.1 percent 
in 
education 
in 
2001- 
but 
are 
below 
Ecuador’s 
historical 
averages 
as 
well.  Education 
expenditure 
has 
been 
continuously 
dropping 
since 
the 
198Os, 
when 
it 
stood at 
around 
6 
percent 
of 
GDP.3 
15. 
Besides 
the 
low 
levels 
of 
public 
spending, 
the 
main 
problems affecting 
the 
social 
sectors 
have to 
do 
with 
an 
inequitable 
distribution 
of 
resources, 
inefficient provision 
of 
basic 
services, 
and 
insufficient 
coverage: 
a. 
b. 
Access 
to 
basic 
health 
care 
services 
is 
limited for 
a 
significant percentage 
of 
the 
population. 
Only 
about 
25 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
is 
covered 
by 
some 
kind 
of 
public 
health 
insurance, and about 
30 
percent 
has 
no 
access 
to 
basic 
health 
care services; 
Public 
spending 
in 
health 
is 
the 
second 
lowest 
in 
Latin 
America, 
after 
Haiti. 
The 
system 
is 
highly 
fragmented, 
with 
both 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
the 
Social 
Security 
Administration 
JESS 
administering 
public 
health 
care 
provision 
in 
their 
own 
facilities, 
leading 
to 
inequities 
in 
treatment 
and 
care; 
A 
more 
detailed 
analysis 
of 
the trends 
in 
public 
spending 
in 
the 
social 
sectors can 
be 
found 
in 
Annexes 
7 
to 
9, 
which 
summarize 
the 
recently 
written Policy 
Notes 
in 
Education, 
Health 
and 
Social 
Assistance.

Approximately 
10.5 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
aged 
15 
or 
older 
is 
illiterate. 
Even 
though 
primary 
school 
enrolment 
is 
close 
to 
90 
percent, 
net enrolment 
rates 
for 
secondary 
school, at 
5 
1 
percent, 
are 
too 
low 
for 
Ecuador’s development 
level; 
There are 
severe 
inequities 
in 
education 
spending 
by 
income group. 
This 
is 
mirrored 
in 
discrepancies between 
rural 
and urban 
areas, 
as 
well 
as 
between indigenous and 
non 
indigenous populations; 
Governance problems 
in 
the 
educational 
system 
like 
the 
high 
turnover 
rates 
in 
authorities, the 
highly 
centralized 
administration 
systems, 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
coordination 
among 
the 
different 
units 
within 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
all 
contribute to 
low 
levels 
of 
monitoring 
of 
activities 
and 
poor 
incentive 
schemes 
for 
teachers; 
The 
social 
assistance 
system 
suffers 
from 
high 
fragmentation. 
There 
are 
over 
20 
‘priority 
programs’ 
in 
the 
system, 
and 
more 
often 
than 
not 
their 
objectives and 
target 
populations 
are 
not 
well 
defined, 
so 
that there 
is 
high 
potential 
for 
duplication 
and 
overlap. 
Moreover, different 
programs are 
administered 
by 
separate 
units 
and 
even 
different 
Ministries, 
inflating 
the 
share 
of 
the budget 
that 
goes 
to 
pay 
for 
administrative 
costs; 
The 
Bono 
Solidario 
program 
-which 
concentrates 
more 
than 
half 
the 
total 
social 
assistance 
budget- 
lacks 
clarity 
on 
its 
objective, 
on 
the way the benefit 
is 
determined, 
and 
on how 
the 
target 
population 
is 
chosen. 
It 
has 
no 
mechanism 
to 
update 
the 
beneficiary 
pool 
over 
time 
and 
its 
impact 
has 
never 
been 
satisfactorily 
evaluated; 
Most 
social 
assistance 
programs are 
ineffective 
due 
to both 
their internal 
designs 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
appropriate targeting 
instruments. 
This 
in 
turn 
translates 
into poor 
coverage 
of 
those 
most 
in 
need, 
and 
into 
important 
leakages 
of 
resources 
to 
groups 
with 
higher 
income; 
The 
formal 
social 
security 
sector has 
very 
low 
effective 
coverage. 
With 
only 
26 
percent 
of 
the Economic 
Active 
Population 
covered 
by 
formal 
social 
security, 
and 
with 
extremely 
low 
pensions 
paid 
to 
retirees, the 
effective 
coverage 
is 
among 
the 
lowest 
in 
Latin 
America. 
Even 
though 
the social 
security system 
is 
currently experiencing 
a 
surplus 
-partly 
through 
the 
low 
benefits 
being 
paid 
and 
partly 
through yearly 
transfers 
from 
the 
Government- 
it 
is 
still 
in 
need 
of 
reform, 
from 
a 
legal 
and 
accounting 
standpoint  and 
more importantly, 
from 
the perspective 
of 
its 
operational rationale; 
and 
There 
is 
no 
coordination 
among the 
income protection 
schemes 
for 
the 
elderly. 
This 
applies 
to 
the 
formal 
social security 
system, 
the social 
assistance 
provided 
through 
the 
Bono 
Solidario, 
and 
the 
non-contributory 
insurance 
scheme 
for 
independent 
rural 
workers, 
called 
Seguro 
Social 
Campesino. 
B. 
LONG 
TERM 
VISION 
OF 
HUMAN 
DEVELOPMENT 
IN 
ECUADOR 
16. 
Ecuador’s 
long-term 
vision 
for 
the 
social 
sectors 
is 
that 
they 
provide 
adequate 
protection 
to 
vulnerable 
groups, 
operate 
efficiently 
to 
offer wide 
access 
to 
basic social 
services, 
and 
achieve 
spending 
levels 
necessary 
for 
quality 
provision, 
according 
to 
Ecuador’s income 
and 
development 
levels. 
Improving 
health 
and 
education 
outcomes 
will 
crucially 
depend 
on 
the adoption 
of 
a strategy 
that incorporates 
those 
objectives. 
Higher 
levels 
of 
spending 
in 
health and 
education, 
changes 
to 
the 
financing 
structure 
of 
health 
care 
and 
the 
6 
Page  15
allocation 
of 
resources 
in 
education, and a 
radical 
reform 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
basic 
social 
services 
are necessary 
to 
reach 
a 
larger 
percentage 
of 
the 
population, especially 
the poor. 
These 
guiding 
principles 
also 
apply 
to 
the 
social 
safety 
net, 
indispensable 
as 
a 
means 
to 
protect 
the 
vulnerable 
groups, 
and 
to 
the economic 
protection 
for 
the 
elderly. 
17. 
In 
the 
health 
sector, 
the Government’s 
long 
term 
goal 
is 
to 
guarantee the 
population 
access 
to 
a 
basic 
package 
of 
essential 
services 
that 
is 
financially 
sustainable, 
offered through 
networks 
of 
public 
and 
private 
providers. 
The “universal” 
coverage 
will 
be 
achieved 
in 
stages, 
through 
the gradual transformation 
of 
existing institutions 
that 
currently 
provide or 
finance 
basic 
health 
care 
to 
some segments 
of 
the 
poor 
population. 
As 
a 
first 
step, 
formal 
agreements 
will 
be 
signed 
between 
some 
health 
care 
providers 
that 
currently 
target 
the 
poor 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health, 
so 
that the 
population 
with 
no 
current 
access 
to 
health 
care can 
receive 
services there 
- 
financed 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health.  Next, 
a 
comprehensive cost-effective 
basic 
health 
care 
package 
will 
be 
defined 
that can be 
provided 
universally,  and 
agreements 
will 
be 
signed 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
this 
basic package 
to 
those 
without 
protection. 
Over 
time, 
an increase 
in 
coverage 
of 
the 
vulnerable 
population 
will 
come 
from 
the 
contracting 
of 
networks 
of 
providers 
with 
access 
to 
this 
population. 
Eventually 
the 
financing 
of 
health 
care 
will 
be 
separated 
from 
the 
provision, 
first 
in 
the 
formal 
health 
insurance 
institution 
and 
later 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
so 
that 
the purchaser can 
pay 
for 
the basic package 
to 
be 
provided 
by 
any 
health 
care 
facility. 
Increases 
in 
coverage 
will 
depend 
upon 
availability 
of 
fiscal 
resources 
and 
service 
capacity. 
18. 
productive 
and 
adaptable 
labor 
force, 
Ecuador 
needs 
to 
invest 
heavily 
on 
its 
education 
system 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
access, 
coverage, 
and 
quality. 
These goals can 
only 
be 
achieved 
through 
a 
set 
of 
institutional 
and 
functional reforms 
that 
address 
the problems and 
inequalities 
that 
exist 
today 
and 
propose 
solutions 
that 
are 
viable 
and 
compatible 
with 
the process 
of 
decentralization.  Ecuador 
needs 
to 
align 
the 
incentives 
of 
those 
involved 
in 
the 
provision 
and 
acquisition 
of 
education 
with 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
country. 
Regularity 
in 
teachers 
pay 
and 
proper 
incentives 
to 
attract 
qualified 
teachers 
to rural 
areas 
are a 
priority, 
as 
is 
better 
quality 
of 
education 
for 
children 
and adults that 
makes 
school 
enrollment 
and 
attendance 
worthwhile. 
These 
changes 
will 
require 
substantial 
work to 
strengthen the 
operational 
and 
institutional 
capacity 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education and 
other 
education authorities, 
as 
well 
as 
increased 
investments 
in 
the 
hardware 
and 
software 
of 
the system 
19. 
The 
main 
challenge 
in 
social 
assistance 
is 
to 
provide 
protection 
to 
the 
most 
vulnerable without 
increasing the 
strain 
on 
fiscal 
resources. 
More 
than 
half 
the 
population 
of 
Ecuador 
is 
poor, 
and 
about 
half 
of 
those 
live 
in 
extreme 
poverty. 
These 
figures 
pose tremendous 
challenges 
for 
a 
social 
assistance 
system that 
has 
limited 
resources 
and 
almost 
no 
capacity 
to 
respond 
to 
temporary 
increases 
in 
poverty 
and 
vulnerability 
due 
to 
economic 
crises 
or 
natural 
disasters. 
Ultimately, 
Ecuador 
aims at 
having 
a 
flexible 
social 
safety 
net 
system, 
able 
to 
provide 
assistance 
to 
the 
poor 
with 
minimum 
leakage, 
channeled 
through 
a 
few 
efficient 
and 
well 
organized programs 
with 
clear 
goals,

their 
capacity 
to reach 
the needy, 
and, 
most 
importantly, their impact 
on 
poverty 
and 
other 
outcomes 
of 
interest. 
Reforms 
in 
the 
next 
few 
years 
should 
then be 
directed 
to 
rationalize 
the 
social protection 
system 
while 
minimizing 
the 
potential 
negative 
social impact 
of 
the 
transition 
from 
one social 
assistance 
model 
to 
another. 
This 
will 
entail

communication 
campaigns 
and 
social 
ownership 
of 
the 
proposed 
reforms 
based 
on 
principles 
of

in 
the 
long 
term, an 
integrated 
system, 
with 
high 
coverage, 
efficient 
performance, and 
low 
fiscal 
cost. 
These 
goals 
should 
be achieved 
by 
designing 
a strategy 
that 
considers the 
different institutions 
that 
currently 
provide 
income

(IESS, 
ISSFA, 
ISSPOL, 
Bono 
Solidurio) 
as 
part 
of 
a 
single

Labor

reforms 
to 
promote 
formalization 
and 
compliance 
must 
be 
promoted, and 
an 
efficient, 
well-targeted 
non 
contributory 
system 
has 
to 
be designed 
and 
implemented 
for 
those 
who 
are 
structurally excluded 
from 
the 
formal 
labor 
market.

Institutional 
and

system, 
easing the 
fiscal 
pressures 
and 
incorporating 
defined contribution

A 
new legal 
framework 
that 
defines the 
long 
term 
structure 
of

in 
clear 
terms 
and 
generates 
the 
conditions 
for 
the development

IN 
THE 
SOCIAL 
SECTORS 
AND 
IN

The 
overall

to 
assure 
minimum 
levels 
of 
public 
spending 
in 
health, education,

social welfare

Increasing 
Investments 
in 
the 
Social 
Sectors. 
In 
order 
to reflect 
the 
priority 
it 
attaches 
to 
Human 
Development, 
the 
Government 
of 
Ecuador 
has 
committed 
to 
maintaining 
spending 
in 
this 
sector 
in 
the near term, and 
raising 
it 
over 
time. 
The 
decreasing 
trend 
in 
public 
spending 
on 
the social 
sectors 
was 
stopped 
in 
the 
year 
2000, 
and 
even 
though 
the 
fiscal 
situation 
in 
the 
country 
rules 
out 
any 
sharp 
increases 
in 
the 
social 
sectors 
budget 
this 
year, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
at least 
maintain 
the 
level 
of 
spending 
as 
compared 
to 
last 
year. 
As 
the 
country 
engages 
in 
a 
path 
of 
sustainable 
growth 
and implements 
the 
structural reforms described 
in

The 
government 
should 
not 
only 
protect the 
budget 
of 
the 
social 
sectors 
as 
a 
whole, 
but 
of 
some 
key 
priority 
programs 
as 
well. 
There 
are about 
20 
social 
programs 
in 
Ecuador 
considered 
to 
be 
“priorities”, 
but 
some 
are 
more relevant 
than 
others 
in 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
poor 
and 
other vulnerable groups 
-in 
spite 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
serious 
impact evaluation 
for 
most 
of 
them. 
The 
Government and 
the 
Bank 
have agreed 
on 
a 
subset 
of 
these 
programs that 
should 
be 
protected, a 
decision 
that 
was 
based 
on 
the 
overall 
budgets 
for 
each program, 
the 
target 
population, 
and the 
general objectives. 
These

The 
institutional

line 
ministries 
and the 
potential 
for 
technical 
assistance 
was 
essential 
in 
fleshing out 
the strategy 
for 
each 
sector. 
For 
social 
assistance the 
counterpart 
from 
the 
Government 
is 
very strong 
- 
as 
the 
Secretaria Tkcnica 
del 
Frente 
Social 
is 
a 
technical 
group 
dedicated 
to 
providing 
support 
in 
this 
area. 
In 
health, the 
Bank 
has 
established 
a strong 
relationship 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
through 
a number 
of 
investment 
operations, 
and 
the 
scope 
for 
technical 
assistance 
through 
existing 
projects 
is 
high. 
Education, 
on 
the other 
hand, 
has 
a 
weaker 
institutional 
capacity. 
This 
is 
why 
the 
actions 
in 
education 
are 
more 
slowly paced 
than 
the 
ones 
in 
social 
assistance 
and 
health. 
While 
there 
is 
some 
front- 
loading 
in 
the actions 
for 
social 
assistance, 
most 
of 
the significant 
actions 
for 
education 
will 
happen 
during 
the 
last 
phase 
of 
the 
HDFW, 
using 
the 
first 
two 
phases 
to 
build 
consensus 
and

shown 
that 
often 
the 
most effective social 
assistance 
programs 
are those 
which 
use 
conditional 
cash transfers 
to 
induce behavioral 
changes 
among 
the 
program 
beneficiaries. 
For 
instance, 
conditional 
cash 
transfer programs 
like 
PROGRESA, 
in 
Mexico, 
and 
Bolsa Escola, 
in 
Brazil, 
have 
been 
very 
successful at 
increasing school enrolment 
and 
attendance, 
as 
well 
as 
nutritional 
outcomes 
among infants. 
The 
largest 
social 
assistance 
program 
in 
Ecuador, the 
Bono 
Solidario, 
was 
instituted 
in 
1998 
as 
a 
cash subsidy 
to 
poor families affected 
by 
the 
elimination 
of 
the 
energy 
subsidies 
(which 
were later 
re-instated). 
Its 
targeting 
criteria 
were 
not 
systematic, 
but 
rather 
ad- 
hoc: 
families 
were 
“certified” 
in 
local 
churches 
and 
other 
institutions. 
In 
2002, 
more 
than 
1.2 
million 
beneficiaries 
received 
unconditional 
transfers 
from 
the 
program, 
amounting 
to 
US$152.6 
million, 
or 
about 
0.75 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Little 
is 
known, 
however, about 
the 
potential 
impact 
these 
transfers 
may 
have 
had 
on 
outcomes 
of 
interest 
since 
payment 
did 
not 
depend 
on 
the 
beneficiaries 
taking 
any particular 
action. 
For 
this 
reason, 
and 
because 
unconditional 
transfers can 
often 
generate dependency 
among 
beneficiaries, the Government 
is 
going 
to 
create 
a 
new 
program, 
the 
Bono 
de 
Desarrollo 
Humano, 
that 
will 
replace 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
and 
the

will

social 
assistance 
system 
includes 
some 
highly 
regressive 
programs. 
For 
example, subsidies 
for 
electricity, 
gas, 
and gasoline amounted 
to 
US$541 
million 
in 
the year 2000, 
almost 
4 
percent 
of 
the 
GDP, 
of 
which 
households 
received 
63.5 
percent. 
These 
subsidies are 
highly 
regressive, 
as 
they 
are 
correlated 
to 
the 
consumption 
of 
fuel, 
which 
increases 
with 
income. 
It 
is 
estimated that 
the 
total 
subsidy 
per capita 
-on 
electricity, 
gas, 
and 
gasoline- 
is 
five 
times 
greater 
among 
the 
wealthiest 
quintile 
than 
among the 
poorest.  Nonetheless, the 
subsidy 
represents a 
fundamental 
source 
of 
aid for 
the poorest 
of 
the 
poor. 
It 
has 
been 
reported that 
without 
the 
subsidies, 
the 
poorest 
sectors 
would 
see 
their income 
reduced 
by 
7 percent 
annually. 
Some 
social 
assistance 
programs 
are progressive, 
but 
even 
in 
these 
programs a 
high 
percentage 
of 
the 
benefit 
reaches 
the 
wealthiest 
population quintiles. 
For 
example, 
45 
percent 
of 
the 
benefits 
of 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program 
is 
received 
by 
families 
in

instruments. 
To 
that 
end 
the 
HDRP 
will 
support 
the 
use 
of 
two 
targeting 
instruments, a 
proxy 
means 
test 
(SELBEN) 
and 
a geographic 
targeting instrument.  Programs whose benefits 
are 
distributed 
to 
households 
directly 
will 
be 
targeted 
with 
the 
SELBEN 
and 
programs 
whose 
benefits 
are 
distributed according 
to 
geographic 
criteria 
will 
be 
targeted 
with 
the 
Poverty 
Map. 
In 
particular, 
special emphasis 
has 
been 
placed 
on 
the 
targeting 
of 
the 
three largest social 
assistance 
programs 
in 
terms 
of 
budget, the 
new 
Bono 
de 
Desarrollo 
Humano 
(BDH), 
the 
School Feeding 
Program 
(PAE), 
and the 
largest 
early

development program, the 
ORI.

programs. 
It 
had 
an 
approved budget 
for 
2002 
of 
US$25.7 
million, 
and 
provides 
nutritional 
supplements 
to 
school-age 
children. The 
program utilizes 
an 
approximate 
poverty 
map 
determined 
by 
the 
Social Vulnerability Index. 
Yet, 
this 
program 
is 
clearly 
not only 
benefiting 
the 
poorest.  Indeed, 
in 
200 
1, 
supplements 
were granted 
to 
approximately 
1.4 
million 
school-age 
children, 
yet 
in 
1999 Ecuador 
had 
1,629,065 
children enrolled 
in 
elementary schools. 
Furthermore, 
like 
all 
programs 
that 
grant 
in-kind 
transfers 
through 
schools, those 
who 
are the 
poorest 
do 
not 
receive the benefit, 
because 
they 
are 
outside 
the 
formal 
educational 
system. 
In 
that 
light, 
the 
poverty 
map 
should 
provide

34. 
Establish 
a 
relationship 
with 
the 
Ministry of 
Education 
and 
Agree 
on 
a 
Strategy 
for 
Reform. 
As 
discussed 
in 
paragraph 
26, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
requires strengthening 
to 
carry 
out 
immediate 
changes 
in 
the 
area. 
Moreover, 
the 
political 
risks 
are 
very 
high 
in 
the education 
sector, 
where the 
teachers 
union 
is 
very 
combative. 
For 
that reason 
the 
actions 
in 
education 
are 
more 
slowly 
paced 
and 
involve 
significant 
exercises 
of 
building 
consensus 
among 
different 
stakeholders. 
The end 
result 
is 
to 
set 
the 
ground 
for 
important 
changes 
in 
the way 
resources are 
allocated 
and incentives 
are 
provided 
for 
teachers 
in 
rural 
areas, 
where 
significant 
gaps 
still 
remain. 
Some 
of 
these changes 
will 
begin 
during 
the 
last 
phase 
of 
the 
HDRP. 
35. 
Improve 
Access 
to 
and 
Coverage 
of 
Education 
in 
Rural 
Areas. 
In 
1999, 
overall 
net 
enrolment 
at the 
primary level 
was 
90 
percent. 
However 
this 
figure 
hides 
significant 
differences 
between 
urban 
and 
rural 
areas 
and, 
since 
most 
of 
the indigenous 
population lives 
in 
rural 
areas, 
between indigenous 
and 
non-indigenous 
children. 
Low 
enrolment 
rates, 
coupled 
with 
frequent 
drop-outs and delayed 
enrolments 
(at 
age 
6, 
only 
70 
percent 
of 
children 
in 
rural 
areas 
are 
enrolled 
in 
school 
compared 
to 
90 
percent 
in 
urban 
areas), 
make 
improving 
access 
to 
and 
coverage 
of 
education 
in 
rural 
areas 
a 
priority. 
36. 
Because 
about 
15 
percent 
of 
the 
rural 
population 
speaks 
languages 
other than 
Spanish 
and 
schools 
with 
only 
one 
teacher 
are 
most often 
located 
in 
poor, 
rural 
areas, 
increasing 
enrolment 
rates 
among 
children 
in 
these 
areas 
will 
necessarily 
require 
investments 
to 
improve 
bilingual 
education 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
at 
multilevel 
schools. 
A 
bilingual 
education 
system, 
Intercultural 
Bilingual 
Education 
system, 
exists 
in 
Ecuador 
since 1998, 
and enrolments 
in 
bilingual 
schools 
have 
increased 
by 
more than 
100 
percent 
in 
a 
decade. 
However, 
despite 
these 
improvements 
the 
system covered 
barely 
4.4 
percent 
of 
all 
children enrolled 
in 
2000 
- 
a 
very 
small 
percentage 
when 
one considers 
that between 
12 
and 
25 percent 
of 
the 
rural 
population 
is 
indigenous. 
Similarly 
multilevel 
schools, 
covering 
approximately 
9 
percent 
of 
all 
children 
enrolled 
in 
elementary school, 
are 
most 
often 
located 
in 
the 
country’s poorest rural, 
isolated 
areas, 
and 
hence 
at 
a disadvantage 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
public 
schools 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
37. 
If 
access 
to 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
in 
bilingual 
and 
multilevel 
schools 
is 
to 
increase, 
teachers need 
to 
be trained 
to 
effectively 
operate 
in 
such 
environments. Proper 
training 
should 
go 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
regular 
pay 
and 
improved 
incentives, monetary 
and 
non-monetary, 
to improve 
working 
conditions 
and 
ensure 
teacher attendance.

rural 
schools 
to 
attract and 
retain 
teachers 
should 
be increased 
by 
linking 
salary 
monies 
to 
positions 
rather than 
teachers 
-currently 
referred 
to 
as 
“Partidus” 
system. 
The 
system 
for 
assigning 
teachers 
contributes 
to 
the 
difficult 
situation, 
principally 
in 
rural 
schools. 
When 
there 
is 
a vacancy 
in 
a 
rural 
school, a teacher 
can 
be 
appointed 
to 
work 
in 
the school, 
but 
a 
few 
months 
later, 
he 
or 
she 
can 
obtain 
a 
position 
in 
an 
urban 
school 
or 
in 
a 
Provincial 
Directorate 
taking 
the 
appointment 
along 
with 
hidher, 
and 
leaving 
the 
school 
without 
an 
available 
position. 
Hence, the 
current 
teacher 
pay 
system 
needs 
to 
be reformed 
to 
fight 
fraud 
among 
teachers 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
salary 
monies 
remain 
where 
they 
are 
most 
needed, 
that 
is, 
in 
rural 
areas. 
In 
addition, 
the 
teachers’ salary structure 
does 
not 
respond 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
performance 
and 
equity. 
For 
example, the 
“frontier 
bonus” 
received 
by 
teachers 
in 
isolated 
rural 
areas, 
which 
represents an 
amount equivalent 
to 
up 
to 
25 
percent 
of 
their 
salary, 
continues 
to 
be 
included 
in 
a 
teacher’s 
salary 
even when 
the teacher 
stops 
working 
in 
the 
rural 
area 
and 
is 
transferred 
to 
an 
urban 
school. 
The 
first 
steps 
in 
these 
directions 
should 
contemplate 
a 
revision 
of 
the 
‘partidus’ 
system, 
including 
an 
update 
of 
the 
currently 
active 
teacher 
population. 
Recognizing 
that 
no 
significant 
reform 
will 
be taken 
as 
long 
as 
teachers 
do 
not 
receive 
their 
salaries 
on 
time, 
the 
HDRP 
also calls 
for 
regularizing 
overtime 
the payment 
of 
teachers 
salaries.

1: 
Creating

to 
oversee 
the 
design 
of 
a 
universal 
basic 
health 
insurance model, 
and 
improving

and 
the 
SSC 
will 
be 
the 
initial 
structures 
over 
which 
the 
universal 
system 
will 
be 
constructed. 
The 
design 
will 
include: 
(i) 
an 
implementation 
strategy 
for 
a 
set 
of 
minimal 
and 
self 
targeted basic 
health 
services; 
(ii) 
a sustainable

mechanism; 
(iii) 
a

system. 
At 
the 
same 
time,

will 
be

2: 
Standardizing

The 
services 
offered 
by

to 
facilitate 
agreements 
among

3: 
Developing

goal 
of 
this 
stage. 
Performance

among

At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
IESS 
will 
proceed 
with 
the 
full 
implementation 
of 
a 
separation 
of 
financing 
and 
provision. 
This 
will 
set 
the 
stage 
for 
the 
IESS 
to 
be 
able 
to 
buy 
services 
from 
other 
providers. 
Stage 
4 
(beyond

the program): Separating 
of

and 
eventually creation 
of 
a 
unique 
purchasing

In 
this 
stage 
the 
decentralization 
process 
will 
continue 
further, 
and 
the separation 
of

will 
be 
completed.

The

at

It 
is 
estimated 
that 
in 
2002 
another 
31 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
received 
basic 
health 
services 
through 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health’s 
facilities 
and 
that 
about 
10 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
receive 
services 
from 
NGOs, 
religious 
institutions and 
other providers. 
This 
leaves about 
37 
percent 
of 
the 
population without 
access 
to 
basic 
services. 
From 
the 
perspective 
of 
the 
depth 
of 
coverage, the 
situation 
is 
even 
worse, 
especially 
for 
the 
poor 
population.  The 
LMG 
is 
limited 
to 
a 
very 
basic package 
of 
services 
for 
maternal 
and 
child 
care 
only, and 
this 
system 
lacks 
adequate 
financial 
coverage 
and 
depends 
on 
a 
system 
of 
referrals 
to 
other (equally 
problematic) 
public 
hospitals when 
severe 
health problems 
are detected. 
43. 
Increased 
access 
and 
coverage 
will 
be 
accomplished 
through 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
basic 
package 
and 
the 
signing 
of 
contracting 
agreements 
among providers 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
idle 
capacity. 
The 
LMG

access 
to maternal

there 
is

poor

in 
leadership, surveillance,

coordination, 
monitoring

Elimination 
of 
Hidden 
Cross 
Subsidies. 
The 
lack 
of 
transparency 
in 
the 
health 
sector 
has 
been a 
major 
factor 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
hidden 
cross 
subsidies 
among 
providers 
and 
the 
high 
price 
of 
pharmaceuticals. 
Thus, 
the 
real 
cost 
of 
different 
services 
is 
unknown, 
as, 
for 
example, 
the SSC 
uses 
IESS 
facilities 
for 
second 
level 
or 
more 
complex 
health 
care procedures 
without 
receiving 
a compensation, 
as 
well 
as 
some 
services 
from 
MOH 
are 
provided 
to 
the 
general 
population, 
including 
IESS 
affiliates. 
In 
order 
to 
eliminate 
the 
cross subsidies, 
the 
MOH 
and the 
IESS 
will 
sign 
agreements 
to 
purchase services 
from 
one 
another, based 
on 
several studies 
being 
performed 
on 
the 
cost 
of 
services 
and the 
extent 
of 
subsidization 
from 
one 
institution 
to 
the 
other.

Reduce 
Out 
of 
Pocket 
Expenses 
in 
Pharmaceuticals. 
The 
out 
of 
pocket 
expenses 
in 
pharmaceuticals 
is 
much 
higher 
in 
Ecuador than 
in 
other 
Latin 
American 
countries. 
This 
can 
in 
part 
be 
attributed to higher 
than 
average 
price 
of 
pharmaceuticals. 
The 
process 
for 
approval 
of 
drugs 
through 
the 
National 
Registry lacks 
transparency. 
As 
such, 
some 
cases 
are processed 
immediately, and 
others 
take 
an 
indefinite period 
of 
time 
to 
go 
through. 
At 
the 
same 
time,

of

Liabilities: 
Access 
to 
pensions 
and

supplements 
among 
the 
elderly 
in 
Ecuador 
is 
one 
of 
the 
lowest 
in 
LAC, 
judged 
by 
traditional 
indicators, 
like 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
economically active 
population 
that pays 
into 
the 
contributive 
system, 
or 
the 
proportion 
of 
persons 
age 
60 
or 
more 
with 
benefits. 
With 
only 
15 
percent 
of 
older 
individuals receiving 
a 
contributory pension and 
another 
15 
percent 
receiving 
a 
non-contributory benefit, 
Ecuador 
is 
the 
country 
with 
the 
second 
lowest 
percentage 
of 
contributors 
to 
formal 
pension 
schemes, 
after 
Bolivia. 
As 
the 
elderly 
are a 
significant proportion 
of 
the 
poor, coverage 
should 
be 
expanded 
in 
the 
formal 
sector 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
informal 
sector. 
This 
may 
be 
accomplished 
by 
improving 
labor market 
conditions, 
enforcing 
existing 
legislation, and designing and

challenges 
with 
potential fiscal implications: 
first, 
the 
Government 
of 
Ecuador 
has 
run 
in 
the 
past 
substantial 
arrears 
on 
its 
contributions 
to 
IESS 
as 
an employer, and 
on 
the 
40 
percent 
of 
pension 
payments 
it 
is 
liable 
for, according 
to 
the 
law. 
The Constitution 
requires that 
the Government and 
the 
LESS 
reach 
an agreement 
on 
the value 
of 
this 
debt, 
and 
that 
it 
be 
paid 
by 
2009.  There 
is 
an 
agreement 
in 
the value 
of 
the debt 
in 
Sucres, 
but 
depending 
upon 
the exchange 
rate 
to 
be 
applied, 
the 
total 
liability 
fluctuates 
between US$0.4 
and 
US$2 
billion. 
Second, 
the 
40 
percent 
payment 
by 
the 
Government 
to 
IESS 
is 
maintained 
by 
the 
new Social 
Security 
Law, 
with 
the added 
problem 
that 
it 
also applies 
to 
increases 
in 
pension 
benefits, 
which 
are 
determined 
exclusively 
by 
the 
IESS. 
50. 
In 
defining 
a strategy 
to 
increase 
coverage, 
the 
fiscal implications 
will 
be 
taken 
into 
account. 
Negotiations 
are 
under 
way 
to 
determine the value 
of 
the 
debt 
and the 
schedule 
of 
payments, 
and 
a 
revision 
of 
the 
current 
Social 
Security 
Law, 
which 
has 
been 
questioned 
on 
legal 
grounds 
in 
the superior courts 
of 
Ecuador 
is 
going 
to 
be revised. 
This 
operation 
does 
not 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
pension 
reform 
as 
described 
in 
the 
1991 
Social 
Insurance 
Law, 
however, 
as 
this 
law 
has 
been questioned 
in 
legal 
courts.

Developing 
a 
Strategic 
Vision 
for 
the 
Sector. 
Unfortunately, 
at 
present 
the 
Government 
has 
not 
articulated 
an 
integrated pension 
policy, 
although many 
institutions 
have 
their 
own 
strategies 
and 
clienteles. 
This 
leads 
to 
a 
fragmented 
system 
with 
coverage 
gaps, 
lack 
of 
mobility 
between employers and institutions, 
and 
inequities 
that can be 
counterproductive.

56. 
Increase 
Transparency 
in 
the 
IESS. 
The administration 
of 
IESS 
funds 
lacks 
transparency and 
allows 
for 
cross 
subsidies 
among programs.  Ecuador 
is 
one 
of 
the 
few 
countries 
in 
Latin 
America 
where the 
health 
and 
pension 
funds 
have 
not 
been 
separated. 
This 
means 
that 
there 
is 
no 
separate 
accounting 
or financial 
management 
of 
the 
funds, 
which 
leaves 
the 
door 
open 
to possibly 
large 
cross subsidies 
from 
one 
fund 
to 
the other. 
Additionally 
there are 
no 
regulations 
at 
the 
IESS 
with 
respect 
to 
publication 
of 
balances 
or 
to 
provide 
a 
transparent 
account 
of 
the use 
of 
funds 
or

seek 
a complete

Fiscal 
Impact 
of 
Social 
Assistance 
Reforms. 
The 
main fiscal 
impact 
of 
the 
first 
phase 
comes 
from 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Bono 
de 
Desarrollo 
Humano 
(BDH). 
This 
has 
been budgeted at 
US$197 
million 
which 
has 
already been 
incorporated 
in 
the 
social welfare 
budget. 
However, the 
team 
working on 
the 
BDH 
estimates that 
significant 
savings 
will 
come 
from 
better 
targeting, the 
introduction 
of 
differential 
payments 
by 
income, and the 
conditionality 
of 
payments. 
Moreover, 
since the 
targeting instrument used 
by 
the 
BDH 
(SELBEN) 
is 
only to 
be 
updated 
every three 
years 
at the 
soonest, 
the 
number 
of 
beneficiaries 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
increase 
in 
the 
medium 
run. 
Changing 
the 
targeting 
mechanisms (expansion 
of 
SELBEN 
and 
producing 
the 
poverty 
map) 
is 
being 
financed 
with 
non-reimbursable 
funds. 
59. 
The 
second 
and 
third 
phases 
of 
the 
program 
will 
consolidate the 
BDH, 
but 
the 
marginal 
cost 
should 
be close 
to 
zero 
and 
will 
support a 
transformation 
of 
the 
nutrition 
programs. 
The 
definition 
of 
mutually 
exclusive 
target 
populations 
and the 
adoption 
of 
SELBEN 
as 
a 
targeting 
mechanism 
are 
expected 
to 
eliminate 
overlap 
and 
hence 
reduce 
cost. 
Also, 
better targeting 
will 
help cut 
down on 
over-coverage, 
especially 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
PAE, 
creating 
savings.  Part 
of 
these 
savings; however, 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
devoted 
to 
the 
inclusion 
of 
milk 
in 
the 
ration 
handed 
out 
by 
the 
PAE, 
an 
issue that 
is 
still 
under discussion 
by 
the 
Government.

significant 
savings since 
an 
important number 
of 
'ghost 
teachers' 
will 
disappear 
from 
the 
payroll. 
It 
is, 
still, 
unclear 
whether 
more 
teachers are 
needed, 
specially 
in 
rural 
areas, 
or 
whether 
the 
teachers 
currently 
on 
the 
payroll 
can 
be 
relocated 
to rural 
areas 
where 
they 
are 
mostly 
needed. 
A 
consultation

determine 
actual 
teacher 
needs 
in 
the 
country, 
and 
to

in 
expenditure 
beyond 
those established 
in 
the 
Pro forma 
Budget. 
The 
agreements 
between 
the 
LMG 
and the 
SSC 
will 
imply 
that the 
total 
budget 
of 
the 
LMG 
be 
used 
during 
the 
fiscal 
year, 
but 
this 
budget 
of 
US$15 
million 
has 
already been 
incorporated 
in 
the current 
budgetary provisions. 
The 
HDRL 
I 
also 
calls 
for 
expansion 
of 
coverage 
by 
IESS 
to 
dependents 
and relatives 
of 
affiliates, 
but 
this 
expansion 
is 
only 
going to 
take 
place 
in 
the second 
phase 
of 
the 
program, according 
to 
a 
plan 
and 
financing 
capacity. 
This 
expansion 
of 
coverage 
has 
already 
been approved 
by 
law, 
and 
the 
program 
is 
assisting 
in 
making 
sure 
that 
such 
expansion 
does 
not 
create 
deficits 
in 
IESS 
and 
fiscal 
contingencies 
for 
the 
Government. 
This 
amount 
will 
have 
to 
be 
budgeted 
in 
future 
years 
also. 
63. 
The 
biggest 
fiscal impact 
on 
the 
health 
side 
will 
be 
felt 
during 
the 
third 
phase 
of 
the 
program. 
It 
has 
been 
estimated that 
the 
extension 
of 
coverage 
to 
the 
lowest 
two 
quintiles 
could 
cost about 
US$120 
million 
(using 
the 
cost 
of 
an 
average basic package 
in 
other countries 
as 
reference). 
Expansion 
beyond 
that 
point 
will 
be 
based 
on 
prior 
analysis 
of 
fiscal 
sustainability. 
A 
Public 
Expenditure

studies

consideration together 
with

HDRP. 
The 
CAS 
has 
identified 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
Government’s 
agenda 
as 
priorities 
for 
Bank 
assistance 
over the 
next 
four 
years: 
(a) 
consolidating 
the 
macroeconomic 
framework 
to lay 
the 
foundation 
for 
diversified 
and 
sustainable 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction; 
(b) 
making 
needed 
structural 
reforms socially 
sustainable 
and 
mitigating their 
impacts 
on 
the 
poor 
and 
the vulnerable; 
and 
(c) 
strengthening governance 
and 
helping officials 
build 
an 
accountable 
and 
efficient 
Government, the services 
of 
which 
are accessible 
to 
all 
Ecuadorians. 
This 
program 
supports 
the 
second 
objective and 
is 
complemented 
by 
the 
proposed 
Fiscal 
Consolidation 
and 
Competitive 
Growth 
Adjustment 
Loan 
that 
addresses 
the 
first 
objective. 
Both 
the 
HDRP 
and 
the 
proposed 
Fiscal 
Consolidation 
and 
Competitive 
Growth 
Adjustment 
Loan 
support Government 
efforts 
to 
strengthen governance 
and 
improve 
the 
equity 
and 
efficiency 
of 
Government service 
delivery. 
67. 
The 
proposed 
Fiscal 
Consolidation 
and 
Competitive 
Growth Loan 
complements 
this 
program 
by 
promoting 
structural 
reforms 
in 
the 
economy. 
The 
proposed

the 
design and implementation 
of 
structural 
changes 
in 
the 
social 
sectors; 
the proposed

will 
support 
the design 
and implementation 
of 
structural 
changes 
in 
the

reinforce 
the 
role 
of 
human 
development 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
long-term 
sustainable 
growth. 
Together 
with 
a 
set 
of 
austerity 
measures 
in 
many other 
areas, 
the 
Government 
announced an increase 
in 
social 
assistance 
spending 
as 
well 
as 
the preparation 
of 
a 
number 
of 
new 
draft laws 
to 
enable 
extension 
of 
coverage 
and 
to 
improve 
the cost 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
provision 
of 
basic 
social 
services. 
The 
Government 
has 
prepared 
a 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy 
to 
this 
effect (Annex 
1). 
The 
new 
administration 
is 
generally clear 
on 
the 
broad 
areas 
of 
need 
and 
the 
general 
principles 
that 
could 
guide 
its 
reform 
process 
(see 
Section 
1II.B 
on 
the 
long 
term 
vision),  although 
at 
this 
early 
stage 
of 
its 
tenure, 
it 
has 
not 
fully 
defined 
the operational 
targets 
that should 
ultimately 
be 
achieved 
and 
a 
timetable 
for 
reaching 
them. 
However, 
it 
envisages a 
period 
of 
national 
dialogue 
on 
major 
social 
sector 
issues, 
making 
immediate reforms 
when 
these 
can 
establish a 
direction 
of 
improvements 
and 
build 
constituencies 
and 
commitment 
for 
further 
activities. 
Key 
to 
this 
process 
will 
be 
the newly-created 
Dialogue 
and 
Planning 
Secretariat 
-Secretaria 
de 
Didlogo y Planijkacio'n, 
whose mandate 
includes establishing 
a 
framework 
for 
and 
implementing consultative 
processes 
on 
issues 
of 
national importance 
between 
the 
Government, 
civil 
society 
and 
international 
partners. 
The 
Secretaria 
is 
receiving 
assistance 
from 
UNDP 
and 
UNICEF 
to 
launch 
its 
activities, 
among 
which 
national 
roundtables 
on 
reforms 
in 
the 
health 
sector 
and 
decentralization 
are 
priorities. 
73. 
Several alternative 
mechanisms 
of 
World 
Bank 
Assistance 
for 
the 
program 
were 
considered 
and rejected.  Support 
through 
investment 
lending 
was 
rejected 
in 
favor 
of 
adjustment 
lending given 
to 
the 
Government's need 
for 
broad 
budgetary 
support 
in 
the present 
financial 
emergency, 
rather than 
for 
structured 
and 
positively-identified 
resources, 
for 
specific 
purposes 
(the 
Bank 
is 
considering investment 
lending 
in 
specific 
sectors 
were 
relevant). 
A 
more 
traditional 
sector-based adjustment approach 
through 
a 
SECAL 
was 
also rejected, 
even 
considering 
the 
sectorial nature 
of 
the 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed, 
since a 
SECAL 
was 
seen 
as 
requiring 
more 
specification 
of 
conditions over 
a 
longer 
time 
period 
than 
would 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
present 
context. 
In 
this 
context, a 
process 
that 
permitted 
a 
certain 
flexibility 
in 
defining 
the precise 
steps 
and content 
of 
a 
medium 
term 
program, 
and 
allowed 
the 
Government 
to 
build 
commitment 
would 
be 
advantageous, 
and 
so 
a 
Programmatic 
Structural Adjustment 
Loan 
was 
considered 
the 
most 
appropriate instrument 
for 
the 
Government's 
needs. 
One 
of 
the 
main 
priorities announced 
by 
the 
Government 
upon taking 
office 
was 
to 
29 
Page  38
74. 
The 
World 
Bank 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
in 
three 
phases, 
the 
first 
supported 
by 
a 
programmatic loan 
of 
US$50 
million, 
and 
the 
second 
and 
the 
third 
by 
programmatic 
loans 
of 
US$lOO 
million 
each, 
with 
their 
own 
terms 
and 
conditionalities 
appraised 
and 
negotiated 
separately. 
The 
loans 
would 
be 
built 
around 
three 
main 
goals, 
emphasized 
differently 
by 
operation 
and 
by 
sector; 
as 
follows: 
a. 
Protecting 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
groups 
in 
the 
population 
by 
protecting 
public 
spending 
on 
the social 
sectors 
in 
general 
and 
priority 
social 
programs 
in 
particular; 
b. 
Increasing 
the 
efficiency 
and coverage 
of 
basic 
social 
services 
through: 
(i) 
improving 
targeting tools 
for 
social 
assistance 
programs; 
(ii) 
using 
those 
instruments 
in 
a consistent 
way 
to 
determine 
who 
benefits 
from 
the program; 
(iii) 
prioritizing 
social 
assistance 
spending 
towards 
the 
most 
efficient 
programs, 
(iv) 
improving 
a 
number 
of 
basic 
social 
services; 
and 
(v) 
eliminating 
some 
administrative 
barriers 
that 
prevent 
social 
services 
from 
reaching the 
poor; 
and 
c. 
Improving 
access 
and 
generation 
of 
information 
and 
to 
promote 
transparency 
in 
the 
distribution 
and 
administration 
of 
public 
social 
sector 
resources. 
The 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
HDRP 
would 
assist 
the 
Government 
in 
closing 
fiscal 
gaps 
75. 
while protecting key 
social expenditures, 
and 
in 
redirecting 
expenditures 
towards 
the most 
vulnerable 
groups 
in 
the 
population. 
The 
HDRL 
I 
would 
improve 
Ecuador’s 
ability to 
finance 
social 
operations 
during 
the 
ongoing 
fiscal 
adjustment 
while 
protecting 
programs that 
affect 
the 
poor, 
and 
would 
also 
provide 
assistance 
in 
the 
adoption 
of 
administrative and regulatory 
measures 
that 
will 
improve 
the 
poverty targeting 
and 
focus 
of 
basic 
social 
services, 
reduce 
leakages 
and 
improve 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
social 
expenditures that 
are 
being 
made 
in 
the 
period 
of 
austerity. 
These adjustments 
would 
have 
dramatic 
medium term 
effects. 
In 
addition, 
work would 
be 
initiated 
to 
design 
alternative 
and 
improved 
programs 
that 
could 
institutionalize 
a 
more 
cost- 
effective 
set 
of 
social 
services. 
76. 
would 
set 
the 
stage 
for 
long-term structural reforms 
in 
the 
social 
sectors. 
While 
the 
first 
phase 
protects social 
spending, begins 
the 
implementation 
of 
changes 
in 
the 
social 
safety 
net, 
and 
assists 
in 
the design 
of 
reforms 
in 
health and 
promotes dialogue 
in 
the 
education 
sector, 
the 
second 
and 
third 
operations 
will 
also 
focus 
on 
guaranteeing that basic 
social 
spending 
is 
protected 
and 
increases 
as 
fiscal 
pressures 
ease, 
and 
on 
preparing 
the 
ground 
for 
implementation 
of 
long 
term 
structural 
reforms. 
This 
will 
be 
done 
through 
the 
execution 
of 
pilot 
experiences, 
leading 
a 
national 
dialogue 
on 
the 
direction 
of 
the social 
agenda, 
negotiating 
changes 
in 
regulatory 
frameworks, 
signing 
agreements 
among 
different 
actors 
in 
the 
social 
sector 
that 
are at the 
moment 
acting 
individually, 
and 
lifting 
a 
number 
of 
constraints 
that 
prevent 
social 
programs 
from 
working 
efficiently.

The 
first 
phase 
would 
emphasize the 
first 
two 
objectives 
since 
they 
are 
considered 
priorities. 
It 
would 
define 
an 
adequate 
level 
of 
public 
spending 
on 
the 
social 
sectors 
to 
be 
maintained, and 
a 
number 
of 
programs 
whose 
budget 
has 
to 
be protected. 
It 
would 
also 
seek 
to 
begin 
the 
implementation 
of 
structural 
changes 
in 
the 
main 
social 
assistance 
program, 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
immediately 
the 
level 
and 
type 
of 
assistance 
to 
the poor, 
for 
example 
by 
changing 
the 
way 
it 
is 
targeted and 
benefits 
determined. 
Finally, 
it 
would 
support the design 
of 
structural 
reforms 
in 
health 
and pensions 
to 
improve efficiency 
and coverage. 
The 
phasing 
in 
the 
program 
recognizes that 
structural 
changes 
in 
social 
assistance 
can 
provide 
immediate 
protection 
and 
relatively 
quick 
results, 
while 
changes 
in 
education 
require 
a 
longer 
term 
to 
be 
effective. 
78. 
The 
second 
phase 
would 
consolidate 
the 
first 
phase 
results 
by 
maintaining 
the level 
of 
protection 
in 
social 
spending 
and 
guaranteeing 
its 
execution, emphasizing 
efficiency 
gains 
and 
the 
accountability 
goal. 
This 
phase 
would 
call for 
maintaining 
the 
level 
of 
social 
spending 
in 
real 
terms and 
for 
showing 
that the 
execution 
of 
some 
priority 
programs 
is 
on 
target, 
as 
delays 
in 
execution 
could 
be 
damaging 
for 
the objectives 
of 
those 
programs. 
During 
this 
phase 
the 
structural 
reform to 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
would 
be 
finalized 
and 
additional reforms 
to 
the 
social 
safety 
net 
would 
be 
implemented, 
like 
the adoption 
of 
the 
poverty 
map 
as 
a geographic 
targeting 
tool. 
The 
second 
loan 
would 
set 
the 
stage 
for 
longer-term 
structural 
reforms 
in 
health 
and 
education, 
including 
changes 
in 
existing 
structures 
and 
the 
administration 
of 
health 
care services 
to 
allow 
for 
conversion 
and 
initiation 
of 
structural reforms, and 
a 
consultative 
process 
in 
education 
to modify 
resource 
allocation 
systems 
and 
improve 
incentive 
schemes 
for 
teachers 
in 
rural 
areas. 
79. 
The 
third 
phase 
would take the 
first 
steps 
in 
implementing 
changes 
that 
would 
have 
a 
long 
term 
impact 
in 
social 
sectors. 
While 
the 
level 
of 
protection 
to 
social spending 
would 
be 
maintained 
and 
even 
increased, 
particularly 
in 
health, a 
third 
loan 
would 
concentrate 
on 
deepening 
the 
changes 
that 
started 
in 
the previous 
operations, 
and 
on 
achieving 
and measuring 
some 
results 
from 
the 
reforms implemented 
then. 
Under 
the 
third 
phase 
other programs 
in 
the 
social 
safety 
net 
besides 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
would 
be 
reformed, 
and 
the 
long-term 
structural 
changes 
in 
health 
will 
be 
mainstreamed. 
The 
long-term 
reforms 
in 
education 
would 
begin, and 
the 
implementation 
of 
the pension 
strategy 
would 
start.

transparency. 
Throughout the 
three 
phases 
there 
would 
be

on 
accountability

THELOANS

1. 
The 
programmatic loans 
will 
consist 
of 
one 
single 
tranche 
of 
US$50 
million 
and 
two 
single 
tranches 
of 
US$lOO 
million 
each. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
first 
loan, the disbursement 
for 
the 
single 
tranche 
would 
be 
for 
US$49.5 
million 
as 
the 
front-end 
fee 
is 
being 
capitalized and should 
be 
deducted 
from 
the 
US$50 
million. 
This 
amount 
will 
be 
disbursed 
upon 
effectiveness. 
The 
second 
and 
third 
loans 
of 
US$lOO 
million 
each are expected 
to be 
negotiated 
and 
submitted 
for 
approval 
around 
May 
2004 
and 
2005 
respectively. 
The 
basis 
for 
the 
negotiation 
and 
approval 
of 
these 
loans 
will 
be the 
completion 
of 
actions 
described 
in 
the 
Policy 
Matrifllan 
of 
Actions. 
82. 
Disbursement 
arrangements 
would 
follow 
the 
simplified 
procedures 
for 
SALS/ 
SECALs 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
on 
February 
1, 
1996. 
The 
Borrower 
will 
open 
an 
account 
in 
Ecuador's 
Central 
Bank 
(Banco Central del 
Ecuador). 
Once 
the 
Bank formally 
notifies 
the 
borrower 
that a tranche 
is 
available 
for 
withdrawal, 
the 
Borrower may 
submit 
a 
simplified 
withdrawal 
application 
so 
that the 
proceeds 
of 
the tranche 
are 
deposited 
by 
the 
Bank 
in 
this 
account,

use 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Loan 
Agreement. Disbursements

and supporting 
evidence 
for 
disbursements 
is 
therefore 
not 
required. 
The 
proceeds 
of 
the

may 
not 
be used 
to 
finance 
expenditures 
typically 
excluded 
under 
the 
Loan 
Agreement. 
83. 
Benchmarks 
and 
Triggers. 
In 
extensive 
discussions 
with 
MEF 
and 
other Government 
agencies, 
a number 
of 
benchmarks 
have 
been agreed 
to 
measure 
progress 
in 
achieving 
the 
objectives 
of 
the social 
reform 
program. 
The 
detailed 
set 
of 
benchmarks 
for 
the 
first 
HRDL 
I 
loan 
and an indicative 
detailed 
list 
of 
benchmarks 
for 
the 
second 
and 
third 
loans are 
specified 
in 
the 
Policy 
Matrix 
in 
Annex 
2. 
This 
matrix 
also 
includes a 
minimum 
set 
of 
expected outcomes 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
program. 
84. 
The 
indicative 
benchmarks 
for 
the second 
loan listed 
in 
Annex 
2 
will 
not 
necessarily 
be 
all 
conditions 
for 
future 
lending. 
Many 
of 
them 
will 
serve 
as 
guideposts 
to 
signal 
progress 
of 
decisions/actions towards 
achieving 
the objectives 
of 
the 
reform 
program. 
Among 
these 
benchmarks, 
some 
key 
actions 
will 
serve 
as 
triggers 
or 
minimum 
conditions 
for 
the 
Bank 
to 
proceed 
with 
the processing 
of 
the 
second loan. 
Following 
is 
a 
list 
of 
Trigger 
Actions 
the 
Government 
has 
committed 
to implement 
as 
necessary 
condition 
to 
proceed 
with 
preparation 
of 
successive 
phases 
of 
the 
program.

Secretario 
will 
be assisted 
by 
specially 
delegated

to

The 
MEF 
will 
coordinate closely 
with 
other 
members 
of 
the 
Frente Social 
to 
assure 
that 
program 
goals 
are 
met. 
Under its 
mandate, 
the

would 
serve 
as 
the 
forum 
to

on 
the 
policies 
and

developed 
at 
a 
political 
and 
strategic level. 
Shortly after 
its 
inauguration, 
the 
new 
Government 
established a Secretariat 
for 
Dialogue 
and 
Planning 
-Secretaria 
del 
Didlogo 
y 
Planinficacidn. 
This 
Secretariat 
has 
the mandate 
to 
facilitate 
consensus 
building 
on 
issues 
of 
national 
importance, 
promoting 
the 
participation 
of 
NGOs 
and 
civil 
society 
organizations 
in 
a 
variety 
of 
national 
and 
regional 
fora.  The 
Secretariat 
would 
be 
engaged 
during 
the 
program 
to 
continue 
to 
facilitate 
dialogue. 
The 
Government 
would 
also 
follow 
a 
two-way 
communication 
and 
consultation 
process 
on 
the 
technical 
and 
programmatic 
aspects 
of 
the 
sectors 
reform 
through 
the 
communications 
unit 
of 
the 
Frente Social. 
These 
consultations 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
definition 
of 
operational 
objectives, timetables, details 
of 
reform 
initiatives 
and 
measures 
to 
implement 
the 
program. 
One 
part 
of 
this 
launching 
process 
was 
the presentation 
of 
the 
program 
in 
a 
dialogue 
that 
coincided 
with 
preparation 
of 
the 
CAS. 
This 
also 
included 
consultations 
with 
representatives 
of 
the 
indigenous community. 
As 
part 
of 
the preparation 
of 
the 
second 
and 
third 
phases, 
additional 
consultations 
would 
be 
organized 
to 
assess 
progress 
in 
meeting 
program 
objectives, 
evaluating 
additional 
needs 
and 
recommending additional 
measures 
that 
might 
be 
required. 
The 
Secretaria Tbcnica 
del 
Frente Social 
would be 
responsible 
for 
arranging 
such 
consultations and 
events. 
Having 
conducted 
such a 
consultative 
process 
would 
also 
be 
part 
of 
the 
conditionality 
of 
making 
the 
second 
and

Therefore,

controlling 
public 
expenditures 
during 
the 
recently 
completed 
(2001) 
State 
Modernization 
Project 
(MOSTA).  The 
ICR 
for 
the 
project 
has 
reported that the development 
and 
application 
of 
a 
new 
integrated 
financial 
management system 
(SIGEF) 
has 
brought 
a satisfactory 
level 
of 
financial 
accountability 
to 
national 
institutions 
and 
provincial 
agencies 
covering 
about 
85 
percent 
of 
the 
national budget 
and 
has 
allowed 
the 
MOF 
to 
consolidate 
and 
track 
such spending. 
The 
MOSTA 
also 
has 
provided 
the State 
Controller’s 
Office 
-Contraloria 
General 
del 
Estado- 
with 
a 
focused 
mandate 
and 
improved 
capacity 
to 
monitor 
and audit 
state 
spending ex post. 
As 
a 
follow 
up, 
the 
Government 
has 
prepared and the 
Bank 
is 
supporting 
a 
Public 
Sector 
Financial 
Management 
TA 
Project 
(FMTAP), 
which would 
provide 
software, hardware 
and 
training 
for 
additional 
agencies, 
including 
autonomous 
agencies 
using 
government 
financing, 
to incorporate 
them 
into 
the SIGEF. 
90. 
To 
mitigate 
risks 
associated 
with 
financial 
management 
under the 
program, 
all 
of 
the 
major 
users 
of 
public 
funds 
to 
support 
social 
sector agencies (ministries, 
ministry 
units 
managing 
specific 
programs; autonomous 
agencies) 
would 
be programmed 
to 
begin receiving technical 
support 
to 
implement 
SIGEF-Institutional provisions 
during 
the second 
and 
third 
phases 
of 
the 
program. 
A 
condition 
for 
making 
the second 
programmatic 
loan would 
be 
that 
MEF 
has 
produced 
a 
consolidated 
report 
on 
the 
status 
of 
spending 
in 
the 
social 
sector 
(as 
defined under 
this 
program), 
and 
while 
not 
specifically 
required, the use 
of 
the 
improved SIGEF 
system 
would 
assist 
in 
this 
task.

During 
2002, a 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding 
(MOU) 
was 
reformulated 
and approved 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
Controller 
General 
of 
the 
State 
(CGE), 
which 
enhances 
oversight 
of 
the 
independent 
audits 
of 
projects 
and aims at 
improving 
the 
timeliness 
and 
quality 
of 
audit 
reports. 
Also, 
a 
Pilot 
Capacity 
Assessment 
of 
Private 
Audit 
Firms 
in 
Ecuador 
was 
conducted 
during 
FY03. 
The 
assessment 
revealed 
that there 
is 
unevenness 
in 
the 
institutional 
capacity, 
audit 
methodology 
and 
engagement practices 
of 
firms, 
when 
bench marked 
against 
international 
standards 
on 
auditing. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
assessment, 
recommendations 
have 
been made 
to 
the 
CGE on 
the 
acceptability 
of 
firms 
to 
conduct audits 
of 
World 
Bank-financed 
projects. 
It 
is 
expected 
therefore, that the 
risks 
to 
Bank 
funds 
posed 
by 
uneven 
quality 
of 
audits, 
will 
be 
reduced. 
92. 
Also, 
a 
Country 
Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
is 
planned 
for FY04. 
The 
results 
of 
this 
assessment 
are expected 
to 
contribute 
to 
Ecuador’s economic development 
by 
(i) 
identifying 
weaknesses 
in 
Public Financial 
Management 
Systems 
and 
Practices 
(ii) 
making 
recommendations 
for improving 
efficiency, 
transparency 
and 
accountability.

work, 
specific

in 
improving

and

Implementing 
the 
program 
faces 
three 
main 
risks;

Political: 
Key 
stakeholder 
groups 
have already 
shown 
their 
ability to 
influence 
the 
possible 
course 
of 
dialogue 
on 
reform 
in 
the 
social 
sectors. 
Throughout, groups 
will 
hold

Page  48
positions, 
reflecting 
agendas 
that 
are 
not 
central 
to 
the 
protection 
of 
vulnerable 
groups 
and social 
sector 
reform. 
While difficult to 
mitigate, 
the 
Government 
would 
engage 
each 
in 
transparent 
and 
open 
two-way 
communications, and 
in 
information-based 
processes 
of 
negotiations 
of 
interests. 
It 
would 
also 
maintain 
an 
open 
information 
policy 
for 
the 
general 
public 
so 
as 
to 
isolate this 
source 
of 
risk 
to 
the 
overall 
program. 
b. 
Macroeconomic: 
Ecuador 
is 
currently 
facing 
a 
period 
of 
uncertain economic 
growth 
(with 
a 
positive 
outlook) 
that 
coincides 
with 
the 
fiscal 
problems 
facing 
the Government. 
Both 
the 
level 
of 
fiscal 
revenues 
and 
to 
a considerable extent, general 
per 
capita 
incomes 
and employment 
levels 
are 
dependent 
on 
an 
uncertain international 
oil 
market. 
The 
budget 
and revenue projections 
underlying 
the present 
program 
(as 
well 
as 
the 
fiscal 
program 
supported 
in 
the proposed 
Fiscal Consolidation 
and 
Competitive 
Growth 
Adjustment 
Loan) 
have been made 
on 
the basis 
of 
low 
international 
oil 
prices 
(about 
50 
percent 
of 
the 
current 
spot 
market 
price 
per 
barrel) 
so 
that the 
fiscal 
risk 
of 
the 
program 
should 
be manageable. 
However, 
fluctuations 
in 
incomes and employment 
will 
affect 
the 
climate 
in 
which 
the 
reform 
process 
is 
to 
take 
place 
and 
change the 
perception 
of 
interests 
and 
the actual 
demands 
for 
social 
sector services 
that 
could 
negatively 
affect 
the 
program’s 
timing 
and 
content. 
Mitigation 
of 
this 
risk 
beyond incorporating 
some 
flexibility 
in 
the planned 
timing 
of 
phases 
2 
and 
3 
may 
be 
difficult. 
c. 
Implementation: 
The program involves 
the 
efforts 
of 
three 
key ministries and 
a 
number 
of 
autonomous 
agencies, 
in 
areas 
that 
are 
technically 
(as 
well 
as 
politically) 
demanding. 
There 
is, 
therefore, a 
serious 
risk 
to 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
entire 
program 
owing to 
its 
scope 
and 
depth. 
The 
program 
appears 
to 
have 
an 
adequate 
management 
structure, 
but 
several 
of 
the 
reforms 
still 
require 
adequate 
technical preparation 
to 
be 
sound. 
Apart 
from 
assistance 
that 
may be available through ongoing projects 
and 
from 
other 
agencies, 
the 
Government 
will 
likely 
seek 
additional financing 
to 
allow 
it 
to 
conduct 
the 
necessary 
research and studies 
to 
reduce 
these 
difficulties, 
and 
the 
Bank 
is 
prepared 
to 
consider 
these 
requests. 
It 
is 
also 
expected 
that 
significant technical 
assistance 
and close supervision 
will 
be 
necessary, 
mostly 
in 
the 
education 
sector.

LETTER 
OF

POLICY 
Quito,

Mr. 
James 
D. 
Wolfensohn 
President 
The 
World 
Bank 
Washington, 
DC 
-USA 
Dear 
Mr. 
Wolfensohn. 
1. 
This 
letter 
addresses 
Ecuador's  progress 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
policies  aimed 
at 
promoting 
human development 
in 
Ecuador 
through 
the 
carrying 
out 
of 
programs 
to 
address 
the 
main 
needs 
of 
the 
poorer, 
including key 
developments 
in 
the health, 
education 
and 
social 
assistance 
sectors. 
The 
improved 
accountability, 
a 
more  participatory 
and 
integrated 
approach, 
the 
development 
of 
compensatory 
and  equity 
enhanced 
policies,  and 
the 
improvement 
in 
the 
quality 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the  social  programs 
in 
Ecuador 
are 
basic 
requirements 
for providing 
better social 
services 
to 
the 
Ecuadorian 
population, 
in 
special the 
underserved communities, 
while improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the  social 
safety 
net 
for 
the 
event 
of 
external 
shocks. 
We 
believe 
the 
policies 
outlined 
herein 
constitute 
key 
Ecuadorian 
government 
initiatives 
to 
be supported 
by 
the 
Bank 
under 
a 
programmatic adjustment 
loan. 
Macroeconomic 
Outlook 
2. 
BACKGROUND: 
In 
early 
2000, 
after 
a 
severe 
economic 
and 
political 
crisis, 
Ecuador 
formally 
replaced 
the 
Sucre 
with 
the 
U.S. 
dollar. 
With 
this 
strong 
exchange 
rate 
anchor, 
the 
economy 
quickly 
stabilized 
and 
started 
to 
recover, 
led 
by 
domestic 
demand. 
The 
recovery 
was 
also helped 
by 
rising 
oil 
prices and 
by 
debt 
relief 
through 
the 
restructuring 
of 
Brady 
bonds 
and 
a 
rescheduling 
of 
Paris 
Club 
obligations. 
However, after 
a 
promising 
start, 
fiscal 
policies 
in 
2001-02 were 
not 
strengthened 
in 
step 
with 
the requirements 
of 
dollarization, 
as 
public 
sector  wages 
ballooned,  imposing significant  fiscal  rigidities 
for 
the 
subsequent 
years, 
and 
the 
primary 
surplus 
declined. 
Moreover, 
while 
the 
banking 
system 
recovered 
rapidly 
after the 
economic 
crisis, there 
was 
little 
progress 
in 
cleaning 
up 
closed 
banks, 
and 
the 
privatization 
program 
of 
public 
enterprises 
and 
other 
important 
structural 
reforms 
were 
halted. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
these slippages, 
by 
end-2002, 
the 
central 
government 
was 
again 
facing 
domestic 
and 
external 
payments 
arrears, 
the 
treasury 
was 
running 
out 
of 
cash 
with 
few 
options 
to 
obtain 
new 
financing, and economic 
activity 
was 
slowing.

THE 
ECONOMIC 
PROGRAM 
FOR 
2003: 
The 
government 
of 
President 
Gutierrez 
took 
office on 
January 
15, 
2003, 
and 
since 
its 
start 
introduced specific 
policy 
actions 
as 
part 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
economic and social program aimed 
to 
correct the 
macroeconomic 
situation 
and 
introduce 
structural reforms. 
After 
a 
short 
process 
of 
negotiation 
developed 
during 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2003, 
the 
program 
of 
the government 
of 
Ecuador 
for 
the 
period 
March 
2003- 
March 
2004 received the support 
of 
the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund 
by 
means 
of 
a 
13- 
month 
Stand-By 
Arrangement 
from 
the 
Fund 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
SDR 
151 
million 
(46 percent 
of 
quota 
on 
an 
annual 
basis). 
The ultimate 
objective 
of 
the 
Economic 
and 
Social Program 
of 
the government 
is 
to 
improve 
the 
living 
conditions 
of 
all 
Ecuadorians, 
particularly 
the poor, 
through 
sustained 
growth 
with 
low 
inflation, 
improvements 
in 
the social 
safety 
net, 
and 
the 
provision 
of 
better 
public 
services, 
in 
special 
health and education. 
In 
order 
to 
reach 
these 
objectives Ecuador 
has 
defined dollarization 
as 
the 
monetary 
tool 
to 
reach those objectives, 
together 
with 
the 
achievement 
of 
a 
strong 
fiscal 
position, 
the 
creation 
of 
conditions 
for 
sustained 
growth 
as 
the 
restoring 
of 
credit 
worthiness, 
and a 
set 
of 
structural reforms 
in 
the 
social 
sector 
to 
improve 
competitiveness, fairness 
and 
governance. 
4. 
THE 
MACROECONOMIC 
FRAMEWORK: 
The 
macroeconomic 
framework 
for 
2003 
projects 
moderate 
output 
growth, 
with 
continued 
progress 
in 
lowering 
inflation. 
Output 
growth 
in 
2003 
is 
projected 
to 
be 
around 
3% percent, 
led 
by 
an 
expansion 
of oil 
exports, 
although 
there 
will 
be 
some 
slowing 
of 
investment 
after 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
new 
oil 
pipeline 
(OCP). 
Consumption 
is 
expected 
to 
expand 
at 
a 
more 
moderate pace 
from 
previous 
years 
following 
a 
period 
of 
catch-up 
spending 
on 
consumer durables. 
The widening 
in 
the 
external 
current 
account 
deficit 
is 
expected 
to 
moderate 
in 
2003, 
while 
consumer 
price 
inflation 
is 
projected 
to 
decline 
to 
around 
6 
percent 
by 
end-2003, 
notwithstanding 
an 
increase 
in 
some 
administered prices. 
5. 
Sustained 
prudent 
fiscal 
policies 
and continued structural 
reforms 
are 
essential 
to achieving 
strong output 
growth 
and 
other medium-term-goals. 
The 
fiscal primary 
surplus 
will 
need 
to 
be maintained 
at 
a 
high 
level 
in 
2004 
and beyond, 
while 
revenues 
from 
extra 
oil 
exports 
will 
be 
used 
in 
large 
part 
to 
reduce the 
public 
debt. 
The 
government 
is 
confident 
that a 
diligent 
implementation 
of 
this 
strategy 
will 
boost 
confidence 
in 
fiscal 
and 
debt sustainability  and 
bring 
down 
the 
current  account 
deficit, 
consistent 
with 
dollarization, 
thus 
contributing 
to 
reduce 
significantly 
the 
very 
high 
interest rates 
and 
EMBI 
risk 
spread 
still 
faced 
by 
Ecuador. 
Bringing 
down 
risk 
spreads 
will 
enhance 
private 
sector 
growth. 
6. 
The 
government's 
fiscal 
policies 
are 
geared 
towards  the 
following 
main 
objectives: 
(i) 
resolving 
immediate 
liquidity 
pressures 
and 
regularizing 
arrears 
left 
by 
the 
previous 
administration; 
(ii) 
tightening 
the 
fiscal 
stance 
to 
recover 
from 
the 
slippages 
of 
2001 
and 
2002; 
(iii) 
protecting 
the 
poor 
by 
stabilizing 
their income levels 
and 
strengthening 
social 
programs; and 
(iv) 
improving 
the 
flexibility 
of 
fiscal 
policy 
and 
prioritizing 
expenditures. 
7. 
The public 
sector needs 
a strong 
primary 
balance 
to 
bring 
down 
inflation, 
to 
narrow 
the 
large 
external 
current account 
deficit, and 
to 
meet debt 
servicing obligations. 
Within 
one 
week 
of 
taking 
office, 
the 
government 
implemented 
a 
set 
of 
corrective 
measures, 
described 
below, 
consistent 
with 
strengthening the 
primary 
balance 
of 
the 
nonfinancial 
public 
sector 
(NFPS) 
from 
4.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002 
to 
5.2 
percent 
in 
2003. 
The 
overall 
NFPS 
balance 
in 
2003 
is 
targeted 
to be US$509 
million, 
or 
1.9 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
resulting 
in 
a 
drop 
of 
the 
public 
sector debt 
ratio 
from 
59 
percent 
of 
GDP 
at 
end-2002 
to 
52 
percent 
by 
end-2003.

9. 
Revenues 
of 
the 
NFPS 
are 
programmed 
to 
increase 
by 
0.9 
percentage 
points to 
26.9 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2003. 
As 
a cornerstone 
of 
the adjustment 
effort, 
on 
January 
19, 
the prices 
for 
fuels 
were 
increased 
by 
an 
average 
of 
25 percent, 
yielding 
close 
to 
US$400 
million 
(1.5 
percent 
of 
GDP) 
in 
2003. 
This 
step 
was 
complemented 
by 
resolutions issued 
by 
COMEXI 
reversing 
selective  and 
highly 
distortionary 
import 
tariff 
cuts 
(for 
US$30 
million) 
that 
were 
implemented 
in 
the 
last 
few 
weeks 
of 
the 
outgoing 
administration. 
The 
government 
is 
also 
committed 
to 
reducing 
subsidies 
on 
government 
services, 
including 
in 
utility 
prices. 
By 
August, 
the 
government 
is 
also 
seeking 
approval 
of 
legislation 
to 
unify 
the 
public 
sector 
wage  structure, 
which 
is 
projected 
to yield 
US$20 
million 
in 
2003 
in 
additional 
social 
security 
revenues. 
Primary 
expenditures 
of 
the 
NFPS 
are 
projected 
to 
stabilize 
at 
21.7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2003. 
This 
reflects 
mainly 
the austerity 
decree 
issued 
by 
President 
Gutierrez 
on 
January 
22. 
In 
this 
decree, 
wage 
rates 
for 
regular 
civil 
servants 
were 
frozen 
for 
2003; 
overtime 
allowances were 
cut;  the  president's  salary 
was 
reduced 
by 
20 
percent; 
and 
the  salaries 
of 
government 
appointees 
with 
monthly 
earnings 
over 
US$l,OOO 
were 
lowered 
by 
10 
percent. 
Moreover, the 
number 
of 
positions 
that  can 
be 
filled 
by 
the 
new 
government 
was 
also 
reduced 
by 
10 
percent. 
Notwithstanding 
these  measures, 
in 
dollar 
terms, 
the 
NFPS 
wage 
bill 
will 
still 
increase 
by 
US$260 
million 
to 
US$2,251 
million 
because 
of 
the 
carryover 
from 
the 
large 
increases granted 
in 
2002, 
an increase 
in 
the 
14th 
salary 
imposed 
by 
congress 
in 
December 
2002, 
and 
normal 
promotions. 
10. 
The 
austerity 
decree 
also restrains spending 
on 
goods 
and 
services 
in 
the 
central 
government, 
including 
restrictions 
on 
official 
travel 
abroad, 
the 
use 
of 
vehicles 
and 
cell 
phones, 
and 
a 
prohibition 
on 
the purchase 
of 
new 
offices 
and 
furnishings. 
11. 
The 
government 
has 
reduced 
by 
some 
US$lOO 
million 
the budgetary expenditure allowance 
for 
Petroecuador. 
Spending 
on 
the social 
safety 
net 
will 
increase 
in 
2003. 
The 
cash 
transfer 
program 
to 
the 
poor 
(Bono 
Solidario) 
was 
increased 
from 
US$11.50 
to 
US$15.00 
per 
eligible 
person 
per 
month, 
to 
help them 
deal 
with 
the increase 
in 
fuels 
prices, 
and welfare 
assistance 
for 
the 
elderly 
poor 
was 
increased 
by 
US$5 
per 
person 
a 
month, 
effective 
January 
2003, 
at 
a 
combined 
cost 
of 
some 
US$60 
million. 
Pension 
benefits 
from 
the social security 
institute 
(IESS) 
were 
sharply 
eroded 
by 
the 
collapse 
of 
the 
currency 
in 
the 
crisis 
of 
1999. 
As 
a 
result,  they 
were increased 
substantially 
in 
2001-02, 
were 
raised 
again 
by 
25 percent 
in 
January 
2003, 
but 
they 
will 
not 
be increased 
further 
this 
year. 
To 
help 
cover 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
large 
pension 
increases, 
the 
ESS 
will 
suspend 
making 
loans 
to 
affiliates, 
thereby 
reducing 
lending 
operations 
from 
US$158 
million 
in 
2002 
to 
repayments 
of 
US$40 
million 
in 
2003. 
12. 
The 
financing 
requirements 
of 
the 
non-financial 
public 
sector 
in 
2003 
are 
projected 
to 
amount 
to 
nearly  US$2.0 
billion. 
The  main 
component 
is 
debt  amortization, 
which 
is 
projected 
to 
amount 
to 
US$1.2 
billion 
(including 
a 
US$29 
million 
debt 
reduction 
in 
the 
last 
quarter 
of 
the 
year 
from 
the 
new 
oil 
stabilization 
fund 
(FEIREP)). 
Also 
included 
are 
nonreschedulable 
external 
arrears 
(amounting 
to 
some 
US$lOO 
million), 
which 
will 
be 
cleared 
as 
a 
prior 
action under 
the 
program, 
and domestic 
arrears, 
estimated at  US$0.4 
billion 
that 
are 
also 
being 
cleared. 
The 
financing 
needs 
are 
programmed 
to be 
met 
from 
the 
fiscal 
surplus 
of 
US$0.5 
billion; 
rolling 
over 
some 
US$0.4 
billion 
of 
domestic 
debt 
falling 
due 
in 
the 
year; 
US$0.3 
billion 
in 
project 
financing; 
and 
with 
exceptional 
program 
fhancing 
of 
just 
over 
US$0.6 
billion 
(US$130 
million from 
the 
World 
Bank, 
US$lOO 
million from 
the 
IDB 
and 
the 
CAF 
each, 
US$160 
million from 
the 
Fund, 
and 
the  government 
is 
seeking 
cooperation 
of 
Paris 
Club 
and 
other 
official 
creditors 
to 
resolve intrayear 
cash 
flow 
pressures 
43 
Page  52
through 
US$l50 
million 
in 
external 
debt  rescheduling). 
With 
these 
amounts, 
the  2003 
program 
would 
be 
fully 
financed. 
Ecuador 
will 
not 
seek 
an 
oil-backed 
loan. 
13. 
The 
budget 
for 
2003  approved 
in 
congress 
before 
end-February, 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
program. 
The 
budget includes 
a freeze 
on 
wages 
and 
is 
based 
on 
an 
oil 
price 
assumption 
of 
US$18  per 
barrel 
for 
Ecuador 
mix. 
If 
realized 
petroleum 
revenues 
fall 
below 
the 
programmed 
level,  the government 
would 
fully 
compensate 
the 
shortfall 
with 
expenditure 
cuts. 
If 
petroleum 
revenues 
turn 
out 
higher 
than programmed, 
they 
will 
be used 
in 
full 
to 
build 
up 
central government 
deposits 
in 
the 
central 
bank 
(in 
the 
Fondo 
de 
Estabilizacibn 
Petrolero 
por 
Liquidar) or 
to 
lower 
the 
public 
debt. 
Any 
higher 
than programmed 
revenues 
for 
the social 
security 
system 
will 
also be 
saved, 
and 
used 
to 
increase 
its 
asset 
base. 
Finally, 
to 
protect 
budgetary 
revenue, the 
government 
has 
issued 
regulations 
to 
the 
new 
tourism 
law 
that prevent 
the 
opening 
of 
new 
tax 
loopholes. 
Structural 
Reforms 
14. 
While 
macroeconomic 
policies 
described  above 
address 
immediate 
fiscal 
needs, 
the 
government 
will 
also 
send 
several 
bills 
to 
congress 
this 
year 
to 
bolster 
the 
fiscal 
and 
structural 
outlook 
for 
2004 and the 
medium 
term. 
15. 
Before 
end-February 2003 
(a 
prior 
action 
under the program), 
the government 
will 
submit 
to 
congress, 
as 
urgent 
legislation, 
a 
reform 
of 
the customs 
administration. 
This 
reform 
aims 
to 
allow 
an 
overhaul 
of 
the 
administrative 
and personnel structure 
of 
the customs 
office, 
permit 
the 
SRI 
to 
upgrade 
the 
information 
systems 
in 
customs, 
and 
bring 
the  customs 
tax 
administration under 
the 
internal 
tax 
administration 
(SRI). 
The 
government believes that 
this 
reform 
will 
make 
a 
major contribution 
to 
reducing corruption 
m 
customs, 
and 
improve 
the 
collection 
of 
revenues. 
16. 
Before end-April 
2003, 
the 
government 
will 
submit 
to 
congress a 
bill 
for 
public 
sector wage 
unification 
and 
civil 
service 
reform 
(including 
amendments 
to 
the 
Ley 
de 
Servicio 
Civil 
y 
Carrera 
Administrativa). 
Under 
the 
wage 
unification, 
the 
various 
components 
of 
remuneration 
will 
be 
brought 
together 
in 
one salary 
statement, 
which 
will 
then 
be 
the 
new 
basis 
for 
the 
assessment 
of 
social 
security  contributions. 
The 
higher  social  security 
contributions 
will 
be 
withheld 
from 
the 
employees 
(phased 
m 
over 
four 
years) 
without 
increasing 
the 
public 
sector wage 
bill. 
The 
civil 
service 
reform 
will 
seek 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
number 
of 
public 
sector employees 
so 
that the 
central 
government 
nominal 
wage 
bill 
in 
the 
2004 
budget 
will 
be 
lower 
than that 
in 
the  2003  budget. 
The 
government 
has 
requested 
technical 
assistance 
and 
financial 
support 
(for 
severance 
payments) 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
the 
IDB 
for 
this 
reform. 
The 
government 
seeks 
congressional 
approval 
of 
this 
reform 
by 
end- 
August 
2003. 
17. 
Before 
end-August 
2003, 
the  government 
will 
submit 
to 
congress  a 
comprehensive  tax 
reform 
bill 
intended 
to 
allow 
for 
a 
more 
efficient 
allocation 
of 
public 
spending 
and 
to 
expand 
the tax 
base. 
The 
reform 
will 
include: 
(i) 
the 
elimination 
of 
revenue 
earmarking 
that 
is 
not 
mandated 
in 
the 
constitution; 
(ii) 
the 
elimination 
of 
tax 
exemptions; 
(iii) 
the 
removal 
of 
small 
taxes 
with 
low 
yields and 
high 
administrative 
costs ("nuisance  taxes"); 
(iv) 
an increase 
in 
vehicle 
tax  revenues;  (v)  a 
reduction 
in 
the  standard 
deduction 
(m'nimo 
imponible) 
for 
personal 
income 
taxes; 
and 
(vi) 
the 
closing 
of 
some 
tax loopholes 
that 
allow 
enterprises 
to 
deduct 
artificially 
inflated 
costs. 
The 
government 
seeks 
congressional 
approval 
of 
this 
reform 
by 
end-November 
2003.

The 
reforms 
described above 
will 
provide 
the 
basis 
to 
achieve an 
overall 
budget 
surplus 
on 
an 
enduring 
basis, 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
reducing 
the 
public 
sector debt. 
The 
new private 
sector 
oil 
pipeline 
(the  OCP) 
has 
the  capacity 
to 
more  than  double 
oil 
exports, 
which 
significantly 
boosts  the 
medium-term 
prospects 
for 
exports  and 
growth. 
However, 
this 
increase 
could 
also 
intensify 
the 
dependence 
on 
oil 
and 
Dutch 
disease 
problems 
in 
the 
economy, 
if 
the 
new 
oil 
revenues are 
not 
managed 
prudently. 
Therefore, 
in 
January 
2003, 
and 
as 
a 
prior 
action 
for 
the 
program, the 
government issued 
regulations 
to 
put 
in 
place 
the 
Fiscal 
Responsibility 
and 
Transparency 
Law 
that 
was 
adopted 
by 
congress 
in 
September 
2002. 
A 
key 
aspect 
of 
the 
legislation 
and 
its 
regulation 
is 
that 
the 
bulk 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
revenues 
accruing 
from 
the 
new 
pipeline 
will 
not 
be used 
to 
augment 
current 
spending 
but 
rather 
be 
placed 
in 
an 
oil 
stabilization 
fund 
(the 
FEIREP). 
Ten 
percent 
of 
the 
resources 
in 
the 
FEIREP 
are 
dedicated 
to 
social 
spending;  20  percent 
will 
be 
saved 
to 
help 
deal 
with 
contingencies,  such 
as 
a 
natural 
disaster 
or 
a 
sharp 
decline 
in 
oil 
prices; 
and 
70 
percent 
would 
be 
dedicated 
to 
debt 
buybacks 
(not 
for 
regularly 
scheduled 
budgetary 
amortizations). 
The 
new 
pipeline 
is 
expected 
to 
come 
on 
stream 
in 
the  last  quarter 
of 
2003. 
The 
government's 
medium 
term 
policy 
of 
fiscal 
surpluses, 
combined 
with 
the 
debt 
buyback 
capacity 
from 
the 
FEIREP, 
are 
projected 
to 
reduce the debt 
to 
GDP 
ratio 
from 
59 
percent 
at 
end 2002 
to 
below 
40 
percent 
by 
end-2006, 
I 
as 
stipulated 
in 
the 
Fiscal 
Responsibility 
and 
Transparency 
Law.

Strengthening competitiveness 
is 
essential 
for 
sustaining 
growth 
and preserving 
dollarization 
in 
Ecuador. 
Fiscal 
expenditures have 
driven 
up 
costs 
in 
the economy, 
and 
these 
outlays 
need 
to 
be controlled 
as 
described  above. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
productivity growth 
needs 
to 
be 
accelerated 
with 
structural  reforms. 
In 
this 
area, 
the 
government 
is 
implementing 
several 
measures 
in 
2003. 
The 
electricity 
distribution 
and 
telephone  companies 
(Pacifictel  and Andinatel) 
must 
be 
made 
more efficient. 
For 
this 
purpose, 
by 
end-June 
2003 the companies 
will 
be 
placed under 
private 
sector 
management 
of 
reputable 
international 
firms. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the subsidies 
to 
these 
enterprises need 
to be 
gradually 
eliminated. 
In 
January 2003, 
the 
suspension 
of 
the 
tariff 
increases 
was 
lifted 
by 
the 
regulatory 
agencies 
(Conelec 
and 
Conatel; 
see 
prior 
action 
item 
3) 
and 
tariffs 
are 
now 
being 
adjusted 
on 
a 
monthly 
basis 
until 
these 
reach 
levels 
matching 
economic 
costs. 
The 
World 
Bank 
and 
the 
IDB 
are 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
to 
establish, 
by 
end-June 
2003, 
the appropriate 
structure 
of 
tariffs, 
taking 
account 
of 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
collections. 
Petroleum 
sector. 
Before 
end-June 2003, 
and 
with 
assistance 
from 
international 
experts, 
the 
government 
will 
conduct 
an 
economic and environmental 
analysis 
and 
prepare an 
action 
plan 
and 
time 
table 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
production, 
distribution, 
and 
sale 
of 
petroleum 
and 
its 
derivatives. 
Improvements 
in 
these 
areas 
could 
produce 
substantial 
savings 
for 
the 
economy. 
To 
provide 
the 
citizens 
with 
better 
information on 
public 
sector operations, 
the 
government 
will 
improve public 
sector 
disclosure 
and 
transparency. 
The 
monthly fiscal 
spreadsheets 
used 
to 
frame 
the 
program 
and 
follow 
its 
implementation 
will 
be 
published 
on 
the web 
pages 
of 
the 
ministry 
of 
economy 
(revenue 
and 
expenditure 
data) 
and 
the Central 
Bank 
of 
Ecuador 
(debt 
and 
arrears 
data), 
PetroEcuador, 
TAME 
(the  airline), 
and 
all 
enterprises 
in 
the 
Solidarity 
Fund, 
will 
publish 
on 
the 
web their 
annual 
reports 
approved 
by 
the Boards 
of 
Directors, beginning 
with 
the

before 
April

and 
their

end-September

These 
reports 
will 
contain 
the companies'

Efforts to 
strengthen 
the social security 
system 
will 
continue. 
With 
technical 
assistance 
from 
international 
institutions, 
the 
government 
will 
assess 
the operating 
procedures 
and actuarial 
balances 
of 
the three 
social security 
funds 
(IESS, 
ISFA, 
ISPOL) 
by 
end-September 2003. 
This 
assessment 
is 
intended 
to 
result 
in 
a 
reform 
strategy 
aimed 
at 
ensuring 
a reasonable 
and 
reliable 
income 
for 
retirees 
on 
a sustainable 
basis, 
including 
by 
eliminating 
the 
actuarial 
deficits 
and 
minimizing 
transfers 
from 
the central 
government. 
The 
government 
wants 
to 
target 
the 
cooking 
gas 
subsidy 
more 
equitably. 
The 
current large 
subsidy 
is 
an 
important distortion 
in 
the 
economy, gives 
rise 
to 
smuggling 
and corruption, 
and benefits 
disproportionately 
the 
higher income 
groups 
in 
society. 
In 
the 
first 
semester, 
the 
government 
will 
undertake 
a 
project, 
with 
help 
from 
the 
IDB, 
to improve 
the 
database 
of 
the 
Solidarity 
Bonus 
to 
focus 
better 
the 
cash assistance 
on 
the 
truly 
poor, 
and remove 
the 
subsidy 
in 
the 
cooking 
gas 
price. 
These 
steps 
are 
programmed 
to 
yield 
US$ 
40 
million 
(net) 
in 
2003. 
Funding 
prospects 
to 
finance 
priority 
social programs have 
been 
conditioned 
by 
the 
behavior 
of 
macroeconomic 
variables, 
in 
such a 
way 
that the greater 
or 
lesser 
availability 
of 
funds 
has 
been 
basically 
linked 
to 
economic 
growth 
trends, 
which 
have 
influenced 
the 
expenditure 
capacity 
of 
the 
Government and 
thus 
the coverage 
offered 
by 
these 
programs. 
This 
means 
that 
social 
investments 
are 
characterized 
by 
their 
procyclic 
nature. 
In 
spite 
of 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
recent 
years, 
funds 
earmarked 
for 
the 
social 
sector 
-which 
grew 
from 
US$ 
690 
million 
in 
2000 
to 
US$ 
1.54 
billion 
in 
2003, 
representing 
4.3% 
and 
7.4% 
of 
the 
GDP 
respectively, 
are 
still 
far 
below 
the average 
for Latin 
America, 
which 
for 
1998-1999 
was 13.1%. 
In 
addition,  performance  levels have 
been 
conditioned 
to 
the transfers 
of 
funds 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy 
and Finance 
to 
social 
sector 
agencies, 
an issue 
that 
has 
hampered the 
advance towards 
the 
achievement 
of 
expected 
goals 
and objectives. 
In 
2002, 
the performance levels 
of 
the 
social budget 
was 
91 
% 
(Fiscal 
Funds) 
while.transfers 
.reached 
86%; 
for 
this 
reason, 
payment 
obligations 
were generated 
for 
the 
5% 
differential. 
The 
current 
Administration 
proposes 
to 
isolate the 
funds 
destined 
for 
social 
investment 
from 
the fluctuations 
of 
the 
general budget, 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
an 
effective 
use thereof. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
Administration 
is 
committed 
to 
maintain or 
increase the amounts 
destined 
to 
education, 
health 
and 
social 
welfare 
sectors 
during 
the 
2003-2006 period, 
which 
in 
2002 
represented 
2.5%; 
1.3%, 
and 
1.4 
% 
of 
the 
GDP 
respectively. 
In 
2003 
the 
budget 
for 
social 
welfare, 
health 
and 
education, 
will 
be 
equal 
or higher 
than 2002 
as 
a 
GDP 
percentage.

Likewise, 
priority 
programs that 
will 
be preserved have been redefined, 
placing 
emphasis 
on 
programs 
that 
provide 
subsidies 
both 
in 
cash 
or 
in 
kind, 
in 
addition 
to 
primary 
health 
care 
programs, 
which 
have a budget 
of 
US$ 
290 
million 
and 
a 
relative 
share 
of 
19% 
of 
the 
total 
budget 
for 
the 
social 
sector. 
The 
priority

by 
the 
Ministry

The 
Social 
Assistance Sector 
33.

36. 
The 
social 
safety 
net 
in 
Ecuador 
has 
evolved 
significantly 
over 
the 
past 
few 
years, 
shifting 
away 
from 
food 
handouts 
towards 
direct 
cash transfers. 
Until 
recently, 
social 
assistance 
was 
dominated 
by 
the 
delivery 
of 
food 
baskets 
and 
supplemental 
feeding 
programs. 
Program 
evaluations 
and 
international 
experience 
showed 
that 
these 
programs 
are 
relatively costly 
and  inefficient, 
with 
the 
logistics 
of 
procuring, 
transporting, 
storing, 
managing, 
and 
delivering 
food 
all 
adding 
significantly 
to 
their 
cost. 
Ecuador 
has 
several 
social 
assistance 
programs, 
including 
the 
Solidarity 
Bonus 
("Bono 
Solidario"), 
student  scholarships 
("Beca 
Escolar"), 
school 
lunch 
program 
("Programa 
de 
Alimentacidn 
Escolar"), 
and 
day care centers 
for 
children. 
However, 
these 
programs 
do 
not 
constitute 
a 
true social 
safety system 
or 
net, 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
coordination and overlapping 
of 
both 
their 
objectives and 
the targeted 
population. 
Although 
these 
programs 
seek 
to 
provide 
assistance 
to 
the most vulnerable population, they 
fail 
to 
respond 
to 
a 
comprehensive 
vision. 
Most 
programs 
lack 
adequate 
monitoring 
and 
follow-up 
and, 
especially, 
impact 
assessments. 
The 
most important 
programs 
as 
concerns coverage and 
budget 
are 
"Bono Solidario" and 
"Program 
a de 
Alimentacidn 
Escolar". Other programs 
have 
low 
coverage. 
The 
"Bono  Solidario" 
appeared 
in 
late  1998 
as 
a 
conditioned 
monetary  compensation 
mechanism 
for 
the 
poor 
population, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
elimination 
of 
the 
subsidy 
on 
electrical 
power. 
With 
the 
financial 
crisis 
of 
1999 
this 
program 
gradually 
became 
the 
axis 
of 
social 
assistance 
in 
the 
country. The 
"Bono 
Solidario" 
is 
a 
program 
that benefits 
the 
poor, 
but 
it 
has 
funding 
problems. 
Currently 
it 
assists 
close 
to 
1.3 
million 
people, 
most 
of 
which 
are 
mothers 
of 
minor 
children. 
The 
social 
safety 
net 
has 
no 
homogeneous 
targeting 
criteria: 
for 
example, 
it 
is 
estimated that 
18% 
of 
the 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
"Bono  Solidario"  program 
are 
not  poor 
(inclusion 
of 
population 
not 
corresponding 
to 
the target group). 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
21% 
of 
the 
program's 
P 
47 
Page  56
37. 
target 
population 
has 
been 
excluded  (exclusion 
of 
population 
corresponding 
to 
the target 
group). 
This 
is 
a widespread 
problem 
affecting 
social 
programs and 
is 
caused 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
technical 
tool 
that 
would 
allow 
to 
target 
beneficiaries 
on 
an 
individual 
basis. 
Given 
the  successful  experience 
of 
conditioned 
monetary  transfer 
programs 
such 
as 
"Oportunidades" 
in 
Mexico 
and 
"Bolsa 
Escola" 
in 
Brazil, 
the 
Ecuadorian Government 
will 
unify 
the 
"Bono Solidario" 
and de 
"Beca Escolar" 
in 
one 
new 
program, 
called 
the 
Human 
Development 
Bonus 
("Bono 
de 
Desarrollo 
Humano", 
BDH). 
This 
program 
will 
consist 
in 
monetary 
allocations, 
conditioned 
to 
school 
attendance 
and 
to 
periodic health 
checkups 
of 
children 
of 
mothers 
who 
benefit 
from 
the 
"Bono 
Solidario", 
as 
well 
as 
of 
those 
registered 
in 
the 
Project to 
Select 
Social Program 
Beneficiaries (SELBEN),  that 
is, 
families 
included 
in 
the 
, 
two 
first 
quintiles 
according 
to 
the social 
assistance 
index 
developed 
by 
SELBEN. 
The 
BDH 
will 
be create 
in 
the 
last 
days 
of 
April 
2003. 
38. 
The 
refocusing 
of 
the 
BDH 
will 
be 
executed 
within 
one 
year, 
starting 
in 
June 
2003, 
and 
will 
include 
approximately 
250,000 
households. 
39. 
An 
initiative 
to 
design 
an 
elderly 
adults 
protection 
strategy 
will 
be 
undertake 
by 
the 
Government. 
A 
interinstitutional 
agreement 
will 
create a 
work 
group 
responsible 
to define 
technical, 
financial, 
legal 
framework 
and 
time 
needs 
to 
achieve 
this 
goal, 
until 
April 
25 
2003. 
The 
main 
objective 
is 
to 
achieve the 
implementation 
of 
a 
legal 
framework, 
until 
May 
2005, 
to 
allow 
the 
expanding 
of 
the 
coverage, 
achieve 
fiscal 
sustainability 
and 
efficient 
contingent 
response, 
in 
the 
long 
term. 
40. 
The 
key 
challenges 
facing 
the 
social 
safety 
net include:  expanding  programs, 
improving 
monitoring 
and  evaluation, 
both 
of 
individual 
programs 
and 
of 
the  broader 
safety  net, 
rationalizing 
and 
consolidating 
the  safety 
net 
and 
improving 
equity  through 
stronger 
targeting 
and 
an 
increased focus. 
The 
Ecuadorian Government 
is 
committed 
to 
face 
these 
challenges, 
specially 
by 
expanding 
criteria 
to 
reach 
new 
target 
populations, 
bringing 
in 
those 
who 
were 
excluded. 
Food 
and 
Nutrition 
41. 
Although 
Ecuadorian  social 
assistance 
policies 
have 
launched 
a  process 
to 
strengthen 
mechanisms that 
will allow 
to 
increase 
their 
effectiveness, 
shifting 
from 
food 
handouts 
towards  direct 
cash  transfers, 
it 
is 
also 
necessary 
to  implement 
adjustments 
to 
current 
programs 
of 
transfers 
in 
kind 
in 
order 
to 
optimize 
their 
actual 
impact. 
42. 
The 
school 
food program 
("Programa 
de 
Alimentaci6n 
Escolar") 
hands 
out 
food 
supplements 
to 
boys 
and 
girls 
who 
attend 
public 
schools 
in 
the 
country. 
This 
is 
also a 
program 
targeted 
for 
the 
poor 
but, 
similarly to 
the 
Solidarity 
Bonus, 
it 
has 
focalization 
problems. 
This 
program 
has 
significantly 
expanded 
in 
recent 
years 
and 
has 
faced problems 
related 
to 
the 
diversion 
of 
funds. 
Currently, 
most recipient 
children 
eat 
both 
breakfast 
and 
lunch 
at 
school. 
43. 
An 
assessment 
of 
the 
social 
safety 
net 
will 
provide 
the 
information 
required 
to 
improve 
the 
rationalization 
and 
coordination 
of 
this 
program. 
It 
will 
also 
help bridge 
the 
gaps 
and 
overlapping 
of 
assistance 
provided to 
some 
beneficiaries, 
as 
is 
currently 
the 
case 
in 
some 
programs. 
This 
will 
allow 
to 
collect more 
consistent selection 
criteria, 
definitions 
of 
target 
groups 
and a 
dimensioning 
of 
funds 
transfers. 
A 
national 
inventory 
and 
georeferentiation 
of 
social 
programs 
will 
also be 
useful 
instruments 
to 
adapt 
social 
policies.

44. 
The 
development 
of 
Poverty 
Maps 
will 
support 
the 
distribution 
and 
will 
complement 
the 
individual 
and household 
selection 
criteria,  increasing 
the 
impact 
on 
poverty. 
In 
addition, 
improving 
the 
targeting 
of 
programs 
for 
small 
children 
and 
pregnant 
and breast-feeding 
women  -key 
vulnerable 
groups, 
given their  unique 
nutritional 
needs, 
also  increases the 
impact 
on 
poverty. Clear criteria 
and 
strategies 
for 
the 
exclusion 
of 
certain beneficiaries 
must 
be 
used 
in 
order 
to 
lower 
their 
dependence 
on 
transfers, 
as 
well 
as 
government 
strategies, 
to 
alleviate poverty and 
improve 
the 
living 
condition 
of 
the families, 
achieve 
it's 
goals. 
45. 
Based 
on 
the 
experience gathered 
in 
the 
execution 
of 
feeding 
and 
nutrition 
programs 
in 
Ecuador, the 
political 
decision 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
Basic 
Fight 
Against 
Poverty Agenda 
("Agenda 
BAsica de 
Lucha 
contra 
la 
Pobreza") 
is 
a 
combined 
strategy that 
includes 
the 
delivery 
of 
economic 
subsidies and the  targeted 
delivery 
of 
food 
to 
the  most  vulnerable 
population 
included 
in 
the 
first 
two 
poverty quintiles. 
46. 
The 
National Food 
and 
Nutrition 
Program 
-PA"- 
will 
continue 
delivering 
food 
specifically 
designed 
and 
formulated 
for 
pregnant women, 
breastfeeding mothers 
and 
children 
under 
2, 
which 
is 
the  best 
way  to 
ensure 
the 
adequate 
nutrition 
of 
these 
vulnerable 
groups. 
Experiences 
in 
Mexico, Chile 
and studies made 
by 
the 
PAHO 
reveal 
that the 
delivery 
of 
this 
type 
of 
food, 
combined 
with 
a 
nutritional 
education 
process, 
can 
generate 
positive 
impacts. 
47. 
48. 
49. 
The 
care 
program 
for 
children 
between 
2 
and 
5 
years 
of 
age 
and 
for 
elderly  non- 
institutionalized 
adults 
will 
operate 
via 
transfers 
of 
cash 
to 
their families 
or 
via 
an increase 
in 
the 
BDH 
(Human  Development 
Bonus), 
combined 
with 
a 
strong 
nutritional 
education 
program 
that 
will 
involve 
the 
community. 
The 
School 
Food 
Program 
-PAE- 
("Programa 
de 
Alimentacih 
Escolar") 
has 
had 
negative 
results 
for 
many 
years, 
due 
to 
the 
diversion 
of 
funds 
both 
in 
the 
handling 
of 
food 
and 
in 
the 
money 
given 
to 
schools 
and 
to 
groups 
of 
parents. 
The 
Agenda 
has 
established 
that 
the 
first 
steps 
will 
be 
to 
analyze and 
improve 
current 
rations 
-which 
include 
breakfast 
and 
lunch 
at 
school; 
and 
to 
improve 
both 
the 
procurement  system 
(including 
local 
purchases) 
and 
the 
timely 
distribution 
of 
food 
to 
schools. 
The 
transfer 
of 
the 
education 
bonus encourages 
school 
attendance 
by 
children, 
while 
the 
food 
component reinforces 
their 
performance 
in 
school. 
The 
school 
food 
program 
will 
target parishes 
in 
the 
country 
included 
in 
the 
first 
two 
quintiles 
determined 
by 
the 
poverty 
map, 
on 
the  basis 
of 
unmet 
basic 
needs 
criteria. 
Children 
attending 
schools 
located 
in 
the 
parishes 
of 
the 
first 
quintile 
will 
eat 
both 
breakfast 
and 
lunch 
at 
school. 
Children 
attending 
schools 
in 
the  parishes 
of 
the 
second 
quintile 
will 
only 
get 
breakfast. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
program 
will 
gradually 
reduce the coverage 
given 
to 
higher 
quintiles. 
The Health 
Sector 
50. 
The 
Ecuadorian 
health 
sector 
is 
characterized 
by 
morbi-mortality 
rates 
which 
place 
traditional 
health 
care 
problems at the 
top 
of 
the 
list. 
Also, chronic 
diseases 
and accident 
and 
violence 
related problems 
are 
in 
the 
increase. 
This 
corresponds 
to 
a 
profile 
that 
is 
typical 
of 
the 
modern 
dynamics 
of 
developing 
economies. 
51. 
The 
health 
system 
is 
not 
fully 
organized, 
is 
highly 
inequitable,  fragmented 
and 
inefficient. 
For 
these 
reasons, 
it 
is 
considered that 
approximately 
30% 
of 
the 
Ecuadorian 
population 
has 
no 
access 
to 
health 
care 
coverage, 
while 
77% 
of 
all 
Ecuadorians 
are 
not 
covered 
by 
any 
type 
49 
Page  58
of 
insurance whatsoever. 
At 
present, 
the 
public 
health 
system 
has 
deteriorated considerably, 
making 
the 
need 
to reform 
the 
sector 
even 
more 
urgent. 
52. 
The 
process 
to reform 
the 
health 
sector began 
in 
the 
90s. 
The 
basic 
principles 
of 
the 
reform 
proposal  include 
increasing  health 
care 
coverage, 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
services, 
separating 
delivery, 
control 
and 
funding 
services, 
providing 
insurance coverage 
to 
the 
entire 
Ecuadorian 
population, 
shifting 
towards a 
model 
of 
decentralized 
quality health 
care, 
raising 
the  professional 
status 
of 
health 
care 
practitioners  and 
providing 
training 
to 
the 
human 
resources 
of 
the 
sector. 
53. 
The 
process 
to implement 
this 
reform 
in 
Ecuador 
has 
resulted 
in 
the development 
of 
a 
dense 
and 
in 
many 
cases 
ambiguous 
legal 
framework, 
with 
loopholes 
that  have 
hindered 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
objectives contained 
in 
the 
reform. 
This 
legal 
framework 
includes 
the 
law 
of 
decentralization 
and 
social 
participation 
-"Ley 
de 
descentralizacidn  y 
participacidn 
social". 
(1997), 
the 
law 
to 
amend 
the 
previous 
law 
on 
free 
maternity 
and 
child 
care 
-" 
Ley 
reformatoria 
de 
maternidad 
gratuita 
y 
atencidn 
a 
la 
infancia"- 
(1998), 
the 
Political 
Constitution 
of 
Ecuador 
(1998), 
the 
Social 
Security 
Law 
-"Ley 
de 
Seguridad 
Social"- 
(2001) 
and 
the 
National Health 
System 
Law 
-"Ley 
del 
Sistema 
Nacional 
de 
Sa1ud"- 
(2002), 
as 
well 
as 
the 
amendment 
of 
the 
Health 
Code 
(a process 
currently 
underway 
in 
Congress). 
The 
new 
legal 
framework 
has 
not 
been 
sufficiently 
assimilated 
inside 
the 
sector, 
generating tension 
with 
both 
existing traditional 
programs and 
new 
proposals that are 
being 
developed. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
new 
regulations 
are 
not 
ready 
and 
there are 
gaps 
that 
hamper 
the 
adequate 
coordination 
of 
actions and the 
possibility 
of 
developing 
a 
national health 
system. 
54. 
The 
most important 
proposals 
in 
this 
area 
relate 
to 
decentralization  and 
universal 
health 
insurance. 
Concerning 
decentralization, 
despite 
advances 
in 
legal 
procedures 
and 
some 
successful  experiences 
at 
local 
level, 
it 
is 
experiencing 
substantial 
contradictions 
and 
currently 
it 
is 
yet 
to 
be 
fully 
implemented. 
As 
for 
the establishment 
of 
a 
universal 
insurance 
system, 
it 
should 
be noted 
that 
this 
proposal 
has 
been 
around 
for 
many 
years. 
Currently 
it 
is 
the 
Central 
Government's 
most 
important 
proposal 
for 
the 
health 
care sector. 
This 
proposal 
provides 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
national health 
system 
that 
would allow  to 
extend 
health 
care 
and 
insurance coverage 
to 
the 
entire 
population, 
to 
rationalize 
resources 
and 
optimize 
their 
use, 
and 
in 
general, 
to 
have 
a 
positive 
impact 
on 
the 
health 
of 
the 
Ecuadorian 
population. 
55. 
With 
respect 
to  Universal 
Insurance, 
an 
international 
work 
group 
will 
be 
established, 
presided 
by 
the 
Vice-presidency 
of 
the Republic, 
to 
ensure 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
goals 
established 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
agreements reached 
within 
the 
sector. 
56. 
An 
initiative to 
extend 
insurance coverage consists 
in 
including 
spouses 
and 
children 
under 
6 
in 
the 
insurance coverage 
provided 
by 
the 
IESS. 
This 
process 
is 
already 
under 
way 
inside 
the 
institution, 
and 
the 
studies 
required 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
this 
measure 
have  been 
completed. 
57. 
Advances 
have also been made 
in 
the 
coordination 
of 
services 
provided 
under 
the 
Law 
of 
Free 
Maternity 
Care 
("Ley 
de 
Maternidad 
Gratuita", 
LMG) 
and 
the 
Rural 
Social Security 
System 
("Seguro 
Social 
Campesino", 
SCC). 
In 
this 
way, 
an  agreement 
will 
be 
signed 
between 
IESS-SSC 
and 
Health 
Ministry-LMG 
to 
improve 
the extend 
of 
insurace 
coverage, 
until 
April 
25 
2003.

58. 
On 
the other 
hand, 
the need 
to 
include 
accountability 
process 
in 
procedures 
related 
to 
the 
Law 
of 
Free 
Maternity 
Care 
and the 
Rural 
Social Security System 
has 
been 
identified. 
Work 
is 
also 
being 
carried out to 
develop 
strategies 
aimed 
at 
a 
better 
handling 
of 
intercultural 
aspects 
related 
to 
the 
services 
provided 
under the 
Law 
of 
Free 
Maternity 
Care. 
59. 
Work 
is 
also 
being 
done 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
a Guaranteed 
Set 
of 
Services, 
in 
the 
coordination 
and 
integration 
of 
existing 
systems, 
and 
studies are 
being 
made 
to dimension 
the operational 
aspects 
of 
the 
reform. The 
development 
of 
crossed 
subsidy 
mechanisms 
has 
been 
proposed 
to 
optimize 
the 
selling 
and purchasing 
of 
health 
services. 
60. 
A 
proposal 
has 
been  made 
to 
rationalize 
the 
legal 
framework 
for 
the 
acquisition 
and 
distribution 
of 
essential 
and 
generic medicine. 
61. 
Finally, 
a 
process 
has 
been 
launched 
to 
separate 
health 
service 
delivery 
from 
health 
service 
financing, through 
service 
delivery 
units. 
The 
Education 
Sector 
62. 
The 
Constitution 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Ecuador, 
passed 
in 
1998, guarantees 
the 
universal 
right 
of 
all 
Ecuadorian citizens 
to  literacy 
and 
basic education. 
The 
government, 
through 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
is 
interested 
in 
bringing 
this 
to 
fruition. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
Ministry 
will 
foster 
two 
extensive 
initiatives. 
First, 
a 
National 
effort 
to 
encourage 
reading and 
writing 
in 
Ecuador 
("Minga Nacional 
por 
un 
Ecuador 
que 
Lee 
y Escribe"), 
with 
the 
main 
objectives 
of 
alphabetizing 
youngsters 
and 
adults, 
strengthening  school 
literacy 
in 
the 
early 
years, 
promoting 
reading 
and 
writing 
among  children, 
young people 
and 
adults, 
and fostering 
reading 
and 
writing 
among 
teachers. 
Second, 
the 
Social Education Contract  ("Contrato 
Social 
por 
la 
Educacih"), 
with 
the 
ultimate goal 
of 
ensuring 
10 
years 
of 
basic 
quality 
education 
for 
all 
Ecuadorian 
men and 
women, 
and 
adopting 
quality 
standards 
in 
education, 
taking 
into 
account the 
ethnical 
and 
cultural 
diversity 
of 
the 
country. 
It 
also includes 
training 
in 
ethical, 
moral 
and 
civic 
values. 
The 
two 
initiatives, 
and especially 
the second 
one, 
were 
proposed 
by 
the 
population 
itself 
and 
have the 
support 
and 
participation 
of 
broad 
sectors 
of 
Ecuadorian 
society. 
63. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Education and 
Culture 
of 
Ecuador 
(MEC) 
has 
a 
dysfunctional, 
centralized 
and 
bureaucratic 
structure. Seeing 
this, 
the 
Ecuadorian 
Government 
has 
a 
clear 
political 
will 
to 
advance 
in 
a  process 
of 
organic 
restructuring aimed 
at 
rationalizing 
strategic  sector 
processes. 
64. 
In 
addition, 
the  system 
devised 
to 
allocate 
resources 
to 
elementary 
and 
high 
schools 
is 
inequitable. 
In 
view 
of 
this, 
the Government 
is 
interested 
in 
reforming 
this 
system, 
taking 
into 
account 
positive discrimination 
criteria, 
including 
density 
of 
school-aged 
population, 
rural 
population, 
intercultural 
aspects, 
vulnerability, and 
gender. 
65. 
The 
government 
identify 
as 
a 
political 
objective 
to 
reduce the 
payment 
delay 
in 
teacher's 
salaries, 
staring 
from 
the 
poorest 
and 
less 
educational 
develop provinces. 
Currently, 
MEC 
and 
MEF 
are 
working to 
define 
a strategy 
to 
reduce the delay 
through 
reform 
process 
link 
to 
improve 
efficiency 
and 
transparency. 
66. 
Another 
significant 
problem affecting 
the 
MEC 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
reliable 
information 
system 
about the human 
resources 
working 
in 
the 
sector. 
Accordingly, 
the 
National 
Government 
is 
P 
51 
Page  60
keen 
in 
developing 
a 
reliable 
information 
system about the 
human 
resources 
of 
the 
Ministry 
and 
in 
purging 
its 
teacher 
roster. 
67. 
Finally, 
another 
current 
need 
of 
the 
MEC 
is 
to 
have 
an 
integrated and 
efficient information 
and  communications 
system 
to 
facilitate 
management 
processes. 
There 
is 
scattered 
and 
chaotic 
information 
that 
must 
be 
unified 
and 
centralized 
so 
that 
it 
can be 
used 
to 
take 
timely 
decisions 
and 
to 
ensure 
an 
efficient 
administration. 
The 
MEC 
is 
keen 
in 
redressing 
this 
situation 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
a  system 
and 
a  strategy 
of 
information 
and 
communication 
that 
will 
integrate the 
various 
existing 
systems, 
giving 
them 
coherence 
and 
making 
them useful for 
administrative 
purposes. 
Transparency 
and 
Governance 
68. 
Currently 
the Government 
is 
developing 
the 
methodology 
and 
the 
timetable 
that 
will 
serve 
to 
define 
the 
baseline that 
win 
be 
used 
to 
assess 
the 
impacts 
of 
the 
BDH. 
The 
selection 
of 
the 
firm 
for 
undertake 
this 
baseline 
will 
be 
done 
until 
April 
25. 
69.

on

Methodology 
for 
the 
use 
of 
the  Poverty 
Map 
in 
the 
geographic 
targeting 
of 
social 
assistance 
programs 
The 
updated 
poverty map 
-using 
data 
from 
the 
2001 
census 
and the 1999 
Household 
Survey- 
is 
being 
developed 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
will 
be ready 
for 
use 
by 
the 
end 
of 
May 
2003. 
The 
Secretaria Tkcnica 
del 
Frente Social 
has 
committed 
to 
use 
the 
map 
to 
target 
social 
assistance 
programs 
using 
a geographic 
criterion 
(see 
part 
A 
of 
this Annex). 
To 
that 
end 
it 
was 
agreed that: 
1) 
The 
totality 
of 
the 
parroquias 
in 
the 
country 
will 
be 
sorted 
by 
poverty 
level, 
using 
a 
severity 
index 
produced 
with 
the 
poverty 
map. 
2) 
Quintiles 
will 
be 
calculated  according 
to 
the 
population 
living 
in 
each 
of 
the 
parroquias 
and  a 
threshold 
level 
will 
be 
determined 
-in 
agreement 
with 
the 
government- 
that 
will 
separate 
the 
parroquias 
that 
will 
receive  social 
assistance 
from 
those 
that 
will 
not. 
3) 
For 
each 
program 
funds 
will 
be 
allocated 
to 
the 
parroquias 
below 
the threshold level, 
using 
a 
formula 
based 
on 
the severity 
of 
the 
poverty 
indicator 
-the 
precise 
formula 
has 
to be 
agreed 
upon 
with 
the 
government. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
PAE 
and 
the 
ORI, 
the government, 
through 
the 
Secretaria Tkcnica 
del 
Frente 
Social, 
will 
have 
to 
determine 
a 
targeting 
goal, 
like 
the percentage 
of 
the 
total 
budget 
assigned 
to 
the 
parroquias 
in 
the 
first 
quintile, 
second 
quintile, 
and 
so 
on 
by 
year 
2005, 
and 
an 
intermediate 
goal 
for 
2004. 
These 
goals 
will 
be 
determined before 
May 
2003 once 
the 
baseline 
for 
the 
targeting 
of 
these 
two 
programs 
is 
established 
using 
the 
2001 
map 
of 
unsatisfied 
basic 
needs.

The 
first 
operation, 
but 
most

of 
the program, 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
a

of 
which 
are 
already 
under preparation. 
Some 
of 
these 
studies are 
included 
in 
the 
Policy Actions 
that the government 
has 
committed 
to 
implement 
as 
part 
of 
the program. 
Others are pieces 
of 
sector 
work 
being 
funded and 
implemented 
by 
the

THE 
EDUCATIONAL 
SYSTEM 
IN 
ECUADOR, 
ISSUES 
AND 
OPTION 
FOR 
CHANGE. 
Ecuador 
has 
a 
complex institutional 
system 
(see 
synopsis 
1). 
several 
plans and 
initiatives 
have 
been 
developed 
during 
the 
1990s 
and 
in 
the 
past 
few 
years 
(see 
synopsis 
2). 
yet 
many 
challenges 
still 
face the 
educational 
sector 
in 
Ecuador. 
The 
principal 
challenges 
facing 
this 
sector are 
described 
below: 
Limited 
Access 
to 
Education 
and 
Inequities. 
Considerable 
discrepancies 
and inequities 
are 
seen 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
services 
when 
comparing 
income 
quintiles 
or 
urban population 
as 
a 
whole to 
rural 
and indigenous populations. 
While 
the 
population 
of 
the poorest 
quintile 
in 
rural 
areas 
has less 
than 
4 
years 
of 
schooling, the 
population 
of 
the 
wealthiest 
quintile 
in 
urban 
areas 
has 
more 
than 
12 
years 
of 
schooling. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
Living 
Conditions 
Survey 
of 
1999 
indicate 
that the 
indigenous 
population 
over 
the 
age 
of 
24 
living 
in 
the 
rural 
highland 
areas has 
an average 
of 
2.4 years 
of 
schooling, 
compared 
to 
5 
years 
of 
schooling 
for 
the 
rural 
non-indigenous 
population 
in 
the 
same areas 
and 
7.6 
years 
of 
schooling 
on 
a 
national level. 
In 
1999 
the 
net 
school 
enrollment 
rate 
for 
basic 
middle 
school education among 
the poorest 
quintile 
of 
the 
population 
was 19 
percent, 
while for 
specialized 
high 
school 
this 
figure 
was 
11 
percent. 
Among 
the 
wealthiest 
quintile 
of 
the 
population, 
these 
rates 
were 
80 
percent 
and 
62 
percent, 
respectively. 
Inequities 
are 
also 
reflected 
in 
higher 
education, 
as 
only 
2 percent 
of 
the 
population 
among the 
poorest 
quintile 
has 
access 
to 
higher 
education, 
as 
compared 
to 
38 
percent 
among the wealthiest 
quintile. 
A 
summary 
is 
presented 
below 
of 
this situation 
as 
seen 
in 
early- 
childhood 
education, pre-school, elementary, 
secondary, 
and 
higher 
education. 
Early-childhood 
education. 
The supply 
of 
early-childhood 
education 
is 
very 
limited. 
Only 
7.3 
percent 
of 
children 
between 
0 
and 4 
years 
of 
age 
in 
the three poorest 
quintiles 
of 
the 
population 
have 
access 
to 
these 
services. 
It 
is 
estimated that 
out 
of 
a target 
population 
of 
close 
to 
1.2 
million 
children, 
only 
97,000 
are serviced 
by 
the 
two 
national 
programs. 
There 
is 
no 
national 
policy 
or 
strategy 
that 
addresses 
this 
group 
of 
children. 
Pre-school education. 
This 
level, 
which 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the mandatory 
ten- 
year 
cycle 
(basic education), covers 
only 
half 
of 
children 
who 
are 
age 
five. 
Only 42 
percent 
of 
children 
among 
the poorest 
quintile 
have 
access 
to 
pre-school 
education, 
as 
compared 
to 
86 
percent 
among 
the 
wealthiest 
quintile. 
Rural 
enrollments 
at 
this 
level 
account 
for 
only 22 
percent 
of 
the total, despite 
the 
fact 
that the 
number 
of 
children 
in 
rural 
areas 
represents 
44 
percent 
of 
all 
children 
between 
four 
and 
five 
years 
of 
age. 
Net 
enrollment 
at 
this 
level 
(33 percent) 
for 
children 
between 
4 
and 
5 
years 
of 
age 
is 
very 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
other countries 
of 
the 
region 
with 
similar 
income. 
Elementary 
school 
education. 
The 
majority 
of 
children 
in 
urban 
and 
rural 
areas 
have 
access 
to 
elementary school 
education. 
In 
1999, 
net 
enrollment 
was 
90 
percent 
and 
gross 
enrollment 
was 
109 percent, 
demonstrating 
high 
coverage. 
Yet 
a 
significant 
number 
of 
students 
were either 
younger, or, 
as 
happens 
more 
often, 
older 
than 
what 
was 
expected 
for 
this 
cycle. 
According 
to 
a 
study 
conducted 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
(2000), at 
age 
6, 
only 
65 percent 
and 
78.6 
percent 
of 
children 
from 
the 
two 
lowest income 
quintiles, respectively, were 
enrolled 
in 
school, 
while 
98.8 percent 
of 
children 
from 
the 
wealthiest 
quintile 
were enrolled. 
At 
age 
7, 
children 
from 
the 
poorest 
quintile 
were 
the 
only 
ones 
with 
late-enrollment problems 
(82.9 percent are enrolled), 
and 
at 
age 
8, 
the 
enrollment 
rate 
was 
92.5 percent. 
Another 
part 
of 
the 
same 
study 
indicated 
that 
delayed 
enrollment 
age 
was 
principally 
a 
problem 
in 
rural 
areas, 
where, 
at 
age 
6, 
slightly 
more 
than 
70 
percent 
of 
children 
were 
enrolled, 
while 
in 
urban 
areas 
this 
figure 
is 
90 
percent. 
(See 
Figure 
1). 
64 
Page  73
At 
the 
elementary-school level, 
the 
enrollment 
rate 
nationwide 
grew 
by 
7 percent 
between 
the 
1994-95 
school 
year 
and 
the 1999-2000 
school 
year, 
with 
two 
million 
students 
when the 
bilingual 
schools are 
included. 
Yet 
enrollments 
only 
grew 
by 
3.9 
percent 
during 
that 
same 
period 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
The 
annual 
enrollment 
growth 
rate 
was less 
than 
the estimated 
growth 
of 
the 
population 
(2 
percent). 
Over 
a 
five-year period, the number 
of 
teachers 
grew 
by 
25 
percent 
in 
urban 
areas 
and 
20 percent 
in 
rural 
areas, 
which 
reduced 
the studentkeacher 
ratio 
from 
26 
to 
23 
during 
this 
period.

The Intercultural 
Bilingual 
Education 
subsystem, 
officially 
created 
in 
1998, 
had 
slightly 
more 
than 
85,000 
students 
in 
the 
year 
2000, 
which 
corresponds 
to 
4.4 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
enrollments 
in 
that 
year. 
This 
percentage 
is 
relatively small 
when 
one considers that 
between 12 
and 
25 
percent 
of 
the 
rural 
population 
is 
indigenous. 
lo 
Enrollments 
in 
bilingual 
schools 
increased 
by 
more than 
100 
percent 
in 
a 
decade. 
It 
is 
worth noting 
that 
the 
enrollment 
of 
males 
grew 
twice 
as 
much 
as 
the 
enrollment 
of 
females. 
Close 
to 
one 
third 
of 
elementary schools 
(approximately 
6,000) 
have 
only 
one teacher 
for 
the 
school. 
In 
the 
Amazon 
region 
the percentage 
of 
schools 
of 
this 
type 
even 
is 
higher 
(53.5 percent). 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
these 
one-teacher schools 
cover 
170,000 
students 
or 
9 percent 
of 
total 
elementary school enrollments. Since 
these 
schools are 
principally found 
in 
the 
country’s 
poorest 
rural, isolated 
areas, 
they are at a disadvantage 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
public 
schools 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
Despite significant 
reductions 
in 
grade 
repetition 
rates, these 
rates are 
still 
alarming, 
particularly 
in 
rural 
areas. 
In 
rural 
areas, 
during 
the 
first 
two 
grades, 
the grade 
repetition 
rate 
is 
13 
percent, 
compared 
to 
6 
percent 
in 
urban 
areas. 
It 
has 
been 
verified 
that the 
percentage 
of 
students 
in 
bilingual 
schools 
who 
are 
not 
promoted 
to 
the 
next 
grade 
is 
almost 
double 
the 
number 
of 
students 
who 
are 
not 
promoted 
in 
what 
are 
known 
as 
“Spanish”  schools. 
Basic 
middle 
school 
and 
specialized 
high 
school 
education. 
The nationwide 
enrollment 
rate 
at 
this 
educational 
level 
grew 
by 
19 
percent between school 
years 
1994-1995 
and 
1999-2000. 
During 
school 
year 
1999-2000, the 
country 
had 
close 
to 
one 
million 
students 
enrolled 
in 
3,473 
schools. 
One 
out 
of 
every 
four 
students 
were 
attending 
a 
private 
school, 
while 
educational 
institutions 
in 
rural 
areas 
accounted 
for 
only 
14 
percent 
of 
the students. 
This 
demonstrates that 
access 
to 
this 
level 
of 
education 
is 
limited for 
poor 
and 
indigenous 
peoples. 
Enrollment 
in 
intercultural, 
bilingual 
education 
establishments amounts 
for 
less 
than 
one percent 
of 
total 
enrollments 
in 
middle 
school 
and 
high-school 
education. 
The 
net 
school enrollment rate 
is

The 
percentage 
depends 
upon 
the 
source 
of 
information.

at 
50 
percent. 
The 
studentkeacher 
ratio 
is 
very 
low 
as 
compared 
to 
the average 
in 
Latin 
America. 
Data 
from 
the 
Living 
Conditions 
Survey 
for 
the 
year 1995 
indicate 
that the 
older 
the age-group, 
the 
less 
likely 
it 
is 
that 
youth 
will 
be enrolled 
in 
school. 
For 
example, 
9 
1 
percent 
of 
youth who 
are 
12 
years 
of 
age 
were 
attending 
school, 
while 
in 
the 
same 
year, 
only 76 
percent 
of 
13 
year-olds, 68 
percent 
of 
14-year-olds, 
62 
percent 
of 
15-year-olds, 
58 
percent 
of 
16-year-olds, 
and 
55 percent 
of 
17-year-olds were 
attending 
school. 
The 
gap 
between 
rich 
and 
poor 
is 
wider 
at 
this 
level 
than 
in 
the 
elementary 
grades. 
A 
study 
conducted 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
using 
data 
from 
the 
Living 
Conditions 
Survey 
of 
1998 
found 
that the 
principal 
reason 
why 
34 
percent 
of 
children 
between 
11 
and 
15 years 
of 
age 
were

19 
percent

is 
not

are 4 
percent 
in 
the 
country's 
rural 
areas 
and 
22 
percent 
in 
urban

Less 
than 
1 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
over 
24 
years 
of 
age has 
a 
university 
degree 
in 
the 
rural 
areas 
of 
the Coastal Region, 
compared 
to 
8 percent 
in 
the cities. 
In 
the 
highlands 
these 
percentages 
are 
1.1 
percent 
and 
11.8 
percent, 
respectively. 
By 
income 
quintiles, the 
percentages 
are 
2 
percent and 
5 
percent 
for 
the poorest 
quintiles 
and 38 
percent 
for 
the 
wealthiest 
quintile 
of 
the 
population. 
In 
the highlands, 
significant 
differences between 
genders 
are 
found: 
15.3 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
in 
institutions 
of 
higher learning 
are 
male 
and 
only 
8.7 
percent 
is 
female. 
Higher 
education 
is 
inefficient 
as 
it 
takes 
an average 
of 
13.4 years 
of 
study 
for 
a 
person 
to 
graduate at a 
cost 
of 
US$22,460. 
The rate

at 
public 
universities 
is 
rarely more than 
10 
to 
15 
percent 
of 
the 
original 
freshman 
class. 
In 
summary, 
inequities 
are 
seen 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
the system. 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
there are 
significant 
discrepancies between 
rural, 
indigenous, 
and 
urban 
populations and among 
income 
groups 
(See 
Figure 
2). 
The 
school-age 
population 
of 
the 
rural 
area 
that 
is 
poor 
and 
indigenous 
is 
at 
a great 
disadvantage 
as 
compared 
to 
urban 
school-age 
children 
who 
are 
not 
poor 
and 
are 
non-indigenous. 
Middle 
school, 
high 
school, 
and 
university 
education 
are 
principally 
aimed 
at 
the 
urban 
school 
population 
from 
the 
wealthiest quintiles, 
as 
the 
poor 
in 
rural 
areas 
have 
no 
possibility 
of 
enrolling 
in 
middle 
school. 
It 
is 
interesting 
to 
note 
that 
the 
analysis 
found 
no 
differences that 
could 
indicate 
problems 
of 
inequity 
between 
men 
and 
women 
in 
basic education. 
Efforts 
to 
expand 
coverage have 
had 
positive 
results. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
note 
that 
illiteracy 
rates 
in 
the 
country 
have been 
significantly 
reduced. 
Currently, 
it 
is 
estimated that 
10.5 
percent 
of 
the 
66 
Page  75
population over 
the 
age 
of 
15 
is 
illiterate. 
This 
illiteracy

percent 
among 25-

As 
is 
to be 
expected, 
the greatest percentage 
of 
illiteracy 
is 
found 
among persons 
over 
the 
age 
of 
65, 
among 
whom 
the 
illiteracy 
rate 
is 
34.5 
percent. 
It 
can also be 
noted 
that 
illiteracy 
is 
chiefly 
found 
in 
rural 
areas, 
and 
especially 
in 
the 
indigenous 
zones. 
Within 
the

National 
Directorate 
of

is 
the

reason 
or 
another have been

The

that

problems 
are 
fundamentally

reached 
the 
same 
conclusion. 
As

and

University 
(Center 
for 
Low 
Quality 
of 
the 
Education 
Imparted 
Results 
from

tests 
(APRENDO) 
indicate 
deficiencies 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
teaching at the 
basic 
level. 
It 
is 
clear that the 
low 
quality 
of 
education 
is 
related 
to 
factors 
involving 
school 
campuses, 
the 
teaching 
staff, the 
family, 
and, 
in 
general, 
with 
the socio- 
economic 
conditions 
surrounding 
the 
students. 
In 
1996 the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
Culture implemented 
a system 
to 
measure 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
and 
ascertain student achievement 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
language 
and 
mathematics. 
This 
system 
was 
applied 
to 
students 
in 
second, 
sixth 
and 
ninth 
grades 
in 
public 
and 
private 
schools 
in 
the 
Coastal 
Region 
and the Highlands. 
To 
date, 
the 
system 
has been 
applied 
four 
times 
(1996, 
1997, 
1998 
and 
2000). 
In 
general, 
it 
can 
be 
concluded that the 
results 
indicate 
deficiencies among 
the 
students 
in 
achievement and 
aptitude 
for 
language 
and 
mathematics, especially 
in 
the 
rural 
areas 
and 
among 
public-school 
students.

Similarly, 
the 
deficient 
quality 
of 
education 
was 
noted 
in 
a survey 
conducted 
in 
Ecuador 
in 
1998, 
known 
as 
‘‘Barbmetro 
Latino” 
(“Latin 
Barometer”). 
The 
survey’s 
participants 
indicated 
that 
they 
considered 
the 
educational 
system 
in 
Ecuador 
to be 
one 
of 
the 
most deficient

there 
is 
still 
a 
long 
way 
to 
go 
in 
terms 
of 
teacher 
training 
for 
contexts 
of 
intercultural, 
bilingual 
education. 
Another 
problem 
is 
that 
teachers 
are 
using 
obsolete 
methodologies 
that 
are 
not 
conducive 
to 
furthering 
a genuine 
teachindlearning 
process. 
Limited 
access 
to 
teaching 
materials 
for 
students 
and the 
teaching staff. 
Due 
to 
the 
economic crisis 
of 
the 
past 
few 
years, 
investments 
in 
teaching 
materials 
for 
schools 
is 
very 
limited 
or 
almost 
null. 
It 
is 
common 
in 
rural 
areas 
to 
find 
students 
who 
do 
not 
have 
access 
to 
the 
most 
minimal 
school 
supplies (notebooks, pencils). 
It 
is 
also 
common, 
both 
in 
rural 
and 
urban 
areas, 
that 
school 
campuses are 
in 
physically 
deplorable 
conditions 
that 
are 
not 
conducive 
to 
learning. 
There 
are other factors that 
affect 
the 
quality 
of 
education, 
related 
to 
child 
labor, 
absenteeism 
among 
children 
who 
work 
to 
help 
their 
parents, 
and 
other 
aspects 
that 
are 
socioeconomic 
in 
nature. 
It 
is 
important 
that 
future 
measurements 
under the 
APRENDO 
system 
include 
instruments 
to 
detect the 
influence 
of 
associated factors 
(family, 
school, 
teachers) 
in 
the 
students’ 
academic achievement. 
Serious 
Difficulties 
for 
Financing Education 
Serious 
financial 
difficulties 
played 
a 
major 
role 
in 
the 
funding 
cuts that 
impacted the educational 
sector. Teachers’ 
salaries 
have been 
impacted 
and 
it 
is 
estimated that 
families had 
to 
contribute 
in 
a greater 
proportion 
to 
educational 
expenses. 
Some 
indicators 
are presented 
below: 
Since 
the 
late 
198Os, 
investments 
in 
education have 
been 
cut 
sharply 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
economic 
crisis. 
Available 
information 
suggests 
that spending 
on 
education 
dropped, 
on 
an 
average 
from 
4.7 
percent 
of 
the 
GDP 
in 
the 
1980s 
to 
3.1 
percent 
in 
1998 and 
2.7 
percent 
in 
2000. 
(See 
Figure 
4). 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the above-mentioned 
spending 
cuts, the needed investments 
in 
education 
are 
not 
being 
made. 
Infrastructure 
maintenance 
is 
minimal 
and 
teachers’ salaries have been reduced. 
This 
has 
contributed 
to 
a 
higher 
teacher 
turnover 
rate, 
teacher 
moonlighting, 
and 
teacher 
absenteeism. 
Similarly, 
these

cuts have 
probably 
reduced the 
interest 
taken 
in 
the 
profession 
by 
young 
people 
who 
would 
have 
wanted 
to 
be 
teachers. 
This 
situation 
could 
have 
serious 
consequences 
for 
the 
availability 
of 
well- 
trained 
teachers 
in 
the future. 
Parents 
have 
had to 
increase 
their 
contribution 
to 
finance 
their 
children’s 
education. 
For 
example, 
they 
have 
had 
to 
hire 
teachers 
to 
replace those 
who 
have 
abandoned schools 
in 
isolated 
rural 
areas, 
or 
hire 
teachers 
of 
certain 
subject 
matters 
in 
secondary schools. 
The 
home 
survey 
conducted 
in 
1998 indicates that 
40 
percent 
of 
parents 
from 
the poorest 
percentile 
contributed 
a 
monthly 
amount 
in 
fees 
and 
uniforms, 
both 
in 
elementary 
and 
secondary schools 
(excluding 
transportation, 
textbooks 
and school 
supplies), 
almost 
equal 
to 
the 
monthly 
payment made 
by 
parents 
of 
private 
school 
students. 
Data 
from 
the most recent 
teacher 
census 
indicate 
that 
more 
than 
1,000 
public 
school 
teachers are 
paid 
with 
community 
funds. 
During 
the 
years 
2000 
to 
2001, 
higher education received 26 
percent 
of 
the 
funds 
allocated 
to 
the 
educational 
sector, 
compared 
to 
22 percent 
in 
1995. 
In 
2001, 
the budget 
for 
elementary 
and 
68 
Page  77
secondary 
education 
was 
the 
same 
as 
the 
amount allocated 
for 
these 
levels 
of 
education 
in 
1995, 
while 
higher 
education received 
an 
increase 
in 
its 
budgetary 
allocation 
of 
almost 
33 
percent 
over 
that 
same 
period. 
From 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
equity, 
these 
budgetary 
allocations 
would 
not 
be 
advisable. Aggregate spending 
in 
education 
at 
all 
levels indicates 
that the 
lowest-income 
population quintile 
is 
allocated 12 
percent 
of 
public 
spending 
on 
education, 
while 
the 
highest- 
income 
quintile 
is 
allocated 
25 percent 
of 
public 
spending 
on 
education. 
The 
percentage 
of 
public 
spending 
on 
education 
that 
reaches 
the 
poorest 
sectors 
of 
the 
population 
is 
less 
in 
Ecuador than 
in 
neighboring 
countries 
such 
as 
Peru, 
where 
21 
percent 
is 
channeled 
to 
the poorest 
population 
quintile, 
Bolivia with 
32 
percent, 
or 
Chile 
with 
34 percent. 
Problems 
in 
the Governability 
of 
the 
Sector 
Despite 
the magnitude 
of 
the 
educational 
sector’s 
financial 
problems, one 
of 
the greatest 
challenges 
is 
the sector’s 
governability. 
Greater 
public 
and 
private 
investment 
in 
education 
will 
not 
have a 
significant impact 
unless 
measures are 
taken 
to 
address 
deficiencies 
in 
governability. 
The principal 
issues are 
mentioned 
below, 
with 
certain 
points 
that 
serve 
as 
indicators 
to 
illustrate 
the severity 
of 
the 
problem: 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
Culture 
has 
an elevated 
turnover rate 
in 
its 
high-level 
authorities 
(ministers, 
assistant-ministers, 
provincial 
directors, 
and 
advisors). 
This 
situation 
impedes 
continuity 
in 
educational policies, 
makes 
it 
difficult 
to 
apply 
a 
long-term 
outlook 
for 
resolving 
problems 
in 
the 
sector, 
and 
also 
creates 
obstacles 
for 
teamwork 
within 
the 
Ministry. 
In 
its 
118 
years 
of 
existence, the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
Culture 
has 
had 
113 
ministers. 
In 
the last 
10 
years, 
11 
ministers 
have headed 
up 
this 
entity. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
Culture 
has 
administrative 
units 
with 
parallel 
functions. There 
is 
a 
duplicity 
of 
functions 
and 
lack 
of 
coordination 
among the various 
levels, 
and 
decision-making 
is 
centralized. 
In 
a 
recent analysis 
of 
the structure and 
functions 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education and 
Culture 
it 
was 
found 
that 
administration 
is 
excessively centralized, that there are 
too 
many 
administrative 
units, 
that 
participation 
in 
decision-making 
at 
the 
local 
levels 
is 
almost inexistent, 
and that service 
to clients 
is 
deficient. 
Within 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and Culture, 
intercultural, 
bilingual 
education 
has 
been 
incorporated through 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
parallel 
system. 
This 
has 
resulted 
in 
a 
structure where 
the 
“Spanish”  system 
and the 
Intercultural, 
Bilingual 
Education 
system 
are 
nearly 
independent 
of 
one another. 
There 
is 
a 
lack 
of 
coordination 
of 
the sector 
inside 
and 
out. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
Culture 
and 
the 
Provincial 
Directorates have 
limited 
communication 
with 
the elementary 
and 
secondary schools. 
As 
a 
result, 
follow-up 
and 
control 
of 
activities 
at the 
school 
level 
are 
not 
effective. 
In 
addition, 
there 
is 
almost 
no 
follow-up 
or 
support 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education and 
Culture 
for 
teachers, 
who 
are the 
most 
important 
resource 
in 
the 
educational 
process. 
Finally, 
early-childhood 
education 
is 
beyond 
the 
control 
and 
coordination 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and Culture, 
since 
it 
is 
administered 
by 
the 
National 
Children’s and 
Family 
Institute 
and 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Social 
Welfare.

SYNOPSIS. 
GOVERNMENT 
STRATEGIES 
AND 
INITIATIVES 
Progress 
in 
the 
DeconcentratiodJlecentralization 
of 
the 
System. 
In 
Ecuador, 
the 
legal  framework 
for 
decentralization and deconcentration 
is 
found 
in 
the 
Constitution 
of 
the 
Republic 
and 
in 
a 
series 
of 
legal 
provisions. 
Despite the 
good 
intentions towards establishing a 
decentralized/deconcentred 
system, 
the 
efforts 
made 
in 
that 
direction 
are 
quite 
timid 
and incomplete. Current decentralization 
efforts 
are 
based 
in 
part 
on 
prior 
experiences, 
especially 
those 
of 
the 
1990s, 
which 
were 
partially 
successful. 
Examples 
of 
these 
experiences 
are: 
the 
Program 
for 
Better 
Quality 
Basic 
Education, 
which 
created 
120 Educational 
Matrix 
Centers 
- 
CEMs 
(Centros Educutivos 
Matrices), 
with 
each 
CEM 
constituted 
by 
approximately 
20 
schools 
comprising 
a 
network. 
Another  example 
is 
the 
Autonomous 
Rural 
School 
Networks 
Program, 
known 
as 
Redes 
Amigus, 
which 
has 
as 
its 
objectives: 
(i) 
to 
grant autonomy 
to 
approximately 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
rural 
schools (close 
to 
2,400 
schools) 
for 
the 
management 
of 
their 
resources, 
with 
greater 
participation 
from 
parents 
and 
members 
of 
the 
community 
in 
school administration; and 
(ii) 
to 
improve 
teaching 
conditions 
in 
basic 
rural 
education 
(elementary school 
and 
middle 
school) 
in 
the 
beneficiary 
schools’ 
zones 
of 
influence. 
A 
third 
example 
is 
the 
decentralization 
of 
approximately 
1,800 
secondary schools, 
which 
are 
managed 
as 
decentralized 
units 
and 
receive 
funds 
(cash 
transfers) 
directly 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy and Finance. 
With 
the 
funds 
received, 
the 
school 
pays 
its 
teachers 
directly 
and covers 
campus 
utility bills 
and 
maintenance 
expenses. 
In 
the 
municipality 
of 
Quito, decentralized 
education 
currently 
covers 
42 Municipal 
Educational 
Centers, 
more than 
12,000 
students, 
and 
900 
teachers. 
The 
Quito 
experience 
is 
a 
further 
example 
of 
actions that 
are 
conducive 
to providing 
autonomy 
and 
delegating 
functions 
to 
the 
various levels. Attachment 
1 
includes a summary 
of 
the progress 
mentioned 
above, 
which 
plays a fundamental 
role 
in 
future educational 
policy 
decisions. 
Progress 
in 
Planning. 
Various plans have been delineated 
by 
the 
past 
few 
administrations 
to 
continue 
the process 
of 
extending 
coverage, 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
services 
and, 
in 
general, 
making 
services 
more 
efficient. 
In 
2000, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
Culture 
prepared and published a ten-year 
plan 
covering 
the 
various levels 
of 
the 
education 
sector. 
The 
plan 
sets 
forth 
policies  to be 
followed,  priorities 
for 
the 
sector, 
and 
strategies 
to 
be 
implemented. 
The 
fundamental 
objective 
of 
this 
plan 
is 
to 
ensure 
universal 
access 
to 
general education 
(including 
basic 
education, 
high 
school, and 
adult 
education), 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
equity. 
This 
plan 
contemplates a 
Ministry 
“converted 
into 
a 
organization 
that functions 
as 
a 
leader, 
that 
is 
deconcentred, 
decentralized, efficient,  and 
flexible, 
and 
whose 
management 
contributes 
to 
reducing inequities 
in 
access 
to educational 
services 
and 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
knowledge 
...” 
(Ministry 
of 
Education 
and Culture, 
2000). 
The 
plan 
in 
question established 
the 
following 
policies 
and 
strategies 
to 
be 
implemented: 
(i) 
universalization 
of 
access 
to 
early-childhood 
and 
basic education, 
while 
ensuring that 
students 
stay 
in 
school 
at 
those 
levels 
of 
education; 
(ii) 
improved quality 
of 
education, 
so 
as 
to 
ensure 
significant learning 
and 
the 
integral 
development 
of 
the 
students; 
(iii) 
strengthening 
of 
intercultural, 
bilingual 
education; and 
(iv) 
better 
conditions 
for 
teachers, 
along 
with 
regulation 
of 
the teacher 
training 
system 
for 
intercultural, 
bilingual 
education. 
In 
order 
to 
implement 
these 
actions, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
Culture 
has 
considered 
the 
following 
measures: 
(i) 
decentralization and deconcentration, 
with

and

The 
Social 
Contract for 
Education. 
More 
recently 
(September 
2002), the 
agencies 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
system 
proposed 
what 
has 
been 
called 
the 
“Social Contract 
for 
Education,” 
which 
sets 
forth 
the 
following 
goals: ensure 
that 
Ecuadorian 
girls 
and boys have 
access 
to and 
remain 
in 
school 
for 
ten 
years 
of 
quality 
basic 
education; adopt 
standards 
Jf 
quality 
in 
education, 
taking 
into 
consideration 
the 
ethnic and 
cultural 
diversity 
of 
the 
country, 
which would 
include 
.raining 
in 
ethical, moral, 
and 
civic 
values, 
so 
that Ecuador 
will 
become one 
of 
the countries 
with 
the best 
indicators 
in 
iasic education 
within 
the 
region.” 
The 
declaration 
also 
includes 
strategies that 
need 
to 
be 
followed 
to 
meet 
these 
goals, 
which can 
be 
summarized 
as 
follows: 
(i) 
training 
and 
continuing 
professional development 
for 
the 
teachers, 
and 
decent 
lay; 
(ii) 
an equitable 
distribution 
of 
human 
resources 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
needs 
of 
the schools; 
(iii) 
compliance 
with 
:urriculums; 
(iv) 
establishments 
with 
adequate 
infrastructure 
and equipment; (v) an 
incentive 
policy 
based 
on 
the 
mplementation 
of 
a 
national 
evaluation 
system; 
(vi) 
support 
to 
needy 
families 
(scholarships, school 
meals); 
and 
(vii) 
mure 
appropriate 
financial 
resources 
to 
meet 
the goals 
that have been established. 
The 
administration 
of 
human 
resources, 
mainly 
teachers 
and 
principals, 
is 
deficient 
and 
must 
be 
improved. 
The 
screening, 
appointment, 
and 
promotion 
of 
teachers 
within 
the 
institution 
is 
a 
process 
that 
lacks transparency. 
Principals 
of 
elementary 
and 
secondary schools 
lack 
authority 
to 
70 
Page  79
select 
their 
personnel, 
or 
to 
take 
corrective 
measures 
when 
teachers engage 
in 
serious 
misconduct. 
Frequently, 
appointments depend 
upon 
subjective 
criteria 
and 
not 
necessarily 
upon 
the experience 
and 
qualifications 
of 
the 
teachers 
being 
considered 
for 
the 
position. 
The 
system 
for 
assigning 
teachers 
contributes 
to 
the 
difficult 
situation, 
principally 
in 
rural 
schools. 
When 
there 
is 
a vacancy 
in 
a 
rural 
school, a 
teacher 
can be 
appointed 
to work 
in 
the 
school, 
but 
a 
few 
months later, can 
obtain 
a 
position 
in 
an 
urban 
school 
or 
in 
a 
Provincial 
Directorate, 
taking 
the appointment 
along 
with 
himher, 
and 
leaving 
the 
school 
without 
an 
available 
position. 
Teachers 
and principals 
of 
elementary 
and 
secondary schools 
are 
appointed 
for 
an 
indefinite 
period. 
No 
mechanisms 
exist to 
ensure 
that 
they 
will 
retire 
when they 
reach a 
certain 
age. 
Due 
to 
the 
fact that 
retirement income 
is 
significantly 
less 
that the 
salaries, 
very 
few 
persons 
opt 
for 
a 
voluntary 
retirement. 
The 
rate 
of 
teacher absenteeism 
in 
schools 
is 
high, 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
teachers 
must 
visit 
the 
Provincial 
Directorates 
or 
the 
offices 
of 
their 
supervisors 
frequently 
with 
regard 
to 
administrative 
matters. 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
estimated that 
during 
the 
past 
15 
years 
an 
average 
of 
one 
month 
per 
year 
has 
been 
lost 
due 
to 
teacher strikes. 
At 
schools 
servicing 
the poorest populations, 
an 
average 
of 
nine 
days 
of 
work 
per 
month 
is 
lost. 
The 
distribution 
of 
teachers 
is 
not 
adequate. 
There 
is 
an 
excess 
of 
teachers 
in 
some areas 
and 
a 
deficit 
in 
others. 
During 
the 
1990s 
the studendteacher 
ratio 
declined 
and 
the inadequate 
distribution 
worsened. 
The 
situation 
seems 
to 
be 
critical 
in 
some 
night 
schools where there are 
six 
students 
per 
teacher. 
Finally, 
the 
salary structure 
of 
the 
teachers 
has 
no 
correlation 
to 
the 
objective 
of 
improving 
the 
quality 
and 
equity 
of 
the 
system. 
For 
example, the 
“frontier 
bonus” 
received 
by 
teachers 
in 
isolated 
rural 
areas, 
which 
represents 
an 
amount equivalent 
to 
up 
to 
25 
percent 
of 
their 
salary, 
continues 
to 
be 
included 
in 
a 
teacher’s 
salary 
even 
when 
the 
teacher stops 
working 
in 
the 
rural 
area 
and 
is 
transferred 
to 
an 
urban 
school. 
The 
management 
of 
the 
budget 
as 
a 
tool 
to 
promote 
progress 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
educational 
policy 
is 
inexistent. 
The 
budget 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
Culture 
is 
administered 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
with 
limited 
participation 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
Culture. 
The 
budget 
is 
not 
being 
utilized 
as 
a 
tool to 
carry 
out 
educational 
policy. 
There 
are delays 
in 
the 
transfer 
of 
funds 
and 
the 
educational authorities 
are 
not 
incorporating 
economic 
and 
financial 
variables 
into 
their 
policy 
decisions. 
Recommendations 
The new 
administration 
needs 
to 
find 
solutions 
to 
the 
problems 
detected 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
coverage, 
quality, 
financing,  and 
governability 
of 
the 
sector. 
The 
principal 
challenge 
facing 
the 
new 
administration 
is 
to 
attain 
the 
goal 
of 
providing 
ten 
years 
of 
basic 
quality 
schooling. 
This 
challenge 
is 
encompassed 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
For 
said 
purposes, 
programs 
aimed 
at extending 
coverage 
must 
be clearly 
focused 
on 
groups 
that have 
not 
been 
attended 
to, 
such 
as 
low-income 
persons, 
rural 
areas, 
and 
particularly 
the indigenous 
areas. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Education and Culture 
has 
attained 
successes 
during 
recent 
years, 
whose 
coverage 
must 
be 
expanded. 
Particular attention 
must 
be 
paid 
to 
the 
schools 
known 
as 
one- 
teacher 
or 
multi-grade 
classroom 
schools, 
so 
that 
in 
places where there 
are 
only 
one 
or 
two 
teachers, 
at 
least 
all 
elementary 
school 
grades 
will 
be 
offered. 
Ecuador 
should 
consider 
other educational options 
such 
as 
the 
model 
of 
“Telesecondary” 
education developed 
by 
Mexico, 
which 
is 
being 
successfully 
implemented 
in 
countries 
of 
the 
71 
Page  80
region 
such 
as 
Guatemala, 
Panama, 
Colombia, 
and 
Brazil, 
among others. 
Similarly, innovative 
strategies 
should 
be 
developed 
to 
offer 
the complete 
basic education 
cycle 
in 
areas 
that 
are 
far 
away 
from 
major 
population 
centers, 
where there 
are 
no 
schools 
offering 
secondary education. 
Given 
that the 
economic situation 
of 
families 
is 
a 
factor that influences 
whether students 
enroll 
in 
school 
and 
stay 
in 
school, the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
Culture 
should 
consider 
financing 
the 
most needy 
students 
through 
scholarships. 
As 
for 
the 
issue 
of 
quality 
education, 
Ecuador 
has 
already 
engaged 
in 
significant efforts 
to 
design 
and 
implement 
a 
quality 
measurement system, 
which 
can 
be improved 
and 
institutionalized. 
APRENDO 
as 
a measurement system 
can 
play 
a 
fundamental 
role 
as 
a 
tool 
that makes 
it 
possible 
to: 
(i) 
identify 
schools 
with 
serious 
difficulties 
in 
attaining given 
standards; 
(ii) 
provide 
follow-up 
to 
policies 
focused 
on 
solving 
certain 
identified 
problems. 
As 
for 
training 
(continual 
education) 
of 
the 
teaching 
staff, various 
options 
or 
strategies 
should be 
evaluated. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
public 
and 
private 
universities, 
as 
well 
as 
normal 
schools 
should 
all 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
training 
process. 
The 
most 
ideal 
institutions 
would be 
those 
that 
are 
devoted 
to 
teacher 
training. 
This 
process 
will 
be 
highly 
effective 
if 
the 
instruction, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
teacher 
training, 
are 
closely 
correlated 
to 
teacher 
promotions 
and 
thus 
increase 
remuneration. 
The financing 
of 
the 
sector 
is 
an 
aspect 
that should 
be 
closely analyzed 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
efficiency 
(size 
of 
the 
system 
at 
the central, 
provincial, 
and 
local 
levels), 
as 
well 
as 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
resources needed 
to 
expand 
coverage 
and 
guarantee at least 
ten 
years 
of 
basic 
education. 
Consideration 
should 
be 
given 
to 
financing 
demand 
for 
the 
service, 
through 
scholarships 
for 
students 
of 
the poorest 
families. 
An 
investment 
in 
infrastructure, 
textbooks, 
libraries 
and 
teaching materials 
is 
fundamental 
to 
ensure, 
at least 
in 
part, 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
service 
being 
offered. 
If 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
Culture 
fails 
to improve 
the “governability” 
of 
the 
sector, 
it 
is 
quite 
possible 
that 
the 
funds 
allocated 
will 
not 
achieve the 
desired 
results. 
The 
structure 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education and Culture 
should 
be 
reviewed, 
carefully 
analyzing 
processes 
for 
screening, 
appointing, 
and 
promoting 
personnel 
both 
as 
teachers 
and 
in 
administration. 
It 
is 
equally 
important 
to 
review 
experiences 
with 
decentralizatioddeconcentration, 
so 
as 
to 
give 
autonomy 
to 
individual 
schools 
and 
greater 
participation 
to 
parents.

THE 
HEALTH 
SECTOR 
IN 
ECUADOR 
Despite the 
difficult 
economic 
and 
political 
conditions 
that 
Ecuador 
has 
confronted 
in 
recent 
years, 
the 
country's 
Human 
Development 
Index 
(HDI) 
has 
shown 
sustained 
improvement, 
increasing 
by 
9 
percent 
between 
the 
years 
1980 
and 
2000. 
Nonetheless, even 
though 
new 
countries 
have been incorporated 
into 
the analysis, Ecuador's 
ranking 
has 
dropped, 
from 
49" 
place 
in 
1975 
to 
93rd 
place 
in 
the 
year 
200011. 
During 
this 
period, 
Ecuador's 
health indicators 
have 
improved 
significantly. 
Life 
Expectancy 
at 
Birth, 
(one 
of 
three 
components 
of 
the 
HDI), 
increased 
from 
58.8 
years 
in 
1975 
to 
70 
years 
in 
2000, 
(67.3 
years 
in 
males 
and 
73.5 
in 
females). 
This 
represents an increase 
of 
19 
percent and 
an 
average 
of 
1 
1.2 
additional 
years 
of 
life 
for 
each 
member 
of 
the 
population. 
Infantile mortality 
was 
reduced 
by 
two 
thirds, 
from 
87 
per 
thousand 
in 
1970 
to 
30 
per 
thousand 
in 
the year 
2000, 
and 
mortality 
in 
children 
under 
five 
years 
of 
age 
was 
reduced 
by 
three 
fourths, 
from 
140 
per 
thousand 
to 
39 
per 
thousand 
over 
that 
same 
period. 
Nonetheless, the 
changes 
seen 
at 
an 
overall national 
level, were 
not 
homogeneous 
in 
the 
country's interior.

This 
trend 
towards better health 
was 
seen 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
the countries 
in 
the 
region. 
Social, 
cultural, 
technological, 
economic, 
and 
environmental 
factors 
have 
all 
contributed 
to 
these 
changes, 
along 
with 
increased 
accessibility 
to 
and 
improved 
quality 
of 
health 
services. 
The 
relationship 
between 
a 
country’s per 
capita 
income 
and 
its 
life 
expectancies 
follows 
a curve, 
with 
Ecuador located 
at 
the 
curve’s 
mid-point 
(Figure 
1). 
Some 
countries 
with 
income 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
Ecuador show 
greater 
life 
expectancies, 
such 
as 
Armenia, 
Syria, 
Sri 
Lanka, 
Surinam, 
and 
Jamaica, 
among 
others. 
Certain 
countries, however, 
such 
as 
Egypt, 
the Ukraine, 
Honduras, 
and 
Guatemala, whose 
income 
is 
also 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
Ecuador, 
have 
lower 
life 
expectancies.

Within 
Ecuador, demographic, 
cultural, and social heterogeneity 
has 
created 
fertile 
ground 
for 
the 
development 
of 
economic inequities 
and 
for 
disparities 
in 
health conditions 
and 
conditions 
of 
life. 
In 
the 
province 
of 
Amazonia, 
life 
expectancy 
for 
1995-2000 
was 
59.6 
years,12 
and 
it 
was 
estimated that 
21 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
would 
not 
survive more 
than 
40 
years. 
At 
the 
other 
extreme, 
the 
population 
of 
Pichincha Province had 
a 
life 
expectancy that 
was 
14.9 years 
longer, 
and 
only 
6.8 
percent 
were 
expected 
to 
die 
before 
age 
forty. 
When 
life 
expectancies are 
compared 
with 
household consumption per 
capita, the 
relationship 
follows 
a 
similar 
curve 
on 
a 
country-by- 
country 
basis. 
In 
this 
instance 
as 
well, 
the 
populations 
of 
“poor” 
provinces 
have a 
lower 
life 
expectancy 
than 
those 
of 
provinces 
with 
greater resources. 
(Figure 
2). 
A. 
DIAGNOSTIC 
AND 
FEATURES 
OF 
THE 
HEALTH 
PROFILE 
Ecuador exhibits 
a 
polarized 
pattern 
of 
epidemiological 
transition, 
in 
which 
problems 
are 
seen 
that 
are 
typical 
of 
developed populations, 
hand-in-hand 
with 
problems 
typically 
seen 
in 
populations that 
have 
not 
achieved 
such 
levels 
of 
development 
(high 
rates 
of 
mortality 
due 
to 
infectious 
disease 
or 
external 
causes, 
cervical 
cancer, 
infantile mortality, 
deaths 
of 
children 
under 
five 
years 
of 
age 
and 
deaths 
related 
to 
pregnancy, 
childbirth or 
puerperal 
deaths). 
This 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
one 
and 
the 
same 
population 
is 
suffering 
from 
both 
types 
of 
problems. 
Rather, 
it 
suggests 
that 
there 
are 
certain 
population 
groups 
with 
better 
health 
indicators, 
longer 
life 
expectancies, 
and 
an 
epidemiological 
pattern 
more 
typical 
of 
a 
developed country, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
as 
other 
population 
groups, 
due 
to 
adverse 
conditions 
of 
life, 
situations 
of 
inequity, and 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
basic 
health 
services, 
suffer 
from 
premature 
mortality 
whose 
causes 
are 
preventable.

Centro 
Latinoamericano 
de 
Demografia 
(Latin 
American 
Demography 
Center) considered the 
underreporting to 
be even 
higher. 
Estimated 
mortality 
for 
1999 
was 
5.9 
per 
1,000 
inhabitants 
(6.8 
in 
males 
and 
4.9 
in 
females). 
The deficit 
in 
medical certifications 
was 
17 
percent 
(1 
1 
percent 
in 
the coastal 
region 
and 37 
percent 
in 
the 
Amazonian 
region). 
Furthermore, 
in 
14 percent 
of 
the 
deaths 
where 
medical 
certification 
was 
provided, 
the 
cause 
of 
the death 
was 
incorrectly 
defined.I3 
Deaths due 
to 
cardiovascular 
disease 
have increased 
by 
3 
1 
percent 
as 
compared 
to 
1995 and 
continue 
to 
be 
the 
leading 
cause 
of 
death, 
with 
an 
adjusted 
rate, 
to 
correct 
for 
underreporting, 
of 
155 
per 
100,000 
inhabitants (166 
in 
males, 
143 
in 
females) 
(Figure 
3). 
The 
second, 
third, 
and 
fourth 
most 
frequent 
causes 
of 
death, 
each 
with 
very 
similar 
rates, 
are cancer, 
external 
causes, 
and 
infectious 
disease. 
Finally, 
at 
a 
rate 
of 
180 
per 
100,000, 
are 
all 
other 
causes. 
Among 
deaths 
caused 
by 
cancer, 
the 
most 
frequent 
cause 
of 
death 
in 
both 
sexes 
is 
stomach 
cancer, 
followed 
in 
males 
by 
lung 
cancer 
and 
prostate 
cancer, 
and 
in 
females 
by 
breast 
cancer, 
cancer 
of 
the 
uterus, 
and 
lung 
cancer. 
The rate 
of 
mortality 
for 
cancer 
of 
the uterus 
(surpassing 
that 
of 
lung 
cancer 
and 
almost equal 
to 
that 
of 
breast 
cancer) 
is 
very 
high. 
It 
causes 
the death 
of 
approximately 
700 
women 
each 
year, 
which 
indicates 
the 
lack 
of 
impact 
of 
preventive 
efforts. 
Deaths 
from 
accidents, suicide, 
and 
homicide 
are 
four 
times 
more 
frequent among males (132 
per 
100,000). 
One 
fourth 
of 
these deaths 
are due 
to 
traffic 
accidents. 
Diseases that are 
easily 
controllable through 
basic healthcare, such 
as 
respiratory 
infections 
and 
diarrhea, 
continue to 
cause 
the 
majority 
of 
deaths 
from 
infectious 
disease, 
especially 
in 
the 
population 
groups 
with 
the 
least 
access 
to 
health 
services. 
There 
was 
a 
decrease 
in 
cases 
of 
cholera, 
but 
rates 
for typhoid 
fever 
and 
food 
poisoning 
increased. 
The 
incidence 
of 
tuberculosis 
has 
gone 
down 
slightly, 
but 
rates 
for 
the 
provinces 
with 
the largest 
proportion 
of 
indigenous and 
rural 
population 
are 
up 
to 
10 
times 
greater 
than 
those 
of 
the 
coastal 
provinces. 
In 
addition, 
it 
is 
estimated 
that the diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
of 
tuberculosis 
is 
accomplished 
in 
less 
than 
60 
percent 
of 
the 
actual 
cases.

Even 
though 
the 
actual incidence 
of 
AIDS 
is 
not 
accurately 
known, 
the 
greatest 
proportion 
of 
AIDS 
cases 
and 
HIV 
carriers 
are 
also 
clustered 
in 
the 
province 
of 
Guayas (83 percent 
of 
the 
country's 
total). 
The reporting 
of 
cases 
continues 
to 
grow, 
especially 
in 
women. Heterosexuals 
account 
for 
62 
percent 
of 
the 
cases, 
homosexuals account 
for 
33 percent, 
and 
bisexuals 
account 
for 
5 percent 
(Figure 
4). 
Slightly 
more 
than 
50 
percent 
of 
the 
country's 
population lives 
in 
malaria 
risk 
zones, 
and 
since 
1996the-reporting 
of 
cases 
has 
increased 
annually, 
until 
reaching 
levels 
almost 
10 
times 
higher 
in 
the 
years 
2000 
and 2001. 
There 
has 
also 
been a 
notable 
increase 
in 
the 
incidence 
of 
dengue 
fever. 
From 
less 
than 
1,000 
cases 
per 
year between 1992 and 
1995, 
the 
rate 
has 
risen 
to 
more 
than 
20,000 
in 
the year 
2000 
(the 
majority 
centered 
in 
the 
province 
of 
Guayas). 
The 
four 
serotypes 
of 
the 
virus 
are 
now 
in 
circulation, 
and 
cases 
have been 
seen 
of 
dengue 
hemorrhagic fever. 
All 
this 
leads 
to 
a 
prediction 
that dengue 
will 
have a 
major 
short-term 
impact 
on 
the 
health 
of 
the 
population 
and 
on 
health 
services. 
HIGH 
INFANT 
MORTALITY 
RATES 
As 
in 
the 
case 
of 
general 
mortality, 
the 
figures 
on 
Infantile 
Mortality 
obtained through 
vital 
statistics are 
lower 
than 
those 
obtained through 
surveys 
or 
estimates. 
For 
the 
period 
of 
1994 
to 
1999, 
the 
mortality 
rate 
according 
to 
the 
Survey 
on 
Demographics and 
Maternal 
and 
Infantile 
Health, 
[Encuesta 
Demogrdfica 
y

ENDEMAIN 
1111 
was 
30 
per 
thousand. These values represent a 
decline 
of 
24 percent 
as 
compared 
to 
the 
period 
of 
1990 
to 
1994 
(39.5 
per 
thousand). 
The 
rates 
estimated 
by 
the 
Pan-American 
Health 
Organization 
(PAHO) 
were 
even 
higher. 
Indeed, 
according 
to 
PAHO's 
estimates, the decline, over a 
longer 
period 
(1990 
to 
2000), 
was 
only 
18 
percent, 
that 
is, 
from 
52.7 
to 
43.1 per 
tho~sand.'~ 
The 
national 
rates 
do 
not 
reveal 
the 
internal 
variations 
in 
this 
indicator. 
In 
the 
costal region, 
the 
rate 
for 
the 
period 
of 
1994 
to 
1999 
was 
25 
per 
thousand, 
in 
the highlands 
it 
was 
34 
per 
thousand, 
and 
in 
the 
Amazonian 
region, 
it 
was 
38 
per 
thousand. 
The 
differences 
are 
even 
more 
extreme 
if 
one 
takes 
into 
consideration: 
Place 
of 
residence: 
Urban 
zones 
(22 per 
thousand), 
rural 
zones 
(40 
per 
thousand). 
Educational 
Levels: 
no 
schooling 
(51), 
elementary 
(35), 
secondary 
(25), 
higher 
education(

(15), 
highest 
(21.9).

HIGH 
PREVALENCE 
OF 
RISK 
FACTORS 
FOR 
INFANT 
MORTALITY 
Fertility 
rates 
have 
decreased 
over 
recent 
decades 
for 
all 
age 
groups, 
except 
in 
adolescents. 
The 
fertility 
rate 
in 
the 14 
to 
19 
year-old 
group 
for 
the 
period 
of 
1994-1999 
was 
58 per 
thousand 
in 
Quito, 
76 
per 
thousand 
in 
Guayaquil, 
and 
as 
high 
as 
157 
per 
thousand 
in 
the 
Amazonian 
provinces, 
exhibiting 
the 
gap 
in 
access 
to 
information 
and 
access 
to 
family-planning 
methods 
among 
those 
populations. 
Close 
to 20 
percent 
of 
mothers deliver their 
children 
without 
any 
prenatal 
care, 
(10.8 
percent 
in 
urban 
zones 
and 
28 percent 
in 
rural 
zones), 
with 
disparities 
as 
wide 
as 
7 percent 
in 
Guayaquil 
and 
34 
percent 
in 
the 
Amazonian 
provinces. 
On 
a 
national 
level, 
29 
percent 
of 
childbirths 
are 
home 
deliveries, 
but 
in 
Guayaquil 
and 
Quito 
the rates 
are 
only 
4.5 
percent 
and 
6.7 
percent, 
respectively, 
as 
compared 
to 
50 
percent 
in 
the Amazonian 
region 
(60 
percent 
in 
Chimborazo, 
in 
Bolivar, 
and 
Cotopaxi). 
Home 
deliveries 
are 
seen 
in 
only 
2.3 
percent 
of 
mothers 
with 
a 
higher 
education, 
while 
for 
mothers 
with 
no 
schooling, the 
rate 
is 
73.6 percent. 
There 
is 
a 
high 
rate 
of 
newborns 
with 
a 
birth 
weight 
of 
less 
than 2500 
grams (16.1 percent). 
Indeed, a 
reduction 
in 
this 
indicator 
could 
produce 
a 
significant 
decline 
in 
infantile mortality. 
More 
extensive 
provision 
of 
basic 
health 
services 
would 
not 
necessarily have a 
radical impact 
on 
this 
factor. 
Specific 
measures 
are required, such 
as 
an increase 
in 
the 
interval 
between 
pregnancies, 
nutritional 
control, 
and 
other factors 
related 
to 
fetal malnutrition or 
to 
premature 
childbirths. 
Finally, 
despite 
the Free Healthcare 
Maternity 
Act, 
there 
are 
major 
inequities 
in 
access 
to 
health 
services 
for 
care 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
life. 
Mortality 
in 
children 
under 
five 
years 
of 
age 
follows 
a 
pattern 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
infantile 
mortality. 
According to 
the 
results 
of 
the 
ENDEMAIN-94 
and 
ENDEMAIN-99 
surveys, 
mortality 
rates 
for 
this 
group 
decreased 
from 
55.7 
per 
thousand 
to 
37.1 
per 
thousand 
(a 
33.4 
percent reduction). 
Nonetheless, estimates 
from 
the 
Pan-American 
Health 
Organization 
(PAHO) 
and 
the 
United 
Nations Population 
Division 
(UN) 
suggest 
higher 
rates 
and 
a 
decline 
between 
1992 and 1999 
of 
only 
11.5 
percent, 
from 
65.2 
to 
57.7 
per 
tho~sand.'~ 
The 
distribution 
of 
mortality 
rates 
in 
children 
under 
five 
years 
of 
age 
follows 
a 
similar 
pattern 
to 
that 
of 
infantile 
mortality, 
with 
a 
predominant 
role 
played 
by 
malnutrition 
and 
infectious 
disease. 
The 
second 
Survey 
on 
Health 
and 
Nutrition 
in 
children under 
five 
years 
of 
age, 
in 
1986, 
determined 
that 
37.5 
percent 
of 
Ecuadorian 
children 
were 
underweight (below 
minus 
two 
Standard 
Deviations 
from 
median 
weight-for-age) 
and 
49.4 
percent 
had 
retarded 
growth (below 
minus 
two 
Standard 
Deviations 
from 
median 
height-for-age). 
Malnutrition 
was 
even 
more 
pronounced 
in 
the 
highland 
provinces 
(51.9 
percent 
and 
69.8 
percent)16. 
Twelve 
years 
later, 
the 
1998 
Living 
Conditions 
Survey 
estimated that the 
prevalence 
of 
chronic 
malnutrition 
had 
declined 
to 
26 
percent. 
This 
means 
that 
still, 
more 
than 
350,000 
children 
under 
five 
years 
of 
age 
are 
suffering 
from 
malnutrition. 
HIGH 
MATERNAL 
MORTALITY 
RATES 
The 
records 
on 
maternal 
mortality 
are even 
less 
precise. 
While 
the 
INEC, 
the 
National 
Statistics 
and 
Census 
Institute 
of 
Ecuador 
(Znstituto 
Nacional 
de 
Estudistica 
y 
Censos) 
states 
that 
the 
rates 
for 
the 
years 
1990, 
1996, 
and 
1998 were 117,63, 
and 
55 
per 
100,000 
births 
respectively, 
ENDEMAIN 
I1 
has 
estimated that 
during 
the 
period 
of 
1981 
to 
1994, 
there were 
an 
average 
of 
220 
maternal 
deaths 
for 
each 
100,000 
births, 
(302 per 
100,000 
for 
the 
period 
of 
1981-1987 and

PROBLEMS 
IN 
THE 
HEALTH 
SERVICES 
SYSTEM 
More 
than 
two 
thirds 
of 
the 
population 
of 
Ecuador 
have no 
formal 
health 
insurance, 
and the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health 
and 
other 
public 
institutions 
are 
incapable 
of 
providing 
healthcare 
services 
to nearly 
half 
of 
the 
uninsured. Those 
who are 
left 
without 
service 
are 
precisely 
the persons 
with 
the worst 
health indicators. 
While 
the 
financing 
is 
insufficient to provide 
basic healthcare 
to 
this 
30 
percent, average 
spending per 
person 
is 
US$70 
on 
persons 
affiliated 
with 
the General 
Obligatory 
Insurance 
of 
the 
Ecuadorian Social 
Security 
Institute 
(IESS) 
and 
almost 
five 
times 
less 
on 
the 
affiliates 
of 
Rural 
Social 
Security. 
These 
disparities 
are 
even 
greater 
if 
instead 
of 
considering 
national 
averages, 
certain 
values 
are 
analyzed 
at 
a 
provincial 
level. 
BACKGROUND 
In 
1992 
a 
process 
was 
commenced 
for 
the modernization 
of 
the 
national 
government. 
As 
part 
of 
that 
effort, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
promoted 
decentralization 
of 
services 
and 
community 
participation 
in 
the management 
model. 
In 
1993 
a 
project 
was 
launched that 
was 
known 
as 
FASBASE, 
“Strengthening 
and Expanding 
the 
Scope 
of 
Basic 
Health 
Services 
in 
Ecuador” 
(Fortalecimiento 
y 
Ampliacio’n 
de 
10s 
Servicios 
Bdsicos 
de 
Salud 
en 
el 
Ecuador). 
This 
project’s 
activities, focused 
on 
the 
country’s 
7 
1 
poorest 
zones, 
was 
aimed 
at 
expanding 
the 
covered 
population 
and 
at 
increasing 
institutional 
capacity, 
so 
as 
to 
provide 
basic 
health, 
nutrition, 
and 
sanitation 
services and also 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
health 
services 
for 
the population 
at 
greatest 
risk. 
In 
1997, 
the Special 
Law 
on 
Decentralization 
of 
the State 
and 
Social Participation defined 
the 
conditions 
for 
a transfer 
of 
authority 
and 
resources 
to 
the 
municipalities 
and 
provincial 
councils. 
In 
1998, 
the 
National 
Constitutional 
Assembly 
legally 
consecrated 
the 
right 
to 
health, 
with 
an 
integral 
conception 
involving 
both 
health 
promotion 
and 
healthcare. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
reaffirmed 
the regulatory 
role 
of 
the 
State, 
the need 
to 
organize 
the 
national health 
system, 
and 
to 
implement 
a 
strategy 
of 
decentralizing 
governmental 
management. 
The 
reform 
also 
recognized 
the 
need 
to 
develop a 
new, 
competitive 
social 
security 
health 
care approach, based 
on 
universality, 
solidarity, 
and efficiency, 
while 
entrusting 
the 
Ecuadorian Social 
Security 
Institute 
(IESS) 
with 
the management 
of 
that 
system. 
As 
a complement 
to FASBASE, 
a 
project 
was 
launched 
known 
as 
MODERSA, 
“Modernization 
and Development 
of 
Comprehensive 
Health 
Services 
Networks 
(Modernizacio’n 
y 
Desarrollo 
de 
Redes 
Integrales 
de 
Sewicios 
de 
Salud) 
with 
three strategic 
pillars: 
a) 
to 
strengthen the 
Ministry 
of 
Health’s 
regulatory and supervisory role, 
b) 
to 
develop 
Decentralized 
Health 
Services 
that 
would 
function 
in 
networks, 
and 
c) 
to 
promote 
the 
Modernization 
of 
semi-autonomous 
hospitals 
that 
could 
provide 
support 
to 
those 
networks. 
In 
November 
2001, 
the 
Social 
Security 
Act 
was 
passed. 
It 
was 
then declared unconstitutional, 
however, 
in 
a 
legal 
process 
that 
has 
yet 
to 
be 
completely defined, 
and 
whose 
application 
is 
partial. 
One 
year later, the

for 
the 
entire

For 
this 
purpose, the 
law 
proposes 
to 
implement 
a Comprehensive 
Health 
Plan, 
which 
emphasizes 
primary 
care, basic services,

health promotion. The 
law 
guarantees 
the 
financing 
of 
the

creates

for 
protection 
against 
catastrophic

FRAGMENTED 
ORGANIZATION 
AND 
UNDERUTILIZED 
RESOURCES 
Ecuador’s 
health 
sector 
is 
comprised 
by 
a 
number 
of 
public 
and 
private 
institutions, 
with 
independent 
organizational 
structures 
and 
management 
mechanisms, 
and 
little 
or 
no 
interaction 
and/or 
coordination. 
Thirty 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
lacks 
access 
to 
health 
 service^.'^ 
Despite 
efforts to 
increase 
access 
to 
health 
services, 
these 
percentages 
have 
not 
significantly 
changed 
in 
recent 
years. 
Such 
deficiencies notwithstanding, Ecuador 
has 
ambulatory 
care and 
hospitals 
run 
by 
either the 
IESS 
(Ecuadorian 
Social 
Security Institute) 
or 
the 
private 
sector, 
although 
the 
geographic 
dispersion 
and 
distribution 
of 
human 
resources 
is 
not 
homogeneous 
(See 
Synopsis 
1). 
Synopsis. 
Organization 
of 
the 
Health 
Sector 
The 
public 
subsector 
is 
comprised 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health; 
the 
Ecuadorian 
Social 
Security 
Institute 
(IESS) 
with 
General 
Obligatory 
Insurance and 
Rural 
Social Security, 
the 
Health 
Service 
of 
the 
Armed 
Forces, 
and 
the 
Health 
Service 
of 
the 
Police 
(each 
with 
its 
own 
institutions). 
One 
can 
also 
consider 
some 
of 
the 
institutions 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Social Welfare 
and 
certain 
municipal 
services 
as 
forming 
a 
part 
of 
this 
sector, 
along 
with 
those 
of 
some 
private, 
non- 
profit 
institutions, 
such 
as 
the 
Welfare 
Council 
of 
Guayaquil, 
the 
Guayaquil Children’s Protection 
Society, 
the 
Red 
Cross, 
and 
the 
Society 
for 
the 
Fight 
Against 
Cancer. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Public Health 
provides health 
services 
to approximately 
31 
percent 
of 
the population, 
the 
IESS 
to 
18.0 
percent (10 
percent 
through General 
Obligatory 
Insurance 
and 
8 
percent 
through 
Rural 
Social 
Security);  the 
Armed 
Forces cover 
close 
to 
1 
percent, 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
institutions 
cover 
10 
percent. 
The private 
sector, 
with 
a 
number 
of 
independent institutions, covers 10 
percent, 
while 
as 
much 
as 
31% 
of 
the 
population 
(or more 
if 
one 
takes 
into 
consideration 
that 
part 
of 
the 
population 
covered 
by 
the 
IESS 
also 
receives services 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health), 
has 
no 
access 
to 
basic 
services. 
For 
the 
performance 
of 
its 
functions, 
in 
addition to 
service units, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
has 
Health 
Directorates 
in 
each 
province 
and Health 
Areas 
for 
each 
municipality, which 
oversee 
municipal 
health 
posts, 
health 
centers, 
and hospitals. 
The IESS 
is 
Ecuador’s social security health 
system. 
It 
also covers 
pension programs, workmen’s 
compensation, 
severance 
pay 
indemnifications,  a 
funeral 
aid 
program, 
Illness 
and 
Maternity 
Care Insurance, and 
Rural 
Social 
Security. 
For 
their 
part, 
the 
non-profit 
institutions 
are 
establishments 
with 
a very 
long 
history 
in 
the 
sector, 
and they 
have 
a 
powerful 
influence. 
In 
1999 
there were 
3,518 
service 
units, 
of 
which 
2,975 
were 
ambulatory 
care 
units 
and 
543 were 
hospital 
units.20 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Public Health 
accounted 
for 
48 percent 
of 
the 
total 
establishments 
(52.5 
percent 
of 
the 
ambulatory 
care 
units 
and 
22.3 
percent 
of 
the 
hospital 
units), 
while 
the 
IESS, 
through 
its 
General 
Obligatory 
Insurance 
and 
Rural 
Social Security, accounted 
for 
almost 
30 
percent 
(33.6 
percent 
of 
the ambulatory 
units 
and 
3.3 
percent 
of 
the 
hospital 
units). 
The 
three groups 
of 
establishments 
function 
in 
parallel, and 
in 
many 
areas 
they 
provide 
an underutilized, 
inefficient installed 
capacity. 
This 
is 
particularly 
true 
among 
the 
establishments 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
the 
General 
Obligatory 
Insurance. 
Utilization 
of 
hospital-bed capacity 
during 
the 
period 
of 
1990 
to 
1999 
fell by 
25 
percent, 
as 
a result 
of 
the 
decrease 
in 
the 
average 
hospital 
stay 
and 
a 
stable 
rate 
of 
50 
patient 
discharges 
for 
each 
:housand 
inhabitants. The 
private 
sector 
contributes 
67.6 
percent 
of 
the hospitals (148 
institutions) 
but 
only 
23 
percent 
3f 
the available 
beds 
(4,408 
beds). 
l%e 
availability 
of 
human 
resources, 
especially 
of 
physicians 
and 
professional 
nurses, 
has 
grown 
over 
the 
last 
decade, 
kom 
11.6 physicians and 
3.7 
nurses 
per 
10,000 
inhabitants 
in 
1991 
to 
14.5 
and 
5 
per 
10,000, 
respectively, 
in 
the 
year 
2000. 
In 
contrast, 
the 
number 
of 
auxiliary 
nurses 
during 
that 
period 
went 
down 
by 
12.3 
per 
10,000 
inhabitants 
to 
10.5, 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
professionalization programs and a reduced supply 
of 
training 
programs 
for 
auxiliary 
nurses. 
fie 
geographic 
distribution 
of 
human 
resources 
is 
not 
homogeneous. 
Urban 
centers and 
training 
centers 
have 
much 
iigher 
concentrations than the provinces 
of 
Amazonia, 
Esmeraldas, 
and 
Bolivar.

INSUFFICIENT 
GOVERNMENT 
SPENDING 
AND 
INEQUITABLE PRIVATE 
SPENDING 
ON 
HEALTH 
According 
to 
recent 
estimates, 
after 
the 
dramatic 32 
percent 
drop 
in 
overall 
spending 
on 
health 
in 
the 
year 1999, spending 
grew 
to 
US$1.500 
billion 
in 
2001 
(US$123 
per 
year 
per inhabitant), 
recovering 
1998 
values.’l 
These values 
are 
greater 
than 
the 
ones 
estimated 
in 
the 
National 
Accounting 
Report22, 
which would 
indicate 
that 
private 
spending 
had 
been severely 
underestimated 
and that 
it 
probably 
accounted 
for 
80 
percent 
of 
total 
health 
expenditures. 
Government 
expenditures amounted 
to 
1.7 
percent 
of 
the 
GDP, 
somewhat 
higher 
than 
the 
1.5 
percent 
figure for 
the 
year 
2002, 
but 
failed 
to 
regain 
the 2.2 
percent 
level 
of 
1997. 
As 
such, 
Ecuador 
is 
one 
.of 
the countries 
of 
Latin 
America 
with 
the 
lowest 
proportion 
of 
its 
GDP 
earmarked 
for 
public 
health 
expenditures, 
(only 
Haiti 
spends 
less). 
Owing 
to 
the crisis, the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health cut 
its 
expenditures 
from 
US$197.6 
million 
in 
1997 
to 
US$89.6 
in 
1999. 
The 
recovery 
of 
the 
GDP 
allowed 
health 
expenditures 
to 
grow 
to 
US$145 
million 
in 
2001, 
however, 
of 
which 
one-fourth 
was 
earmarked 
for 
administration 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public Health 
and 
the 
Area 
Directorates. 
As 
for 
a 
breakdown 
of 
expenditures 
by 
level 
of 
care, 
the 
Ecuadorian 
health 
system allocates 34.2 
percent 
to primary 
care, 
29.7 
percent 
to 
secondary 
care, 
and 
36.0 
percent 
to 
tertiary 
care. 
In 
terms 
of 
structure, 34.4 percent 
of 
expenditures are earmarked 
for 
hospital 
services, 29.3 
percent 
for 
medications, 
23.6 percent 
for 
ambulatory 
care, 
1 
1.7 
percent 
for 
public 
health 
services, 
and 
0.9 
percent 
for 
research. 
The 
average 
expenditure 
of 
US$123 
per inhabitant 
varies 
notably when 
viewed 
in 
terms 
of 
each 
provider’s 
expenditure 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
population 
covered. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health, 
which 
covers approximately 
3 
1 
percent 
of 
the population, 
spent 
approximately 
US$38.40 
dollars 
per 
beneficiary 
in 
2001, 
the 
IESS, 
through 
its 
General 
Obligatory 
Insurance, 
spent 
US$84.8 
million 
(US$70.5 
per 
insured party), and 
spent 
US$14 
million 
(US$14.8 
per affiliate) through 
Rural 
Social 
Security. 
The disparity 
between the 
expenditures 
on 
General 
Obligatory 
Insurance 
and 
Rural 
Social 
Security 
was 
even 
greater 
this 
year, 
since the 
level 
of 
spending 
for Rural 
Social 
Security remained 
unchanged, 
while 
it 
is 
estimated that spending 
on 
General 
Obligatory 
Insurance almost 
doubled. 
Moreover, 
the 
most 
recent 
Living 
Conditions 
Survey (1998) made 
it 
patently 
clear that the 
poorest 
of 
the 
poor 
are 
the 
group impacted 
the most 
by 
out-of-pocket 
expenses. 
Among 
the 
decile 
with 
the 
least 
income, 
health 
expenses 
represent 
40 
percent 
of 
income, 
while 
among the 
decile 
with 
the 
highest 
income, 
health 
expenses 
barely 
surpass 
5 
percent 
of 
income. 
(Figure 
5). 
NON-TRANSPARENT 
FINANCING 
According 
to 
the 
National Accounting 
Report, 
approximately 
5 
1.3 
percent 
of 
national 
spending 
on 
health 
is 
financed 
by 
public 
sources, 
that 
is, 
23.7 
percent 
from 
the general 
budget 
of 
the 
nation, 
a 
similar 
percentage (23.9 percent) 
through 
the 
social 
security 
health 
system, 
and 
the 
remaining 
3.7 
percent 
from 
other 
public 
sources. 
For 
its 
part, the 
private 
sector 
reportedly 
contributes 
46.2 
percent, 
of 
which 
34.4 
percent 
corresponds 
to 
the 
families’ 
out-of-pocket 
expenses 
and 
2.5 
percent comes 
from 
external 
sources. 
Yet 
according 
to 
the 
study that 
MODERSA 
conducted, 
private 
financing 
is 
approximately 
100 percent 
greater, 
which would 
reduce 
the 
percentages 
attributed 
to 
the 
national 
budget 
and 
the 
Social Security 
Health 
system 
by 
fifty 
percent.

LIMITED 
HEALTH 
INSURANCE 
COVERAGE 
Ecuadorians, 
or 
a 
sector 
of 
them 
(22 
percent), have 
four 
types 
of 
health 
insurance: 
General 
Obligatory 
Insurance, 
Rural 
Social 
Security, the Insurance 
of 
the 
Armed 
Forces 
and 
the 
Police, 
and insurance 
through prepaid 
healthcare companies. 
General 
Mandatory 
Insurance 
(Seguro 
General Obligatorio 
- 
SGO) 
is 
managed 
through 
the 
Ecuadorian 
Social 
Security 
Institute 
(IESS). 
Persons 
with 
steady 
employment, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
majority 
of 
self-employed 
workers, 
are 
entitled 
to 
this 
insurance. 
Though 
SGO 
Insurance 
is 
now 
obligatory, 
a 
significant 
number 
of 
workers 
are 
not 
affiliated 
with 
it. 
SGO 
is 
an 
individual 
insurance 
that 
does 
not 
cover 
one’s 
immediate 
family. 
The 
only 
exception 
is 
that 
for 
female 
affiliates, 
their 
children’s 
healthcare 
is 
covered, 
but 
only 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
life. 
The Social 
Security 
Act, 
which 
extends coverage 
to 
one’s 
dependents, 
is 
not, 
in 
fact, 
being 
applied. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
IESS 
has 
commenced 
a process 
to 
extend the 
scope 
of 
coverage. 
Thus, 
children 
under 
the 
age 
of 
six 
and 
the 
wives 
of 
affiliates 
are expected 
to 
be 
included 
by 
the year 2003. 
In 
1999, 
1,303,000 
affiliates 
(10.7 percent 
of 
the 
population) 
were 
covered 
by 
this 
insurance, 
of 
which 
1,092,000 
were 
active 
affiliates 
and 
21 
1,000 
were 
retired. 
In 
comparison 
to 
the 
number 
of 
active 
affiliates 
in 
1990, 
the current 
figure 
represents a 
growth 
of 
33.8 
percent. 
Yet 
considering 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
economically 
active 
population 
during 
this 
period, 
this 
actually 
represented a 
growth 
in 
coverage 
of 
only 
5 
percent. 
With 
the 
incorporation 
of 
family 
members 
projected 
for 
late 
2003, 
the number 
of 
affiliates 
would 
be 
two 
million, 
with 
16.5 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
covered 
by 
this 
insurance. 
The 
health 
services 
are 
preferably 
provided 
through 
the 
ESS’s 
own 
institutions, although 
expenses 
for 
services rendered at establishments 
with 
which 
agreements 
have 
been made 
are 
eventually 
compensated. 
The 
population 
generally 
considers 
this 
insurance 
to 
be 
of 
poor 
quality. 
Many 
people 
consider the 
insurance 
to 
be 
useful 
to 
them 
for 
situations necessitating 
major 
expenses, 
but 
not for 
situations 
of 
minor 
complexity. 
In 
fact, 
many 
people 
have 
additional 
private 
insurance. 
The 
SGO 
insurance 
had 
a 
financial 
deficit 
of 
close 
to 
50 
percent 
in 
1997,24 
percent 
in 
1998, 
and 
29 
percent 
in 
1999, 
which 
was 
covered 
using 
their 
returns 
on 
investments. 
Under 
the 
dollarization 
of 
Ecuador’s 
currency, 
and 
calculating contributions on 
the basis 
of 
the 
totality 
of 
revenues 
from 
private 
workers, 
the 
financing 
of 
the 
SGO 
insurance grew 
significantly, 
from 
US$59.8 
million 
in 
the 
year 
2000 
to 
US$88.1 
million 
in 
2001 
and approximately 
US$187 
million 
in 
2002. 
It 
is 
projected 
that 
revenues 
in 
2003 
will 
amount 
to 
US$237 
million. 
The Social Security 
Act 
prohibits 
cross subsidies 
between 
the 
pension 
funds 
and 
the 
health 
funds 
of 
the 
IESS. 
Rural 
Social 
Security 
(Seguro Social 
Campesino 
- 
SSQ. 
This 
insurance 
is 
also managed 
by 
the 
IESS. 
It 
is 
a voluntary 
family 
insurance, 
which 
provides 
coverage 
to 
peasants 
who 
work for 
themselves 
or 
are 
organized 
into 
cooperatives, communes, 
or 
agrarian 
associations. 
The 
population 
covered 
in 
1999 
was 200,000 
direct 
active affiliates, 
13,000 
passive 
affiliates, 
and 
737,000 
family 
members. 
As 
of 
2002, 
these 
figures have remained 
unchanged, 
and 
it 
is 
estimated that 75 
percent 
of 
the 
rural 
population 
(3 
million 
persons) 
have 
not 
even applied 
for 
coverage. 
The 
insurance covers 
medical 
and 
pharmaceutical 
services, 
with 
no 
maximum 
limit, 
and 
includes 
prevention 
and 
health 
promotion 
activities. The 
services 
are 
provided 
through 
service 
centers 
in 
the 
rural 
zones, 
and 
when a 
greater 
complexity 
is 
involved, 
through 
the 
ESS’s 
General 
Obligatory 
Insurance 
establishments, 
as 
opposed 
to 
those 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public Health. The 
insurance 
is 
paid 
for 
through 
a 
symbolic 
contribution 
from 
the 
peasants 
of 
US$O.O4 
per 
month 
and 
through 
1 
.O 
percent 
of 
the 
wages 
of 
all 
workers 
affiliated 
with 
the 
IESS, 
prorated 
as

and 
0.35

by

affiliated 
with 
the 
General 
Obligatory 
Insurance, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
contribution 
of 
1.0 
percent 
of 
the 
minimum 
wage 
from 
heads 
of 
 household^.^^ 
This 
insurance, 
which 
is 
older than the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health 
itself, 
has 
a great 
deal 
of 
meaning 
for 
the 
peasant 
population, 
who 
consider 
it 
to 
be 
a 
victory. 
Unlike 
the 
General 
Obligatory 
Insurance, 
its 
affiliates 
consider 
it 
to 
be 
“good 
insurance”. Nonetheless, 
Rural 
Social 
Security 
is 
facing 
serious 
financing 
difficulties, 
along 
with 
problems 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
supplies 
and medications. Moreover, many 
of 
its 
service 
units 
require 
maintenance. 
Their 
basic 
equipment, 
which 
is 
now 
obsolete, 
also 
needs 
to 
be upgraded. 
The Social 
Security 
Act 
extended 
the 
application 
of 
the insurance 
to 
the 
entire 
rural 
population 
either 
working 
in 
the 
fields 
or 
in 
fishing. 
Yet 
due 
to 
budgetary constraints, 
it 
has 
not 
been 
possible 
to 
actually 
extend the 
coverage. 
During 
the 
year 
2003, 
an 
additional 
100,000 
affiliates 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
covered. 
(Only 
the 
3.3 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
remaining 
to 
be 
incorporated 
into 
the 
insurance 
program).

the 
Armed

and 
the 
Police, 
for 
the 
personnel 
of 
the 
Armed 
Forces and 
the 
Police, 
and 
their direct 
relatives. 
This 
insurance covers 
approximately 
1 
percent 
of 
the 
population. 
Private 
insurance, 
according 
to 
records 
that 
are 
not 
very 
up-to-date, 
covers 
approximately 
3 
percent 
of 
the 
p~pulation.~~ 
The 
Free 
Healthcare

Act. 
This 
is 
not 
insurance 
per 
se. 
Nonetheless, 
it 
guarantees 
33 
services 
for 
expectant 
mothers 
and 
infants 
at 
no 
charge 
in 
119 
municipalities 
that 
have signed an 
agreement. 
The 
Law 
was 
passed 
in 
1998, 
but 
its 
regulations 
were 
only 
recently 
adopted, 
in 
2002. 
Users can 
receive 
care 
from 
several 
different 
services, 
particularly 
those 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health, and 
the system reimburses 
providers 
through 
a fee schedule. 
Expenditures 
for 
2002 
are 
estimated 
at 
12 
milli01-1,~~ 
and 
the 
budget 
for 
the 
coming 
year 
projects 
a 
financing 
of 
30 
million. 
This 
financing 
is 
not 
dependent 
upon 
demand, 
and 
many service 
providers 
complain 
that the 
fee 
schedule 
does 
not 
cover 
their 
costs. 
Furthermore, 
given 
the 
universal 
nature 
of 
the coverage 
under 
the 
Law, double 
coverage 
is 
being provided 
to 
persons 
who 
already 
have 
some 
type 
of 
health 
insurance.

These 
results 
illustrate 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health’s 
existing 
weaknesses 
in 
carrying 
out 
its 
planning, 
administration, 
monitoring, 
control, 
and 
evaluation 
functions. 
There 
is 
no 
single 
health 
information 
system, 
and each 
of 
the 
various 
subsystems, 
which 
in 
general are dependent 
upon 
vertical 
programs, have 
different 
percentages 
of 
underreporting. 
Their 
efforts 
overlap and they 
fail 
to 
coordinate 
with 
one another. 
Health 
promotion, 
which 
was 
recently 
prioritized 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health, 
was 
qualified 
as 
being 
minimally 
developed. 
Participation 
of 
the 
citizenry 
is 
being 
encouraged 
through 
a general 
governmental 
initiative. 
The active 
community 
role 
in 
the 
Local 
Health 
Councils, 
in 
the 
context 
of 
developing Decentralized 
Health 
Services, 
is 
an 
important 
step 
in 
that 
direction. 
As 
for 
control 
activities, 
activities 
vary depending 
upon 
the 
zone. 
For 
example, 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
surveillance 
system, 
research 
and 
control 
activities 
for 
outbreaks 
of 
disease 
and 
epidemiological 
emergencies are 
very 
limited. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
even 
though 
one- 
fourth 
of 
the 
municipalities 
have 
not 
attained 
the 
goal 
of 
95 
percent coverage, the expanded 
immunizations 
program 
has succeeded 
in 
significantly 
lowering 
the 
number 
of 
cases 
of 
neonatal 
tetanus 
(24 
in 
1998, 
14 
in 
1999 
and 
only 
6 
in 
the 
year 
2000), 
and 
no 
cases 
of 
diphtheria 
or 
measles 
have 
been 
recorded 
since 
1998. 
The 
Ministry’s 
capacity 
for 
reducing 
the 
impact 
of 
emergencies and 
disasters was 
the 
only 
aspect 
evaluated 
as 
good. 
The 
government’s 
emphasis 
on 
control 
and 
assistance 
in 
emergency situations, 
derived 
from 
the 
El 
NiAo 
phenomenon, 
has 
probably 
been the determinant 
factor 
in 
said 
regard. 
LIMITATIONS 
OF 
THE 
IESS 
HEALTH 
AREA 
Although 
the Ecuadorian 
Constitution 
considers the 
IESS 
to 
be universally 
responsible 
for 
the 
administration 
of 
insurance, 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
population 
that 
is 
insured 
continues 
to 
be 
low. 
The 
IESS 
provides 
inadequate, 
inequitable 
services, and 
the 
population 
is 
not 
satisfied 
with 
them, 
despite the 
fact 
that the 
IESS 
administers almost 
50 
percent 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
funds. 
The 
IESS 
health 
area 
is 
suffering 
from 
problems 
similar 
to 
those 
faced 
by 
the 
health 
system 
in 
general 
in 
Ecuador: 
Lack 
of 
orientation 
and 
clear 
policies. 
Constant 
changes 
in 
laws and 
regulations, 
conflicts 
of 
interest 
in 
its 
administrative functions 
(to direct, plan, 
and

the 
institution) 
and 
a 
long, 
unconcluded 
IESS 
restructuring 
process. 
Deficient allocation 
of 
resources. 
Mainly 
directed 
towards 
covering 
the 
expenses

of 
the resources 
concentrated 
on

DIFFICULTIES 
FOR 
ACHIEVING 
MILLENNIUM 
DEVELOPMENT 
GOALS. 
For 
Ecuador, 
achieving 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
is 
a 
difficult 
challenge. 
Many 
of 
the 
needed 
changes are 
beyond 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
health 
sector, 
yet 
the 
cumulative 
impact 
of 
the 
health 
sector’s 
own 
actions 
are 
indeed 
required, 
especially 
in 
terms 
of 
narrowing

RECOMMENDATIONS 
Ecuador 
must 
overcome 
a 
difficult, 
complex epidemiological 
and 
social 
scenario, 
where 
inequities 
are 
clearly 
present. 
In 
particular, 
it 
must 
meet the 
following 
challenges: 
Attain 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
regarding 
infantile malnutrition 
and 
infantile 
and maternal 
mortality, 
as 
well 
as 
mortality 
in 
the 
young 
population; expand 
basic care coverage 
and 
formal 
health 
insurance 
coverage; 
increase 
public 
investment 
in 
health, 
and 
seek 
formulas 
so 
that 
private 
spending 
will 
be more 
equitable and 
efficient; 
as 
well 
as 
develop a sectorial 
coordination 
between 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health 
and the 
health 
area 
of 
the 
IESS. 
It 
is 
clear that 
public 
investment 
in 
health 
is 
insufficient 
and 
that 
certain 
areas 
and 
services 
require 
an 
investment 
in 
upgrades 
and 
development. 
Yet for 
want 
of 
coordination 
and 
complementation, there 
is 
also a 
duplication 
of 
underutilized 
resources, 
with 
results 
that are 
far 
from 
desirable. 
Moreover, 
in 
addition 
to 
inequities 
in 
spending 
and 
in 
access 
to 
services, 
there are 
inequities 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
health 
services, 
and 
especially 
in 
their 
results. 
The universal 
programs 
approach 
(give everything 
to 
everyone) 
has 
limited 
the 
ability 
to 
set 
priorities, 
which 
has 
resulted 
in 
services 
of 
variable quality 
for 
a few, 
while 
many people receive 
no 
services at 
all. 
Extension 
of 
Access 
to 
Basic 
Services 
Universal 
coverage 
for 
all 
benefits and 
for 
the 
entire 
population 
is 
for 
now 
an 
impossibility, 
and 
such 
an 
approach 
has 
been 
one 
of 
the 
factors 
that 
has 
distorted 
an 
equitable 
distribution 
of 
spending. 
The 
idea 
of 
a 
system 
that 
guarantees 
the 
provision 
of 
a 
series 
of 
basic services 
is 
a 
rapid, 
efficient 
alternative, 
and 
has 
already 
been 
implemented, 
albeit 
with 
certain 
difficulties, 
by 
the Free Healthcare 
Maternity 
Act. 
In 
order 
to 
better develop 
this 
program, a 
targeting 
model 
should be 
utilized 
to 
avoid 
double 
coverage. 
In 
addition, 
actions 
should 
be 
taken 
to 
extend 
coverage, 
taking 
social 
and 
cultural 
aspects 
into 
consideration 
that 
limit 
the demand 
for 
basic 
services. 
A 
package 
of 
basic 
activities 
and 
services 
should 
be 
developed 
and 
gradually 
expanded 
to 
cover 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
population, especially 
aimed 
at 
achieving 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(reduction 
of 
infantile 
malnutrition, 
of 
mortality 
in 
children 
under 
5 
years 
of 
age, 
and 
of 
maternal 
mortality). 
This 
should 
include 
promotion 
and prevention 
activities, especially the 
promotion 
of 
prenatal 
care 
and 
institutionalized childbirth, 
the 
prevention 
of 
low 
birth 
weight, 
teenage 
pregnancy, 
and 
short 
intervals 
between 
pregnancies, 
and 
the 
provision 
of 
care 
to 
children 
under 
the 
age 
of 
six 
(addressing 
growth, 
development, 
and 
common childhood 
diseases).

Out 
of 
approximately 
300,000 
births 
per 
year, some 
250,000 
take 
place 
with 
no 
type 
of 
health 
insurance. 
The 
US$12 
million from 
the 
2002 budget 
for 
the 
Free 
Healthcare 
Maternity 
Act 
are 
equivalent 
to 
US$48 per 
birth, 
which would 
increase 
to 
US$120 
with 
the 
US$30 
million 
projected 
for 
2003. 
This 
figure 
is 
still 
insufficient 
when 
one 
takes 
into 
account that 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
250,000 
births 
(pregnancies, 
childbirths, 
post-partum, 
and 
care 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
life), 
these 
funds 
must 
also 
finance 
healthcare 
activities 
for 
approximately 
one 
million 
children 
between 
one 
and 
five 
years 
of 
age 
that have 
no 
health 
insurance 
coverage, 
along 
with 
a 
series 
of 
programs 
to 
stimulate 
the demand 
for 
health 
services 
among 
this 
population 
and 
promote 
reproductive 
health. 
If 
the Free 
Maternity 
Healthcare 
funds 
were 
exclusively 
earmarked 
for 
the 
uninsured population, 
estimating 
an 
average 
expenditure 
of 
US$90 
per 
birth, 
(including 
prenatal 
care, 
childbirth, 
and 
post-partum, 
along 
with 
care 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
life), 
plus 
US$30 
for 
each 
child 
between 
one 
and 
five 
years 
of 
age 
and 
for 
promotional 
programs, an 
additional 
US$22.5 
million 
would 
be 
required 
in 
2003. 
The information 
system 
for 
the 
management 
of 
the Free 
Healthcare 
Maternity 
Act 
must 
also 
monitor 
indicators 
for 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
and 
for 
their 
respective 
risk 
factors. 
The 
possibility 
of 
progressively 
including children 
of 
up 
to 
13 years 
of 
age 
in 
the 
program 
should 
be 
evaluated. 
Health 
expenses 
for 
the 
population 
between 
6 
and 
13 
years 
of 
age 
is 
much 
less 
than 
for 
children 
under 
the 
age 
of 
six. Moreover, 
this 
group 
has 
no 
health 
coverage 
through 
other 
mechanisms. 
In 
order 
to 
reach 
the 
population 
most 
in 
need, 
it 
is 
also essential that 
efforts 
to 
implement 
the Free 
Healthcare 
Maternity 
Act 
be 
integrated 
with 
Rural 
Social 
Security. 
Rural 
Social 
Security 
has 
financial limitations 
in 
the short 
term 
that 
prevent 
it 
from 
extending 
its 
coverage 
to 
the 
remaining 
three 
million 
targeted 
beneficiaries. 
Thus, 
the uninsured maternal 
and 
infantile population 
depends 
upon 
the Free 
Healthcare 
Matemity 
Act 
for 
its 
care. 
For 
this 
reason, 
a 
closer 
collaboration 
should 
be sought 
between 
Rural 
Social Security 
services 
and Free Healthcare 
Maternity 
activities, 
by 
creating 
mechanisms 
that 
allow 
Free Healthcare 
Maternity 
beneficiaries 
to be 
serviced 
at 
Rural 
Social 
Security 
establishments. 
In 
order 
to 
extend 
access 
to 
basic 
services 
so 
as 
to 
include retired 
persons 
and the 
disabled, 
access 
to 
these 
services 
should 
be made 
available 
through 
the 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program 
earmarked 
for 
this 
population. Such 
a 
mechanism 
could 
take 
advantage 
of 
part 
of 
that 
subsidy 
program’s operating and targeting 
structure. 
In 
this 
way, 
coverage 
could be 
offered 
to 
approximately 
230,000 retirees 
and 
8,000 
disabled 
persons 
who 
have 
no 
other healthcare 
resource. These 
services 
should include preventive 
and 
promotional 
activities, 
ambulatory 
care, 
and 
hospitalization 
for 
common 
acute 
diseases, 
as 
well 
as 
a basic package 
for 
chronic 
diseases 
and 
surgery. 
Estimating 
a cost 
per 
person 
of 
US$SO, 
the 
additional 
cost 
of 
these 
services 
would 
be 
US$19 
million. 
Nonetheless, 
an 
actuarial 
calculation 
would 
have 
to 
be 
made, 
based 
on 
a 
profile 
of 
the 
population 
and 
a 
definition 
of 
the services, 
so 
as 
to 
attain 
a 
more 
accurate estimate. 
a 
mid- 
and 
long-term 
action, an attempt 
should 
be 
made 
to 
expand 
the 
population 
coverage 
of 
Rural 
Social 
Security and 
of 
the 
General 
Obligatory 
Insurance, 
while 
creating 
an 
insurance 
for 
the 
low-income 
population 
to 
gradually 
replace the benefits 
of 
the Free 
Healthcare 
Maternity 
Act 
and 
the services 
of 
the 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash 
Subsidy Program.

Decentralization 
for 
a 
Better 
Supply 
of 
Health 
Services 
The 
use 
of 
local 
managers 
and 
planners, 
closer 
to 
the 
communities they 
serve, 
would 
increase the 
possibilities 
for 
community involvement 
in 
decision-making 
regarding 
the design 
and operation 
of 
the services. Such 
community 
involvement 
is 
a 
factor 
that promotes demand. 
Nonetheless, 
health 
services 
are 
still 
very 
much 
dependent 
upon 
a 
Ministry 
provider. 
An 
accelerated 
decentralization 
would 
contribute 
to 
a 
deterioration 
in 
the 
supply 
of 
health 
services, 
and 
prior 
training 
efforts 
are needed. 
Decentralization 
of 
health 
services 
should 
be 
considered 
a 
first 
step 
in 
a 
long-term 
decentralization, and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
should 
continue 
moving 
this 
process 
along. 
In 
doing 
so, 
it 
should 
build 
on 
the experiences 
of 
MODERSA 
(“Modernization 
and 
Development 
of 
Comprehensive 
Health 
Services 
Networks” 
- 
Mudernizacio’n 
y 
DesarrulZu 
de 
Redes 
Integrales 
de 
Sewicios 
de 
Salud) 
and 
utilize 
the 
decentralization 
to 
strengthen 
its 
administrative 
role. 
An 
evaluation should 
be 
made 
in 
each 
particular 
case 
of 
the 
operative 
conditions 
for 
the decentralization. 
In 
addition, 
encouragement 
should 
be 
given 
for 
health 
centers 
and 
hospitals 
to 
develop capabilities 
so 
that they 
can 
define 
their 
own 
baselines, 
priorities, 
objectives, 
and 
management 
commitment 
goals, 
formulate 
plans 
of 
action 
and 
budgets, 
and 
develop 
periodic, 
systematic 
evaluation 
mechanisms 
of 
their 
results. 
Sectorial Coordination 
and 
the 
Future for 
the Ministry of 
Public 
Health 
and 
the 
IESS 
Bearing 
in 
mind 
the 
opportunity 
for 
change that a 
new administration 
of 
government 
creates, 
consideration 
should 
be 
given 
in 
the short 
term 
to 
preparatory 
changes 
aimed 
at 
improved 
coordination 
of 
the 
health 
sector, 
so 
that 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public Health 
can 
properly 
perform 
its 
essential 
public 
health 
functions, 
and 
so 
that 
the 
health 
area 
of 
the 
IESS 
can, 
in 
the long-term, 
manage a 
national 
health 
coverage system. 
The 
regulations 
for 
the 
Organic 
Law 
on 
the 
National 
Health 
System 
create an 
opportunity 
for 
this 
process. 
Given 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
clear 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
the 
Social 
Security 
health 
system, 
those 
regulations 
need 
to 
be 
rapidly 
defined 
and applied 
to 
the 
Organic 
Law 
on 
the 
National 
Health 
System. 
The 
regulatory framework 
needs 
to 
be 
developed, 
and 
the 
groundwork 
needs 
to 
be 
laid 
for 
a 
system 
of 
regional 
health 
service 
networks 
structured 
into 
tiered 
levels 
of 
complexity, 
with 
participation 
from 
establishments 
affiliated 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health 
and 
decentralized 
establishments, 
as 
well 
as 
those 
affiliated 
with 
General 
Obligatory 
Insurance and 
Rural 
Social 
Security. 
The 
local 
levels 
should 
focus 
their efforts 
on 
primary 
care 
and 
basic services programs, 
while 
specialized 
institutions and 
network 
hubs 
should 
focus 
on 
technical and 
logistic 
support 
to 
resolve more complex 
situations. 
The 
networks should 
operate 
with 
referral 
systems 
and 
a 
training 
program 
for 
human 
resources 
in 
primary 
care, 
promoting 
the 
concept 
of 
working 
as 
a 
network. 
The 
signing 
of 
management 
commitments should be 
encouraged. These management 
commitments should 
stimulate the demand 
for 
basic 
health 
services 
among the 
population 
and 
award 
the 
attainment 
of 
indicators 
that 
exhibit 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
quantity and 
quality 
of 
coverage. 
While 
the 
process 
of 
decentralization 
is 
underway, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health 
should 
consider 
developing 
a comprehensive 
program 
for 
executing 
its 
functions 
as 
a 
regulating 
body, 
taking 
the 
following 
aspects 
into 
consideration: 
implementation 
of 
an 
accreditation mechanism 
for 
establishments, 
bearing 
in 
mind 
their 
levels 
of 
complexity 
and 
the services 
they 
offer, 
along 
with 
systems 
for 
monitoring 
their 
production quality 
and 
results; a 
review 
and 
modernization 
of 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
National Hygiene 
Institute, 
(its 
procedures 
for 
record-keeping, 
quality 
control, 
and 
approval 
of 
medications 
and 
medical 
supplies; 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
production 
of 
biologics 
and 
87 
Page  96
as 
a 
public 
health 
laboratory); 
strengthening 
of 
control 
strategies 
for 
enforcement 
of 
regulations 
on 
the treatment 
of 
solid 
waste 
generated 
by 
hospitals, 
as 
well 
as 
food 
safety, 
air 
quality, 
and 
potable 
water; 
improvement 
of 
the 
vital 
statistics system 
to 
reduce 
underreporting 
and raise the 
quality 
of 
death 
certifications; 
strengthening 
of 
the 
health surveillance 
system 
and capacity- 
building 
for 
intervention 
in 
situations 
of 
epidemiological 
risk 
and 
disease 
outbreaks; 
and 
the 
training 
of 
Human 
Resources. 
Parallel 
thereto, a 
modernization 
program 
for 
the 
health 
area 
of 
the 
IESS 
should 
be developed, 
involving both 
promotional 
and 
preventive 
activities; 
which would 
develop 
forms 
of 
service 
provisioning, contracting 
systems, 
and 
risk-management 
systems; 
along 
with 
mechanisms that 
allow 
the 
insured party 
to 
freely 
choose 
his 
or 
her provider; 
the 
design 
of 
systems 
to 
prevent 
increased 
costs; 
the development 
of 
mechanisms 
for 
coordination 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
health 
system, 
especially 
the 
Ministry 
of 
mtblic 
Health; 
the 
development 
of 
changes 
in 
financial 
transactions, 
with 
a 
migration 
from 
historically 
budgeted 
funding 
to 
payment 
for 
services 
rendered, 
depending 
upon 
the 
capacity 
for 
local 
management; 
the 
development 
of 
a 
human 
resources 
training 
program; the 
improvement 
of 
mechanisms 
for 
the 
contracting 
of 
services 
in 
order 
to 
promote 
competence, 
including 
capitation 
systems 
with 
management 
commitments; and 
the implementation 
of 
a system 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
quality 
and 
results.

A. 
MAIN 
ISSUES 
ON 
SOCIAL 
ASSISTANCE 
IN 
ECUADOR 
PRINCIPAL 
FEATURES 
dF 
THE 
SOCIAL 
ASSISTANCE 
SYSTEM 
A 
social 
assistance system can 
be 
defined 
as 
a 
set 
of 
programs designed 
to 
protect vulnerable 
population 
groups 
(chronic 
or 
temporary) against 
specific 
risks 
that threaten 
their well-being. 
Such 
a 
system 
should 
be 
comprised 
of 
structural 
elements 
as 
well 
as 
anticyclic 
elements. 
Programs 
of 
the structural type 
attempt 
to 
raise the standard 
of 
living 
and 
well-being 
of 
persons 
in 
situations 
of 
chronic 
poverty, that 
is, 
persons 
who 
face 
a 
prolonged 
impossibility 
of 
subsisting 
or 
generating 
an 
adequate 
level 
of 
income 
on 
their own. 
Anticyclic 
programs 
aim 
to 
protect 
individuals 
against temporary 
reductions 
in 
their 
income 
or 
well-being, and 
are 
fundamental 
in 
times 
of 
crisis, 
when 
the number 
of 
poor 
increases 
as 
a consequence 
of 
temporary impacts 
on 
major 
sectors 
of 
the 
population. 
A 
typical 
example 
of 
a 
classically 
anticyclic program 
-although 
it 
is 
actually 
insurance- 
is 
unemployment 
insurance. 
In 
times 
of 
crisis, 
when 
the 
number 
of 
unemployed 
increases, 
the 
base 
of 
the insurance also 
expands; once 
the 
crisis 
is 
over, 
the 
base 
of 
the 
insurance 
contracts. 
A 
system 
can 
be 
comprised 
by 
a great 
variety 
of 
programs. There 
are 
programs 
for 
the supply 
of 
goods 
and 
services, 
such 
as 
in-kind 
transfers 
and 
subsidies 
on 
the 
consumption 
of 
certain 
goods; 
demand-based 
programs, such 
as 
money transfers; 
and 
programs that 
help 
generate 
income 
in 
families 
by 
providing 
temporary employment. 
Many 
of 
these 
programs 
are 
represented 
in 
the 
social 
assistance 
system 
of 
Ecuador. 
In 
fact, there 
are 
22 
social 
assistance 
programs 
in 
Ecuador designated 
as 
Priority 
Programs 
by 
the 
Frente 
Social, 
an 
entity 
that attempts 
to 
coordinate the 
social 
assistance 
activities 
of 
the ministries 
of 
Education, Health, 
Social 
Welfare, 
and 
Urban 
Development and 
Housing, 
which 
are 
the entities that 
administer 
these 
programs.28 
The 
Priority 
Programs came 
into 
being 
in 
the 
year 
2000 
with 
the 
design 
of 
the Emergency 
Social Plan 
in 
an 
attempt 
to confront 
the 
crisis. 
Table 
1 
summarizes the 
principal 
features 
of 
the 
Priority 
Programs. 
In 
2001, 
Ecuador 
spent 
close 
to 
US$264 
million 
on 
its 
Priority 
Programs, 
or 
approximately 
1.5 
percent 
of 
its 
GDP. 
Out 
of 
that 
sum, 
approximately 
60 
percent 
is 
represented 
by 
two 
money-transfer 
programs, the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash Subsidy 
Program 
and the 
Scholarship 
Program 
(Beca 
Escolar), 
the 
latter 
of 
which 
has 
a 
minimal 
budget 
as 
is 
at an 
experimental 
stage. 
The 
rest 
involve food 
and 
nutrition, 
education, 
childcare 
for 
children 
between 
zero 
and 
six 
years 
of 
age, 
healthcare, and 
construction 
of 
housing. 
This 
list 
does 
not 
include 
subsidies 
on 
gas 
and gasoline consumption, 
which, 
represented 
approximately 
US$350 
million 
in 
transfers 
to 
households 
in 
the year 
2000, 
and 
almost 
US$500 
million 
in 
total.

22 
programs

Table

summarizes the 
outstanding 
features 
of 
the most 
significant 
social 
assistance 
programs. 
In 
terms 
of 
coverage 
and 
budget, 
the 
two 
foremost programs 
are 
the School 
Breakfast and 
Lunch 
program, 
with 
an implemented 
budget 
of 
US$24 
million 
in 
2001, 
and 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program, 
with 
a budget 
of 
US$154.5 
million 
in 
2001. 
In 
general, 
it 
is 
noted 
that the 
system 
is 
comprised 
by 
a 
great 
number 
of 
programs 
that, 
in 
their majority, 
are 
not 
inter- 
coordinated, and 
some 
of 
which 
overlap 
one another 
in 
terms 
of 
their 
objectives 
and 
the 
population 
they cover. 
In 
addition, 
the 
programs 
are 
administered 
by 
many 
different 
players. 
Some recent 
programs, 
such 
as 
the Scholarship 
Program, represent a 
fundamental 
change. 
Indeed, 
this 
program 
pioneered 
in 
the use 
of 
a 
clear 
targeting 
tool, 
a system 
known 
as 
SELBEN, 
the 
Ecuadorian 
Beneficiary Identification 
and Selection System 
(Sistemu 
de 
Zdentificucidn 
y 
Seleccidn 
de 
Beneficiurios), 
and 
it 
also 
provides money 
transfers 
in 
an 
attempt 
to 
influence 
the 
behavior 
of 
the beneficiaries.

SUPPLY AND 
DEMAND 
FOR 
SOCIAL 
ASSISTANCE 
VULNERABLE 
GROUPS 
One 
methodological 
framework 
for 
evaluating 
social protection 
programs 
is 
known 
as 
the 
Social 
Risk 
Management 
Framework*’. 
The 
concept 
of 
Social 
Risk 
Management 
is 
based 
on 
the 
idea 
that 
individuals 
are subject 
to 
unexpected shocks that 
affect their 
capacity 
to 
generate 
income. 
In 
some 
cases, 
the 
shock 
is 
permanent 
in 
nature, 
while 
in 
other 
cases 
it 
is 
purely 
temporary. 
Optimal 
risk 
management consists 
of 
a 
series 
of 
mechanisms 
to 
prevent 
and 
mitigate 
the 
risk 
in 
question, 
and, 
as 
a 
last 
resort, 
activities 
to 
aid 
those 
affected, 
so 
that 
they 
can 
withstand the negative effects 
of 
the shocks 
in 
minimize 
their 
adverse 
effect. 
The 
mechanisms 
so 
utilized include 
social 
security 
health 
systems 
and 
social 
assistance 
systems. 
This 
framework 
for 
evaluating 
the 
social 
assistance 
system 
involves 
the 
following 
steps: 
First, 
a 
determination 
is 
made 
of 
the 
potential 
demand 
for 
social 
assistance, 
as 
a 
function 
of 
the 
risks 
associated 
with 
the 
various 
population 
groups. 
Second, 
an 
evaluation 
is 
made 
of 
the 
mechanisms 
that 
these 
groups 
employ 
in 
order 
to 
cope 
with 
those 
risks, 
and 
how 
such 
mechanisms 
could 
affect 
the 
well-being 
of 
the respective groups. 
Third, 
a survey 
is 
conducted 
among the 
groups 
that 
face 
a 
high-risk 
of 
temporary impacts 
as 
a consequence 
of 
a crisis, 
or 
of 
permanent 
impacts 
due 
to 
a 
chronic 
impossibility 
of 
generating 
income. Fourth, 
an 
evaluation 
is 
made 
of 
the 
features 
of 
the 
current social 
assistance 
programs 
in 
light 
of 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
population, especially the 
needs 
of 
vulnerable groups 
as 
determined 
above. 
Finally, 
a 
decision 
is 
taken 
regarding 
measures 
to 
be 
implemented, 
aimed 
at 
improving 
the 
contribution 
of 
programs 
in 
effect 
to 
the 
well-being 
of 
groups 
who 
are 
in 
need 
of 
social 
assistance. 
A 
study 
of 
poverty 
in 
Ecuador 
(Le6n 
(2002)) 
maintains 
that 
“recent” 
poverty 
in 
Ecuador doubled 
between 1998 
and 
1999. “Recent” 
poverty refers 
to 
households that 
are 
below 
the 
poverty 
line, 
but 
whose 
basic 
needs are 
satisfied. 
This 
means 
that 
the households 
in 
question 
are 
confronting 
a 
situation 
of 
temporary poverty, 
where 
their 
standard 
of 
living 
has 
been reduced, 
but 
not for 
so 
long 
that 
their 
basic 
needs 
are 
affected. 
When 
households 
have 
lived 
in 
poverty over 
a 
long 
period 
of 
time, 
their 
basic 
needs 
go 
unsatisfied. 
That 
population, 
which 
lives 
in 
conditions 
of 
poverty 
qualified 
as 
“chronic,”  increased 
from 
28 
to 
36 
percent 
between 1995 
and 
1999. 
It 
is 
interesting 
to 
observe that the increase 
in 
temporary 
or 
recent 
poverty 
was 
principally 
seen 
in 
urban 
zones, 
while 
the increase 
in 
chronic 
poverty 
is 
both 
an 
urban 
and 
a 
rural 
phenomenon. 
The 
unemployment 
rate 
also increased 
notably 
during 
the 
period 
of 
crisis. 
While for 
the 
15 
to 
28 
year-old 
age 
group, 
unemployment 
rose 
from 
15.3 
to 
27.8 
percent between 
1998 
to 
1999, 
unemployment 
for 
the 
29 
to 
44 
year-old 
age 
group 
rose 
from 
5.4 
to 
11 
percent. 
In 
total, 
the 
unemployment rate 
doubled, 
from 
8.5 
percent 
in 
May 
1998 
to 
16.9 
percent 
in 
August 
1999. 
Underemployment 
also 
increased 
significantly. 
The 
increase 
in 
the 
inflation 
rate, 
the 
depreciation 
of 
the 
Sucre, 
and the 
subsequent 
dollarization 
of 
the 
economy 
may 
have increased the 
number 
of 
recent 
poor. 
The 
inflation 
rate 
was 
52 
percent 
in 
1999 and 
96.1 percent 
in 
the 
year 
2000. 
Many 
families who 
were 
not 
poor 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
period 
may 
have 
been 
affected 
by 
the 
depreciation 
of 
the 
Sucre 
if 
they 
had 
debts 
in 
dollars. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
those 
with 
savings 
in 
Sucres 
suffered 
from 
the 
freeze 
on 
deposits 
ordered 
by 
the 
government 
in 
March 
1999 
and 
the 
high 
inflation 
and 
depreciation 
rates 
that 
eroded the value 
of 
their 
savings. 
According 
to 
the survey 
of 
households 
of 
1998, 
approximately 
25 
percent 
of 
the 
families 
in 
the 
third 
quintile 
of 
consumption 
had 
savings accounts. 
The 
most 
vulnerable 
age 
groups 
in 
Ecuadorian society 
are 
poor children 
and 
pre-teens, 
pregnant 
women 
in 
conditions 
of 
poverty, 
and 
elderly 
persons 
with 
no 
formal 
income. 
In 
fact, 
families

Risk

Bank 
(2001).

children under 
two 
years 
of 
age, 
and 
to 
a 
lesser 
extent 
families 
that 
include 
older 
children 
or 
elderly 
persons, 
have a 
higher probability 
of 
being 
poor. 
Indigent 
families 
include, 
on 
an 
average, 
a 
higher number 
of 
elderly 
persons and 
children 
between zero and 
two 
years 
of 
age. 
According 
to 
the 
Living 
Conditions 
Survey 
of 
1998, 
the percentage 
of 
chronic 
malnutrition 
among 
children 
between 
zero 
and 
two 
years 
of 
age 
in 
the 
first 
income 
quintile 
was 
32.5 
percent, 
while 
the percentage 
of 
low 
weight-for-age 
was 
24.3 
percent. 
Both 
these 
figures 
are 
far 
above 
average 
for 
that 
age 
group. 
This 
situation 
was 
also 
seen, 
to 
an 
even worse extent, 
in 
the 
group 
of 
children 
between 
three 
and 
five 
years 
of 
age, 
where the percentage 
of 
chronic 
malnutrition 
was 
44 
percent 
in 
the 
lowest 
quintile, 
as 
compared 
to 
an 
average 
of 
29 percent 
in 
the general 
population. 
Among 
this 
group, 
the 
percentage 
of low 
weight-for-age 
was 
23.3 
percent 
as 
compared 
to 
14 
percent 
overall. 
The National 
Children's 
and 
Family 
Institute 
(INNFA) 
[Znstituto 
Nacional 
de 
la 
NiAez 
y 
la 
Familia] 
reports that 
approximately 
660,000 
children 
between 
zero 
and 
five 
years 
of 
age 
show 
signs 
of 
acute, 
chronic malnutrition. 
The 
group 
of 
school-age 
children 
in 
the 
poorest 
quintile 
is 
also subject 
to 
numerous 
risks, 
especially 
malnutrition 
and 
limited 
formation 
of 
human 
capital. Pre-school education 
for 
this 
group 
is 
very 
low, 
with 
levels 
of 
attendance 
at 
10 
percent 
(as 
compared 
to 
30 
percent 
for 
the 
highest quintile). 
The 
disparity 
between 
levels 
of 
income 
is 
particularly 
notable 
for 
secondary 
schools, 
with 
net 
attendance rates 
of 
44 
percent 
for 
the 
country 
as 
a whole, 
but only 
19 
percent 
for 
the 
lowest quintile. 
A 
parallel 
phenomenon 
to 
low 
school 
attendance 
is 
that 
of 
children 
who 
work, 
with 
21 
percent 
of 
children 
between 
10 
and 
15 years 
of 
age 
working 
and 
not 
attending 
school 
in 
1998. 
According 
to 
data 
from 
the 
Integrated 
Social Indicators 
System 
of 
Ecuador (SIISE) 
[Sistema 
Zntegrado de 
Indicadores 
Sociales 
de 
Ecuador], 
in 
Ecuador 
there are 
1,050,802 
children 
who 
work, 
32.5 
percent 
of 
whom 
are 
between 
five 
and 
nine 
years 
of 
age, 
and the 
rest 
of 
whom 
are between 
10 
and 
17 
years 
of 
age. 
According to 
the 
Demographic 
Survey 
and 
the 
Survey 
on 
Maternal 
and 
Infantile 
Health, 
there 
were 
no 
significant 
changes 
in 
the percentage 
of 
children 
who 
received 
healthcare 
and 
follow-up 
during 
the 
first 
five 
years 
of 
life 
between 1994 
and 
1999. 
Though 
the 
prevalence 
of 
diseases 
such 
as 
diarrhea 
and 
acute 
respiratory 
infections 
went 
down 
for 
the 
country 
as 
a 
whole, 
an a increase 
was 
seen 
in 
the 
incidence 
of 
both 
these 
ailments 
for 
the 
group 
of 
mothers 
without 
schooling, 
which 
is 
an 
approximate 
indicator 
of 
low-levels 
of 
income. 
A 
similar 
trend 
was 
seen 
for 
vaccination 
rates. 
When 
observing 
the 
percentages 
of 
children 
under 
one year 
of 
age 
who 
received complete 
vaccinations, a 
significant deterioration 
was 
seen 
between 1994 and 
1999, 
especially 
in 
rural 
zones 
and 
in 
families 
where 
the 
mother 
has 
no 
schooling. 
In 
these 
families, 
the 
percentage 
who 
received 
complete 
vaccinations 
declined 
from 
26 
to 
16 percent. 
This 
might 
reflect 
a 
deterioration 
of 
healthcare 
conditions 
as 
a consequence 
of 
the 
crisis. 
The 
elderly 
without 
coverage are 
an 
especially 
vulnerable group. 
Poverty 
statistics 
indicate 
that 
families 
with 
elderly 
persons 
in 
their 
nuclear 
family 
unit 
have 
a 
13 
percent greater 
probability 
than 
the average 
population 
of 
being 
poor. 
From 
1990 
to 
2001, 
the 
proportion 
of 
persons 
more 
than 
60 
years 
of 
age 
rose 
from 
6 
to 
9 percent, 
and 
in 
1999, 
illiteracy 
was 
seen 
in 
34 percent 
of 
the 
elderly. 
Five 
out 
of 
every 
100 
poor 
were 
elderly3'. 
The 
coverage 
of 
the 
social 
security 
health 
system 
is 
minimal, 
as 
only 
23 percent 
of 
Ecuadorians 
over 
the 
age 
of 
60 
is 
affiliated 
with 
the 
IESS. 
In 
this 
context, many 
elderly 
persons 
belong 
to 
multigenerational 
households 
(54 
percent 
of 
the 
elderly 
live 
in 
this 
type 
of 
household). 
A 
social 
assistance 
program 
does 
target 
this 
population 
group, 
as 
according 
to 
the 
Living 
Conditions 
Survey 
of 
1999,30 
percent 
of 
Ecuadorians 
over 
the 
age 
of 
65 
were 
receiving 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash 
Subsidy. 
Currently, 
the 
subsidy

SOCIAL 
RISK 
MANAGEMENT 
STRATEGIES 
The 
Living 
Conditions 
Survey and 
information 
from 
a 
qualitative 
study 
aimed 
at 
determining 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
crisis 
in 
Ecuador, 
reveal 
a 
series 
of 
behaviors that 
could 
be 
considered 
to 
constitute 
social 
risk 
management. 
Many 
of 
the 
behaviors 
that 
households are 
employing 
could 
have 
a 
negative 
impact 
on 
the 
future well-being 
of 
their 
members, 
and 
the 
social 
assistance 
system aims 
in 
part 
to 
prevent 
these 
behaviors 
from 
being maintained 
for 
prolonged 
periods 
of 
time: 
* 
Child 
labor: 
According 
to 
a 
2001 
UNICEF 
study 
-based 
on 
the 
Living 
Conditions 
Survey 
of 
1999, 
there were 
136,700 
children 
in 
Ecuador between 
five 
and 
nine 
years 
of 
age 
and 
914,000 
between 
10 
and 
17 
years 
of 
age 
who 
were 
~orking.~’ 
This 
is 
not 
necessarily 
due 
to 
the 
crisis, and may have 
already 
existed, 
but 
some 
households 
have 
indeed coped 
with 
the 
crisis 
by 
incorporating more 
members 
of 
the 
family 
into 
the 
labor market 
in 
order 
to 
generate 
income. 
The 
percentage 
of 
children 
between 
10 
and 
15 years 
of 
age 
who 
were 
working 
and 
not 
studying 
remained more 
or 
less 
constant 
between 
1998 
and 
1999, 
and 
the 
same 
constancy 
was seen 
in 
the 
gross 
attendance 
rate. Nonetheless, the 
number 
of 
days absent 
from 
school 
almost 
doubled, 
from 
5.4 
to 
10.5 
days 
per 
month. 
This 
may reflect 
a 
deterioration 
in 
the supply 
of 
education 
or 
problems 
with 
transportation and 
other 
social 
services, 
on 
account 
of 
which 
it 
has 
become 
more 
difficult 
to 
attend 
school, 
but 
it 
may 
also 
be 
due 
to 
the 
alternative 
use 
of 
time 
by 
children 
on 
temporary 
jobs. 
In 
many 
cases, 
even where 
no 
drop 
has 
been 
seen 
in 
school 
attendance, 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
education 
received, 
which 
is 
much 
more 
difficult 
to 
measure, 
could 
have been 
affected 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
crisis. 
+ 
Reduction 
in 
consumption: 
A 
recent 
IDB 
study (2002) 
cites 
data 
from 
1999, 
which 
indicates that 
95 
percent 
of 
the 
beneficiary 
households 
of 
the 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program 
have reduced their 
consumption 
of 
food, and 58 
percent 
have 
reduced 
their 
number 
of 
meals 
per 
day. 
Information 
is 
also 
found 
in 
interviews 
with 
focus groups conducted 
in 
July 
1999 
(World 
Bank, 
2000), 
which 
reported 
a 
drop 
in 
consumption 
of 
proteins and 
minerals, 
and 
an increase 
in 
the 
consumption 
of 
carbohydrates 
and

PROBLEMS 
OF 
THE 
SOCIAL 
ASSISTANCE 
SYSTEM 
Lack 
of 
Flexibility. 
With 
a budget 
of 
between 
1 
and 
1.5 
percent 
of 
the 
GDP 
earmarked 
for 
social 
assistance, 
spending 
on 
social 
assistance 
in 
Ecuador 
is 
average 
for 
the 
region32. 
Nonetheless, the 
system 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
have 
the 
capacity 
to 
adapt 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
population, that 
is 
to 
say, 
to 
expand 
in 
times 
of 
crisis 
and 
contract under 
normal 
circumstances. 
The 
system’s 
lack 
of 
flexibility 
is 
a 
result 
of 
the nature 
of 
its 
budget, 
problems 
of 
coverage, 
and the 
design 
of 
programs. 
Flexibility 
in 
the 
Budget. 
A 
recent analysis 
of 
trends 
in 
social 
spending 
between 1970 
and 
2002, 
Vos 
et 
al., 
(2002) 
argues 
that social 
spending 
as 
a 
whole 
has 
been 
procyclic, 
although 
volatility 
varies 
according 
to 
the category 
of 
the 
expenditure 
-education, 
health, 
social security 
healthcare, 
and 
social 
assistance. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
social 
assistance, 
the 
trend 
is 
principally 
non-cyclical, 
as 
it 
is 
characterized 
by 
a 
relatively 
inflexible 
budget that 
is 
not 
correlated 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
social 
protection 
of 
vulnerable 
groups 
during 
times 
of 
crisis. 
Over 
the 
past 
two 
years, 
social 
assistance 
spending 
has 
increased, 
to 
the detriment 
of 
spending 
on 
health 
and 
education. 
This 
is 
primarily 
a 
consequence 
of 
the creation 
of 
money 
transfer 
programs 
such 
as 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program. 
Nonetheless, the 
trend 
over 
the past 
two 
decades 
has 
been 
a decline 
in 
social 
spending 
as 
a 
whole. 
The 
social 
assistance 
budget 
not 
only 
needs 
to be flexible 
-and 
wherever 
possible 
anticyclic, 
it 
is 
also 
necessary 
to 
protect 
the 
budgets 
of 
certain 
priority 
programs 
in 
order 
to 
guarantee 
their long- 
term 
sustainability. 
If 
minimum 
floors 
were established 
-in 
terms 
of 
absolute 
value 
- 
for 
the 
budgets 
of 
some 
programs, 
this 
in 
fact 
would 
add an 
anticyclic 
component 
to 
the social 
assistance 
system. 
Currently 
there 
are 
no 
guarantees 
regarding 
the 
continuity 
of 
several 
social 
programs, 
as 
the 
budgets 
are 
not 
protected 
in 
the future. 
Although 
the 
World 
Bank 
Structural Adjustment 
Loan 
for 
the 
year 
2000 
included 
a 
commitment 
from 
the government 
to 
maintain 
minimum 
floors 
for 
social 
programs 
in 
terms 
of 
absolute value 
for 
2000 and 
2001, there 
are 
no 
similar 
figures 
for 
2002 
and 
the 
following 
years. 
Flexibility 
in 
Coverage. 
The 
programs 
do not 
have 
an 
automatic 
mechanism that 
allows them 
to 
be 
rapidly 
updated. 
This 
is 
especially 
necessary 
for 
anticyclic 
programs 
aimed 
at 
providing 
temporary social 
assistance 
in 
times 
of 
crisis. 
In 
these 
cases, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
be 
able 
to enroll 
beneficiaries 
at 
various times 
during 
the 
life 
of 
the program, 
and, 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
remove 
beneficiaries 
from 
the 
system 
when 
they 
no 
longer require 
assistance. 
For 
example, 
the 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program enrolled 
beneficiaries 
when 
it 
was 
launched 
in 
1998 
only. 
In 
successive 
years 
the 
beneficiary 
base 
was 
screened 
and 
non-eligible 
households 
were eliminated, 
yet 
no 
mechanism 
was 
ever 
designed 
to 
enroll 
new 
beneficiaries. 
Some supply-based 
programs 
are updated, 
which 
allows 
for 
the 
enrollment 
of 
new 
beneficiaries, 
but 
no 
systematic 
mechanism 
exists. 
Rather, the 
review 
of 
the 
beneficiary 
base 
is 
made 
on 
an 
ad 
hoc 
basis. 
Flexibility 
in 
Design. 
At 
this 
time 
there 
is 
no 
program 
that 
is 
classically anticyclic. 
Anticyclic 
programs 
contain 
automatic adjustment 
mechanisms 
that 
allow 
the 
beneficiary 
base 
to 
be 
increased 
in 
times 
of 
crisis. 
For 
example, 
programs that 
provide 
temporary 
employment 
with 
a

For 
example, 
in 
1999 
Argentina

approximately

Mexico

Nicaragua 
1.1 
percent, 
Peru

percent, 
and Venezuela 1 percent

Lindert 
(2001)).

self-targeting 
criterion 
and 
sufficiently 
low 
wages 
are 
clearly anticyclic, 
as 
only 
during 
a 
crisis 
is 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
taking 
such 
employment 
sufficiently 
low, 
and 
therefore 
the 
beneficiary 
base 
increases. 
Absence 
of 
Consistent 
Targeting 
Criteria 
and 
Regressivity 
in 
the 
System’s 
Programs. 
The 
social 
assistance 
system 
in 
Ecuador includes 
both 
universal 
and 
targeted programs. 
In 
general, 
it 
is 
observed that 
many 
of 
the 
universal 
programs 
tend 
to 
be 
regressive, 
as 
a 
high 
percentage 
of 
the 
expenditure 
on 
those 
programs 
ends 
up 
benefiting 
the 
higher 
level 
income 
quintiles. 
The 
targeted 
programs vary 
in 
their effective 
outreach 
to 
the 
lower 
quintiles, 
and 
furthermore, 
do 
not utilize 
consistent 
targeting criteria. 
This 
generates 
duplications 
and 
dilutes their 
effectiveness 
even 
further. 
Several 
programs 
also 
have 
insufficient 
coverage, 
and 
in 
many 
cases 
fail 
to 
address 
important 
risks 
for 
certain 
vulnerable 
groups. 
Such 
is 
the 
case 
of 
programs 
to 
protect 
children 
from 
zero 
to 
two 
years 
of 
age 
against the 
risk 
of 
malnutrition. 
Targeting 
and 
Regressivity. 
The 
social 
assistance 
system 
includes 
certain 
highly 
regressive 
programs. 
For 
example, subsidies 
for 
electricity, 
gas, 
and gasoline amounted 
to 
US$541 
million 
in 
the year 2000, 
almost 
4 
percent 
of 
the 
GDP, 
of 
which 
households 
received 
63.5 
percent. These 
subsidies 
are 
highly 
regressive, 
as 
they are 
correlated 
to 
the 
consumption 
of 
fuel, 
which 
increases 
with 
income. 
It 
is 
estimated that 
the 
total 
subsidy 
per 
capita 
-on 
electricity, 
gas, 
and 
gasoline- 
is 
five 
times 
greater 
among the wealthiest 
quintile 
than among the 
poorest.  Nonetheless, 
the 
subsidy 
represents a 
fundamental 
source 
of 
aid for 
the poorest 
of 
the poor. 
The 
study 
in 
question 
argues 
that 
without 
the 
subsidies, 
the 
poorest 
sectors 
would 
see 
their 
income 
reduced 
by 
7 
percent 
annually. 
Vos, 
Ponce, 
Ledn, 
et 
al., 
(2002) estimates 
the 
percentage 
of 
benefit 
of 
various social 
assistance 
programs 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
population 
quintiles 
benefited. 
This 
can 
be 
represented 
graphically 
through 
concentration 
curves, such those 
on 
Figure 
1. 
A 
progressive 
program 
would 
have 
a 
concentration 
curve higher than 
the 
45 
degree 
curve, 
indicating 
that 
the 
poorest 
quintiles 
receive 
a 
more 
than 
proportional 
benefit. 
Figure 
1 
illustrates 
that 
some 
social 
assistance 
programs are 
progressive, 
but 
even 
in 
these 
programs, a 
high 
percentage 
of 
the 
benefit 
reaches 
the 
wealthiest 
population 
quintiles. 
For 
example, 45 percent 
of 
the 
benefits 
of 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash Subsidy 
Program 
is 
received 
by 
families 
in 
the three 
highest 
quintiles (Attachment 
1 
contains the 
exact 
percentages 
of 
benefits 
reaching 
the various 
population 
quintiles). 
Insufficient 
Coverage. 
The 
coverage 
of 
the 
social 
assistance 
system 
is 
inadequate. 
This 
is 
not 
necessarily due 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
budget, for, 
as 
was 
mentioned 
above, 
Ecuador’s 
spending 
on 
social 
assistance 
is 
average 
among the countries 
of 
Latin 
America 
for which 
said 
information 
is 
available. 
Yet 
due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
a consistent 
targeting 
criterion and 
the 
overlapping 
of 
programs, 
in 
many 
cases 
funds 
are 
diverted 
towards groups 
that do 
not 
need 
them. 
The group 
of 
children 
under 
the 
age 
of 
six 
offers 
a 
clear 
example. There are at least 
five 
programs that 
have 
this 
group 
as 
a 
target population, and 
according 
to 
the 
National 
Children’s 
and 
Family 
Institute 
[Instituto 
Nacional 
de 
la 
Niiiez 
y 
la 
Familia] 
- 
INNFA 
(2000), 
the 
programs administered 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
of 
Social 
Welfare, 
and 
the 
INNFA 
itself 
cover 
approximately 
139,000 
children, 
that 
is, 
approximately 
7 
percent 
of 
all 
children 
in 
that 
age 
group and 
11 
percent 
of 
the 
age 
group 
in 
situations 
of 
poverty. 
According 
to 
INNFA 
1999,40.3 percent 
of 
the 
population 
was 
undernourished 
in 
Ecuador 
in 
1999 
-comprehensively 
and chronically. 
In 
other 
words, 
out 
of 
1,304,920 
children 
between 
zero 
and 
five 
years 
of 
age, 
approximately 
525,800 
showed 
some 
sign 
of 
malnutrition. 
This 
illustrates 
that 
the programs 
for 
this 
age 
group 
and 
risk 
are 
far 
from 
ideal. 
Other 
vulnerable 
groups, such 
as 
the elderly, 
are 
covered 
by 
social 
assistance 
programs, 
but 
the 
benefit 
received 
is 
insufficient 
to 
meet 
their 
needs.

The 
near 
universality 
of 
certain 
programs 
limits 
the 
field 
of 
action 
of 
the 
social 
assistance 
system. 
The 
Free 
Maternity 
Healthcare 
program 
provides free 
medical 
assistance 
to 
pregnant 
women 
through childbirth, 
even 
for 
women covered 
by 
IESS 
health 
insurance. 
It 
is 
imperative 
to 
review 
the 
targeting 
criteria, 
coverage, 
and 
benefits 
of 
the system's 
most significant 
programs. 
Shortcomings 
of 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program. 
The 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program 
is 
the most 
significant program 
in 
the 
social 
assistance 
system. 
If 
Ecuador 
could 
only 
administer 
a 
single 
assistance 
program, 
this 
would 
be 
a 
natural 
candidate, 
given 
its 
broad 
beneficiary 
base, 
its 
high 
budget 
within 
the 
system, 
its 
scope, 
and 
the 
possibilities 
it 
offers. 
Nonetheless, the 
program 
has 
numerous 
organizational and 
implementation 
problems that 
must 
be 
addressed. 
a. 
of 
new 
beneficiaries. 
The 
beneficiary 
base 
is 
being 
screened, 
and the 
number 
of 
beneficiaries 
has 
been reduced 
from 
approximately 
1.7 
to 
1.2 
million 
through 
this 
mechanism. 
Yet 
new 
beneficiaries 
have 
not 
been 
allowed 
to 
enroll 
since the 
commencement 
of 
the 
program. 
This 
is 
particularly 
serious 
if 
one 
bears 
in 
mind 
that the 
program's 
initial 
targeting 
did 
not utilize 
any 
consistent 
instrument beyond an enrollment 
form 
verified 
by 
local 
churches 
and 
parishes. 
b. 
screened, 
using 
a 
series 
of 
criteria. 
For 
example, 
the 
elimination 
from 
the 
beneficiary 
base 
of 
all 
individuals affiliated 
with 
Social 
Security Insurance 
creates 
disincentives 
to affiliating 
with 
this 
program. 
Although 
the 
idea 
of 
approximating 
beneficiaries' 
income 
levels 
through closely- 
correlated 
indicators 
is 
adequate, 
such 
indicators 
must 
be 
selected 
with 
care 
in 
order 
to minimize 
disincentives. 
C. 
targeted 
program, 
given 
that, 
as 
mentioned 
above, 
enrollments 
were 
made 
through 
an 
enrollment 
slip 
validated 
by 
local 
parishes 
and 
churches. 
A 
World 
Bank 
2000 
analysis demonstrated 
that 
the 
coverage 
rate 
of 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash Subsidy 
Program 
was 
88 
percent 
of 
the 
poor.

according 
to 
that 
same 
study, 
many 
individuals 
who 
met 
the requirements 
for 
the subsidy 
were 
not 
actually 
receiving 
it, 
while 
many who 
were 
receiving 
it 
failed 
to 
meet 
all 
the requirements.

the 
number

elderly

as 
compared 
to

is 
high

of

in 
keeping 
with 
the 
initial 
purpose 
of 
the 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash Subsidy 
Program: 
to 
aid 
families 
with 
the 
costs 
of 
gas 
and 
electricity, 
given 
the 
elimination 
of 
energy subsidies. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
energy subsidies 
were later 
reinstated, 
and the 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program, 
which 
was 
supposedly a replacement 
for 
them, 
was 
never eliminated. 
The 
calculation 
of 
the 
benefit 
is 
based 
on 
a 
historical 
criterion, 
and 
does 
not 
accurately correlate 
to 
the 
way 
beneficiaries 
use 
it. 
Factors such 
as 
the 
poverty 
line, 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
accumulating human 
capital, 
the cost 
of 
basic healthcare, 
or 
the 
effects 
of 
dollarization 
and 
inflation 
on 
the 
income 
of 
the 
beneficiaries were 
not 
borne 
in 
mind 
for 
the 
calculation. 
e. 
Institutional 
Problems. 
Currently, 
the 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash Subsidy 
Program 
is 
an 
entity 
with 
financial 
autonomy, associated 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Social Welfare. 
Nonetheless, the 
payments 
are 
made 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy and 
Finance. 
This 
means 
that there 
is 
no 
single 
responsible 
entity. 
Rather, 
different 
administrative 
aspects 
of 
the 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program 
are 
under the 
dominion 
of 
different 
administrative 
bodies. 
Such 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
creates 
confusion 
and 
problems 
of 
coordination. 
Other 
institutional 
aspects 
should 
also 
be 
reviewed. 
For 
example, 
the system 
uses 
the 
private 
banking 
system, 
intensely clustered 
in 
urban 
zones, 
to 
effect 
payment 
of 
the 
benefit. 
The 
banks 
verify 
the 
identity 
of 
the 
payment 
recipients, 
but 
are 
not 
obligated 
to 
convey that 
information to 
the government. 
There 
are 
also problems 
with 
the manner 
in 
which 
payments are made 
(times 
of 
service 
and 
long 
waits 
at 
private 
banks).

Program 
in 
terms 
of 
its 
effectiveness. 
The 
closest 
approximation 
to 
such 
an 
evaluation 
was 
a baseline 
survey 
of 
the 
program, 
conducted 
in 
August 
2002, 
which 
attempted 
to 
determine 
how 
the 
beneficiaries 
were 
using 
the money. Yet, 
just 
as 
occurs 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
programs 
in 
the 
social 
assistance 
system, 
no 
serious 
evaluation 
is 
being 
made 
of 
the 
subsidy’s  effects.

Lack

As 
was 
mentioned 
above, 
the 
historical 
reason 
for 
which 
the 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program 
was 
created 
-that 
subsidies 
on 
energy 
consumption 
were 
being 
eliminated- 
is 
no 
longer valid, 
as 
the energy subsidies 
have 
since been reinstated. 
The 
Bono 
Solidurio 
is 
currently 
a 
money 
transfer 
program 
with no 
stated purpose. 
This 
compromises 
other 
dimensions 
of 
the program, 
such 
as 
targeting and 
determination 
of 
the 
level 
of

social

programs 
are 
those 
which 
attempt 
to influence 
changes 
in 
the 
behavior 
of 
their 
beneficiaries. 
A 
good 
example 
would 
be 
the education 
of 
mothers 
on 
aspects 
of 
nutrition, 
which 
is 
considered 
more effective 
and 
lasting 
than 
food

programs. 
The 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program 
is 
nothing 
more 
than a money transfer. 
It 
does 
not 
seek 
to 
influence 
behavior, and 
thus 
entails 
a 
risk 
of 
generating 
dependency 
amongst 
its 
beneficiaries.

D. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Ecuador’s 
social 
assistance 
system 
is 
plagued 
with 
numerous 
faults that 
the 
new administration 
needs 
to 
address. 
The 
principal problem 
is 
not 
a 
lack 
of 
funds 
for 
social 
assistance. 
Rather, the 
problem 
is 
that 
social 
assistance 
is 
not 
well 
targeted, 
and that several 
programs 
are regressive, 
and 
therefore do 
not 
reach 
the 
population 
most 
in 
need. 
The 
recommendations 
of 
this 
Policy Note 
can be 
grouped 
into 
three categories. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
the 
flexibility 
of 
the social 
assistance 
system 
needs 
to 
be 
increased, 
using 
some 
mechanism 
to 
ensure 
that 
the system 
can 
adapt 
in 
times 
of 
crisis, 
when 
the 
number 
of 
persons 
demanding 
social 
assistance 
grows. 
In 
second place, a 
series 
of 
distortions 
in 
the 
current 
social 
assistance 
system 
must 
be 
corrected. 
This 
will 
require 
a 
review 
of 
the benefits, 
targeting 
criteria, 
objectives, 
and 
administration 
of 
certain 
programs. 
Changes 
such 
as 
these 
demand a 
major 
political 
commitment 
and 
are 
not 
easy 
to 
implement. 
An 
evaluation 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
measures 
adopted 
is 
therefore 
imperative. The 
third 
recommendation 
involves 
Ecuador’s 
largest 
assistance 
program, 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash 
Subsidy Program. 
The new 
administration should 
focus 
its 
efforts 
on 
ways 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
program’s 
structure, 
which 
has 
a 
broad 
outreach 
and 
could 
serve 
as 
the 
backbone 
of 
the 
social 
assistance 
system. 
In 
this 
sense, 
numerous 
changes 
are 
needed, 
which 
are 
described 
below. 
100 
Page  109
INCREASE 
THE 
FLEXIBILITY 
OF 
THE 
SOCIAL 
ASSISTANCE 
SYSTEM 
As 
was 
stated 
above, 
creating 
flexibility 
in 
the 
social 
assistance 
system 
entails the 
creation 
of 
mechanisms 
so 
that 
it 
can 
expand 
in 
times 
of 
crisis and contract 
under 
normal 
circumstances, 
when 
the 
demand 
for 
social 
assistance 
goes 
down. 
For 
said purpose, the 
following 
is 
recommended: 
a. 
minimum 
statutory 
budgets 
be 
created 
for 
certain social 
assistance 
programs. 
The social 
assistance 
system 
should 
have 
a 
basic budget that 
is 
protected, at least 
in 
the 
case 
of 
certain 
programs. 
In 
this 
sense, 
the 
inclusion 
of 
clauses 
in 
the 
agreements 
made 
with 
multilateral 
entities 
to 
guarantee the 
protection 
of 
these 
funds 
is 
an 
option 
that 
has 
been 
utilized 
in 
the 
past, 
which 
has 
allowed 
certain 
priority 
programs 
to 
stay 
in 
operation. 
b. 
most 
significant 
targeted programs are 
not allowing 
new 
beneficiaries 
to 
enroll. 
This 
means 
that 
during 
a 
crisis, those 
who 
require temporary social 
assistance 
have 
no 
access 
to 
it. 
A 
mechanism 
must 
be conceived 
that 
will 
allow new 
beneficiaries 
to enroll 
at 
various times 
of 
the year. 
One 
way 
to 
accomplish 
this 
is 
to 
periodically verify 
the 
eligibility 
of 
potential 
beneficiaries, 
particularly 
during 
a crisis. 
Another 
possibility 
is 
to 
consider 
a 
functional 
decentralization 
of 
certain 
programs. 
If 
their 
administration 
were 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
provinces 
or 
municipalities, 
who 
would 
be 
closer 
to 
the potential 
beneficiaries, 
it 
would 
be 
easier 
to 
evaluate the 
needs 
of 
the 
population. 
C. 
works 
programs 
provide 
income 
to 
unemployed 
persons 
who 
are 
unable 
to 
obtain 
work 
during 
a 
crisis, 
while 
simultaneously 
contributing 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
infrastructure. 
The 
advantage 
offered 
by 
these 
programs 
is 
that 
they 
are 
purely 
anticyclic and 
temporary. 
Indeed, 
it 
is 
only 
during 
a 
crisis 
that a 
major 
group 
of 
individuals 
will 
exist 
who 
will 
be 
looking for 
work 
and unable 
to 
find 
it. 
In 
general, 
these 
programs 
are self-targeted, 
as 
they 
offer sufficiently 
low 
wages 
that 
only 
attract 
very 
poor 
persons 
who 
are 
truly 
in 
need. 
Furthermore, 
the 
benefit 
granted 
is 
usually 
short 
in 
duration. 
These 
programs tend 
to 
be 
expensive, 
but 
part 
of 
the 
financing 
for 
a 
program 
of 
this 
type 
could 
be made 
available 
through 
rationalizing 
or 
adapting 
many 
other 
existing 
programs, 
such 
as 
the energy subsidies. 
Protect the 
budget 
of 
priority 
social assistance 
programs. 
It 
is 
recommended 
that

Public 
IMPROVE 
COORDINATION 
AND 
TARGETING 
IN 
EXISTING 
PROGRAMS 
Ideally, 
a social 
assistance 
system 
should 
focus 
on 
a 
few 
programs 
with 
specific objectives 
and 
consistent 
targeting 
instruments. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
Ecuador, the 
system 
could 
cover vulnerable 
groups 
and 
the 
most 
immediate 
risks 
to 
which 
these 
groups are subjected 
through 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program, 
the Scholarship 
Program, 
and 
an 
anticyclic 
program 
such 
as 
public 
works 
employment. 
This 
would 
entail 
a 
reform 
of 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program 
(the 
recommendations 
for 
which 
are 
included 
in 
the 
next point). 
The 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash Subsidy 
Program should be reoriented 
towards 
protecting very 
young children 
and pregnant 
women 
against the 
risks 
of 
malnutrition. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
influence 
of 
other programs 
that 
offer 
in-kind 
transfers 
should be 
reduced. 
Given 
that 
the 
elimination 
of 
programs 
can be 
very 
costly 
from 
a 
political point 
of 
view, 
an attempt 
should 
at least 
be 
made 
to 
improve 
coordination 
among 
the programs 
already 
in 
existence, 
so 
as 
to avoid 
the 
temptation 
of 
creating more 
programs 
than 
are recommended. 
It 
is 
recommended 
that the 
following 
measures 
be 
studied: 
a. 
Adopt 
consistent 
targeting 
criteria. 
As 
was 
explained 
in 
the 
preceding 
section, 
there 
is 
evidence 
that the present 
social 
assistance 
programs 
do 
not 
always 
reach 
those 
most 
in 
need. 
It 
is 
101 
Page  110
suggested that a 
single 
criterion 
be adopted 
for 
targeting 
the 
most 
significant 
social 
assistance 
programs. 
There 
are at least 
two 
possibilities. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
surveys 
of 
households can 
be 
used 
to 
determine 
which 
households are the 
most 
needy, 
in 
order 
to 
entitle 
those households 
to 
a 
series 
of 
benefits. 
That 
system 
would 
be 
periodically reviewed to 
allow 
the 
enrollment 
of 
new 
households 
and 
to 
validate 
the 
information 
obtained 
on 
households 
that 
are 
already 
receiving 
benefits, 
thus 
minimizing 
errors 
of 
inclusion 
or 
exclusion. 
There are numerous examples 
of 
this 
type 
of 
targeting 
criterion, 
such 
as 
SISBEN, Colombia’s Beneficiary 
Selection System 
(Sistema 
de 
Seleccidn 
de 
Beneficiarios), 
and 
SELBEN, 
the 
Ecuadorian 
Beneficiary 
Identification 
and 
Selection 
System 
(Sistema 
de 
Identijkacidn 
y 
Seleccidn 
de 
Beneficiarios), 
which 
is 
now 
being 
developed. 
This 
system 
tends 
to 
be 
very 
onerous and 
difficult 
to 
administer. 
Thus, 
in 
several 
cases, 
it 
has 
been 
decided 
to 
utilize 
poverty 
maps 
to 
grant benefits. 
The 
benefits 
are granted 
to 
all 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
a 
given 
community 
considered 
to be 
very 
poor. 
Such 
a system 
is 
easier 
to 
administer, 
but 
in 
principle 
can 
generate 
errors 
of 
exclusion 
if 
the 
mapping 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
precise, that 
is 
to 
say, 
considering 
the 
lowest geopolitical 
division 
of 
the 
population 
(in 
the 
case 
of 
Ecuador, that 
would 
be the 
sub-township 
level). 
b. 
Improve 
the Coordination 
of 
Existing Programs. 
The objective 
of 
the programs 
on 
which 
the most 
emphasis 
is 
placed 
must 
be clearly 
defined. 
This 
means 
that 
their 
targeted 
population 
must 
be 
identified, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
eligibility 
criteria 
and the 
risks 
against 
which 
the 
beneficiaries 
would 
be 
protected, 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
an 
overlapping 
of 
programs 
that 
benefit 
one 
and 
the 
same 
household 
and 
address 
one 
and 
the 
same 
problem. 
In 
this 
sense, 
it 
will 
be 
necessary, 
for 
example, 
to 
reconsider 
the 
role 
of 
the 
School 
Meals 
Program, 
as 
this 
program 
addresses 
risks 
that are 
similar 
to 
those 
covered 
by 
other 
programs. 
The 
School 
Meals 
Program 
has 
an 
approved 
budget 
for 
2002 
of 
US$46 
million, 
and provides 
nutritional 
supplements 
to 
school-age 
children, 
both 
elementary 
and 
secondary. 
The 
program utilizes 
an 
approximate 
poverty map 
determined 
by 
the 
Social Vulnerability 
Index. 
Yet 
this 
program 
is 
clearly 
not 
only benefiting 
those 
who 
are 
the 
poorest. Indeed, 
in 
the 
year 
2001 
supplements were granted 
to 
approximately 
1.4 
million 
school- 
age 
children, 
yet 
in 
1999 Ecuador 
had 
1,629,065 
children 
enrolled 
in 
elementary schools. 
Furthermore, 
like 
all 
programs 
that grant 
in-kind 
transfers 
through 
schools, those 
who 
are 
the 
poorest 
do 
not 
receive the 
benefit, 
because 
they 
are 
outside the 
formal 
educational 
system. 
As 
for 
the 
objective 
of 
programs 
such 
as 
these, 
it 
is 
clear that they 
do not 
solve the problems 
of 
infantile 
malnutrition, 
as 
such a 
goal 
would 
require interventions 
at a 
very early 
age. 
Although 
the 
School 
Meals 
Program 
does 
act 
as 
an 
incentive 
to 
school 
attendance, 
it 
also 
competes 
with 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash Subsidy Program. 
In 
fact, recent surveys have 
determined 
that 
60 
percent 
of 
the 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash 
Subsidy 
use 
all 
or 
a 
significant 
portion 
of 
that money 
to 
buy 
food. 
The 
School 
Meals Program 
also 
competes 
with 
the 
Scholarship 
Program, whose 
objective 
is 
to promote 
school 
attendance 
through 
a cash subsidy 
to 
families 
who 
send 
their 
children 
to 
school. 
C. 
Consider 
the 
elimination 
of 
subsidies 
on 
energy 
consumption. 
It 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
that 
this 
program 
is 
highly 
regressive 
and 
costly 
for 
the 
government. 
d. 
Evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
most significant programs. 
All 
decisions 
to 
make 
changes 
in 
current 
programs 
should 
be 
founded 
on 
a 
costhenefit 
study 
and 
on 
a measure 
of 
their impact. 
e. 
Prioritize 
demand-based 
programs 
such 
as 
conditioned 
subsidies. 
This 
will 
also 
require 
the 
improvement 
of 
the supply 
of 
related 
health 
and education 
services 
to 
make 
it 
easier 
for 
beneficiaries 
to 
meet the requirements.

REORIENT 
THE 
BONO 
SOLIDARIO 
CASH 
SUBSIDY 
PROGRAM 
TOWARDS 
BECOMING 
A 
PROGRAM 
OF 
CONDITIONED 
SUBSIDIES. 
The 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program, 
which 
represents 
approximately 
half 
of 
the 
government’s 
social 
assistance 
budget, 
has 
the 
tools 
it 
needs 
to 
become 
the 
central program 
of 
the 
social 
assistance 
system. Nonetheless, a 
series 
of 
changes 
need 
to 
be 
made 
to 
the 
program, 
including 
a 
review 
of 
its 
objectives, a 
recalculation 
of 
benefits 
based 
on 
clear 
criteria, and 
an 
improvement 
in 
its 
targeting. 
Specifically, 
the 
following 
is 
recommended: 
a. 
program, 
oriented 
towards 
protecting the 
health 
of 
children 
and 
pregnant 
women who 
live 
in 
poverty. 
Children’s 
nutrition 
programs 
have a 
very 
limited 
coverage. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that there 
are 
1.3 
million 
boys 
and 
girls 
in 
Ecuador 
between zero 
and 
five 
years 
of 
age. 
Programs 
targeting 
this 
vulnerable group 
only 
provide 
services 
to 
approximately 
200,000 
children, even 
though, 
according 
to 
data 
from 
the 
SIISE,33 
approximately 
600,000 
children 
are 
suffering 
from 
chronic 
malnutrition. 
Clearly 
the 
coverage 
of 
the programs 
aiming 
to 
alleviate 
this 
problem 
is 
insufficient 
and 
inadequate. 
The 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash Subsidy 
Program 
is 
a 
good 
potential 
channel 
for 
promoting 
control 
of 
children’s 
nutrition 
and 
health 
in 
exchange 
for 
a 
transfer 
in 
money. 
This 
approach 
is 
already 
functioning 
in 
other 
countries, such 
as 
Colombia 
and 
Mexico. 
The 
conversion 
of 
the 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program 
would 
entail 
an 
analysis, 
among 
other 
things, 
of 
the 
possibility 
of 
including 
pregnant 
women 
in 
the 
system; 
the 
type 
of 
control 
that 
would 
be 
required 
of 
mothers; and the 
exclusion 
of 
persons 
who 
are 
receiving 
benefits 
from 
other programs 
such 
as 
the 
ORI, 
PDI, 
or 
the 
over 
the 
age 
of 
five, 
for 
whom 
the 
type 
of 
control 
and 
the 
objective 
of 
the 
program 
would be 
different. 
b. 
Maintain 
benefits 
for 
the elderly, 
or 
progressively 
replace 
them 
with 
a 
non- 
contributive 
pension 
for 
the 
elderly 
poor. 
As 
explained 
in 
Section 
C, 
the 
elderly 
are a 
vulnerable 
group, 
especially 
those 
elderly 
persons 
who do 
not 
receive 
pensions 
from 
the 
social 
security 
system (the 
majority). 
The 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash Subsidy 
Program 
is 
thus 
the 
only 
program 
that mitigates the 
lack 
of 
income 
in 
this 
demographic group. Nonetheless, there 
needs 
to 
be coordination 
with 
the social security 
system, 
so 
that 
this 
program 
will 
not 
compete 
with 
a 
possible 
non-contributive 
pension 
under 
the 
IESS 
reform 
plans 
(See 
Policy 
Note 
on 
the 
Social 
Security 
System). 
Also, elderly 
persons 
who 
live with 
beneficiary 
families 
of 
the 
Bono 
Solidurio 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program should 
not 
receive 
a 
separate 
benefit under that 
same 
subsidy 
amounting 
to 
a 
double 
benefit 
for 
those 
families. 
One 
possibility 
in 
such a 
case 
is 
to 
consider 
a 
reduction 
in 
the benefit, 
rather 
than 
its 
complete 
elimination. 
C. 
Improve 
targeting 
criteria. 
In 
the 
first 
place, the 
beneficiary 
base 
should be 
screened, 
using 
a 
criterion 
consistent 
with 
those 
of 
the 
other 
most significant social 
assistance 
programs. 
In 
the 
second 
place, 
new 
beneficiaries 
should eventually be 
allowed 
to 
enroll, 
provided 
that they 
meet the 
respective 
eligibility 
criteria. 
In 
the 
third 
place, 
clear 
targeting 
criteria 
should be 
chosen. 
For 
said 
purpose, 
the 
advantages 
and 
disadvantages 
of 
systems 
such 
as 
surveys 
or 
poverty 
maps 
should be 
studied. 
A 
possible 
combination 
of 
these 
methods 
with 
self-targeting 
criteria 
should 
also 
be 
considered. 
d. 
dependent 
upon 
the 
program’s 
objective 
and 
beneficiary population. 
For 
example, 
the 
benefit 
amount 
to 
protect 
children 
against 
problems 
of 
malnutrition 
would 
be very 
different 
from 
the 
Transform 
the 
Bono 
Solidario 
Cash 
Subsidy 
Program 
into 
a 
conditioned 
subsidy 
An 
approach 
must 
also 
be 
developed 
for 
mothers 
with 
children 
Review 
the 
amount 
of 
benefit granted. 
In 
good 
measure, 
the amount 
would

amount granted 
to 
protect 
families 
from 
temporary 
reductions 
in 
their 
levels 
of 
income 
or 
to 
protect 
children 
from 
possible 
losses 
in 
the 
development 
of 
their 
human capital. 
Benefits 
must 
be 
based 
on 
clear 
criteria 
and 
must 
respect budgetary 
limitations. 
For 
example, 
increasing the 
benefit 
to 
mothers 
so 
that 
their income 
would 
reach 
50 
percent 
of 
the 
poverty 
line 
would 
require 
a 
doubling 
of 
the 
budget. 
Considering 
the 
budgetary 
limitations, 
these 
funds 
could 
be 
made 
available 
through 
a reorganization 
of 
existing 
programs 
or 
an 
elimination 
of 
certain beneficiaries 
based 
on 
such 
targeting 
criteria 
as 
may 
be 
adopted.

(2002) 
estimates 
the 
additional 
costs 
of 
increasing benefits 
and 
enrolling 
additional 
beneficiaries under 
various 
scenarios.

CONCLUSIONS 
The 
political 
changes 
on 
the 
horizon 
in 
Ecuador create an 
opportunity 
to lay 
the 
groundwork 
for 
a 
more 
efficient 
and 
equitable social 
assistance system. 
The 
economy 
has 
been recuperating 
in 
recent 
years, 
but 
the effects 
of 
dollarization 
and a possible 
repeat 
of 
the 
El 
NiZo 
phenomenon 
necessitate 
a 
profound 
analysis 
of 
the 
social 
assistance 
programs. 
It 
has 
been emphasized 
in 
this 
Policy Note 
that 
many 
of 
the 
changes 
do not 
require 
budget 
increases, 
but 
simply 
a 
firm 
political 
commitment 
to improve 
the 
well-being 
of 
Ecuador’s 
vulnerable 
population 
groups.
