Interventions for the specific\n            benefit of indigenous groups will be incorporated into the\n            project design, and, this Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP)\n            summarizes specific actions to these efforts. The main\n            elements in this plan will focus on: increased level of\n            participation of indigenous peoples, and representatives in\n            the design of program actions (empowerment); improved rural\n            focus of actions (geographic equity); and, tightened\n            targeting of measures intended for the poor, so as to\n            effectively shift program coverage in their favor\n            (interpersonal equity). Regarding education, an improved\n            intercultural and bilingual education will be offered,\n            enhancing the technical performance of teachers in their\n            deliverance of intercultural and bilingual education, with\n            specific linkages to other social services to raise\n            children's readiness to receive such education. Teacher\n            availability will be addressed in the program. Regarding\n            health issues, the program will address coverage of the\n            uninsured - mostly poor, and indigenous mothers and children\n            - through the Rural Social Security services, supported by\n            physical and human resources. The program will also address\n            social security issues, focused on making a redistribution\n            of available social security resources, through improvements\n            at the Administration's level, while as a complement to\n            the regulatory and administrative reforms in social\n            services, an \"open access\" to information policy\n            and support to operational infrastructure, will be developed."}, "docdt": "2003-04-30T23:01:03Z"}
