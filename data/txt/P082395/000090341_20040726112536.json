"The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The findings indicate that the original goals\n            of the reform continue to be valid and second and third\n            phases of the Human Development Reform Loan (HDRP) are\n            clearly warranted to achieve them. Although it did not fully\n            prepare the second phase of the program as anticipated, the\n            first phase provided valuable lessons and insights that\n            should be accounted for in the second and third phases. As\n            originally designed, Social Security Administration (IESS)\n            was expected to be a major instrument in reaching program\n            goals. It was directly involved in completing 6 monitorable\n            actions, including two triggers for a second stage. Reforms\n            are underway to restore economic and financial stability in\n            Ecuador. Technical Secretariat of the Interministerial\n            Social Sectors Committee (STFS) has established a sound\n            record in monitoring and motivating the program to date, and\n            should continue this role in the future. It is clear that\n            steps taken to coordinate existing agencies has not led to\n            desired breadth of reform proposals needed to successfully\n            address pension reforms and reform of nutritional and food\n            security programs."}, "docdt": "2004-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
