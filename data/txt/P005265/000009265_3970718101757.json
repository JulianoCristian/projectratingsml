proposed project would assist power\n            subsector development as well as contribute to petroleum\n            exploration and the improvement of energy efficiency and\n            planning.  The power distribution component will promote the\n            expansion and rehabilitation of the urban distribution\n            networks in JEPCO's and IDECO's concession areas\n            and the electrification of 20 villages in the Governorates\n            of Amman and Balka and 55 villages in the Governorate of\n            Irbid.  Other project components consist of petroleum\n            exploration, energy conservation, sources for renewable\n            energy, and energy planning.  These components will provide\n            consultant services, training and the acquisition of\n            equipment to improve knowledge and development in the power\n            subsector.  The renewable energy component will specifically\n            encourage development of alternative energy sources such as\n            solar energy."}, "docdt": "1983-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
