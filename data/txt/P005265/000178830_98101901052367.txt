I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Introduction
1.01     A review of the major issues facing Jordan's energy sector was
undertaken by the Bank in November 1981. A report, Jordan: Energy Sector
Study (ESS) 1/, summarizing the issues and recommendations was discussed with
the Government in October 1982. In March 1983, the National Planning Council
(NPC) presented the recommendations of the ESS in a brief submitted to the
Council of Ministers (CM), and requested authorization to seek Bank financing
for an energy development project to attract cofinancing and serve as an
umbrella for the coordinated implementation of the recommendations of ESS. In
addition, NPC requested, as was recommended in the ESS, permission to create
an energy planning unit (EPU) in the Council to oversee implementation of the
ongoing and proposed energy planning work, and eventually formulate the long
term energy plan. CM approved both requests in April 1983. The proposed
Project is designed with a view to ensuring that a consistent and coordinated
plan of action for 1983-1985 is initiated to implement the mnain
recommendations of the ESS.
B. Energy Resources
1.02     Overview.  Jordan's presently known indigenous energy resources
consist of relatively large deposits of oil shale, some tar sands, a small
hydropower potential, and few geothermal sources of low surface temperatures.
No commercially exploitable coal, lignite, uranium or oil and gas reserves are
known to exist.  Moreover, with the exception of solar energy and possibly
wind energy, Jordan's endowment of non-commercial and renewable energy is
modest.
1.03     Oil Shale.  Oil shale deposits are presently known to exist at
Al-Qatranah, El-Lajjun, and Al-Husseineyyah south of Amman, and in Mukhibah
near the Yarmouk River. So far, only the deposits at El-Lajjun have been
geologically investigated in some detail. The Government has contracted
Klockner (a German firm) to undertake a prefeasibility study for determining
the economic viability of extracting oil from the shale or burning the shale
directly in specially designed power plants. Klockner's preliminary results
favored the extraction of oil and recommended a move to the second phase
involving more extensive geological and engineering work. The Government has
accepted Klockner's recommendations and appointed a panel of international
experts to review the scope of the proposed work program and the
recommendations to follow.
1.04     Oil and Gas.   Jordan spans an area of approximately 97 thousand
km2 of which 75 thousand km2 is covered by sedimentary basins where
petroleum reserves could be found. Past exploration work, by the
international oil companies and the Natural Resources Authority (NRA), has
identified several areas where oil and gas could be present. Of these, 4
areas (IBRD Map No. 16106R) are of immediate interest for petroleum
exploration. Since 1976, NRA has been implementing an exploration program to
1/ Report No. 4012-JO, February 1983.

prepare the geological data needed to attract international oil firms to
undertake exploration drilling in Jordan. However, not a single firm
expressed any interest in acquiring exploration permits. This disinterest has
been primarily due to the inadequacy of geological data and the reliance on
fairly outdated techniques for processing it. The proposed Project would
strengthen NRA's capabilities in executing and processing the geological work
needed to: a) attract international firms to undertake exploration contracts
in Jordan; and b) assist in the formulation and implementation of a systematic
exploration drilling program (paras. 2.02 and 2.13 and Annex 2.1).
1.05     Hydropower.  Jordan's hydropower potential is limited to about 30 MW
(87 GWh per annum) of which 4 MW (12 GWh per anaum) is at King Talal Dam on
the River Zarqa, and 26 MW (75 GWh per annum) could be tapped if the
multipurpose Maqarin Dam on the Yarmouk River is built. The potential at King
Talal will be exploited when the current plan to raise the height of the dam
an additional 15 meters is completed in 1984. As for the Maqarin Dam, its
construction would be subject to the conclusion of an agreement on riparian
rights between Jordan and Syria.
1.06     Geothermal and Other Renewable Energy Resources.  Geothermal
resources exist in the form of hot springs at Al-Zarah and Zarqa Ma'in, about
10 km from the northern end of the Dead Sea. The surface temperature is about
45 deg. C. at Al-Zahra and 63 deg. C. at Zarqa Ma'in. The combined hourly
discharge of these springs into the Dead Sea is estimated to be about 2,000
m3. USAID is currently financing a study conducted by the U.S. Geological
Survey for the assessment of these resources. The first phase of the
assessment, covering the geophysical and geochemical characteristics, was
recently completed. Presently, preparations are underway for the exploration
drilling phase of the assessment. In addition to geothermal energy, solar
energy constitutes Jordan's main renewable energy resource. However, to this
date, the extent of this resource and its distribution is not adequately
known. Moreover, the ongoing and planned pilot and demonstration schemes are
proceeding without the benefit of an overall plan. The Project would address
these shortcomings by financing the establishment of a national solar and wind
resource measuring network, the formulation of a national plan for the
exploitation of renewable energy, and the demonstration of solar technologies
with potential for commercial application in the foreseeable future (para. 2.02
and Annex 2.1). Preliminary results, however, indicate that these resources
are not suitable for the generation of electricity.
C. Institutional Setting of the Sector
1.07     Several entities are concerned with the operation and development of
Jordan's energy sector.  The planning, coordination, and policy formulation
involves 3 bodies:  the National Planning Council (NPC), the Ministry of
Industry and Trade (MIT), and the National Energy Committee (NEC).
The development of domestic sources of primary energy is entrusted to the
Natural Resources Authority (NRA). The production and delivery of secondary
energy are the responsibility of the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company (JPRC),
the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA), the Jordanian Electric Power Company
(JEPCO), and the Irbid District Electricity Company (IDECO). Energy research
involves the Royal Scientific Society (RSS) and the universities of Jordan and
Yarmouk.



-3-
1.08     NPC is an autonomous Government agency responsible for the
formulation of long-term economic plans (paras. 1.27 and 1.47). NEC was
formed in 1977 to review and advise the Government on policies relating to the
supply and development of energy in Jordan. MIT is responsible for regulating
the operations of the private and public enterprises in the energy sector. It
also plays a major role in formulating policies for the pricing of energy, and
the negotiation of concessional agreements with the private firms (JEPCO,
IDECO and JPRC). In 1977, an energy department was established in MIT to
function as a secretariat for NEC in preparing studies relating to energy
conservation, planning, production and distribution. However, the department
has been unable to provide the support originally envisaged because of
shortages of human and financial resources. Moreover, NEC has provided very
little guidance in initiating and implementing policies principally due to its
large membership which hindered the efficiency of the decision-making process
(para. 1.26). Consequently, the Government decided recently to streamline the
prevailing structure by creating, in April 1983, a Steering Committee for
Energy (SCE) composed of only 7 members representing the power, petroleum, and
refining subsectors, RSS and MIT. SCE would set the guidelines and monitor
the operations of the newly created Energy Planning Unit (EPU) in NPC which
would be staffed to function as the sole energy planning entity in the country
(para. 1.27). The Project would cover the cost of consulting services,
training and studies aimed at strengthening the energy planning capabilities
of EPU (para. 2.17 and Annex 2.1).
1.09     NRA is a Government agency responsible for all activities relating to
the exploration and development of minerals, hydrocarbons and groundwater.
The Petroleum Department (PD) at NRA oversees all oil-related activities in
Jordan, which, among other things, covers geological surveys, negotiations
with foreign firms of contracts for exploration, and more recently, the
implementation of a program for exploration drilling. The Department of
Geology at NRA supervises studies dealing with the development of oil shale.
The proposed Project would provide the foreign exchange needed to strengthen
PD by covering the cost of expatriate advisers and the training of Jordanians
in recently developed techniques of petroleum exploration (paras. 2.02 and
2.13 and Annex 2.1).
1.10     JPRC is a privately-owned firm in which the Government holds 12% of
the total shares. It operates the only oil refinery in the country located
35 km northeast of Amman. JPRC is responsible for refining crude oil
purchased by the Government, and the distribution and marketing of all
petroleum products in Jordan. JPRC's operations are regulated by MIT in
accordance with a concession agreement which ensures the company a fair return
on investment.
1.11     JEA is a financially and administratively autonomous Government owned
utility. It is responsible for the formulation of plans for the overall
development of the power subsector, the construction of generation and
transmission facilities, the generation and transmission of virtually all the
publicly supplied electricity and the distribution of electricity in the areas
under its jurisdiction. In addition, JEA regulates JEPCO and IDECO, the
utilities responsible for the distribution of about 90% of all the electricity
sold at the medium and low voltage levels. JEPCO is a private company owned
by the public (77%), JEA (13%), and the municipalities (10%). It distributes
electricity in an area of about 2,000 km2 covering the city of Amman and its
environs. In 1982, JEPCO accounted for about 80%'of total electricity sold at



the medium and low voltage levels. IDECO is a semiprivate company owned by
JEA (46.5%), the Municipalities of Irbid Governorate (42.5%), and by private
investors (11%).  Its service covers a concessionary area encompassing the
Governorate of Irbid. IDECO's sales in 1982 amounted to about 10% of total
electricity sold at the medium and low voltage levels.
1.12     Research in renewable energy is entrusted to RSS and the universities
of Jordan and Yarmouk. RSS is well organised and its staff is of high
caliber. However, the Society's activities in t:he energy field need to be
more closely integrated with national objectives for the sector. The proposed
Project would provide a blue print for integrating and coordinating the
activities of the Society with the ongoing and proposed investments for the
commercial exploitation of renewable energy (paras. 2.02 and 2.16 and Annex
2.1).
D. Energy Balances
1.13     Supply of Commercial Energy:  Jordan is totally dependent on imported
energy for its supply of commercial energy. Its imports are in the form of
crude oil. At times, petroleum products are traded to complement the
refinery's output or dispose of surpluses. As summarized in Table 1.1, the
import of crude oil from Saudi Arabia through the Tapline, which transports
crude to Lebanon via Jordan, increased at an average annual rate of 13.8%
between 1976 and 1982, from 1.1 million toe in 1976 to 2.4 million toe in
1982. Unless oil and gas are discovered as a result of the ongoing and
planned exploration program, and with the exception of the 2 thousand toe of
hydropower to come onstream in 1984 after the completion of the power
component at the King Talal Dam, Jordan would continue to depend on imported
energy for meeting its domestic demand for energy. The annual growth of
imports of crude oil and petroleum products are expected to decline to 12% for
the period 1982-1990 as shown in Table 1.1, from 2.4 million toe in 1983 to
about 5.8 million toe in 1990. The imports of petroleum products would be in
the form of middle distillates (diesel Oil and aviation fuel) and fuel oil.
However, if the plan to build a new refinery at Aqaba is implemented, Jordan
would become a net exporter of petroleum products in the 1990's. A
Government-financed feasibility study by a British firm (Williams Brothers) is
currently underway to determine the least cost means for meeting the projected
demand for petroleum products. In addition, the study would propose a
strategy involving the optimal timing for investment in refining and the
infrastructure for handling crude oil and petroleum products (Annex 1.2).
1.14     Consumption and Losses in Energy Transformation:  Conversion losses
in electricity generation and petroleum refining as well as distribution
losses have been on a declining trend in the past few years and are expected
to decline further, from about 16% of gross ener,gy supply in 1982 to about 13%
in 1990. This decrease is primarily due to: (a) the improvement in the
efficiency of the power subsector resulting from the commissioning of new and
therefore more efficient power plants near Zarqa (Hussein power station) and
at Aqaba; (b) the reinforcement of the transmission and distribution networks;
and (c) the implementation of energy audits and retrofitting for which the
feasibility studies would be financed under the proposed Project (paras. 2.02
and 2.15 and Annex 2.1).

1.15     Consumption of Commercial Energy:  Jordan's net consumption of energy
increased between 1976 and 1982 at an average annual rate of about 14.2%, from
0.87 million toe in 1976 to 2 million toe in 1982. This rate of growth is
expected to decrease to about 12% between 1983 and 1985 and 10% between 1986
and 1990. The deceleration in the growth of energy consumption between 1986
and 1990 is expected to be primarily due to: (a) the improvement in the energy
efficiency of the major energy intensive industries such as cement, power
plants, fertilizers, potash, iron and building materials; (b) the increased
use of solar energy for passive greenhouses and the supply of low temperature
hot water for household, commercial and some industrial uses; and (c) the
improvement of the building codes to promote conservation in the private and
institutional buildings. The studies needed to provide the inputs for the
formulation of both a strategy for the restructuring of energy consumption and
an investment plan for retrofitting and technical improvement in the
industrial processes would be financed under the proposed Project (paras. 2.02
and 2.15 and Annex 2.1).
E. Energy Pricing
Petroleum Products
1.16     During the 1960's and early 1970's, Jordan's petroleum subsector was
a net contributor to the public revenues. However, following the increases in
the price of imported oil that started with the oil embargo of October 1973,
the Government decided to buffer the economy from the adverse impact of higher
energy prices by raising the tax on gasoline and LPG (light distillates) to
cover the cost of the subsidies extended to consuimers of diesel oil, fuel oil,
kerosene and aviation fuel (middle and heavy distillates). Despite the
increase in the tax on light distillates, the revenues collected fell short of
covering the rising cost of the subsidies because of the sustained increases
in the price of imported oil and the inadequate upward adjustments in the
domestic prices of middle and heavy distillates. The Government covered these
shortfalls which reached JD 22 million (US$65 million) in 1978. Faced with
the prospect of a sustained increase in the burden of the subsidies on the
national budget, the Government decided in 1979 to phase out the subsidies by
gradually closing the gap between domestic and border prices. Since then
domestic prices were increased 6 times; in March and July of 1979, February of
1980, February and November of 1981, and February of 1983.
1.17     As a result of the upward adjustments in the domestic prices of
petroleum products since 1979, and the stagnation in the import price of oil
for most of 1982, the deficit (net subsidy) coveresd by the Government in 1982
amounted to JD 16.5 million (US$46.3 million). In 1982, the domestic price of
the reconstituted barrel was about US$33.2 compared with a cost of about
US$35.8. As i) the price of imported oil has remained at its March 1983 level
of U3S$31/barrel, and ii) so far the domestic prices of a reconstituted barrel
is about US$36 in 1983, the petroleum sector is expected to be a net
contributor to the revenues of the Government. Based on a forecast
consumption of about 2.7 million tons, the net contribution of the subsector
to the fiscal resources would amount to JD 2.6 mi]Llion (US$7.6 million) in

Weighted Average        284           320             -                113
As of April 1983, the average domestic price for petroleum products was at
about 113% of border price; that is, US$320/ton compared to US$284/ton.
1.18     The subsidy for gas oil/diesel accrues mainly to the owners of the
commercial transport vehicles transporting goods and materials within Jordan
and from the port of Aqaba to Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. The subsidy for jet
fuel benefits the national airline, while the subsidy for fuel oil accrues to
industry and utilities such as JEA, the cement plant, the Zarqa refinery,
etc. These subsidies are indirectly passed on to the consumers through the
relatively lower prices paid for goods and services produced by the transport,
industrial and agriculture sectors. On the other hand, the subsidy for
kerosene accrues, directly to the consumers who use it for domestic purposes.
The subsidies for gas oil/diesel, fuel oil and jet fuel are not justified on
social or economic grounds. The optimal policy for pricing energy resources
would dictate that domestic prices be set at levels that reflect their real
cost to the economy in order to ensure their efficient use and mobilize the
maximum revenues for the Government. Therefore, despite the commendable
progress made in reducing the burden of the subsidy on the national budget,
the cross subsidization between petroleum products should be phased out over
the medium term plan. The recent decline in the price of imported oil and the
likely stagnation in the real rate of its increase until 1985 provides an
opportunity for the Government to sustain its efforts in phasing out the cross
subsidy through upward adjustment in the prices of the subsidized product at
rates lower than would otherwise have been required had the price of imported
oil continued the upward trend experienced between 1979 and 1981.
1.19     Several studies and measures are either underway or planned which
would provide the Government with the necessary input to formulate a more
concrete and systematic plan for phasing out the subsidies. A transportation
study has recently been completed which provided the Government with a measure



- 8 -
of the impact of eliminating the subsidies for aviation fuel and diesel oil on
the economy. In addition, the Bank has recently appraised a transportation
project where one of the objectives is to double the freight transport
capacity of the rail system in order to reduce the use of diesel for the
transport of goods by trucking. Concurrently, t:he Bank is financing a study,
as a part of the energy sector work program, to assess the impact of higher
prices for diesel oil on the mode of transport and to set a strategy for the
optimal taxation of fuels used in the transport sector. The proposed Project
would also finance several energy conservation and audit studies aimed at
reducing the industrial and household consumption of energy. These studies,
and the investments likely to follow from them, would cushion the economy from
the full impact of higher energy prices resulting from the upward adjustments
in the prices of the subsidized petroleum products. During negotiations,
understanding has been reached with the Government that it would continue its
review of domestic prices of petroleum products with the objective of phasing
out the subsidies over the medium term (1984-1989) (para. 5.01).

industries, JEPCO and IDECO). The low voltage t:ariffs are set by JEA in
consultation with JEPCO and IDECO; however, the introduction of new tariffs
require Government approval.
1.21     Bulk Tariffs:  The bulk tariffs apply only to JEA's sales to the
large industrial consumers, JEPCO and IDECO. These are based on a time of day
structure (peak and off-peak) with no seasonal variation.-They also
differentiate between consumers in the district of Irbid and those in the
other districts.  The peak tariff involves a monthly capacity charge of JD
2.4/kW (US$6.7/kW) for all districts, and an energy charge of 17.5 fils/kWh
(US 49 mills/kWh) for Irbid and 18.5 fils/kWh (IJS 52 mills/kWh) for the other
districts. The off-peak tariff involves an energy charge of 12.5 fils/kWh (US
35 mills/kWh) for Irbid and 13.5 fils/kWh (US 37 mills/kWh) for the other
districts. In January 1983, the average economic cost of electricity (LRMC)
for bulk sales was about 28 fils/kWh (US 75 milLs/kWh) compared to an average
revenue for sales to JEPCO, IDECO and the large industrial consumers of about
26 fils/kWh (US 72 mills/kWh).
1.22     Retail Tariffs:  The tariff structure Eor electricity sales to the
low voltage consumers is identical for all three utilities (JEA, IDECO and
JEPCO). It is based on a uniform block rate for each customer category,
classified according to the end use of electricity (domestic, commercial,
small industries, water pumping, etc.). However, the tariff level for each
category differs slightly among the three utilities to reflect the cost
incurred by each in providing elecl:ricity service. In April 1983, the average
tariff for sale to the low voltage consumer was about 35.6 fils/kWh (US 99.6
mills/kWh) which was slightly above the average economic cost of supply (LRMC)
of about 35.04 fils/kWh (US 98.3 mills/kWh).
1.23     Tariff Level:  Tariffs were at levels ithat conveyed to consumers the
cost to the economy of the resources used in meeting their electricity demand
(LRMC), and high enough to allow JEA, JEPCO and IDECO to cover their operating
costs and provide at least 25% internal contribution towards the cost of



- 9 -
their development program between 1977 and 1980 (para. 3.06 and 3.15).
However, the continued upward adjustment in the prices of fuels used by JEA
for power generation and the reluctance of the Government to allow the utility
to reflect the higher fuel costs in its tariff, reduced JEA's level of
internal cash generation below 25% for 1981 and 1982. By contrast, the level
of internal cash generation for JEPCO was in excess of 30% for the same two
years. IDECO's internal cash generation, however, was only 6% in this period,
mainly because of its heavy up-front investment in rural electrification.
Normally, in a totally thermal power system like Jordan's, if the average
tariff is at the LRMC, the internal cash generation of a utility should be
sufficient to cover its operating cost and provide an adequate level of self
financing. However, in the case of JEA, the cost of implementing and
operating the Government's rural electrification program in the sparsely
populated areas is incurred by the utility. It is estimated that the
economic cost incurred by JEA in supplying the rural consumers is about
70 fils/kWh (202 mills/kWh) compared to a tariff of about 35.6 fils/kWh
(99.6 mills/kWh) 1/, resulting in an economic loss of about JD 800 thousand
(US$2.4 million) in 1982.  Moreover, the supply of electricity for public
lighting is provided free of charge. In 1982, this consumer category
accounted for about 2% of total sales, representing a foregone revenue of
about JD 1.5 million (US$4.2 million). In recognizing the impact on JEA's
financial position of the tariff freeze, the higher prices for fuel, the
losses incurred by JEA in serving the streetlighting free of charge and the
rural consumers, the Government compensated JEA for the cost of these services
for 1981 and 1982. This enabled the utility to meet the internal cash
generation agreed with the Bank under earlier loans. However, similar
compensation has not been extended to JEPCO and IDECO which also incur similar
losses. Moreover, the present arrangements for Government compensation to JEA
have not been formally institutionalized, and there is a strong possibility
that once JEA's financial position improves, the extent of the Government's
compensation for services provided by the utility would diminish or completely
stop. The informal arrangement currently being followed for billing the
Government hinders JEA's ability for sound financial planning because of the
uncertainties relating to the extent of the compensation and dates for the
remittance of the sums involved. As in the case of JEA, JEPCO and IDECO also
need compensation to ensure their development as financially viable entities.
This matter was discussed during negotiations and the Government informed the
Bank that, in order to address these shortcomings, new measures had been
established to compensate the power utilities for the services they provide
below cost (mainly rural electrification). First, a Rural Electrification
Fund, funded from specific and general tax revenue of at least 2 million JD
each for 1984 and 1985, and by amounts to be determined thereafter, has been
created and would provide soft loan and equity funds to the power utilities
for their rural electrification programs. Second, according to new
regulations rural beneficiaries will contribute a lump sum towards investments
1/ Excludes 1 fils/-kWh rural electrification tax levied on all electricity
sales at the low voltage level. The revenues collected is used by the
Government to partly finance the cost of the national rural
electrification program.

in their communities ranging from 5,000 JD to 15,000 JD per comtmnity
depending on population. In addition, the TORs of the Demand Management Study
of the proposed Project, which would formulate a comprehensive program for
future energy pricing policies, would include the review of the Government
compensation to the power utilities.
1.24     The uniform block rates for the low voltage consumers are
inconsistent with the Government's policy of encouraging conservation and
restraining the growth of demand for energy. There are indications that the
low voltage consumer's demand for electricity is relatively insensitive to
increasing tariffs primarily because the remittances from the Gulf and Saudi
Arabia accrue principally to the households rather than the Government. As a
result, the household's demand for electricity is determined by levels of
disposable income that are higher than would otherwise prevail. Therefore, by
maintaining uniform block rates for sales to the low voltage consumers, the
Government is foregoing revenues which the utilities could mobilize to finance
their development program. In addition, by introducing increasing block rates
in the structure of electricity tariffs, large domestic and small commercial
consumers could be induced to conserve electricity.  The Government and JEA
have reviewed with the Bank, in October 1982, the results of a study by JEA
for the assessment of the effects on the resources mobilized by the power
subsector of introducing increasing block rates in the low voltage tariff
structure  Currently, the Government: is in the process of reviewing JEA's
proposal for possible implementation in conjunction with the next tariff
increase. However, in order to ensure consistency with its declared policy of
adjusting domestic prices of energy to reflect their costs to the economy, the
study for the formulation of demand management policy for energy would examine
the overall structure and level of electricity tariffs with a view to
outlining the steps needed to maintain parity with the economic cost of supply
(LRMC) and ensure the achievement of the financial objectives for JEA and
IDECO which were agreed upon with the Bank.
F. Energy Planning and Development Strategy
Energy Planning
1.25     Energy Sector Planning:  Jordan has been successful in formulating
long term plans for the development of the economy which achieved an average
annual rate of increase in real GDP of about 10% over the past decade.
Recently, however, due to the constraints on the availability of foreign
exchange stemming from a softening of the world market for oil and the
consequential decline in the level of remittances from Jordanians in Saudi
Arabia and the Gulf States, and the increasing bill for oil imports which
continues to absorb higher percentages of export earnings, the Govermnent
turned its attention to the energy sector. Several studies concerned with the
production and use of energy have been commissioned by NPC; however, these
were dictated by immediate pressing needs rather than a long-term strategy
aimed at providing the inputs that would result in a development plan for the
energy sector similar to the macroeconomic plans. As a result, to this date,
Jordan does not have a national plan for energy that would outline a set of
consistent policies for the development and management of the sector. There
is a pressing need for Jordan to formulate a long-term plan for the



- 11 -
development of the energy sector; outline consistent policies for energy
pricing, conservation and demand management; and strengthen its capabilities
in project identification, preparation, and implementation. The proposed
Project would address these shortcomings by strengthening NPC's planning
capabilities and finance studies needed to assist the Government in
formulating energy plans (para. 2.17 and Annex 2.1).
1.26     Institutional Setting for Energy Planning:  Several entities and
agencies are involved in the operation and management of Jordan's energy
sector.  A feature of this setting is the lack of coordination and the large
difference in the technical and administrative capabilities of the entities.
All the enterprises responsible for the production, transportation and
distribution of energy (JEA, JEPCO, JPRC, and to a lesser extent, IDECO) are
fairly well staffed and capable of executing their responsibilities at
standards that are, for some, substantially higher than those generally found
in the area, and in most cases, comparable to those found in the
industrialized countries. By contrast, the agencies responsible for the
overall management of the sector, and the formulation and coordination of
plans, lack a clear direction, and are either overextended (NPC) or
understaffed (NEC).
1.27     Until recently, NEC was, in essence, responsible for the formulation
of overall policies in the energy sector. However, since the membership of
the committee is made up of high ranking officials with other administrative
responsibilities (ministers, directors of departments and corporate managers),
its effectiveness as an energy planning body was constrained because of the
limited input provided by the Energy Department at MIT. Since its creation,
the Energy Department has been unable to adequately execute its
responsibilities because of lack of precise objectives, shortage of funds, and
above all, inexperience. The department experienced severe difficulties in
attracting and retaining staff of the quality needed to ensure effective
support for NEC and adequate input in the formulation of energy policies. NPC
is responsible for the coordination of sectoral plans, the selection of
projects for the national development plans and the mobilization of foreign
and domestic financing for these plans. However, its coordinating function is
basically an aggregation of plans for each energy subsector drawn
independently by the enterprise or agency responsible without assurance that
the plans are part of an overall least cost strategy for the development of
the sector. In sensing the need for a more systematic analysis of the
interrelationship between energy and economic growth, NPC has moved to fill
the existing gap in the institutional structure of the sector by commissioning
several energy planning related studies. However, its staff has been
over-burdened because of the wide responsibilities covering all sectors of the
economy; and as a result, the time devoted by the Council to energy planning
was fairly limited.
1.28     The main constraint to the Government's ability to formulate
comprehensive national energy plans has been the abundance of agencies in the
sector among which the country's human, financial and administrative resources
are dispersed. Consequently, the sector suffers from the absence of a nucleus
of human and financial resources needed for undertaking energy planning. The
Government has recently become aware of the shortcomings of the institutional
structure of the sector, and as a result, it created the SCE under the



- 12 -
chairmanship of the president of NPU, with representatives from the various
subsectors of the energy sector (para. 1.08).  SCE has been given the mandate
to set guidelines and monitor t'he operations of the newly created EPU at NPC.
EPU has been entrusted with the solle responsibility for energy planning in
Jordan.  This would cover the formuLation of long-term energy policy and
plans, the integration of the subsectoral i.nvestment plans into a consistent
national inivestment plan, the idertifiLcation of priority projects and the
supervision of their implementation, The creation of SCE and EPU represents a
major step in the rationalization o:E energy planning in Jordan. The creation
of EP.U has filled a major gap in the :nstitutional structure of the energy
sector.  The next step would be to draw from the manpower presently available
in the various institutions in the sector cualified Jordanians who could be
trained in energy planning. During negotiations the Government agreed i) to
assign to EPU in at timely manner the staff required to enable EPU to perform
its administrative and technical funictions under the Project and ii) to set in
con.sultation with the Bank the outline of training programs needed to
strengthen the capabilities of EPU's staff (para. 5.02). In addition, the
Government informed the Bank that the selection process for EPU's manager has
started and his apppointment will take place by the end of 1983.  Currently,
NPC is compiling a list of the potential candidal:es who could be transferred
from the other agencies in the sector, industry and the universities to staff
EPUo
1.29     The Power Subsector:  Planning in the power sector is substantially
better than the overall energy planning. Altho-ugh some weaknesses still
prevail, the subsector is in the processes of adcdressing them with the
assistance of the Bank.  Investment plans for generation and transmission are
prepared by JEA assisted by expatriate consultant:s. In fact, the Bank has
questioned the extent of JEA's deperdence on consultants during the appraisal
of the third power project (Loan 1688-JO). Since! then, JEA has taken
commendable steps in staffing its planning depart:ment and training its newly
recruited staff.  JEA's load forecasting capability has improved
significantly, and with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) and Bank financing under the proposed Project, a new forecasting
model relating the macroeconomic indicators and the consumption of electricity
would be added to JEA's planning tools. Moreover, the Load Research and
Management Study financed under the proposed Project would outline a system
for the establishment of data base for the Dower subsector to be used for load
forecasting, system planning, and tariff designs (Annex 2.1), The proposed
Project would also provide the resources needed to train and install the WASP
systems planning model at JEA (Annex 2.1). Details of load forecast and the
existing and planned facilities in the power subsector are presented in Annex
1.1.
Energy Development Strategy
1.30     Jordan is totally dependent on imported oil for meeting its needs of
commercial energy. Following the 1973 oil crises, the burden of Jordan's
import bill for oil started rising asad by 1982 it absorbed 29% of its foreign
exchange earnings compared with 10% in 1973. Past exploration work by
international oil companies has been unsuccessful, and consequently all of
their activities were terminated in L976. Efforts by the Government, as
recently as 1981, to attract foreign firms t:o undertake exploration following
their withdrawal from Jordan have also been unfruitful, mainly because of the



- 13 -
poor quality of the geological packages offered, which failed to provide
adequate technical support for the prospects. Despite the setbacks
experienced in attracting international oil firms to undertake exploration
contracts in Jordan, expert assessment of the country's petroleum geology
indicates that the prospects for the discovery of small oil reserves are
fairly good. This encouraged the Government to initiate its current
exploration program, which includes seismic and drilling operations. Although
traces of oil have already been encountered, a more extensive geological
analysis, based on recently developed techniques, is required to provide the
basis for the implementation of a systematic exploration drilling program.
1.31     Solar energy is Jordan's principal energy resource; however, its
commercial utilization is well below what could optimally be achieved,
primarily because of the absence of a policy for encouraging its use as a
substitute for petroleum products. Moreover, past research work on the
exploitation of solar energy is proceeding in a piecemeal and uncoordinated
fashion, largely due to country's inability to mobilize technical and
financial resources from bilateral and multinational agencies. As for the
commercial exploitation of solar energy, it is presently limited to water
heating supplied by locally manufactured equipment based on older technology
produced without adequate attention to quality. Consequently, the market
penetration of solar water heaters has been slower than in other countries in
the region. Solar passive systems and solar greenhouses are two other
technologies that have important commercial and fuel displacement potential
for Jordan; however, so far, these have not been properly demonstrated in the
country.
1.32     Despite the favorable prospects for the discovery of oil and the
potential for increased utilization of solar energy as a substitute for
petroleum products and electricity, Jordan's only option for decreasing its
dependence on imported energy in the immediate future is to ensure that energy
is supplied and consumed in the most efficient way possible. Jordan's energy
consumption per unit of GDP is one of the highest among the middle income
countries and industrial market economies. In 1982, the energy consumption
per unit of GDP 1/ was 0.617 toe/l,000 GNP which was higher than the energy
intensity of Japan (0.323/1,000 GNP), France (0.335/1,000 GDP), Italy
(0.437/1,000 GDP) and Turkey (0.404/1,000 GDP). This high level of energy
intensity is due primarily to the inefficiency with which energy is consumed
by the industrial sector and the subsidized prices maintained by the
Government for aviation fuel and diesel oil which encourages their uneconomic
use in the transport sector. In 1982, the transport sector absorbed about 50%
of total energy consumption and the industrial and power sectors accounted for
another 38%.
1.33     The 1981-1985 program for the development of the urban and rural
distribution program in areas served by JEA, JEPCO and IDECO was formulated in
1980. The Bank has financed (Loan 1986-JO) a slice of that program in
parallel with other commercial, bilateral and multinational organizations, and
financial institutions. However, with the growth of demand at the currently
projected rate, it is expected that by 1985 or at the latest 1987, the
existing grid would reach its capacity limit, and unless the network is
1/ Expressed in real terms.



- 14 -
reinforced, the level of technical losses would increase and the quality of
service would deteriorate significantly. Furthermore, there has been
increased import of small diesel power generators by the rural households
without access to public supply of electricity, thus raising the consumption
of diesel oil, which continues to be in short supply in Jordan because of the
present configuration of the country's only refinery at Zarqa. Consequently,
the Government has accelerated the program for rural electrification. JEA has
secured financing from the local market and bilateral aid agencies for the
development of its distribution iietwork. By contrast, JEPCO and IDECO
continue to experience shortages in their finances for the implementation of
their rural and urban electrification programs. The distribution component of
the Project would help close the gaps in the financing plans of the two power
distribution utilities.
1.34     Recognizing the need for a systematic approach to the development of
energy, the Government requested Bank assistance in identifying the major
issues facing the sector which were presented in ESS.  The main issues and
recommendations outlined in the ESS are presented in Annex 1.2 which are
referred to as the energy plan of action for 1983-1985 (EPA). The EPA
summarizes the issues, recommendations, the agency financing the studies
involved, if any, and the status of all the actions required. When fully
implemented, EPA would provide most, if not all, of the inputs needed for the
formulation of strategies for: (a) oil and gas exploration; (b) the
exploitation of oil shale; (c) the increased commercial use of solar and wind
energy; (d) the optimal utilization of geothermal resources; (e) the
development of infrastructure for refining the i-uture supply of crude oil and
transporting and handling petroleum products; (f) the reduction of losses in
the transformation and delivery of primary to secondary energy in both the
petroleum and power subsectors; (g) conservation in the overall consumption of
energy, particularly by the industrial, transport, residential and commercial
sectors; and (h) the improvement of energy demanid management through pricing
and fiscal measures. In addition, Jordan's energy planning capabilities would
be strengthened through the creation of a comprehensive and detailed energy
data base, the installation and integration of several energy planning models,
and the establishment of an energy planning unit: with staff trained in the
most recent techniques of investment planning, project preparation and
appraisal, and macroeconomic policy formulation.
G. Beneficiaries and Implementing Agencies
The Jordanian Electric Power Company (JEPCO)
1.35     JEPCO's operations are regulated in accordance with a 50-year
concession agreement granted in 1962. The company's management is dictated by
the Articles of Association (1978) which regulate all matters relating to
capital formation, responsibility of shareholders, issue and sale of shares,
procedures of the General Assembly, election and activities of the Board of
Directors, distribution of profits, auditing, etc. JEPCO's Board of Directors
is composed of 11 members; 2 are nominated by the Government, and the other 9
are elected by the General Assembly.



- 15 -
1.36     JEPCO is well organized and its staff is, on the whole, well
qualified. However, its main organizational weakness is in the area of
finance. In order to address this gap, the Bank financed, under the fourth
power project (Loan 1986-JO), a financial management study, by
Gilbert Commonwealth Engineers and Consultants (GCEC), a US firm, aimed at
identifying the major issues and outlining a strategy for addressing them
(organization, staffing, training, financial control, etc.). The preliminary
recommendations of the study have been reviewed with the Bank in May 1983.
The study would be completed by the end of 1983. After finalizing the study,
in consultation with the Bank, JEPCO would invite proposals by consultants for
the implementation of GCEC's main recommendations. The proposed Project would
ensure, through amendments to the TORs, of ongoing and proposed studies for
JEA, JEPCO and IDECO, that a system for measuring and monitoring the technical
and financial efficiency of the 3 utilities is designed and implemented. This
system would include: (a) the development of meaningful means for the
measurement of performance; (b) the development of a data base for the power
subsector and the storage, retrieval and supply of data; (c) the establishment
of performance criteria; and (d) the outline of guidelines for reporting and
evaluating performances (Annex 2.1).
1.37     At the end of 1982, JEPCO had 1,470 employees, of which 983 were in
operations. Although JEPCO's staff salaries are somewhat higher than JEA's,
JEA has managed to attract and retain engineers because of technically
challenging nature of generation and transmission planning and operations.
Consequently, to attract and retain its qualified staff, JEPCO has introduced,
in addition to regular salaries and wages, 13th and 14th month salaries,
accommodation allowances, discount for electricity consumption and other
incentives.
1.38     JEPCO's training programs are carried out with the assistance of the
Jordanian Vocational Training Corporation. About 220 students have been
selected to be trained with various technical teams in the company for a
period of three years. In addition 10 students, sponsored by JEPCO and
attending courses at engineering colleges, are being trained in the technical
and administrative departments of the company. In 1982, 10 engineers were
sent to the UK, USA and France to attend training courses.
The Irbid District Electricity Company Limited (IDECO)
1.39     Similar to JEPCO, the operations of IDECO are regulated in accordance
with a 50-year concession agreement granted by the Government in 1961. The
management of the company is outlined in the General Agreement (1978) which
covers capital acquisition and disposal, treatment of profit, distribution of
earnings, auditing, etc. IDECO's Board of Directors is composed of 11
members, 6 are nominated by the Government, 2 by municipalities, and the
other 3 are elected by the General Assembly.
1.40     Although IDECO's operations are reasonably well managed considering
its size and remoteness, some improvements are still needed in its
organization and management, particularly in finance. IDECO has retained the
services of the Government-owned Jordan Institute for Administration to advise
it on management, manpower planning, and accounting. On the technical side,
IDECO receives staff support from JEA in the areas of planning and network



- 16 -
operation. In addition, the company has retained the services of Preece,
Cardew and Rider (PCR), a UK firm,  to assist in the implementation of its
development program.  The Bank has reviewed the guidelines for JEA's technical
support and the TOR for PCR and found them satisfactory. In the financial
area, however, there are still major weaknesses which should be addressed.
Therefore, similar to the steps tak:en in dealing with JEPCO's weaknesses in
the financial area, IDECO should undertake a study to outline a strategy for
strengthening its capabilities in the area of finance as well as performance
measurement (para. 1.36). The prop,osed Project would finance a study to be
undertaken in accordance with TOR acceptable to the Bank by not later than
June 30, 1984 (para. 3.18).
1.41     At the end of 1982, IDECO had 604 employees, of which 277 were
technical staff. Although IDECO staff salaries are somewhat lower than JEA's,
it has been able to attract a fair number of qualified staff because the cost
of living in Irbid is lower than Amman's. In acddition to regular salaries and
wages, IDECO has also introduced lth and 14th month salaries, discount for
electricity consumption and other incentives in order to retain its
professional and skilled labor staff.
1.42     IDECO's training programs have been carried out in the training
centres at Yarmuk University. About 80 students have been selected to be
trained with various technical teams in the company for a period of three
years. In addition 20 students attending courses at engineering colleges, are
being trained during the summer vacations in the technical and administrative
departments of the company. In 1981-1982 four engineers and one accountant
were sent to the U.K. to attend training courses. Also IDECO includes in its
project contracts a provision to train its staff.  Although the previous
training of IDECO's staff has been satisfactory, continuing efforts are needed
to intensify IDECO's training programs covering all basic training needs.
Natural Resources Authority (NRA) and Royal Scientific Society (RSS)
1.43     NRA is discussed in para. 1.09.  RSS is the only applied research
agency in Jordan. It was established in 1970 through a Royal Decree with the
mandate to promote research aimed at the industrial, economic and social
development of the country. The Society provides direct consulting services
to Jordanian industries and makes available its facilities to interested
industrial concerns in the country. Finally, the Society also provides
assistance to the Government in its planning operations and in designing
scientific curricula for academic institutions. Since its creation, the
Society has worked toward attaining this goal. RSS uses a mission-oriented
approach in its projects and tries to develop products which, in principle,
could lead to commercialization. However, despite important strides that RSS
has made, there still exists room for impr3vemerLt. The Society is cognizant
of this fact and is trying to rectify it.
1.44     RSS has qualified manpower and adequate support facilities.  It has a
total of 430 employees out of which 188 are professionals, and the rest are
support staff. Among the professionals, nearly 50% have post graduate degrees
and diplomas mostly from universities in USA and. Europe. Generally speaking,
the technical quality of RSS staff is fairly high. Also the support
facilities (especially the computer, workshop and testing facilities) are
exceptionally good.



- 17 -
1.45     The policy of RSS is formulated by a Board of Trustees chaired by the
Crown Prince. The Society is headed by a Director General, who administers
the organization through a number of directorates (viz. mechanical
engineering, economics, industrial chemistry, computer science, education,
economics, buildings research, electrical services and general administration)
each headed by a director. Some larger directorates are further divided into
departments. Of particular interest is the mechanical engineering
directorate, which includes solar energy as one of its major departments. The
department has a staff of 20 which includes 15 professionals, with 11 having
post graduate degrees. The department has undertaken R&D work in solar and
wind energy for about a decade. Their major success has been in spinning off
the solar water heating industry in Jordan, which despite some weaknesses to
be addressed under the proposed Project, has attained some modest degree of
success. In general, however, the department needs to sharpen its focus
toward commercialization. In order to achieve this objective, the solar
energy department should strengthen its staff and its experimental
facilities. The proposed Project would cover the cost of demonstration and
pilot schemes, studies and training which would improve and update the skills
of staff in the department of solar energy.
1.46     RSS draws most of its budget through grants from the Government.  The
rest of its funds are in the form of grants from the bilateral and
multilateral agencies. In addition, the Society generates a small fraction of
its budget through contract research. RSS is attempting to expand its revenue
generating role in order to reduce its reliance on grants. Judging by the
progress made during the last few years, the prospects of attaining this goal
appear to be reasonable.
National Planning Council (NPC)
1.47     NPC is a well organized autonomous government agency.  Its staff is
of high caliber and its management is largely credited with the achievement in
the formulation of development plans and the mobilization of external
resources for their implementation. The council has a free hand in its
operation and its president, who is appointed by the Government, maintains
control over the general policies and guidelines but delegates all decisions
relating to the daily operations of the council to his deputies and line
managers. NPC has been able to attract and retain qualified Jordanians mainly
because of the technical caliber of the work, and the salaries and
compensation schemes which are higher than those of the civil service. The
council has also been effective in recruiting internationally reputable
consultants to undertake specific studies which its staff were unable to
undertake either because of the workload or lack of experience. Although
NPC's staff is adequately trained in general macroeconomic planning, the newly
created EPU would need to be staffed and its capabilities matched with those
of the macroeconomic planning unit. Moreover, the operations of the unit and
those of the macroeconomic unit would need to be coordinated to ensure
consistency and to avoid duplication. The Bank would assist in drafting the
professional profiles for the staff to be recruited for EPU, and the proposed
Project would cover the cost of advisers, training and equipment needed to
ensure that the unit ultimately develops into a highly qualified energy
planning body (para. 2.17 and Annex 2.1).

H. Role of IDA/Bank
1.48     The World Bank Group has been involved in 5 operations in the power
subsector. The first 2 of these operations were in the form of credits made
to the Government to support its efforts in initiating the first stages for
the development of generation. Credit 386-JO (1973) financed US$10 million,
together with an equal amount from the Kuwait Fund, the foreign exchange cost
of 2x33-MW steam power units and lx13 MW gas turbine at the Hussein power
station.  These have been completed and are currently operating
satisfactorily.  IDA Credit 570-JO (1975) for US$5 millions wlith cofinancing
from the Arab Fund (US$13.4 million), covered the foreign exchange cost of a
third 33 MW unit at the Hussein power station, the reconditioning of the Marqa
diesel power station, and a study for the formulation of a plan for the
development of the transmission and distribution grids in the southern
region.  The steam unit and the reconditioned Marqa diesel station were put
into commercial operation in 1974. TChe combined 'project completion report for
the two Credits (June 1982) states that the projects, in fulfilling their
roles, have exceeded the expectations of the appraisal. Loan 1688-JO (1979)
for US$15 million financed the development of the national transmission
network and the extension of public supply of electricity of 33 villages in
the areas served by JEA. The Project has been completed and the corresponding
completion report is being prepared. Loan 1986-JO (1981) for US$25 million,
which covered parts of the development programs of JEA and JEPCO for the
period 1981-1984, is progressing satisfactorily. Loan 2162-JO (1982) for
US$35 million, with cofinancing from a number of bilateral and multilateral
institutions, covered the foreign exchange cost of- a 2x130 MW thermal power
station at Aqaba with a total cost of about US$300 million. The
implementation of the Project is proceeding in accordance with the timetable
outlined in the appraisal report.
1.49     The Bank Group lending operations have been instrumental in fostering
the development of JEA into a fairly mature utility. These operations have
also played a catalytic role in attracting financial resources from a number
of bilateral and multilateral financial institutions. The Bank has also
undertaken a comprehensive review of the main energy sector issues summarized
in the ESS. The report has been successful in initiating extensive
discussions within the Government and with the bilateral and multilateral aid
agencies, and in coordinating all activities relating to the development of
the sector. The proposed Project would enable the Bank to continue its
efforts towards achieving the institution-building objectives identified. It
would assist the Government in mobilizing the external resources and
integrating all activities in the sector into a plan of action for 1983-1985
aimed at providing all the necessary inputs for the formulation of a long-term
plan for the development of energy.

II. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
2.01     The main objectives of the proposed Project are:
(a)  to initiate or continue the implementation of some major investments
that would contribute to the improvement of Jordan's overall energy
efficiency;
(b)  to attract cofinancing and serve as an umbrella whereby all the
involvement of the bilateral and multinational organizations is
coordinated and integrated into a consistent plan of action for the
development of energy; and
(c)  to ensure that the critical elements (data, models, training, pilot
projects, prefeasibility investment studies, etc.) needed for the
formulation of a comprehensive long term energy plan would be
available by 1985.
Project Description
2.02     The proposed Project is designed to ensure that the involvement of
the aid donors, international organizations and the Bank in the implementation
of the EPA is coordinated into a set of complementary or sequential tasks
which would provide the elements needed for the formulation of the envisaged
long-term plan for energy. It would involve 5 components: Petroleum
Exploration; Power Distribution; Energy Conservation; Renewable Energy; and
Energy Planning. Details are presented in Annex 2.1 and are summarized below.
A. Petroleum Exploration Component:
(i) Equipment and material for micropalaeontology, palynology
petrography, geochemistry and well testing;
(ii)  Consulting services for petroleum geology, drilling and
production, seismic interpretation, seismostratigraphy;
(iii)  Training of NRA's staff abroad in recently developed
techniques in petroleum exploration and production; and
(iv) Advanced processing of seismic data.
B.  Power Distribution Component:
(i) Expansion and rehabilitation of the urban distribution
networks in JEPCO's and IDECO's concession areas and
electrification of about 75 villages, involving about 100
km of 33-kV and 11-kV underground cables, 445 km of 33-kY
and 11-kV overhead lines, 915 km of low voltage lines, 8
power transformers of total capacity of 50 MVA, and
distributiQn transformers with a total capacity of 74 MVA;
and



20 -
(ii) Consulting services to assist JEPCO in the preparation of
detailed engineering design, preparation of bidding
documents, evaluation of tenders, and supervision of
construction and erection; and assist IDECO in the
formulation of a strategy for strengthening its
capabilities in Einancial planning and control.
C.  Energy Conservation Comzonent:
(i) Equipment for analytical laboratories and field
measurements for the determination of the energy
efficiency of boilers, heat exchangers, turbines,
electrical motors, etc.;
(ii)  Consulting services for undertaking detailed energy audits
and project preparation in selected major industries with
potential for energy saving. These would include the
refinery, power plants, phosphate mining and transport,
potash, fertilizer plants, ceramics, cement and steel
works; and
(iii) Training abroad iJor short periods, ranging between 2 and 4
months, for the staff of EPU in identifying and preparing
projects for the improvement of energy efficiency, and the
training of energy conservation officers from the main
industries. In addition, the component provides for 18
months of advisory services to EPU.
D. Renewable Energy Component:
(i)  Equipment:  solar and wind resource measuring instruments
for about 10 locations in the country; 8 solar water
heating demonstration systems, solar collectors, and
experimental set-up to test solar water heating systems;
energy conserving materials (insulation, reflective
coating, etc.); and instrument:ation required to test 4
solar passive homes and 3 commlercial size greenhouses;
(ii)  Consulting services to undertake studies (potential
assessment study, solar water heating study, solar pond
study and solar passive systen); and provide design,
installation, data analysis arLd supervision support on the
pilot and demonstration schemes (solar greenhouses, solar
passive houses and solar water heating test facility); and
(iii) Training for RSS staff ranging; in periods of about 4-12
weeks in the form of workshops and visits to commercial
establishments in an industrialized country. The training
would emphasize commercialization of renewable
technologies.



- 21 -
E.  Energy Planning Component:
(i)  Equipment:  Software and hardware for the energy planning
unit at the National Planning Council;
(ii)  Consulting services for detailed studies in energy
planning, demand management, pricing, etc., and 2 advisers
to assist EPU for a period of 24 months;
(iii)  Training in Jordan and in institutions outside for periods
ranging between 2 and 4 months in project appraisal and
preparation, investment planning, project implementation,
energy pricing conservation, demand management and
macroeconomic policy formulation.
Project Cost
2.03     The total cost of the proposed Project, including physical and price
contingencies, is about JD 23.9 million (US$67.0 million) of which JD 16.2
million (US$45.3 million) is in foreign exchange. Details of the Project cost
are given in Annexes 2.2 through 2.8 and summarized below. The front-end fee
would be paid by the Government and therefore has not been included. The
Project estimates are based on mid-1983 prices derived on the basis of:
a) detailed data provided by the consultants (distribution component);
b) information available on the cost of specialized consultants and training
programs involved in similar tasks in other Bank financed projects (petroleum
exploration, conservation, energy planning and renewable energy), and
c) quotations received for the delivery in June 1983 of equipment and material
similar to those included in other Bank-financed projects. The price
contingencies for the local costs are 8% per year for 1983 through 1986. The
price contingencies for the foreign exchange cost of the Project are 8% for
1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985 and 6.0% for 1986. The Project cost
estimates include physical contingencies for the power distribution component
of 5% because of the nature of the component which is repetitive and requires
standard equipment designs, and the fact that minor variations in the physical
extent of the component would not affect its success. No physical
contingencies were assumed for the other 4 components because these would
primarily involve consulting services and studies, and relatively small
amounts for highly specialized equipment. No tax or import duties would be
paid on the equipment and material financed under the proposed Project.
Project Financing
2.04     The proposed Bank loan of US$30 million would finance about 45X of
the overall cost of the Project of US$67 million. The remaining US$37 million
would be financed by the Government, the beneficiaries, customer
contributions, bilateral and multilateral aid agencies, and UNDP. The
proposed loan would cover about 66% of the foreign exchange cost of the
Project of US$45.3 million, and the remaining US$15.3 million would be
financed by JEPCO and IDECO, Aid agencies, UNDP, and other sources to be
identified by JEPCO. Details of the financing plan are summarized below:

The proposed Bank loan would finance 100% of the foreign exchange cost of the
petroleum exploration component (IJS$5.0 million) and the local cost would be
covered by NRA. The local cost of1 the power distribution component would be
covered by customer contributions, JEPCO and IDECO (US$18.47 million). The
foreign exchange cost of the power distribution component would be financed as
follows: (i) IDECO's share of about US$17.03 million would be covered by:
the proposed Bank loan of US$8.00 million, material and equipment already
available in the utility's warehouses amounting to US$7.3 million, and
internal cash for the remaining US$1.73 million which represent the indirect
foreign exchange for installation and erection,: (ii) JEPCO's share of about
US$17 million would be financed by: the proposed Bank loan of US$13.5
million, commercial loans to be secured to cover the cost of the switchgears
amounting to US$1.85 million, and internal cash for the remaining US$1.65
million representing the indirect foreign exchange for installation and
erection. The proposed loan woulc cover about 94% (US$3.0 million) of the
foreign exchange cost of the energy conservation component and the remaining
6% (US$0.2 million) would be financed by USAID. The local cost (US$0.4
million) of this component would be covered by the Government. The proposed
loan would finance about 15% (US$C.25 million) of the foreign exchange cost of
the renewable energy component and the rest, US$1.45 million equivalent would
be covered by USAID and the Italian bilateral aid agency. RSS would cover the
local costs from its own resources. The proposed Bank loan would finance
about 18% (US$0.25 million) of the foreign exchange cost of the energy
planning component and the balance, amounting to US$1.15 million (82%), would
be covered by USAID, EEC and UNDP. The foreign exchange risks and any cost
overrun would be borne by JEPCO and IDECO for the distribution component of
the proposed Project. The Governnment would bear these risks for the other 4
components. The financing plan for the proposed Project which involves the
beneficiaries (JEPCO and IDECO), and several bilateral and multinational aid
agencies has been reviewed during negotiations and the Government agreed to
fund the components for which the expected contributions do not materialize by
December 31, 1984.

Lending Arrangement
2.05     The proposed Bank loan wzuld be made to the Government.  The portion
of the loan covering the power distribution component would be onlent by the
Government to IDECO (US$8.0 milliDn) and JEPCO (US$13.5 million) at the same
terms as the Bank loan.  This is reasonable in view of the fact that the two
utilities have been able to secure loans for their development programs at
interest rates which are substantially lower than the onlending rate proposed
for Bank loan.  Execution of subsidiary ]oan agreements between Government and
JEPC0 and IDECO will be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 5.09). The
shares of the loan (US$8.5 million) relating to petroleum exploration, energy
conservation, renewable energy and energy planning will be disbursed out of
the annual budgetary allocations of NPCo With regard to the share of the loan
(US$3 million) covering the energy conservation component, it has been agreed
during negotiations that, when a 3tudy for an industry concludes that an
adequate return is likely to resuLt from undertaking investments in certain
energy conservation measures, the corresponding cost will be passed on to the
beneficiaries on terms to be agreed with the Bank.
Accounts and Audits
2.06     The accounts of JEPCO and IDECO are satisfactory.  As agreed under
7oan 1986-JO, JEPCO's accounts are audited by independent auditors and their
past performance has been satisfactory. Under the proposed Project the audit
covenant for JEPCO will be repeated (paras. 3415 and 5.07). IDECO is a new
borrower and agreement has been reached on the appointment of independent
auditors and the submission of audit reports (para. 3.29). The Petroleum
Exploration Component would be executed by NRA. Therefore, in order to
monitor the financial management and control oE the exploration component, the
Government and NRA agreed during negotiations to keeping separate accounts for
NRA's share of the proposed loan; and to appointing independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and to submitting yearly audit reports for Bank's
review and comment 6 months after the close of each year (para. 5.03). The
other 3 components, namely energy conservation, renewable energy and energy
planning would be managed by NPC, and therefore, in order for the council to
monitor the allocation of the loan proceeds to these components and the tasks
within each, the Government and NPC agreed during negotiations to keep
separate accounts for the energy conservation, renewable energy and energy
planning components, to appoint independent auditors acceptable to the Bank
and to submit yearly audit reports for Bank review and comments 6 months after
the beginning of each year (para. 5.04).
Engineering and Consulting Services
2.07     Petroleum Exploration:  Implementation of the Petroleum Exploration
component would require about 206 man-months of consulting services amounting
to about US$3.1 million, based on an estimated cost of US$15,000/man-month.
This would involve: a) eight expatriate advisers for a period of 12-18 months
each to assist the staff of NRA in prospect mapping, log interpretation, well
drilling, seismic and stratigraphic interpretat:ion and in establishing a
computer based accounting system for exploration costs and materiml
(108 man-months); (b) specialized consulting services to be provided by
internationally reputable firms to support the ongoing work (62 man-months);
(c) periodic consulting services to assist and advise NRA in seismic
acquisition and seismic stratigraphy and processing. These services



- 25 -
will be needed for 3-4 periods of 8 weeks (12 man-months); and
(d) miscellaneous consulting services as may be needed by NRA
(24 man-months). The TORs for the advisers and consultants under (a) and (b)
have been agreed upon. The TORs for the services under (c) will be drafted
depending on the needs and the interim results of the ongoing work.
2.08     Power Distribution:  Only the electricity distribution component of
the Project required consulting services prior to appraisal. These services
involved preliminary and detailed design of the network, the specification of
equipment and estimation of costs which were prepared by Kennedy and Donkin
(K&D) and Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR), both UK firms, for JEPCO and IDECO
respectively. The cost of K&D's services were financed by the Bank from the
provisions made for the preparation of new projects under Loan 1986-JO. IDECO
covered the cost of the services provided by PCR from its own resources. The
services of K&D and PCR would be retained by the distribution companies to
assist in the implementation of the Project. In the case of JEPCO, the
Project would finance the engineering services of K&D for assistance in the
evaluation of bids and supervision of construction. This would require about
92 man-months of consulting services at an estimated total cost of about
US$1.11 million, based on a cost of US$12,000/man-month. IDECO is currently
retaining PCR as consultants to provide assistance in the development of the
distribution network between 1983 and 1986. It is estimated that IDECO would
require 100 man-months of consulting services to implement the proposed
Project at an estimated cost of about 1.2 million, based on
US$12,000/man-month. The cost of these services would be financed by IDECO.
In order to ensure that Project execution would proceed in accordance with the
projected implementation schedule, IDECO will employ consultants whose
qualifications and experience are satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.08).
2.09     Energy Conservation:  Implementation of the energy conservation
component would require about 245 man-months of consulting and advisory
services at an estimated total cost of about US$3.0 million of which about
US$2.6 million would be in foreign exchange. About 169 man-months would be
provided by foreign experts at an average cost of 15,000/man-month. Of the
245 man-months (a) 218 man-months, including 146 man-months provided by
foreign experts, would involve the preparation of detailed energy audits,
engineering designs and bidding documents, for the 10 largest energy consuming
plants; (b) 18 man-months of foreign advisory services would be provided by an
energy conservation adviser to train and assist the newly recruited staff at
EPU and the staff of selected industrial companies in the identification of
potential conservation projects in the medium and small scale industries, and
the implementation of an industrial conservation strategy; (c) an additional 9
man-months, including 5 man-months of foreign experts, would be required to
draft an industrial energy conservation manuals for use by the industries to
be audited under the Project. The breakdown of the consulting services
required for each plant is summarized in Annex 2.9.
2.10     Renewable Energy;  Implementation of the renewable energy component,
comprising 10 tasks, would require 87 man-months of consulting services at an
estimated cost of US$870,000, based on a cost of US$10,000/ man-month . Of
these, 53 man-months of consulting services would be needed to complete the
following studies: potential assessment (12 man-months), solar water heating
(19 man-months), solar pond (11 man-months), solar passive (12 man-months).
The execution of the tasks involving demonstration and pilot schemes and
measurement facilities would require about 34 man-months of consulting



- 26 -
services for the selection of sites, specification of equipment, systems
design and training of local counterparts at RSSo
2.11     Energ  Planning;  Implementation of the energy planning component
would require about 168 man-months of consulting services at an estimated cost
of about US$2.3 million, based on a cost of US$14,000/man-month. These
services would cover: (i) the load research and management study (39
man-months) to assist in identifying a strategy for the efficient supply and
consumption of electricity throughout the power subsector; (ii) the
construction of an energy data base and a system for the collection, storage
and retrieval of energy data (38 man-months) for use in energy planning and in
monitoring overall and sectoral consumption of energy; (iii) a study to
determine the economic feasibility of converting simple cycle gas turbines to
combined cycle (5 man-months); (iv) the formulation of a policy for demand
management involving energy pricing policy, fiscal incentives and measures for
the inducement conservation, retrofitting, insulation, etc. (6 man-months);
(v) the addition and integration of the WASP power system planning model and
the model for the forecast of demand for energy in the planning tools of EPU
and JEA (5 man-months); (vi) 2 resident advisers in energy economics and
energy planning to advise and assist the staff of EPU in identification and
evaluation of projects, investment planning, formulation of energy policy and
integration of macroeconomic and energy development plans (48 man-months);
(vii) consultative group on energy composed of internationally reputed energy
economists, planners and engineers to advise EPIJ's staff and advisers on
energy policy and review the studies and plans produced by the Unit through
periodic conferences abroad and in Jordan (7 man-months); (viii) formulation
of a tax structure for petroleum products to ensure consumption of products in
a mix consistent with refinery output and maximize the resources mobilized for
the Government, and outline a strategy for limiting energy subsidies, if any,
to target low income groups (6 man-months); and ix) studies in energy policy,
energy planning and energy modelling that the Government, based on advice from
NPC or the consultative group and in consultation with the Bank, judge
necessary for the achievement of the objectives of the proposed Project (14
man-months).
Project Implementation
2612     The overall responsibility for coordinating and monitoring the
implementation of the Project would be entrusted to the newly created energy
planning unit (EPU) at NPC which wculd also act as the counterpart to the Bank
and cofinanciers. However, in order to ensure the efficient execution of some
of the components, 3 separate Project agreements would be required for the
implementation of the proposed Project. These would affect JEPCO and IDECO
for the execution of their respective share of the power distribution
component, and NRA for the execution of the petroleum exploration component.
Furthermore, since the Government has requested the Bank's active involvement
in mobilizing cofinancing from bilateral and multilateral aid agencies for the
renewable energy and the energy planning components, the Bank would provide
guidance in drafting the TOR and setting the implementation schedule for the
tasks and studies financed by the cofinanciers. EPU would coordinate and
monitor the progress of the tasks financed by the cofinanciers. The Project
implementation schedule is given in Annex 2.10. In order to ensure that the
implementation of the proposed Project is not delayed because of staffing
constraints, the early appointment Df a manager would be needed to monitor and
coordinate all the preparatory work needed for completing the staffing of EPU



- 27 -
and commissioning the studies financed under the Project. During
negotiations, the Government confirmed that the appointment of EPU's manager
will take place before the end of 1983.
2.13     Petroleum Exploration:  The petroleum exploration component would be
implemented by the Petroleum Department (PD) of NRA over a period of about 18
months. The consulting services, training and equipment to be financed under
the Project would strengthen the capabilities of PD to undertake a more
extensive and systematic program of geological work (prospect mapping, log
interpretation, and acquisition, processing and interpretation of seismic
data) required to attract foreign oil firms to undertake petroleum exploration
in Jordan, and to provide the inputs needed for NRA to formulate an
exploration drilling program in case foreign firms continue their disinterest
in exploration in the country. In addition, the team responsible for
implementing NRA's ongoing program for exploration drilling would coordinate
with the senior drilling and production engineer to be recruited under the
Project. Therefore, in order to ensure that the Project would make the
largest possible impact on the ongoing geological work, the Government and NRA
agreed during negotiation to recruit, in accordance with terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank, the specialist under para. 2.07 by not later than
June 30, 1984 and to review with the Bank the results of the geological
studies prior to the implementation of the drilling program (para. 5.04).
2.14     Power Distribution:  The power distribution component would be
implemented by JEPCO and IDECO. The implementation of the Project in parallel
with the extension and reinforcement of the existing system, is considered to
be within capabilities of both companies with the assistance of consultants.
The Project will be implemented over 3 years. The preparation of detailed
design and tender documents for procurement of goods are under way and would
be completed by March 1984. Installation and erection of the Project
facilities would start in July 1984 and is expected to be completed by
December 1986. The terms of reference for both K&D and PCR, and the
qualification of the staff assigned to assist JEPCO and IDECO in the
implementation of the Project have been reviewed by the Bank and found to be
satisfactory. Once the Project is commissioned, all the facilities would be
owned, operated and maintained by JEPCO and IDECO respectively.
2.15     Energy Conservation Component:  The energy conservation component
would be implemented over a period of 18 months by consultants with proven
experience in energy conservation. It would involve techno-economic studies
aimed at assessing the potential savings and costs of energy conservation
projects in about 10 major energy consuming industrial works. The studies
would be undertaken in 3 phases all of which would be carried out under the
Project. The energy conservation studies would require 227 man-months of
consulting services including 76 man-months of local support. These services
would involve: (i) preliminary audits to identify energy conservation
projects; (ii) recommendations and detailed feasibility studies for energy
conservation projects; (iii) preparation of basic engineering designs,
equipment lists and specifications, cost estimates and economic evaluation of
proposed projects; (iv) preparation, for recommended projects, of bidding
documents in consultation with the concerned industries; and (v) preparation
of energy conservation and utilization manuals. Phase I would review and
establish an energy balance for each process within a plant and aggregate them
in an overall energy balance for each plant. This would make possible the
identification of the areas where savings in energy could be achieved with



- 28 -
improved management and operating procedures together with minor investments
involving better insulation, heat recuperation, etc. This phase would also
provide an estimate of the potential for conservation without major investment
and a rough estimate of the savings that could be achieved with more
substantial investments.  The resulcing output from Phase I would be a matrix
of various levels of investments and the corresponding savings by plant.
Phase II would provide an exact estimate of the investment in selected
projects required to improve the energy efficiency and the net saving
attributable to the investment, as well as, the pay back period and the return
on investment. This phase would provide a ranking of the investments in
energy conservation. Phase III would focus on the basic engineering design,
the specification of equipment and the preparation of bidding documents for
the industries where investment in new equipment and processes is deemed
justified from the economic point of view. The terms of reference for the
component have been prepared and submitted to NPC for review and comment. The
TOR were finalized in July 1983. In order to assist the Government with the
coordination and supervision of the ongoing work, a resident adviser would be
provided under the Project for a period of 18 months. The adviser would be
assigned to the newly created EPU at NPC in the section for energy
conservation. In addition, the Unit would include at least 2 engineering
graduates who would be trained overseas in the identification, preparation and
implementation of energy conservatian projects in institutions specializing in
conservation to be selected in consultation with the Bank.  A training program
has been outlined by the Bank and raviewed with NPCD The training, covering
periods ranging between 2 and 4 months, would be carried out in sequential
manner to allow sufficient overlap cf EPU's Jordanian staff with the
conservation adviser over the 18-month assigniment. Moreover, the Project
would finance equipment, which would be installed at the chemical analysis
department of RSS, and train 2 of tlhe Laboratory's staff in the use of the
equipment to provide technical support for the conservation section of EPU.
In order to ensure that the energy conservation component is implemented in
accordance with the proposed schedule, EPU would need to recruit Jordanian
professionals with adequate qualifications including a head for the energy
conservation and renewable energy section to be created in the Unit
(para. 2.16). This would ensure that all preparation (correspondence with
potential consultants, coordination with managers and technicians in the
plants to be audited, briefing of cDnsultants, etc.) necessary for initiating
the energy audits are coordinated. During negotiations, the Government and
NPC agreed to recruiting, in a timely manner, a qualified engineer to head the
energy conservation and renewable energy section (para.5.04).
2;16     The Renewable Energy Component:  The renewable energy component would
be carried out by the Conservation and Renewable Energy Section of EPU in
cooperation with RSS and with assistance of consultants. It would be
implemented over a period of about 3 years., The bilateral (US and Italian
Government) aid agencies became interested in participating in this component
only because of the Bank involvement. In addition, the Government felt that
the formulation anid implementation of a national plan of action for the
renewable energy subsector could best be achieved under the Bank's
leadership. A coordinated plan has been formulated to ensure timely
implementation of the 10 tasks constituting the renewable energy component.
This plan would provide a framework for the discussions of the Government with
the cofinanciers. Therefore, in order to ensure the timely implementation of



- 29 -
this component, an understanding has been reached during negotiations that the
Government would provide the Bank with details of the arrangements and
implementation schedule agreed with the cofinanciers and the activities
covered thereunder by not later than December 31, 1983. With respect to
studies financed by the Bank, there will be an exchange of views with the Bank
prior to initiating detailed designs on subprojects. EPU would monitor the
implementation of the tasks financed by the cofinanciers (para. 5.01).
2.17     Energy Planning Component:  The implementation of the energy planning
component would be the responsibility of the EPU of NPC. The unit would be
managed by Jordanians, whose manager would report directly to the President of
NPC. The unit would have 3 sections each headed by a chief. These are: the
energy conservation and renewable energy section, the policy and development
section, and the statistical analysis section. The energy conservation and
renewable energy section would be staffed with Jordanians selected by the
Government to perform tasks outlined in TORs discussed with the Bank during
negotiations (para. 2.15). The section would be primarily involved for 2
years in the coordination and supervision of the energy audits financed under
the Project. In addition and in order to train the newly recruited staff, the
conservation adviser would assist in identifying energy conservation projects
for the small and medium scale industries. The section would also work
closely with the policy and development section in formulating an overall plan
for demand management which would be undertaken with the assistance of
consultants financed by the Bank. These tasks and reports would be monitored
by the Bank for the tasks and studies financed under the Project, and by EPU
for those financed by the cofinanciers. The Energy Policy and Development
Section would be responsible for the formulation of all policies relating to
demand management, energy development and project identification and
preparation and the integration of subsectoral investment plans into a
consistent national energy development program. The staff of the section
would be involved over a 2-year period in coordinating and completing the
study for the formulation of demand management, the study for the design of an
optimal structure for taxing petroleum products, and the ultimate formulation
of an overall energy plan for 1985-1990. The section would be staffed with an
expatriate energy economist to assist and supervise the work to be undertaken
by the 2 Jordanian economists to be recruited. In addition, the Jordanian
staff would be trained in institutions outside Jordan in the areas of project
evaluation, investment planning and energy policy. Detailed outline of the
training program has been reviewed during negotiations and would be finalized
by December 31, 1983. The Statistical Analysis Section would be responsible
for the construction of an energy data base, the integration of an energy
submodel in the macroeconomic model of the economy, the construction of
detailed models for the forecast of energy including electricity and
monitoring the consumption of energy by the main sectors of the economy. The
section is already in existence and its staff would only require strengthening
and training. A statistical adviser consultant with experience in energy
would be recruited for the section under financing provided by the Project.
Detailed TOR for the economic and statistical advisers have been reviewed with
the Government and NPC during negotiations.
Procurement
2.18     Procurement for most of the works and goods to be financed by the
proposed Bank loan would be through international competitive bidding (ICB)



- 30 -
with appropriate allowance for preierences for domestic manufacturers.
However, for certain specific items, an alternate form of procurement
described in Part B of the Bank's Procurement Guidelines would be selected.
The procurement of the services of consulting firms or of the individual
consultants would be in accordance with the Banlc's Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants. The following summar.zes the procurement procedures proposed for
various components of the projects.
2.19     Petroleum Exploration Component:  Aboui: 206 man-months of consulting
services required to provide technical assistance to NRA (para. 2.07) at an
estimated cost of US$3.1 million would be procured in accordance with
provisions described in Part II of the Bank's Guidelines for use of
Consultants. For the highly specialized geological laboratory equipment and
geochemical equipment of estimated values US$2.C million, for which there are
only a limited number of suppliers, procurement would be through limited
international tendering.
2.20     Power Distribution Component - JEPCO:  The goods and services to be
financed by the Bank have been grouped into the following 9 contracts to
ensure effective international competition:
Contract Amount (US$ Million)
Local     Foreign       Total
(1)  Overhead Conductors                  -           1.85        1.85

(9)  Engineering Services                 0.65        0.46        1.11
TOTAL                             4.20      13.50        17.70
Items I through 8 would be procured through ICB.  In the comparison of bids
obtained under ICB, local manufacturers would be allowed a margin of
preference equal to the existing rate of customs duties applicable to
competing imports or 15% of the CIF price, whichever is lower. Contract for
92 man-months of consulting services would be in accordance with the provision
of Part II of the Bank's Guidelines for Use of Consultants. To complete the
urban component, JEPCO would procures the switchgear in accordance with the
requirements of the cofinanciers. In addition, JEPCO would carry out by force
account the balance of the installation and erection works covering several
small relatively dispersed elements which are not suitable for ICB.
2.21     Power Distribution Component - IDECO:  The goods and services to be
financed by the Bank would be packaged into the following 5 contracts:



Contract Amount (US$ Million)
Local     Foreign      Total
(1)  Concrete Poles                       -            1.10        1.10
(2)  Steel Poles                          0.15         1.90        2,05

(5)  Post Insulators and Accessories    -              0.30        0.30
TOTAL                                0.15         8.00        8.15
All those contracts would be subjected to ICB and the above packaging
arrangements would ensure effective competition. In the comparison of bids
obtained under ICB, local manufacturers would be allowed a margin of
preference equal to the existing rate of customs duties applicable to
competing imports or 15% of the CIF price, whichever is lower. Installation
and erection (which would not be financed by the Bank) would be undertaken by
IDECO and local contractors.
2.22     Energy Conservation Component:  About 150 man-months of foreign
consulting services would be required for energy conservation studies (para.
2.09) at an estimated cost of US$2.3 million and would be processed in
accordance with the provisions under Part II of the Bank's Guidelines for
Consultants. Another 20 man-months of individual consulting services at an
estimated cost of US$300,000 for identifying and preparing energy conservation
projects in the medium and small scale industries and for providing training
to local staff (para. 2.10(b)) would be procured in accordance with the
provisions under Part V of the Bank's Guidelines for use of Consultants. As
there are only a limited number of suppliers for the highly specialized
measuring equipment for energy consumption and the amount involved is also
small (US$380,000), the procurement would be through international shopping in
accordance with the provisions under Part B, para. 4.2(c) of the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines.
2.23     Renewable Energy Component:  About 25 man-months of individual
consulting services for design, installation, data analysis and supervision of
resource assessment network and demonstration solar water heating systems
would be procured in accordance with the provision under Part V of the Bank's
Guidelines for use of Consultants. Since the equipment to be procured for
resource assessment network are highly specialized and for which there are
only a limited number of suppliers and since the value is small (US$93,000)
they would be procured through international shopping in accordance with the
provisions under Part B, para. 4.2(c) of the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
The equipment required for demonstration solar water heating systems would
likewise be procured through international shopping in accordance with the
provisions under Part B, para. 4.2 (c) of the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
However, in developing equipment specifications the consultants would pay
particular attention to the technical reliability, economic viability and
amenability to local production in Jordan.
2.24     Energy Planning:  About 25 man-months of consulting services at an
estimated cost of US$250,000 required to strengthen EPU's planning
capabilities would be procured in accordance with the provisions under Part II
of the Bank's Guidelines for Consultants.

Disbursements
2.25     Petroleum Exploration Compcnent:  The disbursement from the proceeds
of the proposed loan would be made for 100% of the foreign exchange cost of:
i) consulting services for petroleum exploration (US$2.9 million);
ii) training courses for the Jordanian staff of PD at NRA (US$0.6 million);
iii) equipment for geological and geochemical anaLlysis (US$0.5 million); and
iv) advance processing of seismic data (US$1.0 million).
2.26     Power Distribution Componert:  For JEPCCI's part of the component,
disbursements would be made for (i) 100% of the foreign expenditures of
directly imported equipment and materials or 100% of local ex-factory costs of
goods manufactured in Jordan; (ii) 40% of total c:ost of contracts procured
through ICB procedures for installation and erect:ion which represents the
estimated foreign exchange content; and (iii) 100% of the foreign cost of
consultants' services. For IDECO's part of the component, disbursements would
be made for 100% of the foreign expenditures of directly imported equipment
and materials or 100% of local ex-factory costs of goods manufactured in
Jordan.
2.27     Energy Conservation:  The disbursements from the proceeds of the
proposed Bank loan for this componen.t would be made for 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of (i) consultants' services for the energy audits (US$2.42
million); (ii) laboratory equipment (US$0.38 million); and (iii) 75% of the
18-month services to be provided by the conservation adviser for EPU (US$0.20
million). Retroactive financing of up to US$0.2C million is proposed for
costs incurred after November 1, 1983 for consultants' services for the energy
audits.
2.28     Renewable Energy:  The disbursements from the proceeds of the
proposed Bank loan for this component would be made for 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of: (i) consulting services for the design and installation of
solar/wind resource assessment network and demonstration solar water heating
systems; (ii) measuring equipment for resource assessment; and (iii) solar
water heating equipment.
2.29     Energy Planning;  The disbursements from the proceeds of the proposed
Bank loan for this component would be made for 100% of the foreign exchange
cost of the consulting services.
2.30     The estimated disbursements from the prcposed loan and for each of
the five components are shown in Annex 2.11 and the disbursement profile is
compared with the regional profile in Annex 2.12.
Risks
2.31     In addition to the risks usually associated with petroleum
exploration there is a risk involved in the implementation of the Project due
to its multidisciplinary nature which would require a high degree of
coordination by the newly created EPU. However, given NPC's demonstrated
success in matter involving interdepartmental coordination and the
Government's commitment to the creation of a strong planning unit, this risk
is substantially reduced.

III. FINANCE
3.01     This Chapter addresses the finances of JEPCO and IDECO, the only
revenue earning beneficiaries. The other entities such as NPC, NRA are
Government agencies. Although part of the conservation component would
benefit the large energy consuming industries (cement, fertilizers, etc.)
which are revenue earning semi-public industries, the Government is presently
in the process of determining how the cost of the energy audit studies would
be treated. However, it has decided that irrespective of the process selected
(grants, loans at concessionary terms, etc.), it would bear the responsibility
for borrowing and repayment.
Rural Electrification Losses
3.02     It is axiomatic that rural electrification is a losing proposition
for a utility because the revenues provided by the consumers in the first few
years of electrification normally fall far short of the utility's costs in
providing the service. This is because of the low level of capacity
utilization of the equipment with a relatively large upfront investment to
meet a disproportionately small demand for electricity in the first few years
of service. The utility would be able to break even from say, 5 to 10 years
depending on how quickly the load develops and costs are spread over an
increasing number of consumers. For example, JEA now incurs an economic cost
of about 70 fils/kWh in supplying electricity to the rural consumers and
obtains as revenue only about 35.6 fils/kWh, thus incurring a loss of about
34.4 fils for each kWh sold (para. 1.23). In view of the inevitable revenue
losses in rural electrification, all the three utilities, namely JEA, JEPCO
and IDECO, being commercially-oriented, would normally be averse to
undertaking extensive rural electrification schemes and would do so only to
serve the national and social objectives of the Government. Since the Bank's
financial objectives for the subsector aim at developing the three utilities
into financially viable and autonomous enterprises, it is reasonable to expect
the Government to compensate them for any losses stemming from the
implementation and operation of its national rural electrification schemes,
which from the utilities' point of view are not justified on financial
grounds. The Government is aware of the need to compensate the utilities for
losses as reflected in its past compensation to the utilities in the form of
soft loans, equity contributions, etc. However, the arrangements for
determining and paying the compensation have not been formalized, and they are
usually completed after considerable negotiations and consequential delays.
In order to avoid these difficulties, Government has established formal
compensation reserves for compensating the utilities for losses (para. 1.23).
Accordingly, the financial projections for JEPCO and IDECO assume revenue
increases and compensation by the Government which together would ensure
that: (a) the average tariff is maintained above or at par with the economic
cost of supply (LRMC) by annually increasing the average revenues to reflect
the increase in the general price level; and (b) the financial targets agreed
with the Bank to ensure the financial viability of the utilities are
achieved. Moreover, the financial projections assume that Government
compensation would decline steadily over the forecast period (1983-1988) as
the level of utilization of infrastructure and equipment approaches its
optimal level.

A. Jordanian Electric Pouer Company
Accounting
3.03     JEPCO's financial planning is handled by its consultants, K & D of
the U.K. It has only an accounting section responsible for keeping the
books. It does not have a financial management department. Under Loan
1986-JO, JEPCO appointed GCEC to undertake a ccmprehensive study of its
organization and management practices, to plan and implement an appropriate
training program to improve the quality of the financial and accounting staff,
and to review its hiring policy with a view to hiring and retaining
appropriately qualified and experienced senior level staff who could gradually
take over the planning functions from the consultants. The study has been
completed and as agreed under Loan 1986-JO, JEPCO would expeditiously
implement, in consultation with the Bank, appropriate changes in its
organizational structure and the training program on the basis of the study.
Accounts Receivable
3.04     During the period through 1980, the Government departments were slow
in paying JEPCO's bills for electricity supply with the result that JEPCO's
accounts receivable were between 6) and 80 days' sales. Under Loan 1986-JO,
the Government agreed to cause all its departments and agencies to pay all
outstanding electricity bills by Saptember 1, 1981 and thereafter to pay all
current bills within 6 weeks of their issuance by JEPCO. Although the earlier
arrears had been liquidated by September 1981 as covenanted, the Government
departments are still slow in paying their current bills, resulting in a high
level of accounts receivable; they were 59 days' sales at the end of 1982. In
order to ensure that delayed paymeat of bills by the Government departments
and agencies may not be a continuing problem, the Government and JEPCO have
agreed to take all actions required to enforce the collection by March 31,
1984 of all bills from the Government departments and agencies which are
outstanding for six weeks or more and thereafter the collection of all current
bills within six weeks of their issuance (para. 5.05). As regards domestic
customers, JEPCO decided in 1980 to safeguard its interests against defaults
on their part by raising the level of customer deposits for new customers to
two months' estimated consumption, and already about 85% of JEPCO's domestic
customers furnish such deposits. As agreed under Loan 1986-JO, JEPCO would
gradually increase the deposits of the remaining 15% of consumers also over
the next two years from the existing level of one month's estimated
consumption to two months. Non-payment of electricity bills by JEPCO's
customers is not expected to be a problem in the future.
Revenue Covenant
3.05     JEPCO agreed under Loan 1986-JO to generate internally, after the
payment of dividends, at least 25% of construction requirements in 1982 and
1983 and at least 35% in 1984 and thereafter. The level of cash generation is
to be computed with reference to the average construction expenditures for 2
years namely, the current and the preceding years. Under that loan, the
Government and JEPCO further agreed to: (i) review at least three months
before the end of each fiscal year, the adequacy of JEPCO's revenues to
achieve, on the basis of a realistic forecast, ;:he agreed self-financing ratio
for the following fiscal year; and (ii) determine, on the basis of this



- 35 -
review, the measures required to achieve this ratio, and consult with the Bank
on these measures and on the implementation schedule for these measures before
the beginning of the following fiscal year.
3.06     The above revenue covenant has served in the past as an appropriate
mechanism for determining the level of revenues required to meet JEPCO's
financial needs. It has to be examined whether the covenant would be
appropriate in future also for setting JEPCO's financial goals. This is
discussed in para. 3.12.
Past Performance and Present Position
3.07     JEPC0's concession agreement stipulates:  (i) that dividends shall
not be less than 7.5% of the nominal value of the shares; and (ii) that if a
tariff increase is approved by the Government to meet the above requirement,
then the increase shall be such as to restrict the profit including income tax
to not more than 16% of the nominal value of the shares. Any profit earned in
excess of 16% is to be transferred to a voluntary reserve account. JEPCO has
always set its financial goals within the framework of the above provisions in
the concession agreement.
3.08     JEPCO's income statements, sources and applications of funds
statements, and balance sheets for the years 1980, 1981 and 1982 are given in
Annex 3.2.  JEPCO's past financial performance has been satisfactory.  Its
self-financing level was 30% of construction requirements in 1981 and 51% in
1982 as against 25% required under Loan 1986-JO (para.3.05). The high
self-financing level in 1982 was mainly because of a 20% drop in the actual
construction expenditure in 1982 as compared to the estimated level. Its
pretax rates of return on revalued assets were 9.5% in 1981 and 8.4% in 1982,
and the corresponding returns after a 38.5% corporate tax were 5.8% in 1981
and 5.2% in 1982. Its debt/equity ratio, which was 26/74 in 19&1 and 29/71 in
1982, indicates a sound equity base, particularly since the assets are
recorded at historical costs. The current ratio was 1.4 in 1981 reflecting an
acceptable liquidity position. In 1982, it dropped to 1.1 indicating that
liquidity was increasingly tight. In fact, owing to the tight cash position
JEPCO had to double its overdraft in 1982 from JD 1.0 million at 1981-end to
JD 2.0 million at 1982-end.
Financing Plan
3.09     The forecast sources and applications of funds statements of JEPCO
for the period 1983-1988 are given in Annex 3.2. These are based on the
assumption that the Government would compensate for rural electrification
losses to provide for average revenue increases of about 21% from January
1984, 2% from January 1985, 2% from January 1986 and 3% from January 1988 to
enable JEPCO to maintain the cash generation levels required under the
existing and proposed covenants (paras. 3.11 and 3.12). A summarized version
is given below:

3.10     Internal sources including customer contributions and additional
customer deposits are expected to provide a total of 46% of the construction
requirements. About 48% of the construction requirements is proposed to be
financed by JEPCO through borrowings of about JD 30.8 million, which includes
committed loans of about JD 10.9 million (17%), the proposed Bank loan of
about JD 4.8 million (7%), and unidentified loans of about JD 15.2 million
(24%). However, about 72% (JD 12 million) of the unidentified portion of the
borrowings assumed relates to its construction requirements after 1985. It is
expected that JEPCO would be able to identify these sources when it updates
its next four-year financing plan for the period 1986-198 . The forecast
assumes that to meet part of its capital expenditure requirements, JEPCO would
sell in March 1985 two million new shares at JD 1.70 per share. JEPCO was
able to sell about 921,000 shares to JEA and other investors in 1981 at JD 1.9
per share. Its shares are actively traded in the market and since they
provide an attractive yield to investors (para. 3.12) it would not have any
difficulty in raising the proposed equity capital from the market. This
equity capital of JD 3.4 million (US$9.6 million) would cover about 6% of its



- 37 -
program requirements. JEPCO has agreed to issue and sell new shares in a
total amount which shall be sufficient to enable JEPCO to meet its capital
expenditures under the Project; and to consult with the Bank, in sufficient
time before the beginning of each fiscal year with a view to determining, in
light of such construction requirements and the expected capital expenditures
of JEPCO during such year, the amount of shares to be issued and the timing
thereof (para. 5.06).
Future Performance
3.11     The forecast income statements and balance sheets for the years
1983-1988 with assets carried at "book value" are given in Annex 3.2.
Assumptions relating to the forecasts are included in Annex 3.1. The
forecasts assume an increase in the average revenue of about 21% starting
January 1, 1984 to secure the agreed 35% cash generation in 1984. The
increase in revenues will be primarily through compensation by the Government
for losses incurred in meeting the demand of the rural consumers and of street
lighting, which together account for about 12% of JEPCO's sales. The
forecasts assume a further increase in the average revenue of about 2% from
January 1, 1985, to enable JEPCO to generate at least 35% of the construction
requirements internally in 1985 as required under Loan 1986-Jo. It is
estimated that with these increases in average revenue, the after-tax rate of
return on revalued assets would be around 6% during 1983-1985, which is
satisfactory (para. 3.12).
3.12     Being a distribution company serving essentially urban consumers,
JEPCO's capital expenditure is mainly in the nature of extension of
distribution facilities or of upgrading existing distribution facilities.
Therefore, after a period of renovation and expansion, there is a falling off
in construction expenditures with the result that with the same level of
internal cash generation the self-financing ratio rises. This is the case
with JEPCO in the years 1986-88 when the total construction expenditures are
estimated to fall from JD 13.6 million in 1985 to JD 10.3 million in 1986,
JD 9.1 million in 1987 and JD 9.5 million in 1988. In such circumstances, it
has to be tested whether the required level of cash generation results in an
adequate return on revalued fixed assets in operation. Since the return is
computed after 38.5% of taxable income is siphoned off by Government as
corporation tax, a rate of return of around 6% on revalued assets should be
considered adequate. Such a return would be the equivalent of a return before
taxes of close to 10% on revalued assets. To achieve a 6% return on revalued
assets in 1986-1988, JEPCO would require a revenue increase of about 2% from
January 1986 and 3% from January 1, 1988. During negotiations, an
understanding has been reached with the Government and JEPCO that JEPCO would
test its financial performance not only by cash generation objectives but also
by returns on operating asjets valued according to a methodology to be agreed
between the Government and the Bank (para. 5.01). The Government and JEPCO
have agreed to repeating the existing revenue covenant in the proposed loan
(para. 5.05). Since 12% of JEPCO's sales are to rural consumers and for
street lighting, an appropriate compensation from Government for losses
associated with street lighting and with the extension of public supply of
electricity to the rural consumers would be included as revenues in computing
the cash generation (para. 3.02). Government and JEPCO have also agreed to
repeating the existing review provision (para. 3.05) in the proposed covenant
(para. 5.05).



- 38 -
3.13     During the period 1983-1988, JEPCO's debt/equity ratio would be
between 41/59 and 54/46, which is acceptable. The current ratio during the
period would be between 1.3 and 1.6, which reflects an acceptable liquidity
position. The company's earnings per share would be between 14% and 33% of
the nominal value of the shares which, when computed with reference to the
market value of the shares (about twice the nominal value at present), still
provides a return to the investors, which is attractive relative to other
investments in the country. Consequently, it is expected that JEPCO would
continue to be successful over the forecast period in attracting private
investors. Assuming that the Government departments would pay their bills
promptly, the accounts receivables are projected to be about six weeks' sales
in the future.
Debt Service Coverage
3.14     During the forecast perioL, the debt service coverage ratio is
projected to be between 2.7 and 3.2, which is satisfactory. Under Loan
1986-JO, JEPCO agreed that it will not incur any debt without prior approval
of the Bank, unless its net revenues (before depreciation and interest) less
proposed dividend for each year during the term of the debt is at least equal
to 1.5 times the projected debt service requirement for such year, on all its
debt, including the debt to be incurred.  The existing covenant relating to
debt service coverage would be repeated in the proposed Loan (para. 5.06).
Auditing
3.15     JEPCO agreed under Loan 1986-JO to appoint independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank to audit its accounts, and to submit to the Bank
audited financial statements and audit reports for each year, not later than
five months after the end of the year. The accounts of JEPCO are audited by
Khadder, Ramadan & Co., a local auditing firm. The auditing arrangements are
satisfactory and the reports have always been submitted on time, as
covenanted. The reports have also not disclosed any significant deficiencies
in JEPCO's accounting work. JEPCO has agreed to repeating the existing audit
covenant in the proposed Loan; however, because of time constraints due to
Government review and clearance, it: was agreed to extend the submission time
until not later than five months aiter the end of the year (para. 5.06).
Insurance
3.16     JEPCO's purchases from abroad are covered during the construction
period by insurance provided by the contractors. Insurance coverage for its
assets in operation is provided by local insurance companies operating under
Government regulation. The arrangements for insurance coverage have been
satisfactory. JEPCO has agreed under Loan 1986--JO to continue to maintain
with responsible insurers, or make other provis:ions satisfactory to the Bank
for, insurance against such risks and in such amounts as shall be consistent
with sound utility practice. The existing covenant relating to insurance
would be repeated in the proposed Loan (para. 5.06).



- 39 -
Monitoring System
3.17     The revenue covenant would help determine the level of revenues
required to meet JEPCO's financial needs. However, it is also necessary for
JEPCO to develop other key indicators for monitoring its technical and
financial performance in the future.  JEPCO has agreed to assemble by
September 30, 1984, in consultation with the Bank and with the help of its
financial consultants, a comprehensive set of key indicators to monitor its
technical and financial performance (para. 5.06). Suggested key indicators
are given in Annex 3.4.
B. Irbid District Electricity Company Limited
Accounting
3.18     IDECO does not have a department or adequately qualified staff for
financial planning and management. It has only an accounting section
responsible for keeping the books. In order to plan and manage its financial
operations efficiently, IDECO has agreed to employ not later than December 31,
1984, a qualified and experienced financial planner (para. 5.08). The TOR for
the appointment of the financial planner would be reviewed and finalized by
the next supervision mission. Also there is a need to plan and implement an
appropriate training program to improve the quality of the accounting staff
and the accounting section's operating methods to be in line with current
utility practices. IDECO has agreed: (i) to employ by June 30, 1984 experts
with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank and in accordance with TOR
acceptable to the Bank to outline a plan for strengthening IDECO's
capabilities in financial planning, management and control; and (ii) after
taking into account the Bank's comments to implement promptly the experts'
recommendations by not later than January 1986 (para. 5.08).
Past Performance and Present Position
3.19     IDECO's income statements, sources and applications of funds
statements, and balance sheets for the years 1980 through 1982 are given in
Annex 3.3. IDECO's concession agreement provides for the distribution of the
net profit as follows: (i) an amount equal to 10% of the profit before tax
would be allocated to a mandatory reserve account; (ii) an amount not
exceeding 20% of net profit, as determined by the General Assembly of the
Shareholders, would be allocated to the voluntary reserve; and (iii) after
providing for appropriate remunerations for the Board of Directors, a portion
of the remaining profits as determined by the General Assembly of the
Shareholders would be distributed as dividends. IDECO has always set its
financial goals within the framework of the above provisions in the concession
agreement.
3.20     IDECO's financial performance has been generally satisfactory.
During 1980-1982, IDECO had an average annual rate of growth in sales of about
19%. Its pretax rate of return on unrevalued assets was between 7.3% and 11%
during 1980-1982. Its rate of return during this period after a 38.5%
corporate tax was between 5.3% and 6.8%. However, its net internal cash
generation was sufficient to meet only about 5% of its construction
requirements in 1981 and 9% in 1982. Until 1980, its assets were primarily
financed through the investors' equity. At the end of 1980, its debt to



- 40 
equity ratio was 27/73. During 1981 and 1982, its expansion program was
financed through borrowings and its debt to equity ratio as of December 31,
1982 rose to 65/35. Therefore, it would be prudent to finance a part of
IDECO's expansion program through equity. Also, IDECO managed its operations
with a low current ratio that has ranged between 0.9 and 1.3 during the period
1980-1982.
Accounts Receivable
3.21     IDECO's accounts receivable during the past two years has been fairly
high at about 2 months' sales because of slow bill distribution and
collections. This situation could be improved by suitably modifying the
procedures. IDECO presently serves about 65,000 consumers. For billing and
collection purposes, it has 25 meter readers and 40 bill collectors. It takes
about one month to complete the meter readings and to check them for
consistency before preparing the bills, another month to process the bills and
another two to three weeks to deliver the bills. Consumers are required to
pay their bills in three days. Normally, the consumers who do not pay their
bills within seven days would be disconnected. However, a review of the
receivables revealed that about 70% of the overdue bills were two-month old
and the balance 30% were overdue by three months or more. The Government's
(primarily water utility) share of these overdue bills is about a third. The
Government and IDECO would take all actions necessary to enforce collection of
water utility's overdue bills. The overdue bills from domestic consumers
relate to people who live in Irbid only a few months in a year and therefore,
by disconnecting them IDECO would lose the minimum charge for which they could
be billed if service is continued. By streamlining the bill distribution and
collection procedures the accounts receivable could be brought down
significantly, say to about six weeks' sales. The mission reviewed with IDECO
various options for improving the billing and collection procedures. One of
the options is to authorize the meter reader to present the bill at the time
of reading the meter. After further processing of the meter readings through
the computer, corrections, if any, could be reflected in the next bill. IDECO
would be testing this procedure in a few villages. IDECO has agreed to
improve its billing and collection procedures with the assistance of its
consultants (PCR) to reduce the receivables to six weeks' sales by
December 31, 1984 (para. 5.08). In order to safeguard its interest against
defaults by customers, the Government and IDECO have agreed to raise the
customer deposits from the existing level of one month's estimated consumption
to two months' (para. 5.07).
Financing Plan
3.22     The forecast sources and applications of funds statements of IDECO
for the period 1983-1988 assuming an average 25% revenue increase from January
1, 1984 are given in Annex 3.3. A summarized version is given below:

3.23     The internal sources are expected to provide a total of 46% of the
construction requirements. About another 46% of the construction requirements
is proposed to be financed through borrowings of about JD 7.2 million, which
includes committed loans of about JD 4.4 million (28%), and the proposed Bank
loan of about JD 2.8 million (18%). The forecast assumes that to meet part of
its capital expenditure requirements, IDECO would sell in 1983 one million new
shares of face value of JD 1 plus a premium of about 0.35 JD per share. This
equity capital of JD 1.35 million (US$3.8 million) would cover about 8% of its
construction requirements. The Jordanian Delegation informed the Bank that 27
percent of the shares had been sold to the private sector as of October 15,
1983, and an understanding has been reached that the Government will buy the

Future Performance
3.24     Since JEA and JEPCO already have cash generation covenants which
regulate their financial goals from year to year, it would be appropriate to
have a similar cash generation covenant for IDECO also. Under such a
covenant, IDECO would be required to mobilize a reasonable part of its
construction program in line with thE. Bank's objective of ensuring that
consumers pay a reasonable proportior of system expansion costs.
3.25     The operations of JEPCO and IDECO are similar.  Both are private
distribution companies serving both urban and rural areas and buying power in
bulk from JEA, and both pay corporation taxes at 38.5% of taxable income.
There are however two important differences: (i) JEPCO is 77% owned by the
public with the remaining 23% owned by JEA (13%) and the municipalities (10%),
while IDECO is only 11% owned by the public, the rest being owned by JEA
(46.5%) and the municipalities (42.5%); and (ii) about 50% of IDECO's sales
are to rural consumers while the percentage is only 10 in the case of JEPCO.
In view of the similarity in the operations of JEPCO and IDECO, it is
reasonable that the two have similar financial objectives with some allowance
for the greater share of rural sales in the case of IDECO. Therefore, a cash
generation covenant similar to the covenant proposed for JEPCO would be an
appropriate method to measure IDECO's financial performance. The Government
and IDECO have agreed to take all such measures as would be required to
produce funds from IDECO's internal sources equivalent to not less than 20%
for each of the fiscal years 1984 through 1988 and not less than 30% in 1989
and thereafter, of IDECO's average capital expenditures for electricity
operations for two years, comprising the year in question and the next
preceding year (para. 5.07). They have further agreed to review at least
three months before the end of each fiscal year, measures necessary for IDECO
to achieve the agreed self-financing ratio for the following year and to
consult with the Bank on these measures before the beginning of the following
fiscal year (para. 5.07). Furthermore, during negotiations, an understanding
has been reached with Government and IDEC0 that IDECO would test its financial
performance not only by cash generation objectives but also by returns on
operating assets valued according to a methodology to be agreed between the
Government and the Bank (para. 5.01). The Government and the Bank would
consult in this regard.
3.26     The forecast income statements and balance sheets for the years
1983-1988 with assets carried at "book value" are given in Annex 3.3. The
assumptions relating to the forecasts are given in Annex 3.1. An increase in
average revenues of about 25% from January 1 1984 (compensation from the
Government for losses incurred in meeting the rural consumers' demand for
electricity and the supply of power far public lighting) would be required for
IDECO to achieve the proposed level of self-financing ratio (this would result
in a return of about 6% on revalued assets in 1984) (para. 3.25). The
Jordanian Delegation informed that this Government would be rescheduling all
foreign loans relent to IDECO giving it an additional five year grace period.
This would enable IDECO to meet all its obligations without any problems.



- 43 -
3.27     During the forecast period, IDECO's debt/equity ratio which would
reach its peak in 1985 at 67/33, would go down to 53/47 in 1988 showing a
decreasing debt burden and increasing financial strength. It is expected that
after implementing appropriate changes in billing and collection procedures
(para. 3.21), the accounts receivable would be not more than six weeks' sales
in the future. During the forecast period, the current ratio is expected to
be between 1.3 and 1.5, which is acceptable.
Debt Service Coverage
3.28     Although IDECO's cash flow during the projection period 1983-1988
would be over 1.5 times its debt service obligations and would rise as high as
2.8 times the debt service obligations in 1988, it is necessary to keep under
review IDECO's assumption of further debt obligations. IDECO has agreed not
to incur any debt without prior approval of the Bank, unless its net revenues
(before depreciation and interest) less proposed dividend for each year during
the term of the debt is at least equal to 1.5 times the projected debt service
requirement for such year, on all its debt, including the debt to be incurred
(para. 5.08).
Auditing
3.29     The accounts of IDECO are audited annually by auditors appointed each
year by the shareholders during their annual meeting in accordance with the
Company's Articles of Association. A local auditing firm has been appointed
by the Company for this purpose. The auditing arrangements are satisfactory.
The reports have also not disclosed any significant deficiencies in IDECO's
accounting work. IDECO has agreed to appoint independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank to audit its accounts, and to submit to the Bank
audited financial statements and the audit report for a year, not later than
five months after the end of the year (para. 5.08).
Insurance
3.30     IDECO's purchases from abroad are covered during the construction
period by insurance provided by the contractors. Insurance coverage for its
assets in operation is provided by local insurance companies operating under
Government regulations to cover all the risks that are inherent in operating
an electricity distribution system. These arrangements for insurance coverage
are satisfactory. IDECO has agreed to continue to maintain with responsible
insurers, or make other provisions satisfactory to the Bank for, insurance
against such risks and in such amounts as shall be consistent with sound
utility practice (para. 5.08).
Monitoring System
3.31     The revenue covenant would help determine the level of revenues
required to meet IDECO's financial needs. However, it is also necessary for
IDECO to develop other key indicators for monitoring its technical and
financial performance in the future. IDECO has agreed to assemble by
December 31, 1984, in consultation with the Bank and with the help of its
financial consultants proposed to be appointed for strengthening its
capabilities in financial planning (para. 3.18), a comprehensive set of key
indicators to monitor its technical and financial performance (para. 5.08).
Suggested key indicators are given in Annex 3.4.

IV. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
4.01     Jordan is totally dependent on imported energy for meeting its demand
of commercial energy. There is potential, however, for decreasing the extent
of this dependence in the future by intensifying the effort for developing
domestic energy resources and improving the efficiency of energy supply and
consumption.  On the supply side, the prospects for the discovery of oil are
good, and there is substantial scope for the increased exploitation of solar
energy through commercially proven applications. Moreover, significant
improvement can be achieved in the efficiency of industries involved in the
transformation of primary energy (oil refining and power generation) and the
transport and distribution of secondary energy (power transmission and
distribution, marketing of petroleum products, etc.). On the demand side, the
rationalization of energy consumption through comprehensive demand management
policies and conservation, particularly in industry and the power subsector,
would reduce the overall energy consumption of l:he economy. So far, however,
these have not been addressed in a systematic fashion and unless an integrated
program is initiated on all these tronts, Jordani's future dependence on
imported energy would increase.  The active involvement of the Bank through
the proposed Project would provide an integrated approach to the development
of the energy sector by serving as a catalyst for the mobilization of external
and local support, both technical and financial.
4e02     The components of the proposed Project were selected on the basis of
their potential for reducing Jordan's dependence on imported energy. The
petroleum exploration component would improve the techniques for the
compilation, integration, analysis and presentation of existing and new
geological data, by training NRA's staff, with the support of international
advisers and consulting firms, in recently deveLoped processes for petroleum
exploration. This data, together with the assistance to be provided in the
preparation of exploration contracts, would allow NRA to prepare geological
packages that could interest international oil firms in resuming their
petroleum exploration activities in Jordan. If this proves unsuccessful, NRA
would be able to use the same data to prepare and implement a systematic
exploration drilling program. The power distribution component would result
in a net saving to the economy and mobilize resources for the power subsector
by allowing JEPCO and IDECO to extend their services to new consumers which
would reduce the consumption of light and middle petroleum distillates (LPG,
kerosene, etc.) currently used for household purposes. In addition, losses at
the distribution level would be reduced by at lesast 1%, from 9.6% in 1983 to
about 8.6% in 1986 for JEPCO, 1/ and from 15% in 1983 to 14% by 1986 for
IDECO 1/ (Annex 1.1, Attachments 1 and 2).  The energy conservation component
would improve the energy efficiency of the 10 l.argest industrial consumers of
energy and set the stage for initiating similar work in medium and small scale
industries.  The renewable energy component wouLd provide the elements and
training needed to ensure that a program for the commercial exploitation of
1/ Reduction in losses in the two distribution systems is estimated at about
3,000 toe per year.



- 45 -
solar energy is formulated, and that a strategy is outlined for strengthening
the local capabilities for the manufacture of solar water heating and solar
greenhouses. The energy planning component would provide critical studies and
training needed to strengthen the Government's capabilities for energy
planning and assist in the formulation of energy plans and policies to ensure
that the future demand for energy is met at least cost to the economy.
4.03     Although the benefits associated with the petroleum exploration
energy conservation, renewable energy and energy planning are not
quantifiable; they are well designed and justified and are expected to make
some contributions to the economy as discussed earlier (para. 4.02). Since
only the power component has quantifiable benefits the economic rate of return
was calculated for only that component.
4.04     The power distribution component represents a part of Jordan's least
cost program for the development of the power subsector. The economic rate of
return for this component is about 12.9% based on the quantifiable costs and
benefits associated with the investment and measured over its expected
economic life. The costs include: (a) the power component capital costs and
physical contingencies, expressed in mid 1983 prices; (b) the long run
marginal cost of supply (LRMC) for generation and transmission of about 28
fils/kWh; and (c) the cost of operation and maintenance which is assumed for
each year to be equal to 2% of the capital cost. The benefits include: (a)
the revenue from the sale of electricity based on the present and projected
average tariff of 55 fils/kWh for IDECO and 36.6 fils/kWh for JEPCO, which are
taken as a proxy for the consumers' willingness to pay 1/; (b) the net saving
in households fuel resulting from the substitution of electricity for
petroleum products; and (c) customer contributions which represent
non-reimbursable payments by the consumers of JD 25 for the urban consumers
and an average of JD 85 for the rural consumers for equipment installed in
their households (meters, connectors, etc.). Details of the calculations and
assumptions are presented in Annexes 4.1 and 4.2.
4.05     The economic rate of return was calculated for JEPCO's and IDECO's
shares of the power distribution component to assess each as a free standing
investment. The economic rate of return on JEPCO's share of the investment is
16.4% and 8.4% on IDECO's share (Annexes 4.3 and 4.4), which in the case of
the former compares favorably with the opportunity cost of capital of 10%.
The return on IDECO's share is below the opportunity cost of capital mainly as
a reflection of the composition of consumers in its concession area and the
extent by which average revenue deviates from the economic cost of supply
(LRMC). In JEPCO's concession area, about 90% of the low voltage sales is to
urban consumers whose economic cost of supply is about 35.04 fils/kWh compared
with an average tariff of about 36.6 fils/kWh. The remaining 10% are rural
consumers whose economic cost of supply is 70 fils/kWh compared with a tariff
of 36.6 fils/kWh. Consequently, despite the economic subsidy extended to
rural consumers, the average tariff for JEPCO's overall sales at the low
voltage level is at about 89% of the weighted average economic cost of supply,
1/ These figures include an additional I fils for each kWh bought by current
consumers representing a contribution for the rural electrification fund
which partly finances the national rural electrification program.



- 46 -
that is 36.6 fils/kWh compared with 41 fils/kWh. By contrast, about 80% of
IDECO's sales is to rural consumers, and despite the fact that the low voltage
tariff in its concession area is about 55 fils/kWh which is higher than
JEPCO's average tariff by about 50%, it represents 85% of the weighted average
economic cost of supply of about 65 fils/kWh. TheW Government recognizes the
inadequacy of existing tariffs for sales to the rural consumers relative to
the economic cost of supply; however, it maintains the economic subsidy on
social grounds primarily to achieve some degree of equity among urban and
rural consumers throughout the country. These subsidies should not be borne
by the utilities, and the Government has agreed tco review the cost incurred by
the utilities in serving the rural consumers and introduce a mechanism for
compensating them (para. 1.23).
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
5.01     Understandings have been reached: (A) with the Government that it

departments and agencies of the Government not later than March
31, 1984, all electricity bills owed by them to JEPCO and
outstanding, as of such date, for a period of six weeks or more;
and (ii) the collection thereafter all such bills within six
weeks from the date of their issuance (para. 3.04);

expenditures of JEPCO during such year, the amount of shares to
be issued and the timing thereof (para. 3.10);
(b) obtain the Bank's prior approval for any new long-term borrowing
unless the net revenue (before depreciation and interest) less

JORDAN
ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Load Forecast and Existing and Planned
Power Facilities
Load Forecast
1.       Electricity sales are forecast to increase at an average annual rate
of about 197o for the period 1983-1987, from 1,363 GWh in 1983 to 2,900 GWh in
1987. The high rate of growth is primarily due to the expected increase in
JEA's direct sales to the large industrial consumers. Maximum demand would
increase from 244 MW in 1981 to 690 MW in 1987. Generation capacity would
increase from 540 MW in 1983 to 850 MW in 1987. The system's load factor is
expected to improve from 49% in 1983 to 70% in 1988, as a result of the
planned improvement in the utilization of generating plants. Sales to JEPCO
are expected to decline as a percentage of JEA's total sales, from 80% in 1983
to 54% in 1987. Sales to large industries will increase from 12% of JEA's
total sales in 1983 to 31% in 1987, reflecting the development of several
large industries in the Central and Southern Regions. The forecast of
electricity sales by JEPCO and IDECO are presented in Attachments 1 and 2.
Existing and Planned Power Facilities
2.       Generation:  In 1982, the extensions of the Hussein steam plant (3x66
MW) and the diesel plant at Aqaba (3x5 MW) were completed. The fourth and
last unit (66 MW) of Hussein plant was commissioned in 1983. The next major
investment in power generation involves the construction of the first phase of
tne oil fired steam power plant at Aqaba (2x130 MW) which is cofinanced by the
Bank (Loan 2162-JO). The implementation of Aqaba is progressing
satisfactorily and commissioning of the station is expected in 1986 as
originally planned. This station would be connected with the power system by
a 400-kV transmission line linking the power plant to Amman.
3.       Transmission:  About 880 km of 132-kV transmission lines and 914 MVA
in substation transformer capacities were in operation by end-1982. Another
1,060 km of transmission lines and substations with combined capacity of 749
MVA would be commissioned between 1983 and 1986. The 132-kV transmission line
from Ma'an to Aqaba, which was commissioned in 1983, resulted in the
interconnection of the Northern, Central and Southern regions and the current
operation of the power system in Jordan as a fully interconnected system. The
Jordanian and Syrian power systems are interconnected through a 66-kV
transmission line for exchange of electric energy. A 230-kV line from Irbid
to Damascus with a 100-MVA transformer substation at Irbid have been
constructed, which allows synchronous operation of the two power systems.
4.       Distribution:  The planning of the development program for
distribution is divided among JEA, JEPCO and IDECO, depending on the area.
The distribution networks in Jordan are designed by experienced foreign
consultants and follow British standards. JEPCO and IDECO design and



- 49b -
ANNEX 1.1
Page 2 of 2
implement their programs with the assistance of consultants. JEA plans and
executes its own program and provide s IDECO assistance in design when needed.
JEA's distribution expansion program for 1981-1986, includes about 150 km of
overhead lines and 120 MVA in substation transformer capacity.  JEPCO plans
involve the extension ana reinforcement of network in its concession area by
constructing 140 power substations with a combined installed capacity of 170
MVA, and 250 km of cables and 80 km of overhead lines at medium voltage (33-KV
ana 11-kV). Furthermore, about 530 distribution substation will be built.
JEPCO has also started a program for reinforcing the urban distribution
network by upgrading the existing 6.6-kV system in Amman to 11-kV. By 1986,
JEPCO's distribution losses would be reduced from 9.8% to 8.7% and the access
to electricity is expected to increase from 72% t:o 91% (Attachment 3).
IDECO's distribution plans include t:he reinforcement of the distribution
network in the city of Irbid by closing the 3.3-kV ring, the construction of a
new 3316.6-kV substation, and the installation oif 6.6-kV underground cables.
By 1986, IDECO's distribution losses would be recduced from 15.6% to 14%. The
access to electricity in IDECO's corcession area is expected to increase from
69.3% to 92.8% (Attachment 4).
5.       Rural Electrification:  JEA has prepared, in collaboration with JEPCO
and IDECO, a national rural electrification plan covering all villages to be
electrified in the period 1981-2000. At present, 232 villages with a total
population of 585,000 have been electrified. As a result, 60% of the rural
population in Jordan has access to public supply of electricity.

2000                    900                      907
Jordan's national program for rural electrification has been supported by
assistance from bilateral soft loans (Denmark, UK and USA), equipment and
material (USSR), and loans from the national budget, the Bank and other
multinational development agencies. A soft loan from Denmark covered the cost
of 21 small mobile diesel generating sets for remote villages in the southern
region. The loan from the UK was used to connect 30 villages in District of
Irbid to the central grid. The USSR provided materials and equipment for the
extension of public supply of electricity to 100 villages in the District of
Irbid and 32 villages in the District of Amman. The proposed Project would
cover the cost of equipment and material and consulting services to make use
of the Soviet equipment currently stored in IDECO's warehouses. A loan from
USAID of US$9 million was used for the supply of materials and equipment
needed to connect 37 villages and two low cost housing areas in JEPCO's
concession area to the national grid. The Bank loans (1688-JO and 1986-JO)
financed the extension of public supply of electricity to villages in JEPCO's
concession area and in the areas served by JEA.

JORDAN
ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
1.       The proposed Project is designed to ensure that the involvement of
the aid donors, international organizations and the Bank in the implementation
of the EPA is coordinated into a set of complementary or sequential tasks
which would provide the elements needed for the formulation of the envisaged
long term plan for energy. The Project would involve 5 components: Petroleum
Exploration; Power Distribution; Energy Conservation, Renewable Energy and
Energy Planning.
Petroleum Exploration
2.       Several foreign oil companies explored in Jordan between 1946 and
1978. Geological and geophysical programs were undertaken through which 14
exploration wells were drilled and oil and gas shows were encountered.
However, as a result of their exploration work, the oil companies concluded
that "Middle East-sized oil fields" were unlikely to be present in Jordan, and
by the mid-70s, all the firms had abandoned exploration work in Jordan. The
Government, while concerned about the lack of interest shown by the oil
companies, remained convinced that the oil and gas potential of the country
had not been fully evaluated. In 1976, NRA embarked on an exploration program
funded from the national budget. Two foreign consulting firms were appointed,
BEICIP (France) and Welldrill (UK), to review past exploration data and to
formulate an exploration program. The firms recommended additional seismic
work whicn was subsequently executed and interpreted by Compagnie Gfnfrale de
Giophysique (CGG), a French firm which undertook additional geological and
geochemical studies. In 1980, the new data was presented to the oil industry;
however, despite some initial interest, in the end not a single oil company
acquired exploration rights. The lack of interest by the internationally
reputable firms was due to: (a) the complex geology of Jordan and the
likelihood that all discoveries would be smaller than required to attract
large oil firms; (b) the poor quality of some of the geological data which
failed to provide conclusive evidence of the prospects; and (c) the inadequacy
of the geophysical methods used in properly mapping the geological
structures. The technology has since then improved to provide the means for
upgrading the quality of geological data and employing new methods for mapping
complex geological structures similar to those found in Jordan. However, to
this date, NRA has not been able to make use of these developments mainly
because of the shortage of local expertise.
3.       The disappointing response by the foreign companies to the packages
offered in 1980, prompted NRA to continue its own seismic work in addition to
embarking on an exploration drilling program. By the end of 1982, three
seismic parties were under contract, and about 8,000 km of seismic lines have
been profiled. The results obtained showed a definite improvement in the
quality of seismic data. Concurrently, NRA contracted a drilling rig from
Naftagas (Yugoslavia) to implement its exploration drilling program. Two
wells were drilled near Wadi Rajil, and the drilling of a third one is under



- 60 -
ANNEX 2.1
Page = ot 13
way. Several possible oil bearing horizons have been found in these wells.
Testing is under way with a workover rig, contracted by NRA from Naftagas.
Seismic surveys will continue through 1983 with one, or possibly two, crews.
The present program foresees acquisition of over 6,000 km of new seismic
lines. Intensive seismic processing and the reprocessing of 15,000 line kms.
of previously recorded data is indeed required for all areas and new seismic
acquisition and processing methods need to be employed in the geologically
complex areas such as Northern Highlands and the Dead Sea Graben. The
Government wishes that processing and interpretation of seismic data be
carried out in accordance with industry standards to ensure that adequate
subsurface data is available to justify the drilling effort. After the
results of the seismic work are known, NRA would make a new attempt to attract
the interest of oil companies. In the unlikely event that no foreign company
expresses interest in the results, NRA would undertake the exploration
drilling itself. This, however, would require high level technical personnel,
not only for the actual drilling operations but also for the attendant
pre-drilling work. In order to overcome this shortcoming, NRA has concluded
technical services agreements with Welldrill (a UK consultant for oil
exploration and production matters) and with INOC (which has seconded
engineers to NRA).
4.       However, before undertaking a full petroleum exploration drilling
program, NRA should explore to the fullest extent the possibilities of
attracting international oil companies to undertake exploration work in Jordan
by strengthening the technical capabilities of its staff in order to improve
the quality of the geological data offered for these companies'
consideration. The improvement of NRA's capabilities and the quality of its
data would have 2 advantages: (a) it would improve the chances of attracting
foreign oil firms to undertake exploration contract in Jordan; and (b) prepare
the authority's staff for undertaking a comprehensive exploration drilling
program in case the foreign oil fir-ms continue their disinterest in Jordan.
In order to achieve this objective, the petroleum exploration component of the
Project, would cover the cost of a program aimed at strengthening NRA's
technical capabilities for undertaking the sophisticated geological work
required to plan and implement an exploration drilling program, and to prepare
packages that would attract international oil companies in Jordan. The
component would involve four elements: (a) equipment and material; (b)
consulting services; (c) training of NRA's staff; and (d) advanced seismic
processing.
(a) Equipment and Materials: The ongoing program for exploration
requires the upgrading of NRA's laboratory facilities to improve the
quality of analysis and results. The proposed Project would cover
the cost of microscopes for micropalaeontology and palynology,
petrography, geochemical equipment, equipment to determine porosities
and permeabilities from core and rock samples and cement testing.
(b)  Consulting Services:  NRA requires the services of consultants with
expertise in petroleum geology to supervise and participate in
prospect mapping, log interpretation and supervision of the geologist
in the wells unit; a senior drilling and production engineer to
assist in the supervision of the drilling program and advise on well



- 61 -
ANNEX 2.1
Page 3 of 13
testing operation and completion techniques; two stratigraphers to
establish a stratigraphical framework of the mesozoic and paleozoic
formation; seismic specialists to assist and advise NRA in the
acquisition, processing and interpretation of geological data. In
addition, the Project would cover the cost of three man-months of
consulting services to undertake a study for determining whether the
capacity of NRA's computer financed by USAID for the storage of data
on groundwater could allow for the compilation and storage of
geological data. The Project would also cover the cost of consulting
services to assist NRA in drafting a new petroleum law; and
(c) Training: NRA has at present about 20 technical staff with
experience ranging between 2 and 20 years; however, only few have had
direct exposure to modern petroleum exploration and production
techniques. A set of courses on oil exploration and petroleum
engineering have been selected to overcome this weakness. About 20
of NRA's staff would be trained annually over a period of about three
years. The duration of these courses is expected to range between I
and 2 months;
(d) At this moment 15,000 line kms of previously recorded data are
available to NRA. One seismic crew provided by Iraq National Oil
Company (INOC) is operating in Jordan with an expected production of
2,000 km/year. The Project will contain a component to reprocess old
data where necessary and apply very advanced processing techniques to
critical parts of the old and new data.
Power Distribution
5.       The 1981-1985 program for the development of the urban and rural
distribution program in the areas served by JEA, JEPCO and IDECO was
formulated in 1980. The Bank has financed (Loan 1986-JO) a slice of that
program in parallel with other commercial, bilateral and multinational
organizations and financial institutions. However, with the growth of demand
at it currently projected rate, it is expected that by 1985 or at the latest
1987, the capacity of existing grid would reach its maximum capacity and
unless the network is reinforced, the level of technical losses would increase
and the quality of service would deteriorate significantly. Moreover, the
import of small diesel power generators by the rural households without access
to public supply of electricity has recently started to increase at
unprecedented rates. The recent family expenditure survey completed in 1982
showed that the rural households without access to public supply of
electricity allocate a greater proportion of their disposable income to
meeting their demand for lighting and other small household uses by generating
their own electricity using diesel oil, the product which continues to be in
short supply in Jordan because of the present configuration of the country's
only refinery at Zarqa. Consequently, the Government has stepped up its
efforts in extending public supply of electricity to the rural areas. The
accelerated program for rural electrification is currently under
implementation. JEA has secured financing from the local market and bilateral



- 62 -
ANNEX 2.1
Page 4 of 13
aid agencies. However, JEPCO and IDECO continue to experience shortages in
their finances for the implementation of their rural electrification program.
6.       The distribution component of the Project addresses difficulties
being experienced by JEPCO and IDEC0 in implementing their revised least cost
development program for 1983-1986 by providing foreign exchange financing
for: (a) the extension and reinforcement of the urban distribution networks
in both JEPCO's and IDECO's concession area; (b) the extension oE public
supply of electricity to about 55 villages in IDECOs concession area; and (c)
the strengthening of the capabilities of IDECO's staff in financial planning
and control.
(a)  Extension and Reinforcement of Urban Distribution Network:  The urban
distribution network in the concession areas of JEPCO and IDECO would
be extended to allow for the supply of electricity to about 25,000
new consumers. It would replace equipment that are currently
overloaded to ensure improved quality of service and corntribute
towards the reduction of losses from 9.8% in 1982 to about 8% by 1987
and 6.4% by 1990 and from 16% in 1982 to 14% in 1987 for JEPCO and
IDECO respectively. The Project would also result in the doubling of
some main feeders which would provide uninterrupted supply to the
pockets of high concentration of consumers and raise the level of
reliability; and
(b) Rural Electrification: The Project would extend public supply of
electricity to about 16,000 rural consumers in 77 villages in IDECO's
and JEPCO's concession areas. This would increase the access of
rural consumers to electricity in IDECO's concession area from the
level of 57.4% in 1982 to 92.5% in 1986 and in JEPCO's concession
area from the level of 34.3% in 1982 to 79% in 1986. It would
displace kerosene and diesel oil currently being used for household
use and irrigation pumping.
Energy Conservation
7.       Jordan is one of the most energy initensive economies among the
developing and industrial market economies. The intensity by which energy is
consumed (energy intensity), measurelf as the ratio of energy consumption and
GNP, was 0.617 toe/1,000 GNP which was higher than the energy intensity of
Japan (0.323/1,000 GNP), France (0.335/1,000 GNP), Italy (0.437/1,000 GNP),
Turkey (0.404/1,000 GNP) and the UK (0.595/1,000 iGNP). This high level of
energy consumption per unit of incoma is primarily due to the high share of
energy consumed by the transport sector which accounted in 1982 for about 50%
of the overall consumption of energy, and the industrial and power sectors
which account for another 38%. The Government is currently financing a
comprehensive transport study which would outline a strategy for the
development of the transport sector that would ensure the optimal combination
of the modes of transport. In addition, the Bank is currently financing a
study as part of the economic sector work for the formulation of structure for
taxing the petroleum products used by the transport sector, The Government
has also taken major steps in eliminating the subsidy for petroleum products



- 63 -
ANNEX 2.1
Page o or 13
which -1-.uld induce conservation in the use of these products a   m-
resources fKr the public sector. As for the industrial sector and the rower
subsector, their consumption of energy has been found to be more sensitive to
the growth of income than the increase in the prices of petroleum products
used.  For example, since 1979 the average tariff has increased by abouW 2002
to accommodate the 190% increase in the price of fuel oil and diesel oil;
however, the consumption of electricity continues to increase unabated at an
average annual rate of about 16%. However, despite the increase in the prices
of industrial fuels, the consumption of energy by the industrial sector has
increased at an average annual rate of 15%. Therefore, the only means by
which Jordan can restrain the growth of the future industrial consumption of
energy would be by intervening in the productive processes through better
energy management, retrofitting, and at times, rehabilitation of entire
industrial processes.
8.       In order to achieve the desired reduction in the overall energy
consumption, there is also a need to complement the direct measures with
indirect measures aimed at providing the incentives for the consumers to
conserve. Such measures include pricing, and tax rebates for both the
investment in conservation and the shift to lower value products. However,
the formulation and implementation of a consistent demand management policy
would require at least two years. In the interim and as a first step in
reducing the overall consumption of energy, the efforts should be concentrated
on the major energy intensive industries. It is estimated that in 1982, five
major industries comprised of at most 10 plants accounted for 41% of the
overall consumption of energy (804 thousand toe of a total of 2,039 thousand
toe). These are petroleum refining (221 thousand toe), cement and building
materials (141 thousand toe), phosphate and fertilizers (171 thousand toe),
potash (20 thousand toe) and power plants (251 thousand toe). Preliminary
evaluation and comparison of the energy consumption of these industries with
similar industries elsewhere indicate that an energy saving of between 15-20%
for each can be achieved once investment in conservation and process
improvement is undertaken and a system for better energy management is
designed and implemented in each plant under the full responsibility of a
trained energy manager. The Project would cover the cost of consulting
services required to outline a strategy for improving the energy efficiency of
these 10 industrial plants to formulate and implement an industrial energy
conservation plan. The formulation of a fiscal plan for conservation would be
addressed under the energy planning component.
9.       The conservation component would involve three elements:  (a) energy
audits and project preparation; (b) training in energy conservation; and (c)
equipment and material.
(a) Energy Audits: Only the aggregate consumption of the major energy
consuming industries are known. Details of the energy balances for
the processes involved are virtually non-existent. Moreover, some of
these industries, if not most, are utilizing technologies most of
which were introduced during the era when energy cost was low
(refinery, cement, building materials, etc.). The Project would
cover the cost of energy conservation studies. The studies would be



- 64 -                         ANNEX 2.1
klage b ot 13
undertaken in 3 phases. Phase I would review and establish an energy
balance for each process within a plant and aggregate them in an
overall energy balance for each plant. This would make possible the
identification of the areas where savings in energy could be achieved
with better management or with some minor investment. This phase
would provide an estimate of the potential for conservation without
major investment and a rough estimate oif the savings that could be
achieved with major investments. The resulting output from Phase I
would be a matrix of various levels of iinvestments and the
corresponding savings by plant which wotuld allow the Government the
opportunity of whether to restrict the action to better energy
management or proceed to more detailed assessment of the major
investments required. Phase II would provide a more exact estimate
of the investment required to improve the energy efficiency of each
process and the net saving attributable to the investment, as well
as, the pay back period ancL the return on investment. This phase
would provide the Government with a rankcing of the investment in
energy conservation. Phase III would follow with the basic
engineering design, the specification oi- equipment and the
preparation of bidding documents for the industries where investment
in new equipment and processes is deemed justified from the economic
point of view.
(b)  Training in Energy Conservation:  So far, little has been done by the
Government in creating the institutional framework needed to promote
energy conservation measures and to prepare the projects for
implementation. The Project's conservat:ion component would provide
training for local staff to be recruitedl in consultation with the
Bank to staff the proposed energy conservation section in the newly
created EPU in NPC. The training would be undertaken in specialized
institutions outside Jordan in accordance with terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank. Moreover, in order to strengthen the
capabilities of the local staff, an energy conservation adviser,
experienced in the identification, preparation and implementation of
energy conservation projects would provide in-field training for a
period of 18 months by assisting the staff of the conservation
section in EPU in identifying and preparing energy conservation
projects for the medium and small scale industries.
(c)  Equipment:  Presently laboratories in Jordan including the
laboratories of RSS, are not equipped with instruments necessary for
measuring energy consumption and identifying the conservation
potential. The Project would provide highly specialized equipment to
be used by the engineers of the EPU and by the analytical chemists of
RSS who would be trained to provide the technical support for the
conservation division at EPU.
Renewable Energy Component
10.      Jordan's renewable energy program has been underway for about a
decade and has covered a number of diverse areas such as: solar water



- 65 -                             ANNEX 2,1
Page 7 or 13
heating; solar desalination; solar heating of building; use of photovoltaic
systems for communication and windmills for water pumping. The program has
been implemented primarily through RSS and has tended to be mainly of a
developmental nature. The only commercial activity pertains to solar water
heating and notwithstanding many of its imperfections, a modest industry has
developed in this area in the last few years. The industry has a capital
outlay of about $2 million, employs some 100 technicians and can produce upto
a maximum of one million square feet of collectors (equivalent to about 28,000
household units) per year. However, despite some successes, the renewable
energy program in Jordan has failed to make an impact on the overall energy
supply of the country. This is due mainly to the fact that the program has
lacked a clear sense of direction, has proceeded in a piecemeal and in an ad
hoc manner and as a result has had little relevance to the energy needs of the
country. Also relatively little emphasis has been placed on commercialization
and the need for pilot/demonstration schemes which would be crucial for
commercializing some of the promising renewable technologies in Jordan which
have been overlooked. Last, but not the least, no systematic effort has been
made to collect solar/wind resource data which is fundamental to the
propagation of renewable technologies in the country.
11.      The renewable energy component of the Project would address most of
the key problems facing the renewable energy program in Jordan. The component
comprises 4 elements: (a) resource assessment, (b) planning, (c)
pilot/demonstration schemes and (d) training. These elements would involve a
total of 10 tasks which are interlinked and constitute a package that would
provide Jordan with a solid foundation for the development--in the near medium
term--of its renewable energy program in a sustained and meaningful manner.
(a) Resource Assessment: Comprehensive and accurate information about
the availability of solar and wind resources is essential for the
formulation of a national program for the exploitation of renewable
energy. So far, limited progress has been made in this context;
currently, the Meteorological Department, NRA and RSS, are involved
in collecting climatological data, some elements of which are
relevant to the assessment of solar and wind resources. However,
this activity needs strengthening through the establishment of a
national resource assessment network covering about 10-12 locations
in the country (the exact number will be determined through site
surveys). Mechanism would be developed for systematically analyzing
the resulting data, archiving it and making it available to the users
in the renewable energy field, along with relevant past
climatological data collected at existing meteorological, NRA and RSS
stations. Financing would be provided for the necessary measurement
and data processing equipment, together with the technical assistance
required in site selection, analysis and archiving of data.
(b) Planning: This element would comprise a total of four tasks, all of
which are in the form of studies. The first of these (potential
assessment study) would develop an overall national plan for
harnessing renewable resources in Jordan, while the remaining studies



- 66 -                         ANNEX 2.1
Y-age b 7T 13
would prepare subplans for solar wacer heating, solar ponds and solar
passive systems, three of the technologies which would have
applications in the near-to-medium term in Jordan. The studies would
be undertaken concurrently whereby they would complement each other.
(i) Potential Assessment Stud would seek to eliminate the piecemeal
and ad hoc implementation of renewablie program in the country and
ensure that it would make optimal contribution to the national energy
budget. The study would quantitatively assess the technical and
economic potential of all renewable technologies, rank them in terms
of their economic viability and develop a detailed plan of action
incorporating policy recommendations, pre-investment activities,
investment projects and financial aid institutional requirements.  In
essence, this planning task will seek to trace the future role of
renewable energy in the overall energy future of the country and
develop a blueprint for realizing this potential; (ii) Solar Water
Heating (SWH) Study. This task consists of a two-part study namely,
"the development of a national subplan for commercializing solar
water heating"; and "preparation of a feasibility study to develop a
"model" manufacturing concern in Jordan". Solar water heating
industry in Jordan is plagued with a number of serious problems. For
example: the Jordanian water heaters do not perform as efficiently
and are not as well construc:ed as they need to be if the full
benefits of residential applications are to be realized; the industry
has so far concentrated on the residential market and ignored the
seemingly much larger commercial and industrial markets; lack of
Government-instituted standards has resulted in marketing of
substandard products, therefore, cornsumer dissatisfaction; there has
been a lack of a government-Led pilot/demonstration program and a
governmental policy regarding possible finiancial incentives to
manufacturers and/or consumers, etc., etc. The first part of the
study would review the problems faced by 1:he industry and develop a
detailed strategy to place it: on firm foot:ing so that it can expand
and make meaningful contributions to the energy supply of Jordan. In
the second part of the study a plan would be developed to build the
"model" manufacturing concern which would use the latest SWH
technology suited to Jordanian needs. Such a concern, which would
either be developed from scratch or through upgrading of an existing
outfit, would have a modernising influence on the existing industry;
(iii) Solar Passive Systems ,tudy. In Jordan, the energy used in
residential, commercial and industrial buildings is about one sixth
of the national energy budget:. However, the buildings are designed
without considering energy conserving measures, potential for which
is substantial and which could save some 2-3% of the total energy
consumption by the end of the decade. The study would review the
existing as well as projectec. building stocks in the country,
together with their energy demand patterns and develop a detailed
plan to minimize their energy consumption. The study would
concentrate on three main technical areas namely, heating,
ventilating and air conditioring equipment; appliances and lighting;
and the "envelope" of the building, the last of which will be most

Page 9 ot 13
important. Experience in many countries shows that energy
re2uirements can be substantially reduced both through conr.e,,io.lai
conservation measures (e.g.  >isulation) and through the "passive
solar" design which raximizes the sun's contribution to meeting
winter heating needs while minimizing summer cooling loads (e.g., by
siting and glazing buildings for maximum energy efficiency and
through the use of special design features such as overhangs). In
addition to the various technical aspects, the study would address
economic, financial and policy issues; (iv) Solar Pond Study. This
task would involve preparation of a prefeasibility study on solar
pond technology, which involves the use of large salt water ponds as
solar collectors from which heat can be drawn off for power
generation and other purposes.  Small and medium-size ponds are being
operated, mainly for research and development purposes in a number of
countries and a large (5 MW peak capacity) pond is under construction
in Israel. In Jordan, the Dead Sea seems to offer an attractive site
suitable for development into solar ponds. It has a theoretical
potential of generating about 2,000 MW of electrical energy at
seemingly attractive price. Although solar pond technology has not
been commercially proven, it seems sufficiently promising to warrant
consideration in countries like Jordan where suitable sites may exist
and where there are few other indigenous energy resources. The study
would make a preliminary assessment of the potential for solar ponds
in Jordan and, if the findings are positive, recommend measures for
the development of this potential if and when the technology develops
to the point at which this becomes feasible.
(c)  Pilot/Demonstration Schemes.  This element would include three tasks
related to demonstration of solar water heating, solar passive
systems and solar greenhouses and help accelerate the
commercialization of these promising technologies. (i) Solar Water
Heating Systems. As mentioned earlier, the SWH industry in Jordan
has ignored the seemingly much larger commercial and industrial
(process heat) markets. The economics of SWH systems for commercial
and industrial applications are better than that of household
systems; also technically they are easier to design and install.
Despite these advantages, both the manufacturers and consumers are
reticent to venture into these relatively unknown markets. This
response is not unique to Jordan and has been experienced in other
countries as well. In Jordan, as indeed in other countries, entry
into the commercial and industrial markets can be made through a
government-led pilot/demonstration program. The task would
accomplish this need by installing collector arrays on a number of
carefully chosen buildings in the country. The array sizes and the
number of buildings will be specified by the consultants. These
systems would be instrumented and their performance monitored for
about a year. Recommendations would then be developed for large
scale deployment of such systems in different parts of the country;
(ii) Solar Water Heating Test Facility. An outdoor test facility for
comparative testing of SWH systems is crucial to the development of

Fage IU of 13
improved SWH systems. Such a facility also provides valuable testing
support to the SWH manufacturers most of whom lack the technical (and
often also financial) resources to obtain one of their own.
Currently RSS has limited testing capabilities which would be
augmented through this task to develop in,to a viable outdoor test
facility; (iii) Solar Greenhouses. Greenhouses have experienced a
rapid growth in Jordan. Starting with about 20 ha in 1970, the
country now has about 2,500 ha under plastic covered greenhouses.
The greenhouses are locally manufactured, are typically tunnel shaped
and with few exceptions do not employ mechanical heating or cooling.
Majority of the greenhouses grow vegetables (mostly tomatoes and
cucumbers) and a few are now entering the lucrative flower market
with distinct potential for export. Whereas the greenhouses have
often resulted in increased crop yields, they have been far from
perfect; without provision for heating and cooling (especially the
former) large crop losses estimated to be in hundreds of thousands of
JD's, have been experienced in colder winters. Whereas the need for
installing heating systems is well recognized, their enormous
recurring fuel costs have impeded their use. If a satisfactory and
cost effective solution is found to the heating problem, the
greenhouse industry could grow rapidly; a leading greenhouse
manufacturer estimates that through such a solution greenhouse
acreage in Jordan would at least triple in probably less than two
years. The use of solar energy seemingly offers a viable solution.
It should be possible to design and build simple and inexpensive
greenhouses in Jordan which--through reliance on solar energy--would
experience minimal recurring costs. The task would include
establishment of three commercial sized greenhouses (roughly 500 m2
each), instrumentation, performance monitoring and development of
recommendations for large scale adoption of solar greenhouses in the
country; (iv) Solar Passive Systems. As noted earlier, the buildings
in Jordan are designed without regard to energy conserving measures.
Passive solar techniques offer an attractive possibility for
conserving energy in Jordanian buildings. The task, which would
concentrate on the buildings in the residential sector, would
demonstrate the use of these techniques in typical 3-4 new houses
and--as a retrofit--in an existing house. The techniques would be
chosen such that they are easy to replicate in Jordan and are
preferably based on materials which are commonly available in the
country. The buildings would be instrumented and their performance
monitored for about a year. The recommendations would then be
developed for large scale adoption of these techniques in the
residential buildings in the country. The demonstration houses would
be procured in Jordan throug]h RSS and the task would finance all
expenses except for the convientional cost of erecting them.
(d) Training. The staff at RSS would greatly benefit from training in
commercialization of various renewable energy technologies and
especially those which are included in the component. This training
would be in the form of 1-2 months' workshops and about 4-6 weeks'

tours to commercial outfits in an industrialized country. No long
term training leading to academic degrees would be included in this
element and a strict commercial orientation would be maintained.
Energy Planning Component
12.      The main weakness of the institutional setting of Jordan's energy
sector is in the area of planning. The formulation of energy policy and
investment plans has been fragmented and divided among institutions which
suffered from the shortage of financial resources, and inadequate and
inexperienced staff. Consequently, NPC moved to fill some of the gaps of
commissioning whatever studies were needed for the formulation of past
investment plans. However, these studies served mainly short term objectives
and in most cases they fell short of providing results needed for the
formulation of energy policies. Moreover, the absence of a comprehensive data
base compounded the difficulties experienced by NPC in setting consistent
energy and macroeconomic policies. Recognizing these constraints, the
Government took a major step in streamlining the organizational structure of
the sector by creating SCE to set the guidelines and monitor the newly
created EPU at NPC. EPU has been designated as the sole organization
responsible for the formulation of energy policy and plans. NPC is currently
in the process of recruiting qualified Jordanians for the unit in consultation
with the Bank. The energy planning component would ensure that EPU's planning
capabilities are strengthened in order to ultimately formulate all energy
policies and monitor the implementation of plans for the development of the
sector. The component would involve 10 tasks: (i) load research and
management study for the power subsector; (ii) development of energy data
base; (iii) interfuel substitution study; (iv) formulation of policy for
demand management; (v) integration of energy planning models and macroeconomic
planning models; (vi) a study for the formulation of an optimal tax structure
for petroleum products; (vii) resident advisers on energy; (viii) consultant
group on energy planning; (xi) training; and (x) adhoc studies on energy.
(i) Load Research and Management Study: In 1982, there was about 40
MW of generating capacity operated by the large industrial
consumers (refinery, cement, phosphates, etc.). These represented
about 20% of the peak demand in that year and 10% of JEA's
installed capacity. Since all the isolated systems have been
converted by the owners to operate by burning fuel oil, and given
that JEA uses gas oil to operate its peak plants, there is a scope
for reducing the overall consumption of gas oil by having the
autoproducers meet their own demand during the peak periods and
using JEA's supply for backup. For example, cogeneration at the
oil refinery at Zarqa would result in a net annual saving to the
economy of about US$324,000 and would reduce the consumption of
gas oil by about 3,000 tons annually, representing 0.2% of total
consumption of the product for 1983-1990. The purpose of the load
research and management study is to outline the means by which the
installed capacities in Jordan could be matched with the demand in
the most efficient way possible. Such a study would also propose
the shift of unessential demand for electricity from peak to off



- 70 -                        ANNEX 2.1
Page 12 of 13
peak periods, e.g., water pumping load,  The study would also
assess the adequacy of tariffs in re]Lation to the optimal
operations of the systeni, the operations of the transmission and
distribution networks, etc.  The study would set a framework for
managing the demand of consumers and the facilities in the sector
to supply electricity at least cost t:o the economny.
(ii) Development of Energy Data Base: The quality of the data
presently available for energy planning vary considerably. JEA's
data on sales to high vcltage consumers is fairly accurate, but
the information available on the end uses of electricity at the
medium and low voltages require substantial strengthening,
particularly, in the areas served by JEPCO and IDECO, Moreover,
very little is known of the pattern cf consumption of petroleum
products in the transport and agriculture sector despite the fact
that they presently appear to account for over 60% of total
consumption.  The data on the industrial consumption of energy by
the large consumers is available but data on the consumption of
the small and medium industries, as well as the households, is
virtually non-existent. Unless more detailed and accurate data is
compiled, the quality of all policies covering pricing, demand
management and investment planning, as well as, project
preparation, would not achieve their objectives. The proposed
Project would address this gap by providing for the collection,
assessment and refinement of data, and its storage in NPC computer
facilities.
(iii)  Conversion of single cycle gas turbine plants into combined cycle
plants: Currently JEA's total gas turbine installed capacity is
about 132 MW. To improve the efficiency of these plants and
increase their utilization, JEA intends to convert these plants
into combined cycle units. Technical and economic feasibility
studies would be undertaken by consultants to assess the technical
and economic viability of the conversion. The consultants'
recommendations would form the basis for carrying out the required
technical modifications to the existing gas turbines.
(iv) Policy for Demand Management: Several energy pricing studies were
undertaken by consultants for NPC and a study for electricity
pricing at the low voltage levels undertaken by K & D for JEPCO
was recently completed. For the formulation of demand management
policy, the result of the pricing studies would be integrated with
a set of indirect measures (taxes, rebates, etc.) which together
with the energy pricing policy would achieve 3 objectives: (a)
convey to consumers the real cost of the resources used in meeting
their demand; (b) mobilize the miaximum resources for the
Government; and (c) induce the increased conservation and economy
in the use of energy.
(v)  Integration of Energy and Macroeconomic Planning Models:  In 1980,
NPC financed a study by Dar El-Handasa (UK firm) for the
formulation of an industrial development strategy.  An (32x32)
input/output table was prepared as a part of the consultant's



- 71 -

study. In 1981, USAID financed a study to assess the impact of
rgher import bill for energy on the overall growth prospects of
che economy. Both studies were of good quality; however, because
of the weakness of the data base the results were of fairly
general nature. The creation of the energy data base would allow
for the extension of the input/output model to capture the
interdependence between the energy sector and the main sectors of
the economy. This would enable NPC to simulate and assess the
impact of different energy policies such as pricing, conservation
and substitution between sources of energy on the economy. The
task would involve the assistance of NPC's staff in: (a)
integrating the energy data base and the input/output model, which
currently is stored in the council's computer; (b) installing a
macroeconomic model for forecasting of energy demand (MEAD)
developed by the IAEA which would be made available to the
Government of Jordan free of charge under the cooperative work
between the Bank and IAEA.
(vi) Optimal Tax Structure for Petroleum Products: Currently the
petroleum subsector contributes to the revenues of the Government
through the taxes levied on light distillates and absorbs most of
these revenues to cover the subsidies extended to the consumers of
kerosene, aviation fuel and gas/diesel oil. The study would
propose an optimal tax structure which would ensure that the
products are consumed in an optimal mix consistent with the
product mix of the refinery. In addition, the study would outline
the possible means for subsidizing the consumption of kerosene by
the low income group, if necessary.
(vii) Resident Advisers: The newly created EPU would be staffed with
Jordanians whose expertise in the design of energy policy and
plans is limited. The component would provide for 2 resident
advisers in energy economics and planning to assist and partly
train EPU's staff in initiating and implementing their work
program. The advisers would be assigned to NPC for a period of 2
years;
(viii) Consultative Group on Energy Planning: A group of internationally
reputed energy economists, planners and engineers would be
selected to assist the Government in setting the overall plans for
energy and review and monitor the results of studies and draft
policies completed by EPU;
(ix)  Ad hoc Studies;  This would cover studies that the Government or
EPU, in consultation with the Bank or the consultative group,
decide are needed for the development of the energy sector;
(x) Training: EPU's newly recruited staff would be trained for
periods ranging between 2 and 4 months in institutions abroad in
energy planning, project identification and evaluation, policy
formulation and project implementation.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A. Jordanian Electric Power Company
I. General
1.       All financial forecasts are given for the fiscal years of JEPCO
beginning January 1 and ending December 31. The forecasts included in
Annex 3.2 have been prepared on a historical cost basis. A set of financial
ratios based on revalued assets is also included in this Annex.
II. Income Statements
2.       Sales of Electricity are based on information furnished by JEPCO as
modified in the Bank. The forecasts assume an average annual kWh sales growth
of 12.3% for 1983, 14.7% for 1984, 13.6% for 1985, 12.5% for 1986, 12.1% for
1987 and 10.1% for 1988, and an average annual maximum demand (MW) growth of
16.2% from 1983 through 1985 and 10.7% per annum thereafter through 1988. The
forecasts also assume an averages revenue increase of 21% from January 1984, 2%
from January 1985, 2% from January 1986 and 3% from January 1988 to comply
with the cash generation covenant (paras. 3.10 and 3.11).
3.       Other Revenues are assumed to increase by the same percentages as
annual kWh sales of electricity,
4.       Purchase of Electricitv for 1983 is based on JEA's existing bulk
supply tariff to all Governorates except Irbid at Fils 18.5/kWh plus JD2.4/kW
of monthly maximum demand, which works out to an average bulk supply tariff
rate of Fils 22.4/kWh. From 1984 onwards, the purchase rate assumed is
Fils 28.2/kWh, which is the rate JEA would need to comply with the revenue
covenant in its existing loans. No increase in this rate is considered
necessary for the present.
5.       Administration and Distribution Expenses have been calculated based
on an estimate of the number of employees in relation to the number of
consumers and the average cost per employee.
6.       Depreciation has been calculated using the depreciation rates
prescribed under the law.  The revised depreciation rates applicable to JEPCO
as of 1982 are the following:

Networks                             5%
Cables                               3%
Meters                               7%
Tools                                6%
Vehicles                            15%
Furniture                            6%
Office Equipment                     7%
7.       Taxes.  Corporation tax has been calculated at the present rate of
38.5% of taxable income and University tax at 1% of taxable income.
III. Balance Sheet
8.       In preparing the forecast balance sheets, inventories have been
forecast at 10% of average fixed assets in service. Accounts receivable has
been estimated on the basis of six weeks' revenues from the sale of
electricity. Customer contributions are based on the estimated cost of the
customer's portion of the supply line. Additions to reserves are based on the
statutory requirements and the provisions of JEPCO's Articles of Association.
Accounts payable is projected to increase at 10% per annum. For purposes of
proforma revaluation of JEPCO's assets, the following index has been assumed:
1980 thru 1983 - 8%, 1984 - 7.5%, 1985 - 7.0%, and 1986 through 1988 - 6%.
IV. Sources and Applications of Funds
9.       Borrowings.  All foreign borrowings are converted to Jordanian Dinars
at the rate of US$1 = JD 0.355. JEPCO's borrowing program has been adjusted
to meet the needs of the construction program as revised by the Bank and
taking into account JEPCO's internal cash generation.
10.      Construction Requirements are based on JEPCO's estimates as revised
by the Bank and escalated using the following percentages for price
contingencies corresponding to expected conditions in Jordan.
1983     1984    1985    1986-1988
Equipment and Civil Works                   8.0      7.5      7.0       6.0
11.      Amortization of Long-Term Debt.  Amortization of existing foreign
loans is based on information provided by JEPCO.
B. Irbid District Electricity Company Limited
V. General
12.      All financial forecasts are given for the fiscal years of IDECO
beginning January 1 and ending December 31. The forecasts included in Annex
3.3 have been prepared on a historical cost basis. A set of financial ratios
based on revalued assets is also included in this Annex.

VI. Income Statement
13.      Sales of Electricity are based on information furnished by IDECO as
modified in the Bank. The forecasts assume an average annual KWh sales growth
of 20% from 1983 through 1985, 18% in 1986, 17% in 1987 and 16% in 1988, and
an average annual maximum demand (MW) growth of about 19% from 1983 through
1988.
14.      Other Revenues are assumed to increase by the same percentage as
annual kWh sales of electricity.
15.      Purchase of Electricity for 1983 is based on JEA's bulk supply tariff
to Irbid Governorate at Fils 17.5/kWh plus JD 2.4/kW of monthly maximum
demand.  From 1984 onwards, the purchase rate assumed is Fils 27.5/kWh, which
is the rate JEA would need to comply with the revenue covenant in its existing
loans. No increase in this rate is considered necessary for the present.
16.      Generation Expenses are based on the estimated expenses of Fils
23/kWh in 1983, increasing at an average rate of about 10.8% per annum.
17.      Administration and Distribution Expenses are assumed to increase by
16% in 1983 and in 1984, 14% in 1985, 13% in 1986, and 12% in 1987 and in 1988.
18.      Depreciation expenses have been calculated using the depreciation
rates prescribed under the law. The depreciation rates applicable to IDECO as
of 1982 are the following:
Buildings                    4%
Generation Equipment          7%
Network                       5%

JORDAN
ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Suggested Principle for Revaluation of Fixed Assets
of JEPCO and IDECO
1.       Separate total costs into yearly figures of foreign and local costs.
2.       Use two different indices for valuing foreign and local costs.
3.       Revalue this foreign cost component by applying the Unit Valuc Index
of Manufactured Exports from Developed to Developing Countries as prepared in
the World Bank and updated from time to time.
4.       Since the revaluation in (3) above would only reflect the changes in
terms of US dollars, apply a further annual adjustment to reflect changes in
the value of the Jordanian dinar vis-a-vis the US dollar at the end of each
year.
5.       Revalue the local cost component by applying annual coefficient based
on either a construction Material Cost Index if one is available in Jordan, or
on the Wholesale Price Index if a Construction Material Cost Index is not
available.
6.       Determine total revalued cost by adding the revalued foreign and
local cost components.

JORDAN
ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Assumption for RaLte of Return Calculations
for the Power Distribution Component
1.       Shadow Pricing:  Shadow prices were not: used, other than for
petroleum products, as conversion factors for Jordan have not been derived.
2.       Capital Cost:  The Project cost, including physical contingencies is
expressed in mid 1983 prices. Since the economic life of the Project is taken
to be 30 years, some of the equipment financed under the Project would require
upgrading or replacement once the demand of the beneficiaries reaches the
capacity limits of the existing equipment. Consequently, the following
investments were attributed to the cost side of the project to cover the new
equipment needed to meet the projected sales:
Year                             17      18     19   20      21      22      23
Amount in '000 JD                650  1,250    250   0   1,100   1,300   900
expressed in mid-1983 prices
3.       Economic Cost of Supply:  The long run marginal cost of supply (LRMC)
of 28 fils/kWh for generation and transmission iS taken as a proxy for the new
facilities that would be needed in the future to meet the demand for
electricity. This includes capacity cost of generation and transmission based
on: (a) the capital cost of the new Aqaba steam power plant (phase II) which
represents the avoidable cost. Phase I has not been considered because it is
currently under construction and consequently, its capital cost cannot be
avoided; (b) the cost of development of the transmission network (400 kV,
220 kV, 66 kV); (c) operations and maintenance cost of about 2% per year of
the capital cost; and (d) the cost of energy based on border prices for gas
oil and fuel oil of about US$300/ton and US$160/t:on respectively, representing
the cost to Jordan in March 31, 1983 of importing these products from Saudi
Arabia.
4.       Average Revenue;  An average revenue of 55 fils/kWh for IDECO and
36.6 fils/kWh for JEPCO is taken as a proxy for the consumers' willingness to
pay. The average revenue includes 1 fils/kWh as a contribution by the low
voltage consumers to the overall cost of the national rural electrification
program.

5.       Savings Through Households Fuel Displacement:  There are additional
savings which accrue from the substitution of electricity for kerosene and LPG
currently being used in households. The average consumption of petroleum
products by households consists of 20% LPG at JD 124/ton and 80% kerosene at
JD 110/ton, which is equal to JD 113/ton. It is estimated that each household
consumes about 0.56 ton of petroleum products/year and that it takes about
1,000 kWh/year to provide that service, equivalent to 63.3 fils/kWh compared
with existing tariffs of 36.6 fils/kWh (JEPCO) and 55 fils/kWh (IDECO).
Therefore, 8.6 fils/kWh and 27 fils/kWh are used, respectively, as a measure
of the savings accruing from the substitution of electricity for fuel used by
households in IDECO's and JEPCO's areas of distribution. The average
equivalent electrical energy of 1,000 kWh/year per household only represents
the fuel displaced in domestic uses. Presently, average electricity
consumption per household is estimated at about 1,200 kWh. The difference
between the average level of consumption and the equivalent fuel displacement
presumably represents electricity usage by small domestic electrical
appliances.
Customer Contribution:
6.       A one-time contribution of JD 25 made by each new urban consumer and
a weighted average of JD 85 made by each new rural consumer when service is
provided for the first time is regarded as a benefit. This contribution is
estimated to cover the cost of the equipment (meters, connectors, etc.)
installed in the customer's premises. The equipment cost is included in the
total cost of equipment and materials to be financed by the Project.
