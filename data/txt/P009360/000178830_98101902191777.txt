INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH FOR A
COASTAL AREA REHABILITATION AND CYCLONE PROTECTION PROJECT
1.        I subnit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $25
million to the People's Republic of Bangladesh, on standard IDA terms, to
help finance the Coastal Area Rehabilitation and Cyclone Protection Project.
This Credit would replace a US $25 million development credit to the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan of January 1971 for the same project (Credit No. 228-
PAK, which would be cancelled) on the basis set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of
my Report and Recommendation to the Executive Directors dated September 15,
1972 on the proposed Chandpur II Irrigation Project (P-1118) which is being
distributed concurrently with this Report and Recommendation.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The findings of an economic mission which visited Bangladesh in
July and August are summarized in Part I of my Report and Recommendation
referred to above. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex II.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BANGLADESH
3.        The operations of the Bank Group in Bangladesh are described in
Part II of my Report and Recommendation referred to above. Annex I lists
Bank loans and IDA credits for projects wholly in the present territory of
Bangladesh.
PART III - THE PROJECT
4.        A US $25 million credit (Credit No. 228-PAK; R70-87) was made
for the "East Pakistan Reconstruction Project" on January 13, 1971, 60 days
after the devastating cyclone of November 13, 1970. Implementation of the
project did not start due to mounting disturbances which culminated in the
emergence of an independent Bangladesh. The Government has now requested a
new IDA credit of US $25 million to reactivate the project. A technical note
describing the findings of a mission which visited Bangladesh in July 1972 to
reappraise the project is attached as Annex III.
5.        The project remains fundamentally the same as the one which was to
be financed under Credit No. 228-PAK. However, it has been updated to suit
the needs of the changed circumstances in the area. A considerable amount
of rehabilitation work, such as rebuilding of inland fishery boats, has al-
ready been done while there has been some lag in carrying out cyclone protec-
tion measures (partly owing to lack of imported equipment and construction



-2-
materials). Thus, emphasis has been shifted somewhat from "rehabilitation"
to "cyclone protection", e.g., the number of cyclone shelters to be financed
has been doubled.
6.        The project would help repair infrastructure damaged or destroyed
by the 1970 cyclone. It would also help save lives during future cyclones
by providing warning of approaching cyclones and protection. In addition,
it would provide improved communications for cyclone relief.
7.        The Credit would be allocated as follows:
(US $ Million)
A. Inland Water Transport Equipment and Terminals:          5.74
Including (a) repairs to 14 inland water port terminals
damaged by the 1970 cyclone; (b) the construction of 10
new additional inland water port terminals to provide
better access for relief in remote areas as well as for
development; Cc) procurement of hydrologic survey equip-
ment, navigational aids, operational vessels and vehicles;
and (d) consultant services. The executing agency will
be the Inland Water Transport Authority.
B.  Telecommunications:                                      5.61
Including (a) 22 base stations for fixed and mobile
public call offices; (b) 40 mobile stations and 100
public call offices; (c) 14 VHF links (24 channels
each) between base stations and communication centers;
and (d) a 300-channel microwave link from Chittagong
to Cox's Bazaar. The executing agency will be the
Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Department (BTTD)
under the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone.
C.  Multipurpose Cyclone Shelters:                           3.95
Construction of 260 multipurpose buildings located
on existing primary and secondary school sites in those
rural population centers frequently struck by cyclones.
In normal circumstances the structures will be used as
schools, accommodating about 100,000 pupils. During a
cyclone, the buildings will be used as cyclone shelters
to accommodate some 800,000 people. The executing
agency will be the Buildings Directorate of the Ministry
of Public Works and Urban Development.
D.  Primary Roads:                                           2.14
Including (a) improvement of roads in the Bhola Island;
(b) bridges and ferries for the road between Barisal
and Patuakhali; (c) road embankment improvement on the
road between Laxmipur and Ramgati; and (d) improvement
of roads in the' Hatia Island. The executing agency will
be the Roads and Highways Directorate of the Ministry
of Communications.



-3-
(US $ Million)
E.  Feeder Roads:                                          2.04
This sub-project is designed to ensure maximum use of
facilities provided by the shelter and water transport
sub-projects (Items A and C above). These feeder roads
will link the shelters and inland water terminals with
the main road system. The executing agency will be the
Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and
Cooperatives.
F. Coastal Fisheries:                                      1.85
Including (a) 1,300 wooden-hulled fishing boats; (b) 204
marine engines; (c) 335,000 lbs. of nylon twine and
167,500 synthetic floats for the manufacture of fishing
nets; (d) 1,300 life buoys; (e) 1 work boat; and (f) 2
insulated trucks. The executing agency will be the
Bangladesh Fisheries Development Corporation.
G. Cyclone Warning System:                                 0. 47
This sub-project would provide equipment to improve the
storm warning system. The executing agency will be the
Meteorological Department.
H.  Technical Assistance:                                  0.20
Includes consultants' services, auditors' services,
vehicles and equipment for project management and
supervision.
The credit also includes an amount of US $3 million which is unaIlocated and
is available to meet contingencies.
8.        The project will be carried out through a Reconstruction Board.
It will comprise: (i) a member of the Planning Commission who will be the
Chairman; (ii) the Secretary of Finance; (iii) the Secretary of Relief and
Rehabilitation; (iv) the Chief of the External Resources Division of the
Planning Commission; (v) the Project Administrator; and (vi) the Project
Coordinator who will be a memiiber and the Secretary. The Project Administrator,
under the general guidance of the Board, will formulate policies required for
the implementation of the project. He will be assisted by a full-time Project
Coordinator who will coordinate implementation of various sub-projects.
In addition, for each sub-project there will be a Sub-project Manager who
will report to the Project Coordinator. The project is scheduled to be
completed within a little over three years. However, the bulk of construction
works are expected to be completed within two years.
9.        The total cost of the project, including contingencies, is estimated
at US$37.84 million, including the foreign exchange component of about
US $17.4 million. The proposed credit of US $25 million would finance 100
percent of the foreign exchange cost plus 50 percent of the local cost.
Thus, the IDA share would come to about 66 percent of the total cost.



Provision is made for financing by the Association (i) of consultant services
provided during 1971, in an amount of about US $70,000, and (ii) any project
expenditures which may have been made after September 1, 1972 and prior to
the date of the credit agreement, in an amount not expected to exceed
US $100,000. In order to ensure that funds are available as required, a
Reconstruction Fund in an initial amount of Takas 20 million will be set up
on a revolving basis.
10.       Imported equipment and materials will be procured on the basis of
international competition in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement
under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits. Local materials, such as sand, bricks
and timber, will be procured locally by competitive bidding. Civil works to
be executed under the project will be carried out by local contractors
(selected through local competitive bidding), since such works would include
small contracts dispersed throughout the coastal area and would therefore be
unsuitable for international competitive bidding.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
,/
11.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Republic of Bangladesh and the Association, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. The provisions of the draft
Development Credit Agreement conform substantially to the provisions of the
prior Development Credit Agreement with the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and
incorporate the relevant provisions of the Project Agreement with the then
Province of East Pakistan. There will not be a separate Project Agreement.
12.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
13.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

BANGLADESH
TECHNICAL NOTE ON
COASTAL AREA REHABILITATION AND CYCLONE PROTECTION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This Technical Note is based on the findings of a mission which
visited Bangladesh from July 7 to 26, 1972 to reappraise the former Recon-
struction Project for the Cyclone Damaged Coastal Areas.   On January 13,
1971, sixty days after the cyclone, an IDA Credit of US$25 million was
signed with the Government of Pakistan (Credit No. 228 PAK) for this Project.
Execution of the Project did not conmence due to mounting disturbances which
culminated in the emergence of Bangladesh.   The Government of Bangladesh
has now requested a new IDA credit of US$25 million to reactivate the
Project.   Although some rehabilitation and restoration work has been
achieved in the cyclone affected area, important measures remain to be
taken to restore full economic activity and provide a measure of protection
against future cyclones.   The Project has been amended to reflect current
priority needs in the cyclone affected area.
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      The cyclone that hit the coastal areas of Bangladesh (Map) on
November 12-13, 1970, caused widespread devastation and loss of life.
Official figures now available indicate that some 200,000 people lost their
lives, and damage to physical infrastructure and crops is estimated to have
been Rs 1,570 million (US$330 million equivalent).   At the time the catas-
trophe occurred, about 20 staff members of the Bank Group were in the field
on various assignments.   Immediately after the storm, this team was
mobilized to help the Government formulate a reconstruction program to
restore damaged facilities and prevent similar loss of life during future
cyclones.   The Government endorsed the program and established a high-level
Reconstruction Board to coordinate relief and reconstruction efforts.   The
full Reconstruction Programnpiwas circulated to the Executive Directors on
December 8, 1970, with the recommendation that IDA make a credit of
US$25 million available to finance selected items.   Simultaneously, other
aid-giving agencies were being approached by the Government for assistance.
On December 30, 1970, the Executive Directors approved an IDA credit of
US$25 million to finance a series of subprojects estimated to cost approx-
imately US$35 million.   The Credit' (228 PAK) was signed on January 13, 1971.
2.02      Under the Project,Z/ IDA financing was proposed for schemes falling
in the following categories: technical assistance; water supplies, recon-
struction of coastal embankments; rural infrastructure; inland fisheries

rehabilitation; marine fisheries rehabilitation; inland water transport; and
other programs;(agrioulture, telecommunications, cyclone warning system). Ten
subprojects within the above categories were appraised by IDA staff during
December 1970 and January 1971. Four of these were ready for signature and
the others were being processed through the Government's Reconstruction
Board when disturbances erupted. Following independence, the Government
of Bangladesh asked IDA to reactivate the Credits and IDA sent a technical
mission to update the Project in July 1972.   The first Annual Development
Plan gives high priority to reconstruction in the coastal areas, a region
twice struck by disaster within a span of little more than a year.
III. THE PROJECT
A. ProJect Description
3.01      The Project consists of equipment, works, and technical support
for reconstruction and for cyclone protection in the coastal areas of
Bangladesh. It will help repair infrastructure damaged or destroyed by the
November 1970 cyclone and subsequent hostilities. It will also facilitate
human survival in future cyclones through cyclone warning and protection
measures as well as improved communications facilities for -relief.
3.02      The Project is fundamentally the same as provided under Credit 228
PAK (Appraisal Report No. PS-3a). However, it has been updated in the light
of the changed circumstances in the area (Annex 1). While substantial
recovery is evident in agriculture, a sector dependent largely on individual
initiative, progress in sectors which require capital-intensive reconstruc-
tion has been modest. For this reason the reformulated Project focuses on
-infras.tructure investments. Furthermore, the Project now excludes activities
which have meanwhile been financed from other sources (i.e., coastal embank-
ments, inland fisheries and water supply).
3.03      Specifically, the Project includes the following subprojects:   (a)
Inland Water Transport Equipment and Terminal Facilities (para;3.04); (b)
Telecommunications (para 3.05); (c) Multipurpose Cyclone Shelt'ers (para 3.06);
(d) Primary Roads (para 3.07); (e) Feeder Roads (para 3.08); (f) Coastal
Fisheries (para 3.09); (g) Other (Cyclone Warning System, etc.) (para 3.10).
These schemes are needed urgently for economic recovery of the area and to
avoid recurrence of similar calamity should another major cyclone strike.
Subprojects covering the above items were appraised by Bank missions which
visited Bangladesh in December 1970 and January 1971. They have been
revised by the new Government and were reappraised by IDA in July 1972.

B. Detailed Features
Inland Water Tran ort Equipment and Terminal Facilities
(IDA allocation US$5.74 million)
3.04      The purpose of the subproject is to provide for the repair and
improvement of facilities for water transportation within the cyclone
affected area. Much of the area is not accessible by land and depends
completely on water transportation. The subproject (Annex 2 and Map) provides:
(a) repairs to 14 inland water port terminals damaged by the cyclone in
November 1970 and never repaired; (b) the construction of 10 additional
inland water port terminals to facilitate access for relief in remote
areas as well as for development purposes; (c) the procurement of
essential hydrographic survey equipment, navigational aids, operational
vessels and vehicles; and (d) expatriate technical assistance for the
successful implementation and execution of the subproject. The executing
agency will be the Inland Water Transport Authority (IWTA).
Telecommunications
(IDA allocation US$5.61 million)
3.05      The purpose of the subproject is to establish reliable telecommuni-
cations in the cyclone area by providing radio equipment to reduce area
dependence for long distance communications on landlines since these lines
are so vulnerable to storms. A reliable telecommunications system is of
particular importance in the coastal areas because physical access is limited
by geographical factors and prompt assistance in the event of a natural
calamity is presently hindered by poor communications. The subproject (Annex
3 and Map) provides: (a) 22 base stations for fixed and mobile public call
offices; (b) 40 mobile stations and 100 public call offices; (c) 14 VHF links
(24 channels each) between base stations and communication centers; and (d)
a 300 channel microwave link from Chittagong to Cox's Bazar. The executing
agency will be the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Department (BT&T).
Multipurpose Cyclone Shelters
(IDA allocation US$3.95 million)
3.06      The purpose of this subproject is to provide refuge for the
inhabitants in the cyclone-prone areas during cyclones, and to rebuild some
of the 826 schools destroyed during the cyclone. Experience in previous
cyclones has shown that well-built, reinforced concrete-framed buildings can
withstand the devastation caused by a cyclone and the associated storm surge,
thereby providing refuge for people. At present, 412 shelters exist in the
cyclone affected area and the Government has plans to build 2,000 more. The
subproject (Annex 4) provides for the construction of 260 multipurpose
buildings on existing primary or secondary school sites in those rural popu-
lation centers most frequently struck by cyclones. Under normal circumstances
the structures will be used as schools, accommodating a total of about 100,000



pupils. During a cyclone the buildings will be used as cyclone shelters,
accommodating some 800,000 people. The executing agency will be the Build-
ings Directorate of the Ministry of Publio Works and Urban Development.
Primary Roads
(IDA allocation US$ 2.14 million)
3.07      Relief operations after the November 1970 cyclone were hindered
by the poor state of roads leading to the cyclone affected area. These are
generally unsurfaced and impassable during the monsoon. The purpose of the
subproject is to repair and improve to a minimum all-weather standard impor-
tant relief routes in the region and to link important IWTA terminals with
the all-weather road system. The subproject (Annex 5 and Map) provides:
(a) road embankment improvement, 10-foot carriageway brick surfacing and
repair of structures on the road between Bhola town and Char Madras on Bhola
Island, with links to the JWTA terminals at Daulatkhan and Tejimuddin (70
miles); (b) bridges and ferries to open the existing brick-surfaced road
between Barisal and Patuakhali (25 miles); (c) road embankment improvement,
10-foot carriageway brick surfacing and repair of structures on the road on
the WAPDA coastal embankment between Laxmipur and Ramgati, with links to the
IWTA terminals at Chitalkhali and Ramgati (40 miles); and (d) the necessary
surveys for the above roads and two other roads in Noakhali District for
which construction works are not proposed in this subproject: (i) the 47-
mile section of road from Hatya to Jahajmara, with links to Kasherhat-Sagaria
and Changar Bazar; and (ii) the 23-mile section of road fram Sonapur to
Munshirhat, with links to Char Jubilee. The executing agency will be the
Roads and Highways Directorate of the Ministry of Communications.
Feeder Roads
(IDA allocation US$ 2.04 million)
3.08      The purpose of the subproject i- tobprviide the necessary infra-
structure to ensure maximal use of facilities provided by the shelter and
water transport subprojects. These feeder roads will conmect the shelters
and the inland port facilities with the main roads. Construction of the
feeder roads will be part of the Rural Works Program, which is designed to
channel the initiative and energies of the rural population for labor-
intensive infrastructure works. The subproject (Annex 6) provides for the
improvement of 670 miles of earthen feeder roads to establish a 12-foot
earthen carriageway. The sides of the road embankment will be protected by
turfing. The necessary bridges and culverts will be constructed. The
executing agency will be the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development
and Cooperatives.
Coastal Fisheries
(IDA allocation US$1.85 million)
3.09      Since fish is the most important source of animal protein in the
coastal areas and fishing is an important occupation for the people living



there, particularly Hindus displaced during the recent disturbances, this
subproject aims to contribute toward the rehabilitation of the coastal
fishing industry by partly replacing losses suffered during the 1970 cyclone.
The subproject (Annex 7) provides 1,300 wooden-hulled fishing boats; 204
marine engines to power fishing boats; 335s,000 lbs of nylon twine and 167,500
synthetic floats for the manufacture of fishing nets; 1,300 life buoys, 1
work boat and 2 insulated trucks. The executing agency will be the Bangla-
desh Fisheries Development Corporation.
Other Features (Cyclone Warning System, etc.)
(IDA allocation US$0.47 million)
3.10      In December 1970 and January 1971, the Association identified and
appraised a subproject which would have provided essential equipment to im-
prove the storm warning system. The subproject was based on recommendations
made a decade earlier but never implemented after the devastating cyclone of
1960.1/ The failure to improve the warning system contributed to the human
tragedy that occurred again in November 1970. The subproject, now reformu-
lated to take account of the improved possibilities for regional cooperation
with neighboring countries, will be included as part of the IDA Project and
funds have been allocated for this purpose. The executing agency will be the
Meteorolcgical Department of the Government of Bangladesh. Should alternative
financing miterialize for the subproject, the funds will be allocated to
other works in the region (shelters, roads, fisheries, etc.) in agreement
with IDA.
Technical Assistance
(IDA allocation US$0.20 million)
3.11      The Project provides for the appointment of independent auditors
(para 3.20). To assist with Project implementation and supervision full-
time expatriate advisors will be provided to the Office of the Coordinator
and short-term consultants will be provided for work on individual sub-
projects, including cyclone shelters, road construction, fisheries, and the
cyclone warning system. These short-term consultants will work closely with
local consultants in assisting Subproject Managers to execute their projects.
Imported equipment needed by the Office of the Project Coordinator for
Project supervision will also be provided as part of the Project (Annex 8).
C. Construction Schedule
3.12      Construction of most Project works should be completed less than
two years after Project commencement, but where the amount or nature of the
work for a particular subproject requires, the work will be carried out over
three years (i.e., shelters and roads). In view of the difficulties now
expected with the transportation of supplies and the availability of
materials, the planned construction period under the revised subprojects is
generally longer than that anticipated under 228 PAK (18 months). The
1/ The recommendations were made by Dr. G. iE. Dunn, formerly Director of
the U.S. National Hurricane Center, Miami, Florida.



Government plans to take steps to alleviate these constraints by making
carriers available for arterial movement of commodities and by using con-
struction materials from Government stocks to expedite implementation.
3.13      The construction season in the Project area is from October to
April. The date of commencement of the Project is thus of critical impor-
tance in assessing the time required for the completion of the works. If
the Project only, starts towards the end of the present (1972/73) construction
season, Project completion will be delayed for one year.  Therefore, the
Government is interested in commencing the Project as quickly as possible in
order to make full use of the 1972/73 construction season. The central
Project organization has already been set up (para 4.01) and task forces for
the execution of the subprojects are being assembled by the executing
agencies. In view of the importance of avoiding delay, retroactive financing
is recommended for subproject expenditures incurred between September 1,
1972 when Project work was initiated and the date of the Credit. Total
expenditures during this period should be modest, involving primarily the
cost of initiating Project work.
D. Cost Estimates and Financial Arran@ements
3.14      Cost estimates for the Project are summarized below:

Total               153.20  123.42  276.62  21.05  16.95  38.00
3.15      The above estimates take account of the recent devaluation of the
Taka (from US$1 = Tk 4.76 to US$1 = Tk 7.28), and inflation in local currency
and foreign currency costs. The cost estimates are based on recent field review
of local construction and transportation costs. In view of the generall unstable
economic situation in the country following the war, contingencies of between
15% and 20%    have been included for local currency expenditures while for



- 7 -
foreign currency expenditures contingencies of between 10 % and 15% have been
allowed. Price contingencies have been based on the assumption of an annual
inflation of local currency costs of ic% and foreign currency costs of 5%.
3.16      Uhdiit the PF66jict,_ 9§ iftided in threii&mThrc d1it (228 PAK),
IDA will finance l0C%.of the foreign exchange cost and 5C% of the local
currency cost net of taxes, duties, land acquisition, staff salaries and
local currency overheads.  The Goverment of Bangladesh will cover the
balance of the local currency cost. The proposed Credit, which includes
an unallocated amount of US$3 million, will thus finance about 66% of the
total Project cost.
3.17      In order to ensure that local currency financing for the Project
will be available promptly, a revolving fund of Tk 20 million has been made
available for use under the Project, as had been agreed under Credit 228
PAK. Assurances have been received that the revolving fund will be maintained
and replenished as necessary.
E. Procurement and Disbursement
3.18      Imported materials to be.financed from the proceeds of the IDA
Credit will be procured on the basis of international competition in
accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and
IDA Credits. Civil works to be executed under the Project would be unsuit-
able for international bidding, because they consist of small contracts
dispersed throughout the coastal area. Thus, construction works would be
carried out by local contractors familiar with the area, selected through
local competitive bidding. Local materials, such ,aB sand, bricks, and
timber will be procured loc8afy ty competitive bidding.
3.15      A special unit will be established in the Bangladesh Trading
Corporation (BTC) for procuring imported Project materials for the executing
agencies that would normally procure materials through the Supply Directorate.
Autonomous agencies (such as IWTA and BT&T) will procure directly using their
existing procurement organizations.
3.20      Arrangements for disbursements will be substantially the same' as
those agreed for Credit 228-PAK. The Association will disburse 100% of the
foreign exchange costs and 50% of the local costs (excltding land acquisition,
staff salaries and overheads). Disbursements for imported equipment and
materials to foreign suppliers, as well as for services of foreign consultants/
advisors, will be made directly by the Association on the receipt of with-
drawal applications. Payments on account of reimbursement for local cost
expenditures will be made by the Association upon receipt of withdrawal
applications duly certified by independent auditors. The Borrower shall be
eligible for retroactive financing for Project expenditures incurred between
September 1, 1972 and the date of the Credit. The estimated disbursements.
schedule is presented in Annex 9.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      The Government plans to reconstitute a Reconstruction Board for
the Cyclone Affected Area as a coordinating body at the Ministerial level



- 8 -
with financial autonomy. The Reconstruction Board will consist of the
following people: a member of the Planning Commission to serve as Chairman;
the Minister of Finance; the Secretary of Relief and Rehabilitation; the
Chief of the External Resources Division of the Planning Commission; a part-
time Project Administrator to formulate policies required for project
implementation; and a full-time Project Coordinator to serve as Board
Secretary and to coordinate implementation of the various subprojects. The
Board will facilitate coordination among various Ministries and expedite
Project implementation, inter alia, by guaranteeing the prompt release of
funds for the Project as needed. It will be the responsibility of the Project
Coordinator to monitor and supervise the execution of Project activities in
the field and tolmonitor the scheduling, procurement, and accounting for the
Project. Actual' execution of each subproject will be the responsibility of
a Subproject Manager working with a sufficient subproject staff appointed
from within the participating government agencies. Four subprojects
(shelters, coastal fisheries, primary roads, feeder roads) willthave full-
time Managers; other subprojects will have part-time Managers.
4.02      The Project Coordinator will have a small, full-time staff to
assist him. In addition, an expatriate engineering advisor and other local
and foreign consultants as required will assist the Coordinator on technical
matters including site supervision. Private independent auditors will be
employed by the Project Coordinator throughout the duration of the Project
(para 3.20).
4.03      The Government will establish a Cyclone Reconstruction Fund of
Tk 20 million for financing the Project. This will be a revolving fund
which the Government has agreed to replenish periodically during the
period of Project execution to ensure that Taka financing of Project works
is available promptly.
V. JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The Project is designed to help restore and bring back to
fruition the considerable physical and human capital of an important economic
region of the country. Cyclones will recur in the coastal areas, causing
more or less damage depending on the size of the tidal bore. The intense
pressures of population on the land in Bangladesh do not allow the wastage
of scarce physical resources, so that the infrastructure must be provided
in the coastal areas to enable normal economic activity and development to
continue in the face of recurring natural hazards. The Project will con-
tribute to recovery of the area and to the provision of this infrastructure.
5.02      It is not feasible to prepare the usual quantified economic
analysis for the Project because of the nature of the reconstruction and
rehabilitation effort. However, experience indicates that the types of
reconstruction and rehabilitation works included in the Project will yield
high economic returns. For example, indicative calculations show an economic
rate of return of about 22% for the coastal fisheries subproject. Similarly,
earthen feeder roads in agricultural areas of Bangladesh have been shown to
have a rate of return of 23%, and brick surfaced roads, such as are proposed
for important relief routes, an average rate of return of 14%.

REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION IN THE CYCLONE
AFFECTED AREA SINCE NOVEMBER 1970
1.        After the 1970 cyclone, relief and rehabilitation assistance
flowed into the devastated region from many sources.  The Ministry for    1/
Reli.ef and Rehabilitation spent Rs 217 million (US$45.5 million equivalent)-
in the area between November 1970 and September 1971 (Table 1).  The largest
expenditures were for housing rehabilitation (Rs 82.0 million), agriculture
(Rs 58.1 million), and an emergency public works employment program (Rs 21.7
million). Foreign aid from bilateral and charitable organizations was given for
reconstruction of coastal embankments; the provision of water supplies; and emer-
gency housing, medical care and other immediate relief requirements. Work under
these programs effectively ceased during the months of intensive civil conflict.
The cyclone region, hit first by an unprecedented natural disaster, and
then caught up in the ravages of human warfare, was left struggling to
maintain mini.mum life-support services and supplies.
2.        Severe damage was sustained. by the agricultural sector in terms
of crop loss and the means of production (animal draft power, farm implements
and inputs). Yet, given Government-sponsored rehabilitation programs and
the tenacity and initiative of the local people almost 100% of the area
cultivated before the cyclone was back in cultivation by 1972.   However,
agricultural production in the devastated area in 1971/72 had recovered only
to about 70% of pre-cyclone production levels (Tables 2 and 3).   Agricultu-
ral rehabilitation was conducted in two phases covering the needs of the boro
crop (Pha.se I) which was the first rice crop to be planted in the area after
the cyclone, and later the aus and aman crops (Phase II).   Under Phase I,
the Government provided the following inputs: 25,000 mds of IR-8 seeds,
33,000 mds of potato seeds and onion bulbs, 3,000 mds of other vegetable
seeds, 11,OOO tons of fertilizers, 156 tractors, 544 power tillers and about
2,o40 low-lift pumps irrigating somie 90,000 acres. A number of farm imple-
ments were also distributed (plows, yokes, spades, sickles, etc.).
3.        Under Phase II, 12,500 tons of fertilizer and 35,000 mds of IRRI
aus were provided by Government grants and interest-free loans.   tIhile the
Government program was modest in its direct impact, it acted as a successful
catal.yst to the recovery of the sector. The distributed IRRI aus rice seed
(IR-13) was adequate to plant about 33,000 acres of the total aus crop
acreage of about 380,000 acres harvested in 1971.   The distributed IRRI aman
(IR-20) anrd local aman seeds were adequate to plant about 128,000 acres of
the total aman acreage of about 1.3 million acres harvested in 1971. Total
fertilizer distribution in the area has increased from 25,400 tons in 1969/
70 to 27,100 tons in 1971/72 (Table 4).

4.        The lack of draft power was a serious factor constraining, agri-
cultural production after the cyclone.    Eleven thiousand pairs of bullocks
were supplied by the Government and thousands more were brought into tthe
area by the private sector.    Government plans for intensive farm mechanid-
zation met with only limited success although the program continues with
assistance from the Consortium of British Charities (Tables 5, and 6).
The natural increase of the bullock population combined with the ongoing
mechanization program is expected to eliminate the present draft power
constraint in the area by 1975.
5.        Prospects for the 1972 aman crop appear promising.    The IRRI 20
program has been expanded to cover 220,000 acres (1971, 128,000 acres) with
inputs of 55,000 mds of seed and 660,000 mds of fertilizer (Table 7).
Although overall production from the area is still expected to be less than
in 1969, the increased penetration of improved seed varieties and inputs is
expected to result in a considerable improvement in production in 1972 over
that obtained in 1971.
6.        Rehabilitation in other sectors has generally been more modest.
By mid-July 1972 about 1,260 inland fishing boats had been built under the
sponsorship of the Directorate of Cooperatives at a cost of Tk 2.6 million,
and 8 5oo fishermen had been provided 55,000 tons of nylon twine for fish
netsJf The inland fishery rehabilitation program is currently being
pursued on a national rather thana regional basis since a large number of
freshwater fishermen lost their boats and nets during the war.    Eight
hundred coastal (marine) fishing boats have been reconstructed.    Reconstruc-
tion ot the damaged coastal embankments has progressed with financial assist-
ance from USAID such that by July 1972, 186 equivalent miles of embankment
had been repaired and 69 sluices (Table 8).    Yet to be repaired are
13 equivalent miles of embankment, 11 damaged sluices, and 6 fully destroyed
sluices.   This tork is planned to be completed by June 1973.
7.        W§ter supplies in the region have been improved by the construc-
tion of deep-an a hallow tubewells (Table 9).    By July 1972, more than
1,400 new shallow tubewells and 569 deep tubewells had been sunk, and 1,970
tubewells resunk.   UNICEF has sponsored a program to support the provision
of a further 1,023 deep tubewells.    For housing rehabilitation, the Govern-
ment has provided Rs 82 million to about Iiiu;0 families for the purchase
of galvanized iron roof sheeting and other materials.    Further assistance
will be incorporated into a national rehabilitation program for housing.
8.        Little proirese has been made with the conatruction of new cyclone
she1te±rs. Six bout of' the government program of 2,000) have been offered
by chairtable organizations.   A cyclone warning system at the village level,
5omething totally lacking in the November 1970 storm, has been implemented
by the Red Cross in the 18 most frequently hit thanas (Table 10). Officials
hAee been trained in the use of radios, megaphones, flags, and lanterns
provided by the Red Cross.   On the other hand, no progress has been made
1/ Data indieating the actual damage sustained during the cyclone are poor,
but indicate that the reconstruction achieved is only a fraction of the
needs.     



ANNEX 1

with the improvements required at the Storm Warning Center in Dacca.
The telecommunications system has been restored to the level existing
before the cyclone.  But it still depends on landlines and thus remains
vulnerable to storm damage. Under the Rural Works Program 770 miles of
feeder roads in the region have been repaired, as well as 143 bridges
and culverts, and 57 miles of new roads have been constructed (Table 11).
Yet, little work has been carried out on the more important primary roads
and no repairs have been carried out to the inland water transport facil-
ities. Water transport is still severely constrained due to the demand
for vessels elsewhere in the country and the destruction of ships and
navigational aids during the recent conflict as well as the 1970 storm.
9.        Substantial progress is thus evident in agricultural rehabilita-
tion, the provision of water supplies and the reconstruction of coastal
embankments but progress in other sectors requiring capital intensive
reconstruction has been modest. The most urgent needs at present are
for the repair and reconstruction of the transportation infrastructure for
both road and water transport; the improvement of telecommunications
facilities; the erection of permanent cyclone shelters which could also
serve as schools; improvement of facilities at the Storm Warning Center
in Dacca; and the rehabilitation of coastal fisheries which, unlike in-
land fisheries , is not being covered on a national basis. These activities'
are covered in the proposed IDA credit. A brief comparison between the
subprojects now proposed in the Project and those which were finally included
under 228 PAK is presented below:

I2NLAND WATER TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND
TERKNAL FACILITIES 1
Introduction
1.        Throughout the coastal areas, water transport is the most
inportant mode of transport. Many parts of the area are only accessible
by water, and yet in the coastal areas, water transport has been seriously
neglected in the past. There has been little provision of marked channels
and landing facilities. This lack of transportation infrastructure caused
formidable problems for rescue and relief operations after the cyclone of
November 1970. Many cyclone battered areas could not be reached with relief
goods for weeks (except by helicopter) as the water routes in the region
were then uncharted, and normal motorized vessels could not be used in
uncharted areas for fear of grounding, or running foul of submerged wrecks
and objects blown or carried into the waterways. In the absence of terminals
and/or floating pontoon jetties, etc., vessels could not be brought to areas
where the disaster was most severe. In those areas where faoilities existed,
14 points were heavily damaged, and have not been repaired to date.  Following
the cyclone, make-shift bamboo landings were hastily put up as a stop-gap
measure. But these lasted only for a short period, and were destroyed during
the monsoon of 1971.
2.        The subproject aims at repairing and improving landing facilities
in the coastal areas and providing marked channels which-w,l   peni the
waterways in the area to water transport, facilitate future relief operations
and contribute to development in this isolated region.
The Su.bproject (see attached map.)
3.        The subproject kteill podvide:
(a)  The repair of 14 damaged port terminals in existing
locations:

5.        IDA financing for the subproject will cover 1P0CQ of the foreign
currency costs, plus 50% of the local currency costs net of taxes, duties,
staff salaries, land acquisition and local currency overheads.   The financing
plan is summarized 'as follows:
Takas Million            US$ Million
Local  Foreign  Total   Local  Fbreign   Total
IDA!/                         9.83    38.o5  47.88     1.35    5.23    6.58.

Thus of the total cost of the project of Tk 59.28 million (US$ 8.14 million),
the' Association will finance about 81°/o.
Organization and Management
6.        The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (IWTA), the author-
ity responsible'for the improvement and development of inland water trans-
portation, will be the executing agency for the subproject. A special
operational task' force will be set up within IWTA, hieaded by(a _'__'
Subproject Manager. Supporting staff will be transferred from within the
Authority or if necessary recruited.  Although the Authozr-ty still rie'tains a-
sizeable organization, redeployment of personnel after independence has
weakened the management structure and the services of a technical adviser
to assist the Subproject Manager is recommended and has been allowed for in
the cost estimates. Technical assistance will also be required for the
procurement of vessels.   The services of a reputable firm of naval architects
will be utilized to prepare designs and performance specifications for the
operational vessels and to assist in the supervisioni of construction.
Accounts and Audit
7.        A separate account will be kept_for the subproject, and
maintained by a full-time accountant attached to the ofifce of the Supr-
ject Manager. Apart from normal Government audit, the accounts will be
audited by an independent auditor employed by the Reconstruction Board.
Procurement
8.        Materials will be procured directly by IWTA using the'organiza-
tion' s 'normal procurement establishuent, after agreement on the' oods and'
services to be procured by a procurement committee consisting of the Project
Coordinator, the, Subproject Manager and a'procurement officer of IWTA. Pro-
curement of sucl' items as floating craft, steel plate, moorings, etc.,

ANNEX 2
Page 5
will be on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Association's guidelines, except where this will cause significant loss
of time and impairment of the construction schedule, in which case direct
negotiations will be permitted with the agreement of the Association.
Procurement of proprietary items, for which prices are well known, such as
Bailey Bridge units, certain standard hydrographic equipment and navigation
aids will be by competitive bidding from DWTA's normal suppliers.
Coordination
9.        On the items of the subproject relating to existing and new Inland
Water Terminal facilities and structures, IWTA will coordinate with the Roads
and Highways Directorate, Fisheries Directorate, Bangladesh Inland Water
Transport Corporation (BIWTC), and the agency executing the feeder roads. On
the other subproject items relating to hydrographic and telecommunications
equipment and navigation aids, IWTA will coordinate with the Meteorological
Department, Telecommunications Agency, and the Water Resources Development
Department. In both instances this will be done as necessary through the
Project Coordinator.
Recommendations
10.       The inland water transport equipment and terminal facilities sub-
project is suitabIe fpr financing by IDA as part of the proposed credit of
US$25 million.   Apart from the general assurances listed in paragraph 6.02,
the following specific assurances accepted by the borrower during negotiations
for the subproject under Credit 228 PAK are still applicable and have been
confirmed with the Government of Bangladesh:
(a)  To promptly and as early as possible, provide land
required for IWTA to construct the new terminal
facilities, and to notify the Association should
there be any substantial change in the locations
presently indicated;
(b) To provide or cause to be provided to the
Inland Water Transport Authority such financial
resources as may be required for the satisfactory
operation and maintenance of the new port
terminal facilities.
The following additional arrangement has been confirmed by the Government:
-.        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.1
IWTA -wll-retain the services of a competent
technical adviser to assist the Subproject Manager
with the implementation of the subproject.

TELECOHMUNICATIONSV
Introduction
1.        Telecommunications in the coastal areas rely predominantly on land-
lines which are vulnerable to damage by bad weather. After the November 1970
cyclone, the devastated area was cut off from the rest of the country due to
a complete breakdown of telecommunications. This prevented information about
the effects of the cyclone from reaching Dacca so that it was several days
before the government was alerted to the size of the catastrophe. Subsequent
relief operations were then severely hampered by poor communications. Since
the cyclone the landlines have been restored (at a cost of Rs 1.7 million) but
the system still remains vulnerable to damage by bad weather. Damage to the
telecouwunications network during the hostilities was mainly the destruction
of microwave and VHF stations at focal points outside the region, but communica-
tion with the region is dependent on some of the facilities destroyed (i.e.,
at Khulna and Hajiganj). The reconstruction of these facilities is already
underway with aid from bilateral sources.
2.        The purpose of the subproject is to improve telecommunications in
the cyclone affected area by replacing existing open wire telephone lines
with radio facilities and extending services to new locations.
The Subproject (see attached map.)
3.        The subproject wili provides  (a) radio apparatiu-s and plant; (b)
supporting power plants; cO -iaits and aerials; (d) biildings sicluding
public call offices; supporting services for the installation of equipment
and the construction of facilities._ Twenty-two base stations will be
established which will be connected to main telecomiunicatio centers at
Chittagong, Barisal, K_ulna, Cox's Bazar and Begumganj by 24 chainel VHF links.
These base stations will serve 100 fixed pubic       offies at community
centers and 40 mobile stations located on vessels operated by government and
semi-government organizations. 2/  A 300 channel syste   will be established
between Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. Plans for the housing of equipment
will be made in such a way as to make iuaxlum uee 'of buildings and structures
already existing in the Project area. The executing agency will be the
Bangladesh Telegraph & Telephone Department (BTAT). The project should be com-
pl!ted in a period of 15 months except for the proposed microwave system which
is expected to be completed in 24 months.
1/    The Tolecommunications subproject was originally prepared by Mr. C.R.
Diokenson who visited Bangladesh in February 1971. Mr. Dickenson also
assisted with the appraisal of the revised subproject.
2/    The general looation of the base stations, public call offices (P0'oS)
and very high frequency (VHF) links are presented in the Appendix.

MULTIPURPOSE CYCLONE SHELTERSI'
Introduction
1.        The official death toll due to the November 1970 cyclone (confirmed
by burials) was 197,990 people. The physical damage included the destruction
of 862 schoolhouses and damage to about 3,500 educational institutions in 28
thanas. Experience during previous cyclones has shown that well-built rein-
forced concrete framed buildings can survive the devastation caused by a
cyclone and the asaooiated storm surge and provide safe refuge for people
during a cyclone. The people could thus have been saved if sufficient such
buildings had been available as shelters in the devasted area. At present
412 shelters exist in the coastal areas but many of these are of poor quality
and several collapsed under the weight of people taking shelter in them in
November 1970.
2.        The Government has a long-term program to build some 2,000 new
shelters in the cyclone prone areas to provide safety for the population of
the coastal areas against cyclones. Six new shelters have been offered by
charitable organizations. The purpose of the subproject is to contribute
towards the government shelter program and assist with the reconstruction of
destroyed schools by providing multipurpose structures which will give
shelter to the people when there is a cyclone but in nozmal periods be used
as schools.
The Subproject
3.        The subproject provides 260 shelters cum schools. Each shelter
will be a two-storey building on stilts with a plan area of 1,293 sq. ft.
The building will have reinforced concrete columns, roof and floors; sub-
stantial foundations capable of withstanding some scour incidents; and light-
weight walls at ground level such that, if the walls are swept away by strong
water currents the basic framework of the structure will not be damaged.
The general design features of the structures are presented in Appendix I
to this annex. Under normal circumstances the structures will function as
primary schools and each struoture will cater for about 400 pupils. During
a cyclone people will use the structures to take shelter on the first and
second floors and on the roof. Each structure will provide shelter for
about 3,000 people. The total number of pupils normally uong the 260 struc-
tures will be about 100,000, and during a cyclone, shelter will7be available
to nearly 800,000 people due to the subproject. The structures will be
built on existing primary school sites, the sites being chosen according to
criteria agreed on between the Government and IDA (Appendix 2). The shelters
will be built over a period of three years. Up to 60 will be completed in
the first year, depending on the availability of building materials and
120 are planned for completion in the second year. The balance will be
conatructed in the third year.
1/    The original Shelter subprojeot was identiflied and appraised by IDA in
December 1970 and January 1971 by Messrs. R. Barton and W. Darcovitch
(Conaultants) and R. O'Sullivan. The design and quantity estimates were
reviewed in detail in November 1971 during a supervision mission whioh
included Mr. P. Dugan. The subprojeot was updated in July 1972 by
Messrs. R. O'Sullivan and K. M. .yi.



ANNEX 4

Cost Estimates
4.        The cost of each shelter winl vary according to the accessibility
of the site at which the shelter is to be built. It is estimated that the
average cost will be Tk 61/sq ft of enclosed and raised floor area which is
equivalent to about Tk 40/sq ft when the ground floor is included. This is
about 35% higher than the cost of a comparative structure in Dacca (presently
about Tk 28/sq ft) due to the inaccessibility of the area which results in
increased charges for transportation, skilled labor and contractors. The
average cost of each structure will be Tk 158,746 excluding supervision
charges, etc. The cost estimates of the shelter subproject are as follows:
A. Cost per Structure

6.        The executing agency for the subproject will be the BDuildings
Directorate. Site selection will be the responsibility of the Deputy
Coissioner of the District with assistance of local representatives who
will form a Site Selection Canmiittee to select sites conforming to the
criteria outlined in Appendix 2. Design and construction of the buildings
* will be the responsibility of the Buildings Directorate. On comIetion the
structures will be handed over to the Education Department which will be
responsible for maintenance and repairs. For the construction phase a
special operational cell will be set up within the Buildings Directorate
headed by a full-time Subproject Manager and staffed by personnel initially
transferred from other posts. The structures will be built by local con-
tractors using materials and equipment made available at site by the
Directorate.
Accounts and Audits
7.        A separate account will be kept for the Project and maintained by
a full-time accountant attached to the office of the Subproject Manager.
Apart frcm normal government audit, the accounts will be audited by an inde-
pendent auditor employed by the Reconstruction Board.
Procurement
8.        Materials will be procured through a procurement conmuittee consist-
ing of the Project Coordinator, the Subproject Manager and a Procurement
officer of Buildings Directorate. Looal materials and services will be pro-

Transportation of Supplies
9.        Materials will be transported to site by the Directorate using
either public or privite carriers.  If necessary the Government will take
steps to ensure that public carriers are available for arterial movements
between the ports and major stockpiles.
Coordination
10.       The Shelters subproject will coordinate through the Project
Coordinator with four other activities in the Jroject area; i.e., tubewell
construction, public call office establishment, feeder road construction and
cyclone proof housing construction. The Departmet of Public Health
Engineering, working with UNICEF, will build a deep tubewell at the shelter
site as part of the ongoing water supply program in the area; BT&T- wili-
locate new PCO's in shelters where appropriate; The Rural Works Program will
ensure feeder road access to the shelters and will coordinate the construc-
tion of feeder roads in such a way as to facilitate the shelters construction
program; and foreign aid-giving agencies /16ooperative for American Relief
Everywhere (CARE) and Christian Organization for Relief and Rehabilitation
(CORR) 7ahave plans to build cyclone-proof housing in the vicinity of shelters
to be constructed under the subproject.

SHELTER DESIGNS
Design Features for Shelters
Detailed designs for the multiple-purpose shelters have been
prepared by architects and structural engineers to withstand wind velocities
up to 150 mph.   Some of the features which were incorporated in the design
plans include:
(1) Substantial foundations, capable of withstanding some
scour incidents due to storm surges.
(2) Columns, floors and flat roofs of reinforced concrete.
(3) Lightweight walls at ground level so that, if they
are swept away by strong water currents, they will not
damage the basic framework of the structure.
(4) Both upper floors and flat roof to be designed to
support a weight of not less than 150 lb/sq ft.
(5) Upper floors and flat roof, both to be designed for
refuge and with ready access to roof by stairway.
Parapet to be provided on roof to minimum height of
about 4-1/2 ft., to provide some protection from wind
to persons occupying the roof.   Such persons would not,
of course, be protected from the rain.
(6) Walls at upper-floor levels to be built of reinforced
masonry or reinforced concrete, with stomn shutters at
window openings.
(7) Other architectural features and partitions are planned
for the multiple-purpose building according to require-
ments of collateral school or other community uses.

LOCATION OF SHELTERS
Criteria for Selection of Sites
Shelter sites wil1 be selected by the spomeoring Government
tDepartments by the following criteria:
(1) Shelters will be constructed on existing Primary School
sites.
(2)  No shelter will be located closer than one mile to the
exposed coastline.  In aireas where coastal embankments
have been completed, the shelters will be situated
within the area protected by the embankment. -
(3)  Shelters will not be situated closer than two miles from
each other, to provide uniform protection throughout the
endangered area and to make shelters available to the maxi-
mum number of people.
(4) Emphasis will be placed on constructing the multi-purpose
shelters in devastated areas where most of the previously
existing buildings--particularly schools and cammunity build-
ings--have been extensively damaged or completely destroyed.
(5) Densely-populated areas will be given preference.
(6) There will be a hand-pump tubewell with adequate yield of
water located and constructed under the supervision of Public
Health Engineering Department and financed by UNICEF.
(7) The buildings will be connected to the local road system
by feeder roads/paths.
(8) The buildings will be sited at a central place in the
Unions as far as possible.

PRIMARY ROADSY
Introduction
1.        The country's network of all weather roads does not penetrate
the coastal areas of Bangladesh except in Chittagong District (see Map).
Traditionally the area has relied on water transportation for both local
and arterial movements but increased development activity in the area in
recent years has been accompanied by an expansion of the local road system.
The roads have been built and maintained by the Rural Works Program (RWP) 2/.
Rough water and bad weather prevent the traditional water transport fleet
from moving through much of the coastal areas for about five monsoonal months
of the year (i.e. May to September) and during the same period movement along
the earthen roads that exist is possible to only a limited extent because the
surface of the roads becomes too muddy to allow the passage of vehicles.
Thus for several monthe some of the coastal areas are completely cut off
from the rest of the country.
2.        After the cyclone of November 1970, the Government decided
that ten roads important for relief operations in the cyclone-prone
area be transferred to the Roads and Highways Directorate and that these
roads should be improved and converted to all-weather roads so that relief
operations could, if necessary, be carried out through the monsoon period 3/.
The purpose of the subproject is to contribute towards the Government pro-
gram of rehabilitation and improvement of important vehicular road relief
routes in the area affected by the November 1970 cyclone. Apart from the
provision of some temporary bridges and the construction of bypasses to
damaged structures no work on the roads has been carried out since November
1970.
The Subproject
3.        The subproject wili provide for repairing two roads and improving
them to minimum all-weather standards (total length  10 miles);   opening
an existing all-weather road by the provision of ferries and bridges (length
25 miles); and surreying five roads, including the above three. The work
would be campleted in three years. The locations of the roads are shown on
the attached map. Details of the work proposed are aa follows:
This subproject was originally prepared by Messrs. R. O'Sullivan and
W. Henel (Consultant) in December 1970 and Jasmary 1971.   The subproject
was updated and revised in July 1972 by Messrs. R. O'Sullivan and K. M. Gyi.
Between 1962 and 1971 about 9,000 miles of roads/tracks (moatly pedestrian
and bullook oart tracks) were built in the coastal areas by the RWP.
J/ Cyclones usually occur in May and October in Bangladesh.    When a severe
cyclone oocurs in May, such as ooourred twice in 1961 and in 1963 and
1965, relief operations are severely hindered-bi the'weather. -

Introduction
1.        The Rural Works Program is an established program designed to
stimulate the initiative of the rural people in local infrastructure
development. jtarted in 1962 it reached its peak in 1967/68 with the
creation of 22 million man days of employment for an expenditure of
Rs 120 million (US$24.8 million). By engaging the rural people them-
selves in the planning and implementation of rural works, the Program
offers a relatively inexpensive means of rehabilitating or reconstructing
rural infrastructure while providing a large number of jobs. The sub-
project is intended to maximize the use of facilities being provided under
other subprojects (i.e., shelters and ferry terminals) by mobilizing the
initiative of the local people through the Rural Works Program to provide
required infrastructure.
The Subproject
2.        The subproject provides for the improvement of feeder roads
to link cyclone shelters being constructed under the Project with the local
road system, and to link ferry terminals being constructed or repaired under
the Project with the interior. About 670 miles of earthen roads will be
improved by widening to provide a 12-ft earthen carriageway. The side slopes
of the roads will be protected by turfing. The necessary bridges and
culverts will be constructed. The executing agency will be the Ministry
of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives using the Ru.ral
Works Program. The subproject should be completed in about 18 months.

COASTAI FISHOI'S  1/
Introduction
1.        In the predominantly agricultural economy of Bangladesh fisheries
is an important subsector. Fish is the single major source of animal protein
in the daily diet of the people, providing about 6.4 grams of the total
estimated daily per capita intake of net annual protein of 8 grams. Of the
estimated 15,000 fishing craft operating in the coastal areas about 33800
boats and a small numnber of fish carriers were destroyed during the cyclone
off November 1970. J/ About 800 new boats have been built since the cyclone
through private initiative.  The purpose of the subproject is to contribute
to the further rehabilitation of coastal fisheries.
The Subproject
2.        The subproject will ptovide:
(a) 1,300 traditional fishing boats;
.(b) 204 inboard engines (10 to 20 hp) to equip part of
( iYaove;
(o) fishing equipment and safety gear (335,000 lbs of
nylon twine, 167,500 floats, 1,300 life bUOys);
(d) fout wooden fish carriers with insulated holds
(each 60 feet long);
(e) one steel work boat (55 feet long);
(f) two insulated trucks.
The executing agency itill be the Bangladesh^Fishing Development Corpoiatidh
(BFDG). The subproject should be completed within ZWflonths of commencemendt.
T This subproject was originally prepared by Mis K. Mortimer (IDA) and Mr.
L. axgvall (FAG) in Dleomber 1970 and January 1971.   The subproject was reviewed
and updated in July 1972 by Messrs. H. Rimbaud and N. FuJinami (FQ/IBRD CP).

Erocurement
5.        Procurement of materials and services will be subject to the
agreement of a procurement committee consisting of the Project Coordinator,
the Subproject Manager and a Procurement Officer of the Bangaldesh Fishing
Development Corporation (BFDC). Imported items will be procured by inter-
national competitive bidding according to IDA procedures, and local materials
by local competitive bidding.  Traditional boats will be built in local
shipyards after competitive bidding.  The steel work-boat will also be built
locally since the contract for construction will be small (about US$3oo0O)
and of insufficient interest to foreign firms to attract international bidding.
The normal procurement establishment of the BFDC will be responsible for
carrying out procurement except for materials and equipment for the steel work-
boat which will be procured by the Bangladesh Engineering and Shipbuiiding-
Corporation.
Organization and Management
6.        Execution of the subproject will be the responsibility of the BFDC.
A Subproject Manager will be appointed with Head Office at Chittagong. He
will be responsible to the Managing Director of BFDC and to the Reconstruction
Board through the Project Coordinator. Under the Subproject Manager, four Regional
Officers will be appointed, at Khulna, Noakhali, Patuakhali and Cox's Bazar.
Project Director and Regional Officers will be supported by a minimum required
number of staff. In order to have a satisfactory distribution of boats, etc.,
four committees'will be set up, one for each region, composed of the Subproject
Manager and representatives of all parties concerned.' These Regional Com-
mittees will be in charge of: 1) channeling information from the Thana level;
2) advising the Subproject Manager on allocation of boats between the various
Thanas; 3) supervising the overall conduct of the project. At the Thana level,
committees composed of the representatives of thep rties concerned will have
the following functions under the guidance of the Regional Committees:
1) preparing lists of beneficiaries; 2) supervising the construction of the
boats; 3) authorizing payments.
7.        Criteria for the selection of beneficiaries will be: 1) loss of
boat during cyclone; 2) non-possession of other boats; 3) absence of means
to procure a replacement boat through different channels. Recipients of
powered boats will undertake to attend a two-week training period at the
Narayanganj Motor Diesel Training Center. Beneficiaries will be owner-operators
of the boats either singly or in groups.
Recovery of Project Expenditure
8.        Since the recovery of subproject expenditure, as decided by the
Government, falls outside the duration of the project, the mechanism for
collecting payments is not included in this project. However, it is expected
that the Government will consider the possibility of establishing a revolving
fund financed by the proceeds of the loan with the purpose of promoting the
development of the traditional marine fishery sector. BFDC may be made
responsible for the operation of the revolving fund.



ANNEX 7

Operation of the Carrier Boats
9.        The BFDC will lease the fish carrier boats on contract to coopera-
tives, groups of fishermen or fish merchants. Boats will be operated by a
BFDC crew but under the management of the leasee.
Accounts and Audits
10.       A separate account will be kept for the subproject and will be
maintained by a full-time responsible accountant attached to the office of
the Subproject Manager. Apart from normal Government Audit, the accounts
will be audited by an independent auditor employed by the Reconstruction
Board.
Recommendation
11.       The coastal fisheries subproject is suitable for financing by IDA
as part of the proposed credit of US$25 million.
