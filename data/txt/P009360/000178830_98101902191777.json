The project has eight separate components: (1)\n            inland water transport equipment and terminal facilities;\n            (2) radio equipment for improved telecommunications; (3)\n            permanent concrete structures for use as schools and cyclone\n            shelters; (4) the improvement of main roads necessary for\n            relief operations to a minimum all-weather standard; (5)\n            feeder roads to connect boats and related equipment; (6)\n            fishing boats and related equipment; (7) essential equipment\n            to improve the cyclone warning system; (8) technical\n            assistance including auditors, engineers, and advisors and\n            equipment necessary for project supervision. The East\n            Pakistan Reconstruction Project consists of selected\n            sub-projects in the following categories of the Government\n            of Pakistan's Reconstruction Program: (i) technical\n            assistance for sub-project preparation, evaluation and\n            execution; (ii) deep wells, shallow wells and tanks for\n            fresh water supply; (iii) repair of coastal embankments;\n            (iv) rural infrastructure, i.e., roads, irrigation channels,\n            drainage works and multi-purpose rural development centers\n            to serve as storm shelters; (v) fishing boats and equipment;\n            (vi) water transport equipment and landing facilities; and\n            (vii) other programs (such as agricultural supplies,\n            telecommunications and an improved cyclone warning system)."}, "docdt": "1972-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
