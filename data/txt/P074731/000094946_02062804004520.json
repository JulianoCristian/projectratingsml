Country\n            Assistance Strategy to substantially reduce poverty in\n            Bangladesh, the Financial Services for the Poorest Project\n            will contribute to this goal, by offering opportunities to\n            targeted groups, by developing skills, and improving income\n            generation and asset accumulation. To this end, the project\n            components will: 1) finance the revolving fund, to be used\n            by the partner organizations (POs) of the Palli\n            Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) for extension of\n            micro-credit to the poorest. POs shall design the delivery\n            of financial services for target groups within the broad\n            parameters of PKSF, which will give range for setting\n            interest rates to borrowers, savings requirements, maturity\n            of loans, repayment period, and linkage with other safety\n            nets. Additionally, training will be provided for income\n            generating activities; 2) set, and operate the Financial\n            Services for the Poorest Unit, and the Research Cell, whose\n            incremental costs will be the responsibility of the\n            monitoring and evaluation component, to be supported on a\n            declining basis. Capacity building needs of POs will be\n            supported, as will the acquisition of specific skills for\n            income generating activities; 3) create a Disaster Fund,\n            from disbursements by PKSF, to compensate losses beyond\n            borrowers' control; and, 4) include a monitoring and\n            evaluation system, to analyze performance indicators, and\n            set the Research Cell of PKSF. A cost-benefit analysis will\n            determine the achievement of project objectives."}, "docdt": "2002-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
