      the Poorest Project in Bangladesh were as follows: outcomes\n            were highly satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned included:  if the micro credit\n            is designed in an innovative fashion with flexibility in the\n            areas of eligibility criteria, small savings, loan size,\n            Income Generating Activities (IGAs) based repayment system,\n            etc. Selection of potential IGA, skills enhancement\n            training, social development and safety-net services, and\n            others were areas requiring attention. Selection of IGAs is\n            crucial for the poorest. It was found that IGA that were in\n            some way related to their family businesses were best suited\n            for them. Small Partner Organization of Palli Karma-Sahayak\n            Foundation (POs) faced financial problems because their\n            equity decreased as a result of cross-subsidizing the\n            program expenditure over the project period. The volume of\n            operation and operational efficiencies, including overhead\n            and administration costs, needed to be rationalized to\n            achieve reasonable returns. In that sense, large POs having\n            large portfolios could provide reasonable returns. Training\n            needs assessment of the beneficiaries was a precondition for\n            selecting the proper type of IGA training. Also, interactive\n            training materials were more useful than conventional\n            training materials. The poorest of the poor should be\n            provided with proper counseling and market information in\n            respect to the appropriate types of IGA they choose.\n            Studying this segment of the poor more deeply in respect to\n            their socioeconomic dynamics is essential. Flexible\n            microfinance products for the poorest should be combined\n            with safety net type interventions. The rationale for\n            combining such approaches is that the primary objective of\n            microfinance - developing sustainable livelihoods for the\n            extreme poor cannot be met unless a household is first able\n            to meet its minimum needs, which includes coping with the\n            effect of shocks. This combination proved to be very\n            effective in supporting IGAs - one without the other might\n            not be effective for poverty reduction in this group.\n            Offering needs-based social development services was a key\n            to success for such programs. However, the social\n            development services offered by the POs depended on their\n            external sources of funding, the willingness of Micro\n            Finance Institutions (MFIs') management, surpluses in\n            other programs, and adequacy of equity, among other things."}, "docdt": "2008-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
