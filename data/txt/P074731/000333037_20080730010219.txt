1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the number of the poor
living on less than a dollar a day by 2015 provides a powerful benchmark against which
the Bank can measure the success of its operations in developing member countries. It
has also underscores the role played by financial development in reducing poverty in
Bangladesh. Accordingly, the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS1) reiterates the
objective of supporting private sector-led growth through regulatory and structural
reforms in the financial sector.

Various studies have shown that the poorest totaling approximately 12 million
individuals or 2.5 million households in Bangladesh are not reached by the regular or
mainstream micro-credit programs due to various constraints. These constraints can be
grouped broadly under two categories: those relating to the socioeconomic conditions of
the poorest, which have bearings on their capacity and skills to use loans for financially
viable activities; and those relating specifically to regular microcredit, which include lack
of multiple income earning sources, seasonal shortfalls in income, lack of grace periods,
mandatory weekly savings, unwillingness of peer groups to accept a perceived "higher
risk" member, specific demographic factors, and higher incidence of ill-health amongst
the poorest. Moreover, the microfinance institutions (MFIs) acting as intermediaries often
shy away from the poorest because of higher delivery costs and risks. The studies also
indicate that if the constraints for exclusion are properly addressed, it may be possible to
extend financial services to this neglected section of the poor, so that they can use
microcredit as the ladder to climb out of poverty. This Learning and Innovation Loan
(LIL) was expected to pilot various delivery models that address the identified constraints
so that the poorest are motivated to join the microcredit program and the MFIs are
encouraged to offer tailor-made programs that suit the special needs of the poorest.

The Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) has been implementing microcredit
programs through its Partner Organizations (POs) since 1990. The Bank's first
transaction with PKSF in 1996 involved a Credit of US$105 million through Poverty
Alleviation Microfinance project (Microfinance I). Upon successful completion of this
project, PKSF/Government requested for a Second Poverty Alleviation Microfinance
Project (Microfinance II) of US$151 million that was made effective in 2001. Both
projects attained their respective development in terms of expanding outreach of
microcredit in both rural and urban areas. As opposed to targeting the poorest of the poor
in the proposed LIL, both of these projects promoted mainstream microfinance in
Bangladesh.




1 The recent Bangladesh Country Assistance Strategy was discussed by the Board in March 2006, and had
guided the Bank Group's program of support for 2006-09. This is a joint CAS with ADB, DFID and Japan,
Bangladesh's 4 largest donors, accounting for more than 80% of aid to Bangladesh.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The objective of the LIL was to find models of sustainable interventions for reducing the
number of the poorest through use of microcredit and other financial services to enhance
their incomes and livelihood.

The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) lists the key performance indicators as follows:
    · Income of at least 50 percent of those that are earning less than 50c a day raised to
        more than 50c (Tk.30) a day;
    · Income of at least 50 percent of those that are earning less than a dollar/day raised
        to more than a dollar/day (Tk.60/day);
    · Innovative delivery mechanisms designed by POs to meet the financial needs of
        the poorest;
    · POs incentivized to extend micro-financial services to the poorest;
    · Household vulnerability reduced by: (a) 25 percent increase in total household
        assets; (b) 50 percent reduction in chronically insecure households; and (c) 50
        percent upgradation of "jhupri" (thatched house) dwellers to semi-durable
        housing structure.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority), Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

PDO and key indicators were not revised in the course of project implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

This LIL targeted the poorest of the poor who comprise the bottom 10 percent of the
population. While the partner organizations (POs) were responsible for selecting their
members from this target group using any accepted method of identification such as the
rapid rural appraisal, the selected members were not expected to be from households
included in any ongoing microcredit program. However, it was decided that the profile
of the households/borrowers to be selected under this LIL would broadly be as follows:

        · Mostly landless, but a few with landholdings of up to 0.3 decimals
        · Unemployed or earning less than a dollar a day or dependent on temporary jobs
        · Asset-less and sometimes without a place to sleep
        · Deserted or separated women-headed households
        · Disabled and/or elderly (over 50 years of age)
        · Parents of former child laborers
        · Former sex workers
        · Domestic help or beggars
        · Seasonal wage earners or daily laborers
        · Having no skills or experience

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The LIL comprises four components: (1) Microcredit, (2) Capacity Building, (3) Disaster
Fund for the Poorest, and (4) Monitoring and Evaluation.

Component 1: Microcredit Component (US$3.33 million)

The LIL proposed to test the hypothesis that an appropriately designed microcredit
program can improve the welfare of the poorest in Bangladesh. The pilot also sought to
determine the most effective delivery model, which could then be adopted for replication
in the whole of Bangladesh to cover as many of the poorest as possible. Therefore, a main
component of the LIL was the revolving fund for microcredit. This fund was to be lent by
PKSF to selected POs for on-lending to new groups of the poorest.

Component 2: Capacity Building Component (US$2.23 million)

Capacity building was considered critical to the success to this LIL. The IDA allocation
for this component and that for Component 3 were disbursed to PKSF as a government
grant. The budget for this component was composed of the following sub-components:

    · PKSF's Capacity Building - (US$0.14 million) to create an adequately staffed
        FSP unit to implement this LIL.
    · Pos' Capacity Building - (US$1.14 million) to cover household targets over the
        project period of three years, provide intense staff monitoring and supervision,
        enable MIS officers and field supervisors/trainers to guide the POs toward self-
        sufficiency and sustainability, and provide training and other logistical supports
        needed for effective supervision.
    · Poorest Borrowers' Capacity Building - (US$0.95 million) to assess training needs
        for the members and evaluate the demand for different types of capacity-building
        initiatives: general orientation, income-generating training for self-employment,
        and income-generating training for wage-employment.

Component 3: Disaster Fund for the Poorest (US$ 0.31 million)

PKSF would create a Disaster Fund by retaining an amount up to Tk.900,000 for each PO
to compensate borrowers for losses sustained as a result of natural disasters or industry
and sector-wide losses.

Component 4: Monitoring and Evaluation Component (US$0.13 million)

The IDA allocation for this component was disbursed to PKSF as a government grant.
Monitoring and evaluating the LIL focused on two broad areas: the substance of the
M&E, covering issues related to methodology, scope, frequency and analytical tools; and
the institutional set-up of the M&E, dealing with the issue of roles, responsibilities and
capacity.

1.6 Revised Components

The project components were not revised.

1.7 Other Significant Changes
Most significant changes were that Government decided to replicate the LIL all over
Bangladesh and that the unutilized funds of microcredit and disaster fund2 categories
were reallocated for capacity building purposes.


2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES


2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project development objectives were well-defined, contributing directly to the needs
of the country by addressing gaps in existing donor projects.

The LIL was designed by cross-consultation with various stakeholders. PKSF, MFIs,
GoB, and other donors provided significant inputs during project preparation. All
stakeholders considered the question whether the poorest of the poor could gainfully use
microcredit which incorporated some elements of the safety net programs. There was a
broad consensus that while the safety nets provide the "fish" for physical sustenance,
microcredit could be the "technique to fish", thus providing a source of financial
sustainability. POs were working on several safety net programs, including those by the
World Food Program (WFP), called the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD)
programs, BRAC's Income-Generating Vulnerable Group Development (IGVGD)
program, the Food for Work and Food for Education programs, the pension scheme for
the elderly, BRAC's Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP) program, and other safety net
programs of bilateral donors as well as government-guaranteed employment schemes.
POs under the LIL were encouraged to either enroll their FSP members in any of the
existing safety net programs or select members from those already using such safety nets.
It was agreed that the LIL would not pilot any new safety net program and would only
avail of the existing programs already in place.

During project preparation, major project risks were identified risks, and pertinent
mitigation measures put in place. The strong commitment of PKSF and POs as well as
their willingness to assume these risks were considered two main factors for the success
of this LIL.


2PKSF established a centralized disaster management fund (DMF) on a permanent basis, which is financed
by transferring 1 percent of net surplus of PKSF as well as IDA credit of US$10 million for the Livelihood
Restoration Program under the Post-Flood Recovery Assistance Program (2005). PKSF asked its POs to
establish their own DMF, to be financed by a 1 percent contribution from their service charge income.
DMF is used as a revolving fund to provide risk mitigation loans and emergency loans to the disaster-
affected households.




                                                    15

The project design included the following innovations: (i) providing income-generating
activities (IGAs) trainings commensurate with recipients' capacities and needs; (ii)
reducing the initial loan size to ensure that the loan proceeds were used for IGAs and
make the debt service more affordable; (iii) introducing flexibility into the repayment
schedules and program rules or obligations (such as group meetings and savings
schemes); and (iv) introducing credit-plus services such as social development and health
services, training of borrowers and MFI staff, etc.

On-lending and final rates of interest. It was agreed that PKSF would lend the
microcredit funds to the selected POs at the rate of 4.5 percent per annum, the rate that
PKSF charges POs for regular microcredit. This rate was retained to avoid a multiplicity
of rates from PKSF to POs. The agreement specified that POs would also charge the
same final rate, i.e., 12.5% percent per annum, to the poorest borrowers as they do under
their regular microcredit programs. A unified final rate was agreed upon to avoid dual
rates in order to prevent distortions, such as attempts by potential borrowers to disguise
themselves as the poorest or campaigns by regular microcredit groups to reduce the rates.
There was no formal Quality at Entry review for this project. Overall, the project design
and preparation were satisfactory. There was clear understanding and a high sense of
commitment on the part of Bangladeshi stakeholders to the objectives of this intervention.
The design of the project also benefited greatly from focused groundwork and analysis
carried out by PKSF and its partner organizations.

2.2 Implementation

This LIL was approved on June 18, 2002; it became effective on August 21, 2002. PKSF
had the overall management responsibility for coordinating and implementing the LIL.
GOB was to disburse money to PKSF from the credit proceeds under a Subsidiary and
Grant Agreement; in tern, PKSF was to on-lend to the selected POs under sub-project
agreements, and POs would then make the funds available to their microcredit borrowers.

This project launching workshop in 2002 was very useful for improving implementation
of the project, as POs could seek guidance on many problems that they had initially
experienced or anticipated experiencing in the near future.

The Grameen Krishi Foundation dropped out of the pilot scheme at the later stage
because of internal management problems.

This project was slow to get off the ground and had slow disbursements because of the
following: (i) the staff of the FSP unit at PKSF was new and needed some time to
mobilize the beneficiaries to be part of this LIL by way of frontloading awareness- and
confidence-building exercises, linking them with other social services programs, etc.; (ii)
POs were able to revolve the funds received under this LIL within a year and collect
loans at a rate of 99 percent, rather than requesting fresh funds; (iii) considering the
success of this LIL, GOB allocated Tk. 2,860,000 (US$ 42 million) from the national
budget (FY06­FY08) for replicating these models all over Bangladesh through PKSF and
its 91 POs (including FSP POs), thus decreasing the demand for funds; and (iv) the
depreciation of the dollar against SDR and of the Taka against the dollar resulted in
higher surplus funds and newer disbursement targets in Taka terms.



                                              16

The project mobilized 64,000 members, generated Tk.54 million (US$0.9 million) in
savings and lent out Tk.644 million (US$9.3 million) to 58,505 beneficiaries. In contrast,
over 828,000 beneficiaries were mobilized under the replicated Ultra Poor Program
(UPP). This is because FSP, being a LIL, covered only 19 upazilas (sub-districts) of 17
districts ­ around 3,000 ultra poor from each upazila were mobilized by each of 19 POs
as per project plan. Moreover, mobilizing the poorest of the poor in the LIL was more
challenging than that experienced under the replicated project. UPP was implemented
all over the country and covered a more extensive geographical area than the FSP which
it replicated-- in 421 upazilas of 62 districts--through 91 POs (including FSP POs).
Due to slackening demand for microcredit funds following GOB's countrywide
replication of the LIL, GOB requested the Bank to reallocate the unutilized funds for
other uses and to extend the closing date for a further period of two years from the
original date. Since grant funding from GOB for UPP was earmarked for relending
purpose and no funds were allocated for capacity-building, it was agreed that the unused
funds under FSP would be used for capacity-building of the borrowers and POs under
UPP to ensure that the development objectives of the LIL were fully met.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project set forth benchmarks and performance indicators to evaluate progress on
individual subcomponents. These indicators were agreed upon during negotiations and
were reviewed periodically to determine their effectiveness against performance
standards and implementation schedules. In addition, a core component of this LIL was
the monitoring and evaluation system that was planned to assess whether an appropriately
designed and delivered microcredit program could improve the welfare of the poorest in
Bangladesh. IDA allocation for this important component, amounting to US$0.13 million,
was disbursed to PKSF as government grant. As detailed in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD), the M&E component for the LIL focuses on two broad areas: (i) the
"substance" of the M&E covering issues related to methodology, scope, frequency, and
analytical tools; and (ii) the "institutional set-up" for M&E dealing with the issues of
roles, responsibilities, and capacity.

PKSF created a separate cell for monitoring the LIL. The M&E component was initiated
through the Research Working Group (RWG), which met on demand. The RWG
comprised experienced persons from PKSF, a research institute, and a leading MFI.
PKSF also developed the MIS system for data capture and analysis and trained the MIS
officer from each PO to implement it at the PO level. In addition, PKSF retained a
consultant to maintain M&E for the project period, established a research cell under the
FSP cell, and strengthened the manpower with qualitative and quantitative research
specialists.

Streamlining the links among PKSF's research cell, its FSP unit, RWG, and the POs
remained challenging in the context of the M&E requirements. However, best efforts
were made by PKSF through repetitive reconstitution of the FSP project unit during the
project period and by deploying people to emphasize the M&E aspect of the project. All
of the 19 selected POs had adequate experience in field data collection, but many lack the



                                               17

capacity to process, analyze, and prepare reports. The POs were responsible for
administering the survey questionnaire (a borrower profile survey). The data was then
entered into a computer program developed to process and analyze the data. Although
FSP program staff provided hands-on data collection and data entry training to PO field
workers and MIS officers, a number of POs, nonetheless faced capacity constraints in
managing proper data entry and analysis and preparing reports. Thus, the FSP cell in
PKSF assumed the entire task of data analysis and reporting.

PKSF conducted two impact evaluations using external agencies in 2005 and 2007
respectively to assess the impact of the project on the livelihood of the poorest of the poor
in both social and economic terms. The impact study used measurable indicators to
estimate changes in income, assets, and living conditions of the beneficiaries, using a
sample survey; the study gathered both quantitative and qualitative information.
Furthermore, PKSF (either on its own or using external consultants) conducted a number
studies such as a comparative study of microfinance programs of PKSF (FSP), BRAC,
Plan International, and Grameen Bank for the poorest in order to apply lessons learned
from those programs to FSP including lessons learned on process management and the
selection process of area & beneficiary. POs also separately conducted a number of case
studies and focus group discussions (FGD) to ascertain the implementation effectiveness
of the LIL. The case covered various occupational groups including beggars, day laborers,
and former sex workers.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Financial Management, Procurement, and Disbursement

Procurement

The FSP unit at PKSF was responsible for procuring goods, developing consultant
services, and training at the PKSF level, as well as for procuring some logistical support
and training at the beneficiary level. No procurement or financial management issues
posed a cause for concern during project implementation.

Although PKSF's capacity to handle procurement under the LIL was adequate,
procurement progress generally was slow and gradual over the project period. Recruiting
experts to provide orientation programs and IGA training for beneficiaries in remote
areas was the most challenging because qualified people were unavailable.

Among the issues raised, one was related to procurement at the PO level. To help the POs
implement this project money was set aside to buy motorcycles or motorized boats,
bicycles, and computers for every PO. During supervision missions, all the POs pointed
out that the original plan for PKSF to buy these items centrally and then distribute them to
the POs was not feasible because--(i) transportation from Dhaka to the sub-districts
(upazilas) involved not only additional cost, but also undue risks that could be avoided by
procuring them at the point of use; (ii) goods procured at Dhaka had to be brought back to
Dhaka for service, whereas such service could be easily obtained from the authorized
agents in the upazilas, if bought from them; and (iii) some POs said that they wanted to
upgrade the models by adding their own funds, which would not be possible through



                                              18

central procurement. It was then decided by IDA and PKSF to allow each PO to procure
these goods individually.

Financial management and reporting arrangements

PKSF designated one staff member from its finance department, who had experience in
Bank-financed projects, to be solely responsible for financial management activities
under the FSP project. PKSF regularly submitted a set of agreed-upon financial
management reports throughout the project period.

PKSF maintained a computerized financial management, accounting, disbursement, and
reporting system for the project. The accounts and records were verified and audited by
the external audit firms. Internal controls included a built-in audit team that worked under
a well-defined TOR and reported directly to MD. Internal audit cells audited POs to
verify, among other things, whether the POs complied with the sub-project agreement
and recommended corrective measures. Participating POs reported to PKSF on a defined
format for project data/performance and submitted annual audit reports conducted by
external auditors to PKSF.

Social Safeguards
The social safeguard aspect of FSP was well designed, as it was developed through
discussions with MFIs that were already providing micro-finance and other services to
the poorest and studying key social and cultural issues of potential beneficiaries,
including the poorest poor who were not included in micro-finance activities or who had
dropped out for various reasons. Among the social safeguards desired by the poorest
groups were a flexible mechanism for repayment, such as providing assets through grants
or repayment of the total amount after six months or after harvest or the productive
season; skill development training; market information; production inputs, and market
linkage for the sale of products. Some POs proposed providing microcredit as a package
with other essential services such as health care, social mobilization for unity and
empowerment, child development, etc. These POs had realized that the poorest need
microcredit that offers flexibility to suit their situation, as well as other supportive
services so that they can invest the credit (rather than consume it) in productive activities
and thus benefit from the services. The project took these aspects into account and
focused on a credit plus approach3 while offering the microfinance package to the poorest.




3 Credit Plus approach includes a broad range of products and services: credit, training, social development
services including that for backward and forward linkages. This approach advocates for flexible and
handholding supports for the poorest in order to build confidence, prosper and gradually come out of
chronic poverty.




                                                     19

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Three triggers4 contemplated in the PAD of FSP for a follow-on operation had been met
successfully well before completion of the project. The government, being fully satisfied
with the outcome of the project, replicated the project all over the country. Therefore, the
question of a follow-on operation became moot as GOB immediately mobilized another 72
POs (for a total of 91 POs) to replicate the program, called Microfinance for the Ultra Poor
or the Ultra Poor Program (commonly known as UPP).


3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES


3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project remains highly relevant to the development of Bangladesh. Within the
framework of the Country Assistance Strategy to substantially reduce poverty in
Bangladesh, the FSP contributed to this goal by offering targeted groups opportunities to
develop skills, improve income, and accumulate assets.

Project design and implementation that have direct bearing on the attainment of project
outcomes included: (i) financing the revolving fund to be used by the POs to extend
microcredit to the poorest. POs designed the delivery of financial services for target
groups within the broad parameters of PKSF, which offered ranges for setting interest
rates to borrowers, savings requirements, maturity of loans, repayment periods, and
linkages with other safety nets. POs also offered training on income-generating activities;
(ii) setting up the FSP unit and the research cell, whose incremental costs were paid out
of the monitoring and evaluation component, supported on a declining basis. PKSF
supported the POs' capacity-building needs and helped them acquire specific skills for
income-generating activities; (iii) creating a disaster fund, from disbursements by PKSF
to compensate losses beyond borrowers' control; and (iv) establishing a monitoring and
evaluation system to analyze performance indicators.

In terms of project implementation, the country's needs did not change during the course
of the project; however, the project responded to changing circumstances by a budget
reallocation during its second extension.




4 Triggers included: (i) more than half of the microcredit borrowers continued to demand microcredit and use
it profitably; (ii) the borrowers maintained an annual repayment rate of at least 90 percent; and (iii) the POs
continued to show interest in extending microcredit to the poorest and in expanding operations to reach a
sustainable scale.




                                                       20

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The objective of the LIL is to find models of sustainable interventions for reducing the
number of the poorest through use of microcredit and other financial services to enhance
their income and livelihood.

By introducing flexibility in the microcredit delivery model, the project reached the
lowest income group of the population and proved beyond doubt that the poorest could
also be credit-worthy to receive financial services. The experience of this pilot not only
convinced the government to replicate it all over Bangladesh, but gave birth to half a
dozen projects being initiated by donor agencies and GOB and implemented by PKSF
and MFIs.

The interim and final impact evaluation studies conducted on the project showed positive
changes in the lives of the poorest borrowers over the period of project implementation.
These changes were revealed in two broad dimensions. First, a marked change has
occurred in the lives of the poorest through various phases of interventions. Second, a
difference in living standards at a given point in time is observable between the situation
under intervention and that with no intervention at different stages of the project's life
cycle. The studies concluded that the project had made significantly positive changes in
the lives of the poorest of the poor.

All performance/result monitoring indicators (including PDOs or outcome indicators to
measure project development objectives and intermediate outcome or output indicators to
measure component performance), as well as the three triggers set for follow-on
operations, were fully achieved. Five main outcome indicators used to assess the PDO
achievements are as follows:

    1. The first outcome indicator, Income of at least 50 percent of those who are
        earning less than 50 cents a day raised to more than 50 cents a day, has been
        fully achieved. As a result of the project intervention, 93.5 percent of borrowers
        now earn more than 50 cents a day.

    2. The second outcome indicator, Income of at least 50 percent of those who are
        earning less than a dollar/day raised to more than a dollar/day (Tk.60/day), has
        been fully achieved as 83.4 percent of borrowers now earn more than a dollar/day.

    3. The third outcome indicator, Innovative delivery mechanisms designed by POs to
        meet the financial needs of the poorest, exceeded what was envisaged in the PAD.
        All 19 POs under the LIL plus 72 POs under the UPP p have designed or
        implemented innovative delivery mechanisms to meet the financial needs of the
        poorest.

    4. The fourth outcome indicator, POs incentivized to extend micro-financial services
        to the poorest, has also been fully achieved. The target was for at least 15 POs to
        be motivated and strengthened to design and implement delivery mechanisms for
        extending financial services to the poorest. The project extended both financial
        and technical support to the POs that acted as incentives to augment their ideas
        and participate in this delivery model. POs gained substantial knowledge and



                                             21

        experience in how to reach and serve the poorest and were motivated to adopt this
        as an additional product line in their mainstream microfinance programs. Thus,
        not only 19 POs that were enlisted in this LIL, but also another 72 POs were
        motivated to offer the micro-financial services to the poorest.

    5. The fifth outcome indicator, Household vulnerability reduced by: (a) 25 percent
        increase in total household assets; (b) 50 percent reduction in chronically
        insecure households; and (c) 50 percent upgradation of "jhupri" (thatched
        house) dwellers to semi-durable housing structure, has been fully achieved.
        Household assets increased by 43.8 percent. There was a 64 percent reduction in
        the number of chronically insecure households and 78 percent of households
        could afford to live in in semi-durable housing structures.

FSP also financed skills development training for about 175,834 beneficiaries of the
replicated project.

3.3 Efficiency

As the main objective of this LIL was to identify sustainable models of extending
financial services to the poorest, a full-fledged economic analysis may not be appropriate.
Nor was such an analysis performed at the time of the LIL appraisal. Quantifying exact
benefits of this LIL to the poorest when they come out of their chronic poverty and into
the microfinance sector was found to be very difficult.

However, a conservative estimate of the project's impact during its implementation phase,
taking into account the microcredit disbursed to the LIL beneficiaries and the savings
mobilized, minus the discounted cost streams, shows a financial rate of return of 23
percent and a net present value (NPV) of Tk. 241.63 million (see Annex 3). As discussed
before, all development objectives were achieved and implemented by utilizing the full
project cost. Although the replicated program (UPP) decreased the demand for
microcredit components, the aptly made reallocation, along with almost full utilization of
funds for capacity-building for PKSF and POs and beneficiary training, helped the
project achieve the development objectives fully.

Two large impact evaluation studies were conducted on the FSP project. The mid-term
evaluation was done in 2005, and the final evaluation of the project was done in 2007.
Both studies showed that PKSF and the POs achieved operational and financial
sustainability. They observed that in the first year, POs needed technical assistance for
one-off training (for awareness- and confidence-building) of the identified members
(beneficiaries). Once they started recovering the credits, after one year, the POs could
sustain themselves, even if there had been no built-in subsidy (which was set on a
declining trend until 2004). With the increase in the number of borrowers and the
increase in the size of the loan portfolio, the project took off at the end of 2004 and
became financially sustainable. Although the subsidy for staff salary and training ended
at the end of the third year of project implementation, POs were able to retain their staff
with project income. Again, as it gained full momentum in the third year in terms of
human resources, logistics, outreach, and operational income, the project achieved



                                              22

operational sustainability and maintained it until the end of the project. It should be noted
that, unlike FSP, where POs had to pay 4.5 percent in interest charges to PKSF and
borrowers were charged as high as 12.5 percent (flat), the UPP, which the GOB is
implementing through PKSF, involves a grant to PKSF paid out of the national budget;
this has enabled PKSF to on-lend to POs at an interest rate as low as 1 percent and POs to
re-lend to the poorest at the maximum interest rate of 10 percent (in many cases, it is
much lower). The UPP, like FSP, is linked to other existing nationwide safety net
programs with free health and education services being offered to the poorest borrowers.

The actual and potential economic benefits derived as a result of this LIL are expected to
be very high. Many of these are not considered in NPV calculations, as discussed in
Annex 3, mainly because of (i) the unavailability of year-by-year data, (ii) some benefits
being of a non-quantifiable nature, and (iii) indirect benefits that were not easily
attributable to the LIL.

The project outperformed almost all of its targets. It was able to increase microcredit
outreach (58,505 borrowers) by doubling the number of beneficiaries targeted to graduate
to mainstream microcredit programs at project inception to 24,514 of the poorest
borrowers at the project's close. Households could increase their income significantly (48
percent per final impact study) and save potential costs by receiving free health, social,
education, and training services.

Inspired by this sustainable model of delivering micro-financial services to the poorest,
we have observed six follow-on operations being implemented by PKSF, including the
UPP, financed by GOB.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The project exhibited high relevance of objectives, design, and implementation. All the
PDOs were fully met, with results, in some cases, far exceeding the targets. The project
was efficient considering its cost-effectiveness and long term sustainability. Furthermore,
all the intermediate outcome indicators were found to be satisfactory, specifically the
following: (i) 58,505 new borrowers received microcredit under innovative terms and
conditions; (ii) 10,276 FSP beneficiaries and 175,809 UPP beneficiaries were trained in
self-employment activities to increase their income levels; (iii) 2,743 members received
training on wage employment; (iv) 13,019 FSP beneficiaries plus 175,809 UPP
beneficiaries s received training on income-generating activities; (v) under the social
development services of FSP, all POs provided health, training, education, family
planning, and sanitation services to 63,000 beneficiaries. Moreover, all of the three
triggers for follow-on operations had been met much earlier than originally planned.
This LIL has achieved its objective of finding sustainable models for extending financial
services to the poorest of the poor. Considering the success of this LIL, GOB allocated
around Tk. 2.86 billion (US$ 42 million) from the national budget to PKSF to replicate



                                             23

the LIL all over Bangladesh. This project has, therefore, been implemented all over the
country through 91 POs that have reached more than 828,000 of the poorest borrowers in
more than 18,000 villages covering 62 districts. The LIL demonstrates that IDA has been
able to inspire innovations in product design and delivery, and it clearly shows the
creditworthiness of clients who had previously been considered not "bankable" and who
had been denied access to funding from the country's many MFIs - a simple but powerful
demonstration with potential lessons across the world.

The task team rated the achievement of PDO as Satisfactory in its final ISR in absence of
a detailed final impact study and definitive figures on achievement of PDOs and
intermediate outcome indicators at the end of the project. Based on the mission's findings
at ICR and the subsequent availability of data, as summarized above, a Highly
Satisfactory assessment for the Overall Outcome Rating has been given; this reflects the
relevance and achievement of the PDOs and the efficiency of the LIL.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The overall development impact of this LIL and, for that matter, the replicated project, is
huge, as it enabled the MFIs to extend microcredit and other financial services to around
900,000 people, who are the poorest of the poor and who did not have access to
mainstream microfinance, with innovative terms and conditions to enhance their incomes
and livelihood. The two large impact evaluation studies conducted under the project
suggest that individuals in the targeted population have significantly improved their
income levels and livelihoods. Women, who were previously either sex workers, beggars,
or domestic help and who had no voice in their families, were empowered with FSP's
intervention to participate actively (even, in some cases, to dominate) their families'
decision making processes; many of them even became entrepreneurs and started
employing their husbands and others in their business enterprises. These women believe
that they have achieved a new social status unimaginable five years ago.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The capacity-building component of the project made important contributions to
institution-building both at PKSF and at the PO level. Market participants (donors, GOB,
MFIs) started recognizing that PKSF had been significantly strengthened to implement
the projects/programs dedicated to the poorest of the poor. As a result, PKSF undertook
half a dozen projects of this nature in the last couple of years. PKSF has established a
permanent cell to look after programs dedicated to the ultra poor. This cell is basically the
successor to the FSP and retains existing project staff. PKSF staff members benefited
from training, site visits, and other exposures and, consequently, were able to make major
improvements to M&E, MIS, research, etc. The POs also benefited significantly from
FSP intervention. They were sufficiently motivated by the training and logistical supports
to provide micro-financial services with innovative credit terms. Each PO was provided
with an MIS officer to monitor the project with a view to strengthening research/M&E
capability within the organization and received tangible support such as PCs, motor
vehicles, etc. POs also adopted the FSP model in their mainstream microfinance and set-


                                              24

up completely separate cells to monitor programs of this nature. POs learned significantly
how to best deliver and monitor micro-financial services to the poorest of the poor.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The government's acceptance of the lessons learned from FSP's experience motivated it
to allocate US$ 42 million from the national budget to replicate the FSP across the whole
country. Thus, the availability of microcredit funds from GOB caused the FSP to extend
three times and to reallocate funds to support not only FSP, but also the replicated
program in the area of capacity-building for POs and final beneficiaries. Consequently,
the project was able to serve more of the poorest poor than it had initially been intended
to reach.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
External consultants conducted three different impact studies based on sample surveys of
beneficiaries: (i) A comparative study of the impact of four similar microfinance
programs in the country, 2005; (ii) Impact Evaluation, 2005; and (iii) Final Impact
Evaluation, 2007.
The mid-term impact evaluation in 2005 found a positive impact for the FSP
interventions on the livelihoods of the target groups in both social and economic terms.
Some of the main findings worth highlighting are (i) the increase in household annual
income and expenditure by 20 percent and 12 percent, respectively in 2005 compared to
the pre-intervention period; (ii) about 90 percent of the beneficiaries were able to save Tk.
1,000 or more per annum. The study also indicated that the success of projects similar in
nature to the FSP project depends not only on the commitments of the service providers,
but also on their institutional and financial growth potential.

The final impact assessment of FSP conducted in 2007, based on a sample survey of
1,900 respondents (75 percent project beneficiaries; 25 percent control group), was
positive (see summary of the final impact evaluation report in Annex 5).The key
findings/conclusions were as follows:

        (i)   As a result of project interventions, participants made significant progress
              toward a change in occupation from doing almost nothing significant to self-
              employment (livestock rearing, rickshaw/van owning, small business
              ownership, farming through leasing, mortgaging, share cropping, and
              renting, etc.);

        (ii) The project was able to increase income (more than 48 percent during the
              project period compared to 34 percent for the control group) and
              expenditures (also 40 percent compared to 22 percent for the control group)
              of beneficiaries' households, which enhanced their standards of living;

        (iii) Significant improvements took place in terms of living conditions, sanitation,
              and food intake (increased from one or two meals to three meals per day
              throughout the year);




                                              25

         (iv) About 24,500 out of 58,500 ultra poor borrowers have graduated to the
                mainstream microcredit program for which they had been ineligible before
                joining the FSP program;

         (v)    Awareness of group formation, health, water and sanitation, savings and
                credit, skills development, IGA selection, building group solidarity and
                leadership, management, and building improved quality life all increased;

         (vi) The beneficiaries were made "bankable" and credit worthy so as to gain
                access to financial services from quasi-formal financial institutions in the
                near future;

         (vii) The savings rate increased from Taka 1 per week to Taka 12 per week,
                indicating the potential for capital formation and growth even at the poorest
                level--a significant achievement;

         (viii) The POs were able to generate an income of about Taka 60 million (US$ 0.9
                million) during the project period. In order to attain financial sustainability,
                one of two options must be exercised­increasing the number of beneficiaries
                to a desired level so as to cover the operational cost or continuing the
                subsidy for some gestation period; and

A stakeholders' workshop was conducted during the ICR mission to learn about the
experiences shared by PKSF and its POs. Annex 5 delineates the summary of the
workshop.


4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME


Rating: Negligible to low.

The development outcomes achieved through this project seem to be sustainable in the
future as the government and PKSF have demonstrated their commitment by replicating
the LIL all over Bangladesh.


5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE


(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

Bank Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory




                                                26

The Bank team was proactive in identifying, preparing, and appraising the LIL in a
fashion most likely to achieve planned development outcomes. FSP directly supports the
GOB and CAS objective of poverty alleviation. The project design was sound in terms of
stakeholder involvement, focus on the poorest of the poor, and anticipating problem areas
to ensure the objective of making the innovative model of microfinance sustainable. The
targeting criteria of the project beneficiaries were determined upfront, at the pre-appraisal
stage, in consultation with POs and PKSF. The preparation of the project was flexible in
design, which improved implementation readiness.

The Bank's implementation arrangement through PKSF was realistic. PKSF was
established in 1990 under the sponsorship of the government to play a direct role in
alleviating poverty by providing financial services to rural borrowers through
NGOs/MFIs. It had already attained a high level of competence at the time of the
appraisal of the project in 2002. It had established a system of financial intermediation
and its outcome has been commendable. PKSF's staff competence was high, as it
recruited people with high caliber and good motivation to work with the poorest of the
poor. PKSF's strength also lay in its independent and strong governing board, comprising
microfinance practitioners, notable civil society members, and government
representatives. A result-based monitoring and evaluation system, the sequencing of
M&E activities, an improved system of accountability and strengthening of the internal
audit unit, and a separate FSP cell and research sub-cell were included in the project
design to ensure effective project implementation and improved portfolio quality.
Inclusion of capacity-building for PKSF, POs, and borrowers was a wise move, as we all
were new to this mode of delivery of microfinance.

The selection of POs based on strict criteria was crucial for the LIL. The Bank had
organized a full array of fiduciary arrangements in the area of procurement and financial
management, including capacity-building in these areas.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory.

It is evident that the Bank's supervision missions focused on development effectiveness
of the project. The team paid attention not only to the implementation results on the
ground, but also to the long-term sustainability of the LIL and the POs involved, the
social impact on beneficiaries, and the demonstration effect of successful microfinance
programs targeted for the poorest. The team maintained well-managed relations with the
borrower and other stakeholders. The team wisely included social development training,
which turned out to be very attractive and useful to the poorest. The impact on
beneficiaries, in terms of their involvement with IGAs, increases in income, and other
indicators, was successfully tracked. Overall monitoring of progress, implementation
performance, and supervision of fiduciary/safeguard aspects were effective. The team's
fiduciary staff always acted promptly on the issues raised at different points in time. The
team, along with the Bank's disbursement office, always tracked the disbursement
condition of the project and followed up with PKSF.



                                                27

A high quality of supervision was maintained throughout: (a) regular supervision from
the field office; (b) semiannual supervision; and (c) an extensive supervision mission
(similar to a regular midterm review) in conjunction with a midterm review for
Microfinance II project in mid-2005. Regular field office supervision had been very
effective in resolving day-to-day implementation issues. The semiannual supervision
concentrated on broader implementation issues--e.g. using supervision resources
optimally, reallocating resources, revising budgeting/action plans, etc. Upon GOB's
request and through close consultation with PKSF, the Bank extended the project three
times to ensure better development outcomes.

The supervision teams included professionals with an appropriate mix of skills to
diagnose the major operational and implementation issues. Therefore, the composition of
the supervision missions changed, depending on the stage of implementation and the
issues that the project confronted. The supervision teams included experts on microcredit,
financial analysis, financial management, institutional development, poverty reduction,
social science, procurement, and disbursement.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.

Overall, the Bank's performance was satisfactory. It was evaluated in terms of: (a) the
soundness of the LIL design and its in-built flexibility for effective implementation; (b)
its assessment and the reliability of the implementing agency in terms of its institutional
capacity, management efficiency, commitment, and poverty alleviation objectives; (c) the
quality of supervision; and (d) actions taken and followed up.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The government had full commitment to achieving the project's development objectives.
Both the Ministry of Finance and the Bangladesh Bank were actively involved in the
consultation process during preparation of the project. GOB expressed its support by on-
lending IDA funds to PKSF through a Subsidiary Loan Agreement (SLA) under the
termsUS$ 3 million as a revolving fund for microcredit at 1.25 percent per annum and
the remaining US$ 2 million as a grant for capacity- building and M&E components.

The government's performance during the project implementation was commendable. It
supported PKSF all through by responding to the issues raised in a timely fashion. GOB
fully owned the LIL and replicated it across the country through PKSF by allocating
more than US$ 42 million from its national budget. GOB's launch of the replicated
program at the midpoint of the LIL helped produce a smooth transition for regular
operation of supported activities after the credit closed.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory



                                              28

The performance of the implementing agency, PKSF, has been undoubtedly satisfactory.
It showed strong ownership of the project during the design, preparation, and
implementation. Its beneficiary and stakeholder consultations were adequate. PKSF
contributed greatly to successful implementation of the LIL and it helped prove that the
poorest of the poor are bankable.

PKSF management also acquired necessary skills for a new mode of microfinance by
implementing this LIL. It strengthened staff capacity, hired additional staff with required
skills, and strengthened supervision capacity. The FSP cell was dedicated to look after
the LIL. The cell has now been converted to a UPP cell. PKSF also deployed dedicated
people to look after the fiduciary aspects of the project. For financial management issues,
it leveraged the experience of staff members who already had solid track records in of
dealing with IDA's Microfinance I project and were dealing with another parallel
Microfinance II project. PKSF maintained a good MIS and POs' monitoring system.
POs' performance was discussed at PKSF's regular coordination meetings. This strict
monitoring enabled PKSF to guarantee that the loan portfolio was of a high quality.
PKSF arranged timely capacity-building training sessions and site visits for the PO staffs.
It responded promptly to client demands with regard to on-lending of funds to the POs.
The recovery rate in the credit operation of the project at both tracks--PKSF to POs and
POs to borrowers--was more than 99 percent.

PKSF showed prudence in utilizing and allocating the money. Its timely identification of
the need to allocate funds among the different categories of the IDA credit and the need
to extend the project, as well as its support for the extension process, contributed to
successful implementation.
Based on the experience of FSP, PKSF undertook six diversified projects targeting the
poorest of the poor, including the biggest UPP (US$ 42 million) financed by the GOB
that has been replicated all over the country by its 91 POs (including FSP POs). UPP
already disbursed more than US$ 113 million to over 800,000 of the poorest borrowers.

The ICR team rates the performance of 19 POs as highly satisfactory; they were behind
the success of this LIL. POs exerted tremendous effort from the very beginning of the
project, accepted the challenge, and proved by their hard work that microfinance services
can be offered to the poorest of the poor in innovative ways in a sustainable manner. It
was a good learning experience for these 19 POs and had demonstrable effects on the
replicated program.

Overall, PKSF maintained a strong identity and kept itself outside the influence of the
government. This helped PKSF earn a good reputation in the microfinance industry as
well as the respect of all of the stakeholders. These results were possible because PKSF's
governing board was composed of respected individuals known for their integrity and
dedication, including Dr. Muhammad Yunus, Managing Director, Grameen Bank; Dr.
Wahiduddin Mahmud, former advisor to the caretaker government, Managing Director of
PKSF; academicians; central bankers; and social workers. The board demonstrated strong




                                              29

leadership of the project by making major implementation and policy decisions and by
formulating policies to develop a sound microfinance sector.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.

Combining the two ratings for government and implementing agency performance,
overall borrower performance is rated satisfactory.


6. LESSONS LEARNED

The LIL attained its objective of finding sustainable interventions for reducing the
number of the poorest by using microcredit and other financial services to enhance their
income and livelihood. The project demonstrated the following major lessons:

    (i) The poorest are bankable if the microcredit is designed in an innovative fashion
         with flexibility in the areas of eligibility criteria, small savings, loan size, IGA-
         based repayment system, etc. Selection of potential IGAs, skills enhancement
         training, social development and safety-net services, and others were areas
         requiring attention.

    (ii) Microcredit for the poorest of the poor is economically viable, as it helps the
        beneficiaries to increase their income and savings and improve their socio-
        economic conditions.

    (iii)A credit plus approach should be used. Flexible microfinance products for the
        poorest should be combined with safety net type interventions. The rationale for
         combining such approaches is that the primary objective of microfinance -
         developing sustainable livelihoods for the extreme poor - cannot be met unless a
         household is first able to meet its minimum needs, which includes coping with the
         effect of shocks. This combination proved to be very effective in supporting
         income-generating activities ­ one without the other might not be effective for
         poverty reduction in this group. Offering needs-based social development services
         was a key to success for such programs. However, the social development
         services offered by the POs depended on their external sources of funding, the
         willingness of MFIs' management, surpluses in other programs, and adequacy of
         equity, among other things

    (iv)The program involved subsidies (from FPS, PKSF, and POs) in training, staff
         costs and, most important of all, in social development services. However, POs
         were able to bear these costs after the third year of operation. In order to ensure
         program success organizers must determine the exact amount (or proportion) of
         subsidies required and devise a realistic strategy to finance the gap to make it
         sustainable. Although the beneficiaries of FSP had been linked with many other
         ongoing and available safety net programs, it would be worthwhile to study what
         would happen if such programs were terminated and what could be done in their
         absence.




                                                30

    (v) Selection of income generating activity (IGA) is crucial for the poorest. It was
        found that IGAs that were in some way related to their family businesses were
        best suited for them.

    (vi)Small POs faced financial problems because their equity decreased as a result of
        cross-subsidizing the program expenditure over the project period. The volume of
        operation and operational efficiencies, including overhead and administration
        costs, needed to be rationalized to achieve reasonable returns. In that sense, large
        POs having large portfolios could provide reasonable returns.

    (vii)Collaboration among GOs­NGOs and NGOs­NGOs helped the extremely poor
        to gain access to social safety net programs. The necessity of these linkages
        became even more evident when the Ultra Poor Program started reaching the
        whole country. Collaboration was necessary among various types of interventions
        and all stakeholders, including government, NGOs, private organizations,
        development partners, civil society, and others.

    (viii) Training needs assessment of the beneficiaries was a precondition for selecting
        the proper type of IGA training. Also, interactive training materials were more
        useful than conventional training materials.

    (ix) Because the poorest tend to be highly vulnerable to disasters and emergencies,
        bringing them under the mandate of PKSF and its POs' disaster management
        (DMF) fund was very important. Such funds should remain flexible and pay
        particular attention to this segment of the poor. As DMF also financed disaster
        preparedness needs, the borrowers of projects like FSP should be guided by POs
        and be linked with DMF where such a preparedness need was foreseeable.
        Gradually, disaster-related micro-insurance products should be brought into the
        microfinance industry to hedge such risks in a more formal and efficient manner.
        There was scope for revisiting the existing regulatory framework which did not
        explicitly allow MFIs to act as agents/brokers of insurance companies, although
        some MFIs had investigated this line of business for their clients to a limited
        extent.

    (x) The poorest of the poor should be provided with proper counseling and market
        information in respect to the appropriate types of IGAs they choose. Studying this
        segment of the poor more deeply in respect to their socioeconomic dynamics is
        essential.

7. COMMENTS ON ISSUES RAISED BY BORROWER/IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES/PARTNERS

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

    (i) PKSF raised the issue that POs provide social development services to the poorest
        either by cross-subsidizing or by introducing them to other safety net programs.
        There was no specific component or allocation reserved for these activities in FSP.
        In the starting years, as the POs were struggling to achieve financial and
        operational sustainability, they had to subsidize the project by diverting funds
        from other projects. This created problems for the smaller POs, as their surplus
        reserve base is not strong. PKSF has no special fund allocation for small POs for


                                              31

         this purpose in its replicated program. Going forward, the government can
         consider allocating separate funds for social development services built into the
         program.

    (ii) PKSF suggested that further research/study and consultation would help them
         better understand the segment and serve them with proper guidance and adequate
         information. A concerted effort among all stakeholders is required to make such a
         program a success.

(b) Cofinanciers

Not Applicable.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
(e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)

Annex 6 explains the issues raised and discussed with partner organizations during the
ICR mission. The workshop supports the view that the FSP was a learning experience for
microfinance industry about the innovative ways of eradicating poverty.

Notes:
* This figure reflects the reallocation of funds among categories (from microcredit and disaster funds to
capacity-building). Detail is presented in section 1.7 of this ICR.

** In FSP, the borrower's contribution was meant to be contributions by PKSF and POs. While PKSF's
component-wise contributions were known at the time of ICR, PO contributions were known only in total,
US$ 0.336 million.

*** This reflects IDA contributions of US$ 5.69 million and borrower contribution of US$ 1.41 million.
However, IDA contributions seem to be inflated in dollar terms as USD depreciated against SDR over the
project period (on an average, 4 percent each year); so did Taka against USD. However, in SDR terms,
IDA disbursement was 97.4 percent (SDR 3.8 million out of total commitment SDR 3.9 million).

                        ANNEX 3. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

The LIL achieved its intended objective of determining a sustainable model of extending
micro-financial services to the poorest of the poor, and its long-term impact is huge. The
task team did not consider conducting an economic or financial analysis for the LIL at the
time of its appraisal. However, an attempt has been made to quantify the short-term
impact during the project's life based on the financial benefits/costs. This yields a
positive NPV (Tk.241.63 million) and a considerably higher IRR of 23 percent of the
overall project. While indirect benefits are not calculated, two obvious financial benefits
prove the viability of such intervention. Thus, a very conservative approach was followed
in looking at the financial NPV/IRR for the project. Obviously, the actual financial and
economic benefits in both the short and the long run are expected to be much higher.

Main Assumptions:

    1. The NPV calculation is based on the actual project life cycle (August 21, 2002, to
        December 31, 2007), with no scrap value at the end of the project;
    2. The cost of funds was assumed to stand close to the market (formal) and thus, all
        cash flows (benefits/costs) were discounted at 12%;
    3. Incremental household income5 and the savings induced by FSP are considered
        two of the most direct benefits derived from the LIL which would not have
        happened without the intervention;
    4. Actual disbursements under the IDA credit were taken into account to estimate
        NPV and IRR;




5Calculated as the difference between before and after figures of average household incomes of the project
beneficiaries per PKSF's Final Impact Study multiplied by 58,505 project borrowers.




                                                   37

    5. Actual costs (operational, consultant services, and goods) borne by PKSF and
        POs in implementing FSP were used in calculations. IDA portion of these costs is
        included in project cost (calculated per IDA disbursements).
    6. Service charges earned/paid by the PKSF, POs, and beneficiaries are not
        considered, as these are benefits to one party and a cost to others.

Other additional direct and indirect benefits derived are shown in the PDO and
intermediate outcome indicators (see Results Framework Analysis at the beginning of this
report). It is notable that 58,505 new borrowers received microcredit under innovative
terms and conditions, which was about
double of the original target of the            Table: Changes Percentage in Household

The economic benefit would also include the indirect/potential cost savings made by the
64,000 FSP beneficiaries who received free health services, training, education, family
planning, sanitation services, etc.

POs also benefited from capacity­building, which has long-term advantages for the entire
microfinance sector (and economy). Over the project period, they earned Tk. 21.5 million,
in total, in the form of service charges from borrowers.

Thus, the indirect benefits derived as a result of this LIL are, obviously, very high. As
mentioned, 24,514 of the poorest borrowers of FSP had already been graduated to the
mainstream microcredit program, and another 60 percent of the 37,712 poorest borrowers
are now qualified (ready to declare) for mainstream microcredit. Until now, PKSF was in
charge of implementing six projects which came into existence because of the success of
FSP, all of which have at least one component targeting the poorest. The UPP has already
reached more than 828,000 ultra poor in 62 districts through PKSF's 91 POs. Since a
conservative approach was followed in calculating the NPV/IRR, not all of these indirect
benefits were included in the calculation. Besides, FSP's contribution to the development
of the microfinance sector, the capacity building and increased productivity of
beneficiaries, PKSF, and the POs and other spill-over effects of these activities on the
economy have been difficult to quantify and have, therefore, not been included in the
analysis.

                         ANNEX 5. BENEFICIARY SURVEY RESULTS

Three relevant studies were conducted under FSP to look into its impact on the lives of
the poorest of the poor.

    1. Financial Services to the Poorest: A Comparative Study of the Programs
        (2005). This study was intended as a comparative study of the impact of four
        microfinance programs (PKSF's FSP, BRAC, Grameen Bank, and Plan
        Bangladesh) on and to suggest a desirable system of delivery of financial services
        to the poorest.

    2. Impact Evaluation (2005). This midterm impact evaluation was conducted in
        2005. Its main objectives were to assess (i) the impact of the interventions on the
        livelihood of the target groups in both social and economic terms, (ii) the changes
        in the organizational and financial capabilities of the POs involved in the project.

    3. Final Impact Evaluation (2007): A final impact study, a sample survey of 1,900
        borrowers, was conducted at the end of the project. The main objectives were to
        (i) assess the impact of the project interventions on the livelihoods of the poorest
        of the poor in both social and economic terms; (ii) measure the actual outcome
        and output indicators of FSP against its target; and (iii) compare the income,
        assets and quality of life of the target groups between midterm and final impact
        evaluations of the project.

Following is the summary of the final impact assessment conducted by PKSF through an
independent consulting firm:


    (i)     Study Methodology. Methodology included a systematic procedure of
            collecting data from both primary and secondary sources. Primary data were
            collected through a survey using a quasi-experimental design incorporating
            project beneficiary and control groups, in-depth interviews with POs, six
            FGDs selected from six administrative divisions, and case studies comprising
            two successful and two unsuccessful beneficiaries identified by the field
            survey. A total of 1,900 respondents, 100 from the service area of each PO,
            were selected, of whom 75 percent were project beneficiaries and 25 percent
            were control group members. From each selected upazila (sub-district), three
            categories of villages were identified: inaccessible, typical, and easily
            accessible. From each category, one village was selected randomly to supply
            the required number of beneficiaries and control group members. .
            Beneficiaries and controls were selected from the same villages in each
            category.

    (ii)    Major achievements. The major tasks accomplished by the 19 POs were to
            identify the potential beneficiaries, select them according to set criteria,
            organize and impart training on awareness building, skills development, IGAs
            selection, and savings and credit operations to bring them under the FSP credit
            umbrella so they could undertake desired and suitable IGAs. Monitoring,




                                              41

      supervision, and follow-up of their activities were also the tasks and
      responsibility of the POs.

      As of December 2007, there were 64,725 identified members, out of which
      58,891 received awareness training, and 58,505 obtained loans. PKSF
      disbursed SDR2.52 million as a credit fund to 19 POs, which disbursed
      SDR6.28 million (cumulative) to the intended beneficiaries. The average
      recovery rate for the project is 99 percent.

      Most of the beneficiaries obtained more than three loans, and a few of them
      were given five loans. Evidently, the POs were able to achieve a reasonable
      rate of return while also reaching the lending target. Most of the beneficiaries
      continued to borrow from the POs, even at the end of the project, indicating
      the sustainability of the program.

(iii) Occupation, employment and working hours. About 52,000 of the project
      beneficiaries are women. Before the project, they were predominantly
      housewives engaged in domestic chores. Project interventions introduced
      significant occupational changes in favor of self-employment (livestock
      rearing; rickshaw/van and other small business ownership; farming through
      leasing, mortgaging, share cropping, and renting; etc) opportunities from
      which they are able to earn regular incomes.

      FSP has made a significant impact on the employment position of the
      beneficiaries and their household members, both full time and part time. The
      average monthly working hours of the beneficiary households increased by
      about 23 hours compared to 14 hours for the control group because of the
      involvement of a larger number of IGAs. Moreover, earning members per
      household also increased from 1.4 to 1.7 persons.

(iv)  Temporary migration. The incidence of migration in the beneficiary
      households declined significantly as a result of the increased number of IGAs
      in the project area while the incidence increased slightly in the control group.
      For example, the proportion of households having migrants in the beneficiary
      households decreased from eight percent in 2002 to four percent in 2005 and
      declined further to three percent in 2007, while the proportion for the control
      group increased from 2.5 percent in 2002 to 5.3 percent in 2005. However, in
      2007 the proportion dropped slightly to about 4.6 percent.

(v)   Household Income and expenditure: From all components of the study,
      such as surveys, FGDs, case studies and PO interviews, it appears that the
      incomes of the beneficiary households have increased sizably, according to
      the Final Impact Survey, compared to both the pre-project situation and the
      midterm study. Household income is also found to have grown appreciably in
      the project households compared to that of control group members. The
      average household income increased by more than 48 percent during the



                                        42

      project period. On the other hand, increase in the incomes of control group
      members was 34 percent. The major sources of household income for the
      beneficiary women, according to the survey, were IGAs undertaken through
       credit provided by the FSP project. These IGAs were based on on-farm and
      off-farm activities.

      During the project period, not only household income, but also household
      expenditures increased by 40 percent, from Taka 25,360 to 35,530, on average.
      For the control group, the average expenditures increased by 22 percent. The
       major expenditure categories, such as food consumption, remained the same,
       but the relative share of food as a portion of household expenditure declined.
       From FGD and case studies, it appears that the quality of food also improved.

(vi)   Savings mobilization. At the time of the FSP launch, the poorest did not have
       any saving for themselves or their families. The flexible saving system
       allowed by the project encouraged them to save in various forms and in
       different amounts. Savings increased from Tk.1 per week to Tk.12 over five
       years. The average household saving generated by beneficiary group in 2007
       was Tk.7,335, compared to Tk.6,441 for the control group. During the five-
       year period of the project, Tk.50.76 million (US$ 0.75 million) was mobilized,
       building financial strength and promoting capital formation at the grass roots
       level.

(viii) Human Assets. At the household level, human capital formation has been
       taking place in the form of schooling children, attending group meetings
       where individuals learn about quality of life and crisis management skills,
       idea generation and sharing, and other skills and awareness training; and
      access to health care services and facilities, etc. Data show that project
       interventions have enabled beneficiaries to gain and improve their perceptions,
      knowledge, attitudes, and practices in relation to important aspects of life.

(ix)  Land usage. The study shows a remarkable improvement in the beneficiaries'
      usage of land, in the form of renting (khaikhalashi), mortgaging,
      sharecropping, and leasing, which largely has contributed to their income
      enhancement. They grow crops and vegetables according to season and choice.
      Thus, the FSP project has created for them opportunities to access to land for
      production activities.

(x)   Livestock and other Productive Assets. More than half of the beneficiaries
      own livestock resources, namely cows, goats, chickens, and ducks. These
      assets supplement their household income, as well as fulfill nutritional
      requirements to a great extent. Many of the beneficiary women purchased
      rickshaws, vans, boats, fishing nets, etc. with the loans they obtained from
      FSP. These are used by their household members or rented to others. Some of
      them are also engaged in small businesses in which they maintained/
      purchased grocery goods and items through FSP credit support. Thus micro-
      enterprises enabled them to enhance their incomes and create employment for
      others.



                                         43

(xi)   Quality of Houses and Sanitation: Beneficiaries have been able to improve
       the quality of their dwellings either by virtue of investments of their loans or
       by savings mobilized under FSP. Instead of thatch roofs, they have installed
       tin roofs, increased the number of rooms, and expanded the homestead areas
       where they plant kitchen gardens.

       About 20% of the beneficiary households were successful in improving
       sanitation at the household level by installing ring slab latrines that the POs
       and the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) support at
       subsidized rates. In the case of control households, the comparable figure was
       only 10 percent. Moreover, in the training they learned about sanitation and
       safe drinking water.

(xii) Food Intake. Because of the enhanced income resulting from FSP
       interventions, the poorest were able to increase their food budget and
       consumption in terms of increasing the numbers meals per day and improving
       the quality of food items contained in their meals. Study reveals that they
       switched from one or two meals to three meals per day throughout the year.
       Thus, FSP was successful in reducing vulnerability of the poorest that resulted
       from poor nutrition.

(xiii) Female Empowerment. Because of FSP interventions, the female
       beneficiaries were able to raise their status in their families, their communities,
       and society in general. This has enabled them to participate in decision-
       making at the family, the group, and the community levels on important issues.
       This empowerment stems from their ability to earn income arising from IGAs
       initiated with FSP support. This empowerment has allowed them to attend
       group meetings, purchase and sell assets/output in the market, and gain access
       to services and facilities that have improved mobility.

(xiv)  Financial Sustainability. Through the FSP, the POs have been able to
       generate an income of about Tk. 20 million during the project period. In
       addition, they obtained a part of their operational cost from PKSF, thus
       gaining an opportunity to attain financial viability. The project is also viable
       for PKSF, with FIRR at 53 percent and NPV at Tk.8.16 million. If cost would
       be increased by 10 percent, the FIRR would remain robust.

       a) Income of the POs. The income of the POs comes from two main sources,
       namely, interest earned on the disbursed amount and the share of interest
       earned from fixed deposits of group savings funds. The interest income from
       the disbursed amount, as of December 2007, stands at Taka 17.96 million at
       12.50 percent per annum; that from the share of fixed deposits of group
       savings funds has been estimated at Taka 2.27 million at 6 percent per annum.
       In total, the POs have earned Taka 20.23 million, with an average of Taka
       1.06 million for each PO.
       b) Expenditures. The end of operational support for POs by PKSF, has seen a
       reduction in their operational costs for FSP execution. The cost reduction
       varied among the POs, principally with regard to including a percentage of



                                         44

      FSP beneficiaries in the normal microcredit program, adjustment of field
      workers through staff reductions, increases in the number of beneficiary
      coverage ratios including FSP members, and budget curtailments in reference
      to the related cost of logistics provided by the project. Given these factors, it
      appears that, on an average, the POs have reduced their costs by 40 percent
      compared to their previous cost reimbursement from PKSF in first three years
      of the project. When considering this average rate, the estimated expenditure
      incurred by the POs stands at Tk. 26.75 million and the average for each PO is
      Tk. 1.41 million for the five years of the project period. Compared to those
      identified during the Mid Term Impact Study, the loan operating costs of POs
      increased by 41 percent in the last two years of FSP.

(xv)  Social Development Services. The selected POs are found to have become
      highly experienced in rendering social services to the poor people. This was,
      however, a challenging task in terms of time spent and methods used to render
      the needed social services, that is, identifying, motivating, counseling, and
      advising individuals to join and form groups, build their organizations, and
      raise awareness through general training, skills development, and IGA
      training, as well as instruction on mother and child health care and family
      planning, water and sanitation safety, savings and credit, organizing and
      conducting regular weekly meetings, disaster management, distribution of
      VGD/VGF cards, vote casting, etc. However, because of the groups' short
      stabilization period, not all of these sessions could be organized and imparted
      in time, and there has been a strong demand from the beneficiaries for needs-
      based IGA training, management and leadership training, training on human
      rights and law, etc. Therefore, during execution of the project, the POs
      conducted training on some subjects and while continuing field operation on
      savings and credit. In all, these added to the aggregate of awareness-building
      of the beneficiaries, which has achieved 93 percent of the targeted coverage
      during a five year period. Intuitively therefore, it is a highly significant
      accomplishment rate for an important task in terms of serving the poorest
      attained by the POs.

(xvi) POs' Experiences of FSP and Attitudes. POs expressed the opinion that
      serving as an implementing partner of such an innovative scheme for the
      poorest has been a period of learning for them during which they have been
      able to enrich their perceptions, knowledge, attitudes, and commitment in
      reference to serving the hitherto ignored poorest of the poor. It was observed
       during the impact assessment that the POs, inspired by the success of the
       project in terms of mobilizing savings and disbursing innovative microcredit
       packages with social services, have included a certain percentage of FSP
       beneficiaries in their normal microcredit programs. This is, indeed, an implicit
       internalization of the pilot testing. Most of the POs, however, voiced the
       opinion that a project such as FSP needs continued technical and financial
       support in order for it to render value and social services, in particular.

(xvii) Focus Group Discussion. The quantitative data obtained through field
       surveys yielded information that was used to measure project development



                                          45

       objectives and output/performance indicators. To validate the findings of
       impact assessment, qualitative information gained through focus group
       discussions (FGD) and selected case studies indicates that the FSP
       interventions have made it possible for the poorest to begin the gradual
       process of elimination of extreme poverty and vulnerability.

(xviii) Conclusions. The final impact evaluation concluded as follows:

 a.    The project was able to significantly increase the income and expenditure of
       beneficiary households.

 b.    There was a significant improvement in the quality of living conditions of the
       beneficiaries in terms of dwellings, sanitation, and food intake.

 c.    There was an increase in awareness of group formation, health, water and
       sanitation, savings and credit, skills development, IGA selection, building
       group solidarity and leadership, management, and building quality of life.

 d.    The beneficiaries were made creditworthy and bankable for access to financial
       services in the long run.

 e.    A significant achievement is the realization of savings mobilization and
       enhancement of the savings rate from Taka 1 per week to Taka 12 per week,
       indicating the urge for capital formation and growth potential of savings at the
       poorest level.

  f.   In terms of the experiences gained by FSP, the project should be replicated in
       other areas of Bangladesh.

(xix)  Lessons Learned. The lessons learned from FSP intervention have been (a)
       the poorest have been made bankable; (b) the poorest have obtained an
       identity as customers of banks; (c) the safety net arrangements included in the
       project have paved the way for beneficiaries to adopt the strategy of gradually
       eliminating extreme poverty and vulnerability; (d) the POs have gained
       significant knowledge that can enrich their attitudes toward working for the
       poorest; (e) FSP has been a capital- intensive project; hence, external finance
       and technical supports are imperative for such projects to address the needs of
       the poorest; (f) through savings and credit operations, the project has opened
       for the first time the scope of capital formation and/or access to resources,
       services, and facilities for the poorest;

            ANNEX 6. STAKEHOLDER WORKSHOP REPORT AND RESULTS

A stakeholder workshop took place during the ICR mission, attended by all of the 19
implementing POs and by PKSF staff. POs shared experiences and lessons learned with
the implementation of the FSP project. The key points were as follows:

    (i)    FSP came into existence as a catalyst to build the confidence of
           microfinance practitioners of Bangladesh to work with the bottom 10
           percent of the poor. There was a great deal of confusion, and skepticism
           among POs about the poorest of the poor. Through experience with FSP,
           POs are now much more confident in terms of extending micro-financial
           services to the poorest. As a result, all 19 of the POs are now also
           implementing the Ultra Poor Program of PKSF. The capacity- building
           component is well appreciated by all participants.

    (ii)   The magnitude of borrowers' development was very high compared to what
           can be achieved in conventional microcredit programs.

    (iii)  One of initial challenges involved relying on the repayment capacity of the
           poorest borrowers. Thus, the initial loan was set at around Tk. 500. The
           initial challenge was overcome by everyday experience. At the later stages
           of FSP, on average, the POs, without any hesitation, were able to raise the
           loan size to Tk. 6,500.

    (iv)   If guided properly, the ultra poor are even more regular payers than
           mainstream microcredit borrowers.

    (v)    Although members of the target group were encouraged and were used to
           saving out of their incomes, one of the major challenges was that they had
           used up all their savings during times of sudden disaster/bad times (e.g.,
           diseases) and they, thus, ended up with no savings for the future.

    (vi)   The social development services that were provided were tied with FSP
           (through PO cross-subsidies) and other programs used as catalysts for
           making the LIL successful. Some of the children of the borrowers are now
           studying in college, the cost of which is being borne by the UPP.

    (vii)  Sustainability of such programs can be ensured through continuous training
           of the poorest.

    (viii) Life pattern changes, such as dressing appropriately, changed a lot; even
           beggars could transform themselves into micro-enterprise owners at the end
           of FSP.

    (ix)   POs reiterated that, in order to reduce poverty, all of those involved should
           concentrate on the bottom-end people;

    (x)    Initially, lack of confidence in credit utilization and fear of not being able to
           pay on time caused groups to break up. Learning from the experience,
           mandatory orientation programs were arranged to build up the confidence of
           the mobilized members, who later ,succeeded in the mission;




                                           47

(xi)    Another lesson learned was the importance of health support through
        existing government programs as well as POs' own health support facilities.
        This support acted as a catalyst for building members' interest in the
        program. The participants thought that health services should be linked in
        some way with the micro-financial services to the poorest.

(xii)   Flexibility in repayment did not affect discipline. If targeting of
        beneficiaries is done properly, it will not affect other programs.

(xiii)  Only credit could not make a difference; it had to be linked to available
        safety-net programs.

(xiv)   Even though there was flexibility in terms of the ability to withdraw
        deposits, the loans were recovered in due time.

(xv)    To cover migration costs of the poorest, consumption loans under FSP were
        allowed in a limited number of cases on a pilot basis. Previously, there had
        been no source of financing available for the consumption needs of the
        poorest. Based on the FSP experience, a new product, consumption loans,
        has been introduced under PKSF's PRIME program.

(xvi)   POs believe that GOB or donors should consult and work collaboratively
        with them at the project's preparation stage. An example cited in this regard
        was that FSP initially did not take into consideration the fact that free health
        service and other social development services (awareness training, sanitation,
        family planning, education, etc.) should be included to give beneficiaries the
        initial feeling that they were being taken care of by the project intervention.
        POs' suggestions about this issue, made in stakeholders' workshops in 2002,
        were discussed during project appraisals and onward, significantly
        decreasing the possibility of failure of the project upfront. POs also
        mentioned that GO­NGO integration is needed in this regard.

(xvii)  Project failed to envisage the risk of manmade disasters that might affect the
        poorest; for example, a portion of the target population were affected by the
        drive by army-led joint forces of the government to demolish illegal
        structures (including slums and small businesses occupying vacant
        government land). Although this was a macro issue and the project had little
        to do with it, the developers, in the beginning should have thought about
        how the project would mitigate such risks.

(xviii) Social intervention costs by POs should be known. This requires deeper
        study.

(xix)   Flexibility combined with discipline is the key to success.

(xx)    More efforts had to be made in FSP for its poorest borrowers compared to
        regular clients under the RMC (rural microcredit) product/program.

(xxi)   Technical knowledge developed in respect to imparting IGA training,
        marketing/promoting of IGA products, etc. The expenses for the IGA
        promotional part were not captured in the project design. .

(xxii)  Not mere credit--Credit Plus is needed for the poorest.


                                        48

(xxiii) Another challenge was the borrowers' temporary migration from one place
        to another and settling in dispersed locations, unlike regular microcredit
        clients; this wandering involved encroaching government khas (vacant) land
        and living with uncertainty, for example. All of these challenges were
        overcome by putting extra effort into the project and undertaking a credit
        plus philosophy. Emphasis was given to imparting IGA training on demand;
        IGAs of different types involved sweets-making, carpentry, mechanical
        works etc., which are unconventional but useful and very much in demand
        in the communities in which the project was in effect.

(xxiv)  Creating linkages with the market is crucial. Providing the poorest with
        information on possible employers or markets for their products helps them
        to succeed.

1.0 Background


PKSF, an apex intermediary, has been making significant contributions to the reduction
of poverty by providing microcredit and other services to the poor. PKSF implements
microcredit programs through its Partner Organizations (POs). PKSF also provides
institutional development and capacity-building supports to the POs to help them achieve
sustainability. Various studies show that the poorest, approximately 12 million
individuals in 2.5 million households in Bangladesh, are yet to be reached by microcredit
programs. The reasons include the stringency of the rules of micro-finance institutions
(MFIs), peer screening and self-exclusion of the poorest, and the lack of suitable
microcredit products and the credit-plus services that they need at first. A brave and
innovative approach was needed to meet their needs. PKSF, with the financial assistance
of the International Development Agency (IDA)/ World Bank, piloted a project titled
`Financial Services for the Poorest' between 2003 and 2007 (primarily stipulated for
three years). The aim of the project was to find models of sustainable interventions for
reducing the number of the poorest by providing microcredit and other services to create,
enhance, and diversify their income and livelihoods.

2.0 Components of FSP

The project included four components:

2.1 Microcredit: The main component of the FSP project is the revolving fund for
microcredit. This fund was given to PKSF to forward to the POs for on-lending to the
individual poorest.

2.2 Capacity-Building of PKSF, POs, and Borrowers: This component is critical for
building capacity of PKSF, its POs, and the poorest beneficiaries of the project to ensure
successful implementation. Based on training needs assessment, the poorest people
received general orientation and income-generating training. The income-generation
training was of two kinds: for self-employment and for wage employment.

2.3 Disaster Fund for the Poor: PKSF was to retain a fund for each PO as a Disaster
Fund. It was to be kept in an interest-bearing account and used to compensate clients for
losses resulting from natural disasters and other industry- or sector-wide losses. The fund
was to be run under strict guidelines.

2.4 Monitoring and Evaluation: In order to test the basic hypothesis of the project ­ if
microcredit is given with needed flexibility, it can improve the welfare of the poor - five
basic issues were set to be monitored: (i) whether the program actually targeted the
poorest, (ii) why they joined the project, (iii) the types of social mobilization and non-
credit interventions provided, (iv) the costs and loan recovery rate, and (v) the
socioeconomic benefits for the participants.

** Availability of microcredit fund from the government (GOB) and needs of fund for capacity-building of
the beneficiaries under Microfinance for the Ultra Poor (Ultra Poor) Program, PKSF requested GOB and
IDA to transfer the rest of the amount to the capacity-building component. Later, GOB and IDA agreed to
permit the diversion of this portion of the fund to the Ultra Poor Program for capacity-building of its
beneficiaries.

3.0 Outcome/Achievement of Components:

3.1 Microcredit

Since the beginning of the project, PKSF has disbursed SDR 2.52 million to the POs, and
the POs have disbursed SDR 6.28 million to the beneficiaries.

3.1.1 Increase of Members: In 2002-2003, total members were 9,954; in 2003-2004,
39,998; in 2004-2005, 59,983; and in 2005-2006, 64,725. As of December 2007, there
were 37,712 members.

3.1.2 Increase of Borrowers: In 2002-2003, the project provided loans to 3,504 of the
poorest borrowers; in 2003-2004, 30,086; in 2004-2005, 49,317, in 2005-2006, 51,718.
As of December 2007, there were 28,965 borrowers.

3.2 Capacity-Building
3.2.1 Capacity-Building of PKSF:

3.2.1.1 PKSF set up a separate FSP unit for the overall implementation of the project and
for internal and external liaison.

3.2.1.2 Training, Project Management, MIS for Monitoring and Evaluation, Supervision
and Research Techniques, all FSP staff members; Identifying Beneficiaries through
Wealth-ranking Techniques, four FSP staff members; Research Methodology, Evaluation
Techniques, MIS, and Process Monitoring System, three mainstream staff members.




                                                      52

Five staff members of FSP and 19 from the mainstream of PKSF received training in
project management at AIT, Thailand, and DCCAP, Philippines. Also, one mainstream
staff member went on a site visit to the Philippines.

3.2.2 Capacity-Building of POs:
Institutional capacity was enhanced on two fronts. POs received subsidies in human
resources and their staffs received training in strengthening reporting, managing MIS and
AIS systems, and sharpening the monitoring system.

3.2.2.1 Every PO implementing the project, received a subsidy to employ five field
workers in 2002-2003 (or in the first year of the project), ten field workers in 2003-2004
(in the second year), and fifteen field workers and one supervisor in 2004-2005 (in the
third year). With one or two exceptions, these positions were filled. As there was no
further allocation, PKSF stopped the subsidy. But the POs retained all the staff members
recruited under the project; in some cases, they recruited more.

3.2.2.2 Until 31 December 2007, the reimbursed amount to the POs from PKSF was SDR
254,179 for subsidies in human resources.

3.2.2.3 Training was arranged for 19 supervisor-trainers, 19 accountant/ computer
operators, and 19 MIS officers in monitoring and supervision, maintaining accounts, and
MIS of FSP. A total of 267 fieldworkers in 19 POs were given foundation training.

3.2.2.4 Seventy coordinators, 789 branch managers, and 1,961 field workers of
Microcredit for the Ultra Poor Program in 85 POs received training.

3.2.2.5 FSP also sent eight PO staff for study tours to the Philippines to share
microfinance experiences. As logistic support, the POs were given motorcycles, bicycles,
computers, and furniture. SDR 60,885.77 was reimbursed to 19 implementing POs of the
project.

3.2.3 Capacity-Building of Borrowers:
The borrowers were given capacity-building support in two aspects: awareness and
income-generating training and emergency/disaster management.

3.2.3.1 As there was no major disaster, the fund established at the PO level was sufficient
to meet the needs. The fund allocated by the IDA/World Bank was redirected to capacity-
building because of the building of a separate Disaster Fund in PKSF and its POs under
the Livelihood Restoration Program (LRP) supported by IDA.

3.2.3.2 Three kinds of training were given to the borrowers: general orientation, income-
generating for self-employment, and income-generating for wage employment. A total of
10,276 borrowers received training for self-employment and 2,743 borrowers received
training for wage employment. More than 63,000 of the poorest people received general
orientation/social development training.
3.2.3.3 FSP also provided skills development training to 175,809 of the poorest people
under the UPP.


                                              53

3.3 Monitoring and Evaluation:
To monitor the five issues determined at the outset the project and to strengthen over all
research capability of PKSF, it was required to set up a separate research cell.

3.3.1 One researcher having a background in qualitative research and another researcher
with a quantitative background were appointed, along with a research associate. They
conducted periodic mini-studies.

3.3.2 A Research Working Group consisting of academics and experts in the
microfinance field was formed to guide the research activities of the project.

The research activities in PKSF, strengthened by the support provided to PKSF under the
FSP project, are still in effect. The research cell worked throughout the project.
Beginning in 2003, PKSF thought seriously about conceiving an independent think tank
in the field of microfinance that would conduct research and studies in that sector,
particularly that of PKSF. In early 2007, PKSF established its Institute of Microfinance
(InM) on its own campus.

3.3.3 Researchers from independent consulting firms conducted the main evaluation
studies. Eusuf & Associates conducted the midterm evaluation study. Narayan Chandra
Nath conducted a comparative study on financial services to the poorest offered by
various MFIs. The final evaluation study was conducted by BETS Consultancy Services
Ltd.

3.3.4 A total of SDR 40,194.76 has been partially spent on monitoring and evaluation
studies of the impact of the project.

3.3.5 The studies done by the internal resources of mainstream and FSP projects include,
among others, "Experience of Financial Services for the Poorest (FSP) Project" in the
first year of implementation, "Financial Services Program: Lessons Learned on Process
Management", "Selection Process of Area & Beneficiary Under Financial Services for
the Poorest Project", and a study on how to make the package of financial services for the
poorest a comprehensive one.

4.0 Project Objectives:

The broad purpose of the project was to make further contributions to poverty alleviation.
To achieve this goal, the specific objectives were:
(i) To increase outreach to the poorest.
(ii) To diversify the coverage of both loans and clients by extending financial services to
the poorest of the poor.
(iii) To enhance the capacity of PKSF and its POs through ID programs.
(iv) To achieve operational, financial, and institutional sustainability of PKSF and the
POs while serving the poorest.
(v) To piloting different delivery models to identify those that best suit the credit needs of
the poorest.



                                              54

(vi) To devise a credit model for the poorest that can be replicated.

5.0 Achievement of Objectives

5.1 Increase outreach to the poorest

5.1.1 During the project implementation, the POs achieved two significant landmarks --
extending financial services to the people who had previously never been deemed
creditworthy and accessing the remotest areas with the services where none before dared.

5.1.2 Of the total number of villages brought into the project, 923 were covered for the
first time by any microcredit program, whether of a PO, of PKSF, or of any MFIs.

5.2 Diversifying loans and clients while extending financial services to the poorest of
the poor.

The successful implementation of FSP has inspired PKSF to move to the forefront in
terms of diversifying its products for the poorest. Within two years and, most important,
before completion of the pilot, PKSF launched a more advanced product in the UPP.
Since then, PKSF has implemented more than half a dozen projects, completely or fully,
having to do with services for the poorest. The Microfinance Support Intervention for
Food Security for Vulnerable Group Development (FSVGD) and the Ultra Poor (UP)
Beneficiary Project, Programmed Initiatives for Monga Eradication (PRIME), and
PRIME-2 are full projects of this kind, whereas a portion of members in MFTS and
PLDP-II are included from the poorest segment of the population.

5.2.1 The Ultra Poor Program (Up-scaling): The Ultra Poor Program (UPP) introduced
more flexibility.

    (i) As of December 2007, 91 POs were implementing the program in 421 upazilas in
         62 districts of the country.

    (ii) The landmarks were reducing the cost of funds at both tracks ­ PKSF to PO and
         PO to borrowers, waiving all charges, and enhanced training activities.

    (iii)This program is now the largest targeted program in the country for the ultra poor.
         Through December 2007, 828,121 ultra poor had received credit support with
         SDR 71,858,218.41.

    (iv)The average loan size stands at SDR 49.16, with a loan repayment rate of 98.82
         percent.

    (v) A total of 175,834 beneficiaries have received training under the program. A total
         of 85 POs are implementing the program 62 in districts.

    (vi)Through this project, PKSF has attempted to address most aspects of the lives of
         the poorest; for example, education, housing assistance, etc. A pledge has been
         made to support the education of children of the ultra poor households.




                                             55

    (vii) Moreover, an initiative has been undertaken to provide housing loans with
        flexible and longer amortization periods and repayment schedules.

5.2.2 PRIME: In order to eradicate monga (seasonal food shortages concentrated in the
northern area) permanently, PKSF has launched PRIME. After a pilot in FY 2005-2006
in the Lamonirhat District of the Greater Ranpur, the program is being run in all five
districts of the Greater Rangpur.

5.2.2.1 Of 35 upazilas in the five districts, the program is now being implemented in 23
upazilas.

5.2.2.2 In the five districts of Greater Rangpur, 550,585 households were detected as
monga-affected (as per the survey in 2006 and 2007).

5.2.2.3 In terms of wealth-ranking and food security measures, 126,000 households have
been found to be severely affected.

5.2.2.4 A total of 115,000 of households have been covered by the Cash for Work
program, an attempt to ensure their subsistence by increasing purchasing power. In a
single day, as many as 86,000 families have been engaged in such works.

5.2.2.5 In two FYs, 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 , SDR 126,660.78 was disbursed as
disaster/emergency loans designed to meet immediate consumption needs of the ultra
poor to 10,078 households, and as flexible loans (from the UPP) SDR 2,166,432.71 was
given to 46,404 households.

5.2.2.6 Moreover, the member households were provided with support services important
for running their income-generating activities or transferring and diversifying their
technologies.

5.2.2.7 This program has a budget of Tk.15 million for skills enhancement of the ultra
poor who have been affected by monga.

5.2.3 PRIME-2: Toward rehabilitating the people most affected by the cyclone Sidr in the
southern five districts, PKSF has started this program, similar to the PRIME, which is
being implemented successfully in the north.

5.2.3.1 The specific objective is to give people subsistence funds by restoring their
purchasing power by involving them in `Cash for Work'.

5.2.3.2 On completion of the primary survey, 74 unions in 11 upazilas in five districts
have been identified for the program. With a budget of SDR 2,100,959.36, PKSF has
targeted bringing 38,551 households under this program. After rehabilitation, PKSF will
provide them with flexible microcredit for running IGAs.

5.2.4 FSVGD and the Ultra Poor (UP) Beneficiary Project: With the assistance of the
European Union for the capacity-building of ultra poor beneficiaries, this three-year
project (2007 to 2010) has been started with a budget of SDR 80,380.

5.2.4.1 The project has identified 109,000 former FSVGD members, of whom 71,000
have been enrolled in the UPP implemented by the POs of PKSF.

5.2.4.2 As of December 31, 2007, 9,453 former FSVGD members have received
microcredit and savings management training and 8,127 have been given skills training.

5.2.5 PLDP-II: This project is aimed at integrating poor people in livestock-related IGAs.

5.2.5.1 Under the project, 25 percent of the target beneficiaries are supposed to come
from the ultra poor segment of the population.

5.2.5.2 At present, the POs are implementing the project activities in 20 districts of the
country. SDR 162,109.41 has been disbursed to 364,614 borrowers. Among them 3,286
borrowers are ultra poor.

5.2.6 MFTS: With a similar objective to that of PLDP-II, this second project for
integrating the poor in the livestock sector with IFAD funds is being implemented.

5.2.6.1 The project provides for including 15 percent of the beneficiaries from the ultra
poor.

5.2.6.2 At present, 24 POs are working in 13 districts of the country. As of December
2007, 41,892 (cumulative) ultra poor have been included in the project.

5.2.7 Extension of services to the poorest of the poor

7.2.7.1 The project covers large groups of the poorest, particularly the disadvantaged
ones. When the project was fully mature in 2005-2006, the occupational/demographic
coverage of the project was 0.38 percent beggars, 25.51 percent daily laborers, .47
percent sex workers, 9.34 percent members of child-laborers' families, 6.60 percent
widows, 4.82 percent indigenous people, 5.68 percent separated women, 1.27 percent
domestic helpers, 1.76 percent divorcees, and 44.07 percent others.

5.2.7.2 The most fascinating aspect was that the percentage of loans of total disbursement
to the beggars was 4.46 percent during the inception year.

5.2.7.3 This trend of inclusion was aimed at increasing the outreach of clients in at least
three ways: bringing in the so far un-creditworthy people under the coverage of
microcredit, graduation of the poorest to mainstream microcredit programs, and an
overall increase in the number of the clients involved in microcredit.

5.2.7.4 The most fascinating aspect was that a good number of beggars were integrated
into productive income occupations.


                                               57

5.2.7.5 As per the final impact evaluation, 93.5 percent of the project's beneficiaries
reached incomes of more than 50 cents, while 83.4 percent earned more than a dollar a
day.

5.3 Enhancing the capacity of PKSF and its POs

5.3.1 Enhancement of PKSF's Capacity

5.3.1.1 The FSP unit, set up at PKSF with the support of the project, fulfilled its
responsibility in of aptly coordinating the project's implementation of the. The maturity
was such that although most of the personnel of the unit, recruited at the inception of the
project, moved to elsewhere later, the project performance was not damaged in any way.
Rather, existing staff and new recruits have handled matters for five years.

5.3.1.2 The training imparted to the staff was also a great help. The officers who received
training shone in their respective works.

5.3.1.3 The unit personnel performed all of the studies related to focus group discussions.
The first coordinator of the project conducted the first year-end progress study, and a
researcher who attended the research methodology sessions of the training later did a full
study on what was learned and on the experiences of the project.

5.3.2 Enhancement of POs' Capacity

7.3.2.1 The training given in Accounting Information System (AIS) and Management
Information System (MIS), supervision, and monitoring of the staff immediately paid
dividends. The program was innovative and flexible and targeted the poorest who were
not dealt with under microcredit programs. The staff who, in most cases were fresh, did
well, and overall activities were up to the mark.

5.3.2.2 The logistic support came as a great help in running the loan operations in
comparatively remote areas.

5.3.2.3 Keeping their MIS and AIS in computers with appropriate software significantly
helped the POs' capacity-building.

5.3.2.4 Many POs strengthened their research activities in collaboration with PKSF. In
some cases, they started research activities while implementing the FSP project.

5.4 Achieving operational, financial, and institutional sustainability of PKSF and the
POs while serving the poorest

5.4.1 It is important to mention that 24,514 of the poorest borrowers were admitted to
mainstream microcredit, and another 60 percent of 37,712 of the poorest borrowers are
now qualified for mainstream microcredit from the FSP project.



                                             58

5.4.2 Two large impact evaluation studies were conducted on the FSP project-- the
midterm evaluation in 2005 and the final evaluation in 2007. Both showed that PKSF and
the POs achieved operational and financial sustainability.

With the increase in the number of borrowers and in its portfolio, the project took off at
the end of the third year (end of 2004) and it achieved financial sustainability. Although
the subsidy for the staff ended after three years, the POs were able to retain the staff with
the project income. Again, as the project developed full momentum in the third year in
terms of human resources, logistics, outreach, and, more important, in operational income,
it worked with operational sustainability until the end.

5.4.2 The institutional development support also clicked well. The subsidy in human
resources and logistics contributed to the healthy performance of the POs.

5.4.3 A total of SDR 31,504.24 was provided to the POs as logistics support.

5.4.4 The lowering of the cost of funds from 4.5 to 1 percent in the UPP has contributed
to the attainment of sustainability.

5.5 Piloting different delivery models to identify those that suit the credit needs of
the poorest

5.5.1 Some financial products were piloted under the project: a credit system with
flexible grace periods and repayment frequency; a savings system with flexible amounts,
frequencies and withdrawals, and flexible attendance requirements at the group meetings.

5.5.2 At the midway point, the cost of funds for the borrowers was reduced from 15 to
12.5 percent.

5.5.3 The flexibility attracted the borrowers in all aspects and it erased the risks perceived
prior to launching the project.

5.5.4 Although the members were allowed to deposit even Tk. 1 (SDR 0.0092), they
voluntarily deposited larger amounts, up to Tk. 10 (SDR 0.092) a week.

5.5.5 The MFIs gave beneficiaries ample flexibility about attendance. Even one
attendance a month was allowed.

5.5.6 The most important achievement, although repayment in most cases was flexible,
was 99 percent repayment rate from the borrowers to the POs, as shown in the final
evaluation.

5.6 Devising a credit model for the poorest that can be replicated
5.6.1 The most important achievement of the pilot project was confirming the hypothesis
that microcredit, if delivered appropriately, could improve the welfare of the extremely
poor. The FSP proved that by introducing important flexibility to mainstream microcredit



                                             59

programs, the condition of the poorest could be improved and they could become
creditworthy in a modified microcredit program.

5.6.2 The partner MFIs also have proved their capacity to deliver innovative and distinct
microcredit products, a task that required a more careful approach in every aspect of
implementation, ranging from selection to rehabilitating participants in appropriate
enterprises and upgrading the matured participants toward mainstream programs like
Rural Microcredit. In this way, they have proved wrong the apprehension of risk
perceived when initiating the project.

5.6.3 The partner MFIs practiced most of the prescribed flexibility norms, introduced
others, and invested their own resources in the social development of the poorest. The
apprehension perceived before the launch about risks relating to `MFI's readiness' did
not prevail.

5.6.4 The targeting was very accurate, as, in most cases, the income of the households,
having an average 3.8 members, was less than SDR 32.23 a month. As a person having
an income of 0.63 SDR a day is considered to be among the poorest, the FSP participants
were the poorest of the poor.

5.6.5 People outside the target group who were erroneously included in the project were
screened out and rehabilitated into other microcredit programs/projects.

5.6.6 The Nath study , which was conducted using data up to June 2004, reveals that on
average, 83.19 percent of the poorest who received training could use it in their
respective businesses. The utilization rate was greater in training for income generation
through self-employment (85.60 percent). The utilization rate in training for wage
employment was 80.78 percent. The same study revealed that 8.3 percent of the trained
beneficiaries imparted training to their people, who undertook similar activities for
income.

5.6.7 The last and perhaps the most important finding is the change in attitude, approach,
and capacity of the poorest as they gained access to financial services: credit and savings.
By taking advantage of credit, other things remaining the same, they improved not only
their food security, housing condition, and asset base, but also developed the habit of
saving and repayment (regular in more than 97 percent of the cases). Eusuf & Associates,
in the same study, found that the rate of repayment of the poorest borrowers was 100
percent. This easily nullifies any apprehension about their "character."

5.6.8 Two facts became clear in the total process: (i) the poorest are creditworthy, but still
may not be bankable in the existing norms of formal financial institutions, although they
have the potential to use the loans for income generation, and (ii) a microcredit program
for the poorest can be institutionally and financially viable.

6.0 Problems Faced During Implementation

While the project implementation shows significant achievements, it nonetheless faced a
few problems, which were as follows:

6.1 Dilemma in beneficiary selection
There was a dilemma at the starting point to decide whether to adopt a holistic approach
or an individualistic or area-specific approach in the selection of members. Ultimately,
the moderate second option of an area-specific path prevailed.

6.2 Late start of training
For some unavoidable reasons, including a lack of availability of resource persons to
impart training in income generating activities and belated training needs assessments,
training was delayed.

6.3 Conservative loan size
About the size of loans, the project was a little conservative in the first year. It took a
little time to overcome the inertia. In the second year, the loan size developed real
momentum.

6.4 Three persistent problems
The project was not able to resolve three problems: 1) full implementation of the disaster
management fund, 2) micro-insurance, and 3) strengthening of the research cell of PKSF.
Of these, the micro-insurance program could not be started, as no service-providing
agency agreed to cover the services needed for the beneficiaries of the project.

6.5 Linking the beneficiaries to employers
The MFIs faced problems in linking the trained beneficiaries to employment. The same
thing happened even in the case of beneficiaries who had been trained while providing
them in any micro enterprise run by microcredit capital.

6.6 No allocation for social development fund
The POs provided social development services to the poorest. As there was no allocation
for them from the apex organization (as there was no allocation in the project plan), so, in
many cases, the supply could not keep pace with the demand.

6.7 Overloaded field workers
Responding to demands from the field, in most cases the POs included more members
than stipulated. This, in some cases, created anomalies. First, as the human resources
subsidy was time-bound and limited, it created an extra burden on field level personnel.
Second, in one or two cases, the POs employed more personnel than prescribed. Third,
this tended to instigate discrimination in the labor market.




                                              61

6.8 Sustainability problems in the beginning
In the starting years, as the POs were struggling to achieve financial and operational
sustainability, they had to subsidize the project by diverting funds from other projects.
This created problems for the smaller POs, as their surplus reserve-bases were not strong.

7.0 Lessons Learned

7.1 The poorest are creditworthy
The poorest are creditworthy if the products are designed with due account taken of their
socioeconomic and other conditions and if needed flexibility is brought into the existing
microcredit products/programs. Eligibility criteria, savings, loans, repayment systems,
training, social development and safety-net services, skills, enhancement, may be the
main areas.

7.2 Poor capitalizes a small chance
The income potential of the poorest can be tapped through motivation and by taking into
consideration the realities of their lives. Flexibility that was brought into the project was
operational, not financial, in nature. Even with that, most of the beneficiaries were able to
increase their incomes by becoming integrated into income activities.

7.3 Inherited occupations suit the poor well
The income activities with which the poorest have any sort of legacy or orientation are
better suited for them.

7.4 The larger the MFIs, the better
The larger the portfolio of the POs, the greater is their strength to provide services for the
poorest.

7.5 Altruism is not sustainable
Subsidy and charity cannot be long-term therapy for rescuing the poorest and the
agencies working for them from the poverty trap. An area like social development
services by the POs for the poorest deserves allocation.

7.6 As a long-term policy
Allocation for social development services is essential if one considers the realities of life
of the poorest and is keen toward offering them a comprehensive package of services to
eradicate their poverty.

7.7 Insurance should be put in place
Given that most of the poorest are vulnerable to disaster and emergencies in their
ecological and other realities, disaster management funds and micro-insurance should be
put in place with needed preparedness as soon as possible.




                                               62

7.8 Access to Information and Technology
Access to information and technology for the poorest should be increased. Information
will help them obtain needed production inputs, job opportunities, and markets for their
products.

7.9 A Project should be supported by an appropriate knowledge base
As the realities of the lives of the poorest are not the same as those of the people who are
integrated into the mainstream of society, so their needs are not the same. Solving these
problems, in most cases, involves a case-specific approach. It entails innovation and
diversification while a product or project is being designed to serve the poorest. Thus, a
sound knowledge base is needed in order to effectively address their problems. Only
good support in terms of research and development can help this and a host of similar
others.

7.10 Coordination at all levels is needed
The eradication of poverty of the poorest people who basically have to rely on a welfare
system needs the concerted efforts of all. Cooperation and collaboration among the
interventions and all stakeholders, including the government, NGOs, private
organizations, development partners, civil society, and others, is essential.

8.0 Bank and Borrower Performance

8.1 Bank's performance
The Bank, which refers to World Bank, the sponsor of the project, has a global strategy to
finance various experimental/pilot projects under the LIL program.

8.1.1 As far as the FSP is concerned, the Bank aptly identified a gross area of the project
for the poorest. After PKSF's exposing of the idea of such a project in the curtain raiser
workshop in Dhaka in 2002, the Bank contributed immensely, both directly and indirectly
to formulating and designing the project in a matured form.

8.1.2 The various appraisal missions from the Bank midway during the course of
implementation gave the project needed guidelines and inputs to allow it to succeed.

8.1.3 The Bank's enthusiasm for the project was proved as it extended its tenure, seeing
its efficacy and giving PKSF ample liberty to divert the money from surpluses to deficit
areas.

8.1.4 The Bank's supervision and monitoring activities unquestioningly accrued credit in
the aspect of streamlining the constraints which stood in the way at one point. A true
partnership arose. The Bank showed a collaborative attitude, even in the areas that were
not feasible to achieve in the given situation.

8.2 Overall Bank performance
The overall performance was highly satisfactory.



                                               63

8.3 Borrower's performance
The performance of the Borrower, which mainly refers to PKSF for this project, can be
termed simply excellent. Through its prudence in designing and formulating the project
and its effective implementation, PKSF proved wrong all the apprehensions that had been
perceived before launching the project.

8.3.1 PKSF proved its worth by acting in a timely manner in forwarding the on-lending
funds to the POs for delivery to the individual poorest to help them create or enhance
income.

8.3.2 The recovery rate in the credit operation of the project in both tracks--PKSF to POs
and POs to individual borrowing poorest people--was more than 99 percent.

8.3.3 PKSF also proved its worth as a borrower by disbursing the money in appropriate
areas. It did not hesitate to declare surplus funds in particular areas and identify the areas
where more funds were necessary in a forward-looking attitude.

8.3.4 PKSF was prompt to convince the Bank about extending the tenure of the project,
conceding to the demands of the poorest for financial resources and contingent services
from such a project.

8.4 Borrower's overall performance
The overall performance of the Borrower can be rated highly satisfactory.

9.0 Achievement of development objectives

The project had, overall, there development objectives, which it attained successfully. We
can elaborate on these in brief in the following:

9.1 Delivery models
Pilot delivery models for reaching services to the poorest. The FSP proper and about half
a dozen projects (initiated in the last six years), which can be termed new generation
projects, are testimonies to having achieved this objective.

9.2 Credit model
By bringing some operational flexibility to the mainstream microcredit programs, the
project reached the lowest income group of the population and proved that the poorest
can also be worthy clients of financial services.

9.3 Contributing to the lives of the poorest
The three terminal evaluation studies conducted on the project showed positive changes
in the lives of the poorest borrowers. They showed in two broad dimensions. The first
was the difference made in the lives of the poorest through the interventions. The second
was the change in the lives of the poorest in given periods through interventions and
without interventions.

Borrower's Comments on draft ICR: Borrower had no comments on The draft ICR
prepared by the Bank.
