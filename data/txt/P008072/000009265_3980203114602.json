The project\n            includes the construction of three hyroelectric power\n            plants, rehabilitation of existing diesel engine generating\n            plants, extension of subtransmission and distribution\n            facilities, a loss reduction program, a training program and\n            engineering/consultant services. The project will reduce the\n            country's dependence on imported fuels by about 34,500\n            barrels of fuel per year, resulting in foreign exchange\n            savings equivalent to US$1,300,000 annually.
