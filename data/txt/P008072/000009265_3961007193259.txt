MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on St. Vincent and The Grenadines
Power Project (Credits 1479-STV and SF 21-STY)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on the St. Vincent and The Grenadines -
Power Project (Credit 1479-STV and SF 21-STY) prepared by the Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office, with Part It contributed by the Borrower.
This project helped a small island resolve a shortage of power identified in 1981 by
shifting from diesel generation, then expected to cost more after the recent oil crisis, to hydro
generation exploiting a local river. The IDA credit of US$5 million equivalent was approved on
May 22, 1984. It was fully disbursed except for a minor amount. Co-financing was provided by
four aid agencies: Canadian International Development Agency (CDN$10.7 million), Caribbean
Development Bank (US$4.5 million), European Investment Bank (US$2.8 million equivalent) and
USAID (US$7.5 million). The utility contributed 10.4% toward project financing.
The project outcome was successful both on the physical component and on institution
building. The objective of providing additional capacity was met. The main project component,
three hydro units, was commissioned in 1988, one year ahead of schedule. The objective of
improving efficiencies was also met. The distribution losses system-wide were reduced by two-
thirds to a low 7.8% in 1992. Training and technical assistance contributed to these positive
results. All covenants were fully met. The two caveats to this success story were the crowding-
out of a small organization by several aid agencies with differing requirements and the imposition
of a time-consuming assets revaluation exercise of limited relevance.
The PCR gives a satisfactory account of the reasons for the successful project outcome.
Overali, the project outcome is rated as satisfactory, its sustainability as likely, and its institutional
impact as substantial.
The project may be audited.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
POWER PROJECT (CREDITS 1479-STV AND SF 21-STy)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) is for a Power Project in St. Vincent and the
Grenadines for which IDA Credits of SDR 4.7 million, composed of SDR 0.7 million of regular
IDA funds and SDR 4.0 million of IDA Special Funds, were approved on May 22 1984. The
borrower was the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines who relent the Credits to St.
Vincent Electricity Services Ltd. (VINLEC). The Credits became effective on February 14, 1985
and were closed on June 30, 1993, two years behind schedule. The Credits were fully disbursed,
except for SDR 268,375.50, which was canceled. The last disbursement was on February 27, 1992.
In addition to IDA, the Power Project was co-financed by Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA), Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), European Investment Bank (EIB) and
USAID.
The PCR was prepared by the Trade, Finance, Industry and Energy Operations Division of
Department II, of Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office. It is based, inter alia, on
the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit and Project Agreements, supervision reports,
correspondence between the Association and the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda.
This report contains Parts I and HI prepared by the Bank and Part I prepared by the
Borrower. Part II reflects the Borrower's perspective of the project's implementation
achievements and related difficulties.

Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.  In 1981, St.Vincent Electricity Services (VINLEC), which has an exclusive license to
operate all generation, transmisson and distribution facilities in St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
was faced with a shortage of generating capacity. About two thirds of electricity demand was met
through diesel generation. Government was concerned about sharp increases in imported fuel
prices and, following the recommendations of a feasibility study financed by UNDP, with the Bank
as executing agency, sought to base VINLEC's long term generation program on the development
of the Cumberland hydroelectric scheme. In addition to a shortage of generating capacity,
VINLEC's diesel plant needed upgrading, and there was a need to reduce excessive transmission
and distribution losses. Government requested the assistance of the Bank in financing a Project
to address the foregoing. The Bank took a leading role in developing a financing plan for the
Project. In addition to IDA Credits of SDR4.7 million (US$5 million equivalent), other finance
approved for the Project amounted to Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) US$4.5 million,
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) CDN$10.7 million, European Investment
Bank (EIB) US$2.8 million equivalent and United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) US$7.5 million) (para. 2.02).
Obiectives
2.   The project objectives were to (i) meet energy generation requirements through 1994 (ii)
substantially reduce petroleum product imports; (iii) improve the quality of electricity services; (iv)
reduce the level of system distribution losses; and (v) improve VINLEC's management and staff
skills (para. 3.01).
Implementation Experience
3.   The main project component, the three Cumberland hydro units, was commissioned in mid
1988 more than a year ahead of schedule. The project loss reduction program was extended to
cover VINLEC's entire network. The Project was substantially completed in mid 1991. The final
Credit disbursement was on February 27 1992. VINLEC's implementation performance was very
good (para. 5.02).



(iii)
Results
4.   The project met the objective of providing additional generating capacity. It was
necessary to advance the purchase of an additional generating unit to 1991, however, as
demand exceeded appraisal expectations. The loss reduction program was very successful,
and losses were reduced from about 26% in 1983 to 7.8% in 1992. The rehabilitation of
diesel units was successful in improving the reliability and operational efficiency of the units.
Overall, however, the project benefits are expected to be significantly less than expected.
The principal reasons for this are: (i) the anticipated value of fuel savings through hydro
instead of diesel generation are expected to be significantly lower than anticipated as,
contrary to widely held expectations in 1983, real fuel prices declined during the subsequent
period; (ii) based on actual river flows, output from the hydro plants will not exceed 70% of
estimates (paras. 6.01, 6.02, and 6.04).
Sustainability
5.   VINLEC operational efficiency is good, and has been strengthened by training
conducted through the Caribbean Regional Electricity Utilities Corporation (CARILEC) as
well as the project training component. This is expected to continue, especially given the
importance that the company gives to staff training (paras. 6.05 and 7.01).
Findings and Lessons Learned
6.   The main findings and lessons learned are:
(i)  In the case of small organizations every effort should be made to keep the
number of lenders involved in project financing to a minimum. The involvement
of five lending agencies and four major procurement contracts placed an
inordinate administrative burden on VINLEC (para. 10 (a)).
(ii)  Discretion should be used in designing asset revaluation covenants for small
organizations so as to reduce the administrative burden (para. 10 (b)).

2.   Background
2.01    St. Vincent Electricity Services Ltd. (VINLEC), a government owned entity in which
the Commonwealth Development Corporation had a controlling interest up to 1984, has an
exclusive license to operate all generation, transmission and distribution facilities and to sell
electricity throughout St.Vincent and the Grenadines. In 1981, the electricity supply demand
balance had become critical. Firm generating capacity was 5,860KW while the system coincident
peak demand reached 5,100KW. Daily load shedding and system outages were common.
2.02    Responding to this, Government requested technical assistance from UNDP for a
feasibility study for a hydroelectric scheme at the Cumberland site. Fuel prices had increased
substantially in the previous years, and these increases were expected to continue. It was
considered that this trend would enhance the viability of an hydroelectric project. The Bank
acted as executing agency for the feasibility study which was carried out by Shawinigan
Engineering (Canada). The study, which was approved by Government, the Bank and UNDP in
August 1983, recommended that the Cumberland Hydroelectric scheme be developed as soon as
possible. In addition VINLEC's diesel plant needed upgrading, and there was a need to reduce
excessive transmission and distribution losses. Government requested IDA assistance in the
implementation of VINLEC's 1985-1990 power expansion program, which included the
construction of three small hydroelectric generating units, diesel plant rehabilitation and a loss
reduction program. In addition to IDA Credits of SDR4.7 million (US$5 million equivalent),
other finance approved for the Project amounted to Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)
US$4.5 million, Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) $7.8 million, European
Investment Bank (EIB) US$2.8 million equivalent and United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) US$7.5 million. CDB, EIB, IDA and USAID finance was onlent by
Government to VINLEC. CIDA finance was provided as a grant to Government and passed to
VINLEC as equity.

3.   Project Objectives and DescriRtion
3.01     Project Objectives: The project objectives were to (i) meet energy generation
requirements through 1994; (ii) substantially reduce petroleum product imports; (iii) improve the
quality of electricity services; (iv) reduce the level of system distribution losses and (v) improve
VINLEC's management and staff skills.
3.02     Program Description: The project consisted of VINLEC's entire 1985-89 investment
program and included the following:
(a) Generation
Construction of three hydroelectric power plants at the Cumberland river with a
total capacity of about 3.4 MW.

-3-
4.   Project Design and Organization:
4.01     VINLEC was responsible for project implementation and engaged an expatriate to
act as project manager. Consultants were engaged for the engineering and supervision of the
construction of the Cumberland hydroelectric scheme.
5. Project Implementation
5.01     Credit Effectiveness and Project Startup: Credit effectiveness was postponed to
February 14, 1985, which was about five months beyond the date specified in the Credit
Agreements. Final delays related to the effectiveness conditions concerning the conveyance
to VINLEC of the land required for the hydro schemes and the finalization of the onlending
agreements. Considering that there were five lending agencies involved, the delays were not
excessive.
5.02     Implementation Schedule: Implementation generally proceeded satisfactorily.
There were five lending agencies involved. This caused VINLEC to be overburdened by the
task of coordinating the work of a number of contractors, and of resolving disputes about the
scope of their responsibility. Added to this, was the time consuming task of dealing with the
different procurement rules of the lending agencies. The main project component, the three
Cumberland hydro units, was commissioned in mid 1988 more than a year ahead of
schedule. However, in 1991, there were serious failures in the hydro units which required
repairs and caused a loss of output. It was thought that the problem had been remedied, but
early 1993 VINLEC discovered excessive wear on the hydro units. Electricite de France has
been engaged to diagnose the cause of the problem and their findings are expected during
1994. The problem is expected to be satisfactorily resolved, but responsibility has not been
settled. Rehabilitation of the three diesel units at Cane Hall was completed in 1986. The loss
reduction program was extended to cover VINLEC's entire network. The project was
substantially complete by mid 1991. The closing date of the project was extended by two
years to June 30, 1993, mainly to permit the technical assistance component of the project to
be extended to include technical assistance related to system control and automation of the
remote hydro stations, and complete the procurement and installation of additional
transformers and remote sensing equipment provided by CIDA.
5.03     Project Costs: The final project costs are estimated at US$32.71 million compared
to the SAR estimate of US$30.78 million. The difference, which was financed through
VINLEC's internal cash generation, is mainly attributable to additional distribution
extensions and the expansion of the loss reduction program.
5.04     Credit Allocation: The original and actual disbursements by category are shown in
Part III (Section 5(C)).



-4-
6.  Project Results
6.01    Project Objectives: The project met the objective of providing additional
generating capacity. It was necessary, however, to advance the purchase of an additional
diesel unit to 1991 because demand exceeded the appraisal estimates. The loss reduction
program was very successful and losses were reduced from about 26% in 1983 to 7.8% in
1992. The rehabilitation of the diesel units was completed early in project implementation
and, as a result, the units improved in efficiency and reliability.
6.02     Physical Results: The major project component, the Cumberland hydro project,
has an installed capacity of 3,694 KW compared to the SAR estimate of 3,370 KW.
However, in planning the project, the task of projecting river flow estimates was handicapped
by the short period of historical data available, and river flows were overestimated. Actual
flows will only be adequate to support an average potential annual output of 14,030 MWh,
about 69% of the anticipated output (Part III, Table 4).
6.03    Financial Performance: 1985-1992 actual and SAR financial statements are
presented in Part III, Annex 1. 1992 kWh sales were about 46% higher than the SAR
forecast reflecting sustained sales growth, and VINLEC's operating income was positive
throughout the period. Four tariff increases were made during project implementation, and
the 1992 tariff levels, averaging about 23.3 US cents per kWh, are among the highest in the
region and high by world standards. Despite these increases, and reasonable, but
unavoidably high expense levels, VINLEC was unable to meet the Project Agreement rate of
return requirements on annually revalued assets. However, VINLEC's managed its limited
cash resources well. Despite the need for non-project capital spending, including additional
generating capacity to meet increased demand, VINLEC was able to finance about 21% of its
capital spending between 1985 and 1992 from internal cash generation.
6.04    Internal Rate of Return: The internal rate of return on VINLEC's 85-92
investment program has been reestimated at about 6.9% compared to the SAR estimate of
10%. The principal reasons for the lower internal rate of return are:
(i) Based on present fuel prices, the value of the anticipated fuel savings resulting
from the construction of the hydroelectric plant will be much lower than
anticipated. In 1983, it was generally expected that fuel prices would continue to
increase. However, prices have declined substantially in real terms since then.
(ii) Although the generating capacity and cost of the Cumberland hydroelectric scheme
are not significantly different from the original estimates, the average potential
annual output in MWh will not exceed 70% of estimates (para. 6.02).
6.05    Institutional Performance: The standard of VINLEC's general management and
the management of project implementation was excellent. The project training program was
used mainly for training associated with the operation of the hydroelectric facilities and for
power system management. Most of VINLEC's training during project implementation was
conducted through CARILEC (Caribbean Regional Electricity Utilities Corporation). Staff



at all levels were trained through courses conducted locally and regionally by professional
trainers. The training has been successful in improving on-the-job performance.
7. Project Sustainability
7.01     VINLEC plans to maintain the quality of its staff performance through the
continuation of staff training and staff recruitment. The operation of the project facilities is
expected to continue to be of a good standard.
8. Bank Performance
8.01     The Bank played an important role in assisting Government and VINLEC by acting
as executing agency for the project feasibility study and in the development of the project
financing plan. There were no major problems during project construction and Bank
missions adequately monitored the progress of the Project.
8.02     VINLEC was unable to develop a satisfactory methodology for annually revaluing
its fixed assets as required under the Project Agreement. Finally, in 1993, consultants were
employed to conduct an asset revaluation study.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01     VINLEC performed well in monitoring the progress of the project, and promptly
taking all the measures needed for successful project implementation.
10. Lessons Learned
10.01    The main lessons that can be learned are:
(a) In the case of small organizations every effort should be made to keep the number
of co-lenders to a minimum. Five lending institutions were involved in financing
the Project, each with its own procurement and reporting procedures (para 5.02).
This placed an inordinate administrative burden on a small company and diverted
staff effort from operational matters.
(b) In view of low inflation in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, it would probably have
been better, and less time consuming, if the covenant in the Project Agreement
requiring annual revaluations of VINLEC's fixed assets (para 8.02) for the
determination of its rate of return had, instead, required revaluations when
circumstances required it to maintain the company's financial viability.

11. Project Relationships
11.01    Good relationships were established between the Bank and VINLEC at an early
stage of project processing, and these were maintained throughout. Relationships between
Government and the Bank were also conducted in a cooperative spirit, and this was
especially helpful in the stages of loan processing up to Board approval.
12. Consulting Services
12.01    Consultant services for engineering and supervision of construction of the hydro
project, project management, and for the implementation of the loss reduction scheme had an
important role in the successful implementation of the project.
13. Project Documentation and Data
13.01    The Project Agreement was adequate for achieving the project objectives. The
appraisal report and supervision reports were helpful in the preparation of the completion
report. VINLEC also provided important data.



PART II
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1. Summary
1.1 The project fell short of the objective of meeting energy demand growth and of
stemming petroleum product imports entirely through investment in hydroelectric
plant. However it was successful in effecting early improvement in customer
satisfaction with the quality of electricity services and long term improvement in
the efficiency of VINLEC's transmission and distribution systems. In particular,
the project initiated a general upgrading of VINLEC's capability to maintain high
performance standards.
1.2 These performance improvements have proved to be sustainable. They will
provide an indefinite benefit to the country if protected. VINLEC therefore
recommends that the Bank include and explicitly detail institutional capability
improvements and performance standards where required in future lending
programmes to utilities.
2. Project Preparation and Investment Decisions
2.1 The Bank and other financing agencies became involved when the national
economy was already badly affected by frequent power shortages. Petroleum fuel
prices had already escalated and were predicted to increase further. The project
consultants were therefore encouraged to focus on solutions which would at the
same time:
i) Meet demand growth
ii) Minimize petroleum imports
iii) Maximize the project IRR
Working under time constraints the consultants recommended, as a complete
solution, full development of the most promising hydroelectric site, in a report
characterized by:
a) low demand growth based on pessimistic local and international
econometric projections;
b) continuation of historical daily demand patterns despite indications of
change;
c) calculation of stream flows (and hence generating capability) due to lack
of recorded data.



- 8 -
VINLEC was eventually obliged to find additional financing, during project
implementation, for the installation of new diesel plant to:
i)  satisfy demand growth well above the predicted levels
ii) maintain reliability of supply, especially in dry season. This requirement
continues long after project completion since the limited water storage
that may be economically incorporated in this type of hydroelectric
development does not allow full output over the duration of the peak
demand periods that have since emerged.
2.2 VINLEC recommends that supply reliability criteria be given equal importance
with economic criteria in designing Bank financed projects in the electricity supply
sector. Where various supply options exist the one that best guarantees sustained
reliability at least cost should be favored even at the expense of a slightly
diminished IRR.
In cases of doubt it is better to err on the side of reliability as the consequences to
national economy may otherwise be severe.
3. Project Implementation
3.1 The arrangements made for project implementation and supervision proved to be
adequate in that completion was affected generally on time and within budget.
However the following improvements might have been made.
3.2 It was particularly onerous for VINLEC to satisfy the different needs of five
separate lending agencies as to procurement, sourcing of contracts, disbursement,
reporting, project monitoring and supervision procedures.
3.3 Implementation of the hydroelectric plant component of the project was
complicated by the need to supervise and co-ordinate the work of four separate
contractors instead of a single prime contractor. The contractors displayed varying
levels of experience and competence.
3.4 Claims for delay and extra costs had to be subsequently resolved, arising in part
from the difficulty of co-ordinating the interface between contracts.
3.5 VINLEC recommends that the Bank, as co-ordinator of future multi-donor projects,
seek to have all finance contributed to a single pool to which a single set of
procurement and disbursement procedures would apply. VINLEC also
recommends that a single set of reporting and project supervision procedures
acceptable to all lenders be required from the implementing agency. These
measures are especially desirable in cases where the implementing agency is
institutionally weak.



- 9-
4. Implementation Schedule
4.1 The time required for construction of the hydroelectric plant was well estimated.
However the time required for transmission and distribution line rehabilitation and
for effective power loss reduction was under-estimated, and errors (e.g in selection
of materials) were sometimes made in an attempt to compress all the work into the
project schedule.
4.2 VINLEC suggests that, where wholesale deterioration of lines has occurred over 20
years or more, it would be more practicable to contemplate a 10 year rehabilitation
programme than a 5 year one, in circumstances where the work must be done in-
house by the local utility.

(IERR)                      10%                    6.9%
1.  The SAR estimate was based on VINLEC's 1985-1989 investment program. The
program was estimated to yield benefits over a 50 year period.
2.  In reestimating the IERR, a similar methodology was used. As the program was
implemented between 1985 and 1993, this period was used.
3.  Costs and benefits were recalculated using 1985 prices.



- 14 -
4.  The reestimated rate of return is lower than the SAR forecast because of two principal
factors: (i) based on current fuel prices, which have dropped in real terms since 1983, the
benefits from fuel savings are expected to be less than anticipated; (ii) average energy
(MWh) produced by the hydro generation units is limited by river flows to less than 70% of
that originally anticipated.
5.  Another factor contributing to the lower rate of return was that rate increases between
1984 and 1992 were insufficient to maintain tariffs in real terms.
