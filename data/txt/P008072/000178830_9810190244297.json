       products, improve the quality of electricity services,\n            reduce the level of the system's distribution losses\n            and improve management and staff skills. The project\n            includes the construction of three hyroelectric power\n            plants, rehabilitation of existing diesel engine generating\n            plants, extension of subtransmission and distribution\n            facilities, a loss reduction program, a training program and\n            engineering/consultant services. The project will reduce the\n            country's dependence on imported fuels by about 34,500\n            barrels of fuel per year, resulting in foreign exchange\n            savings equivalent to US$1,300,000 annually. It will supply\n            a reliable and efficient source of power for the\n            country's development."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
