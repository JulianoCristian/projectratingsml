"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The overall purpose of the proposed Iran\n            Urban Upgrading and Housing Reform Project (UUHRP) is to\n            facilitate the transition to a market-led housing sector in\n            Iran, while improving current living conditions for low, and\n            moderate income households. To achieve the above, a three\n            phase Adaptable Program Loan was prepared and is spread over\n            a period of twelve years. The key development objectives of\n            this project (APL1) are to (i) improve the living conditions\n            in under-serviced neighborhoods in up to five provincial\n            capital cities and; (ii) prepare the systems, capacity, and\n            regulatory foundation and initiate market based housing\n            sector reforms. The Project objectives will be achieved\n            through three main components: (i) urban upgrading and\n            community enabling programs in up to 5 selected cities; (ii)\n            technical assistance for housing sector reforms; and, (iii)\n            technical assistance and capacity building for project implementation."}, "docdt": "2004-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
