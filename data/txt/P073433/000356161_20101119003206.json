were as follows: outcomes\n            were unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and the\n            borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: in project design there is a need\n            to be sensitive to the institutional capacity of the\n            country. If it lies on the lower end of the spectrum,\n            complex or ambitious project design will not be feasible\n            within that context as the learning curve maybe too steep.\n            Systems in place are not effective if not exercised,\n            especially for problematic projects in the portfolio. The\n            project would have done better if there had been fewer\n            cities with suitable measurement mechanisms which informed\n            on the progress of the pilots and allowed for adjustments\n            accordingly. It is important to assess the need to\n            restructure the project earlier rather than later. If the\n            extenuating circumstances of the project justify a full or\n            partial restructuring, or a loan amount cancellation,\n            reducing or omitting the scope of component/sub-component,\n            action should be pursued effectively by the project team in\n            a timely manner. It is important that the Bank understands\n            and serves the client's needs when there has been\n            little previous interaction by preparing upfront capacity\n            building on Bank's processes and procedures. The\n            project faced major difficulties and delays in salary\n            payments to its staff as they were financed through the Government."}, "docdt": "2010-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
