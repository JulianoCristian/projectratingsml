"The Low Income Housing Project will\n            support the Government's effort to narrow the living\n            conditions' gap between the formal, and informal\n            settlements in capital cities in Iran, and, improve the\n            performance of the housing sector, through a long-term\n            program of investment, and capacity building. However, and\n            though in the long-run the project will provide\n            environmental benefits, during construction some subprojects\n            may potentially have adverse environmental impacts. To this\n            end, an environmental screening will be undertaken at the\n            early stages of implementation, to identify adversity, and\n            propose mitigation measures as agreed in the environmental\n            management plans. Roads rehabilitation works will\n            potentially cause clogging of natural drainage channels, and\n            disturb storm water drainage; it is thus proposed to\n            maintain ditches, and provide drainage facilities, to be the\n            responsibility of contractors, and municipalities,\n            respectively. Likewise, it will be the contractor's\n            responsibility to appropriately dispose of construction\n            wastes, and implement dust control measures, such as water\n            spraying construction surfaces, and dirt roads, while it\n            shall be the municipalities responsibility to inform, and\n            coordinate with the appropriate government agency, should\n            unknown archaeological finds occur. To minimize cross\n            contamination of sewage and water lines due to pressure\n            differentials, and leaks, as well as possible water\n            reductions during construction of the water supply and\n            wastewater networks, the Water and Wastewater Company should\n            coordinate with each agency, and review the area's\n            water balance. Municipalities, and the community shall be\n            responsible during schools construction, to avoid\n            encroachment following an adequate sites location, that\n            ensures compliance with urban planning, and appropriate\n            accessible roads, and basic infrastructure. Sites prone to\n            flooding, and earthquakes, should be avoided as possible,\n            otherwise appropriate engineering design measures, and\n            seismic resistance should be ensured. The provision of\n            adequate water quantity and quality should be ensured, and\n            priority should be given to the installation of toilets,\n            appropriate sanitation (cesspools), and disposal of solid wastes."}, "docdt": "2003-10-15T16:52:03Z"}
