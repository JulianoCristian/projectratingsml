"The Low Income Housing Project will\n            support the Government' s effort to narrow the living\n            conditions' gap between the formal, and informal\n            settlements in capital cities in Iran, and, improve the\n            performance of the housing sector, through a long-term\n            program of investment, and capacity building.\n            Notwithstanding the development benefits for the long run,\n            project implementation will entail displacement, and\n            resettlement of local people, thus this resettlement action\n            plan (RAP) presents the policy framework regarding\n            compensation to be available for project affected people\n            (PAP). Current laws are not clear in Iran, on indemnities\n            for damages resulting from possession of lands, and\n            properties, or associated rights, which makes the process of\n            relocation difficult. To this end, the Bank's directive\n            on involuntary resettlement, in line with preferences of the\n            Constitution and the National Document on Enabling and\n            Regularizing Unauthorized Settlement, forms the basis for\n            this policy framework which will govern implementation of\n            any resettlement activity under the project. Surveys will\n            determine socioeconomic specifications, losses incurred,\n            based on public consultations for formulate the appropriate\n            compensation, ensuring living standards improve, or are at\n            least restored. Resettlement compensation specifies the\n            following: parcels of land will be compensated by exchanging\n            to another locality, in accordance with agreed conditions,\n            including infrastructure such as water, power, drainage, an\n            urban and social services nearby; likewise, residential and\n            business facilities will be exchanged to another locality,\n            same as above; construction materials will be supplied, and\n            technical assistance provided during construction.\n            Monitoring methods shall ensure resettlement activities, and\n            compensation comply with this framework, and, grievance\n            mechanisms will be in place should conflict arise."}, "docdt": "2003-10-15T17:02:01Z"}
