ability of\n            participating districts and communities in the Arid and\n            Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) to plan and implement climate change\n            adaptation measures. There are three components to the\n            project. The first component of the project is climate\n            information products, policy, and advocacy. This component\n            will strengthen capacities among national institutions to\n            better assess and respond to current and future climate\n            risks. It will generate and disseminate climate-related\n            knowledge and strengthen institutional coordination among\n            currently fragmented agencies managing disaster and climate\n            risk. National stakeholders will be trained to further\n            disseminate the knowledge that is generated to the district\n            and community levels. The second component of the project is\n            climate risk management at the district level. This\n            component will promote the integration of a climate risk\n            management perspective into district planning processes and\n            programs. The component will build capacity related to\n            climate change among major stakeholders at the district\n            level and support public and private climate-smart\n            investments. The third component of the project is\n            community-driven initiatives for climate resilience. This\n            component will help communities to adopt climate change\n            adaptation strategies and investments. It will complement\n            Arid Lands Resource Management Project (ALRMP)/ASAL\n            Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) activities in reducing\n            vulnerability among the ASAL population by directly\n            strengthening their resilience to climate risk."}, "docdt": "2010-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
