Some lessons learned included:\n            putting in place flexible institutional arrangements that\n            development partners can use to channel support quickly,\n            before climate emergencies occur, can help to improve\n            coordination and efficiency. Implementation arrangements\n            need to allow climate-stressed communities 'time\n            out' to cope with emergencies. Community-driven\n            development projects, or components, through the emphasis on\n            beneficiary participation and empowerment, can be\n            instruments for reducing the risks of corruption and poor\n            governance, especially at the local level, provided that\n            social accountability arrangements are properly designed and\n            implemented by the Borrower and closely supervised. There is\n            a particular need to design workable disclosure and\n            complaints handling mechanisms, assign responsibilities for\n            implementing them, and ensure that this takes place. The\n            first phase of ALRMP did not include conflict resolution,\n            but it very quickly became necessary and the project\n            responded creatively. With this experience, ALRMP II\n            designers planned to integrate conflict management into the\n            natural resource management component. Beneficiaries and\n            other stakeholders point to the resulting activities as\n            having been among the project's most important\n            contributions. Addressing conflicts over natural resources\n            needs to be an integral part of projects in fragile\n            locations that are experiencing in-migration or are\n            over-populated (in relation to the resource base) and\n            subject to increasingly adverse climate change impacts."}, "docdt": "2012-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
