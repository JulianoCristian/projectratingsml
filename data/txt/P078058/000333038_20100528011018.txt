I.          STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

 A. Country and sector issues

 1.    The Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) require special attention if Kenya is to
 achieve sustainable economic development. The ASALs cover more than 80 percent of the
 country`s land mass and extend across 39 districts,1 mainly in the Rift Valley, Eastern, North
 Eastern, and Coast Provinces. Almost 30 percent of Kenya`s people live in the ASALs. These
 people are predominantly pastoral, but the characteristics of livestock ownership and movement
 vary significantly across ethnic groups. The semi-arid districts are characterized by marginal
 dryland agriculture, complemented by pockets of agro-pastoral livelihoods and some pastoral
 livelihoods in the Maasai area. The ASALs support about 70 percent of the national livestock
 population, valued at an estimated KShs 70 billion. These areas also support more than 90
 percent of the nation`s wild game species, which are the central attraction of a tourist industry
 that earns in excess of KShs 50 billion annually. Despite their great potential for development,
 the ASALs historically have been marginalized, economically and politically.

 2.    Gross domestic product (GDP) growth picked up in Kenya in the first half of the last
 decade after stagnating for many years, but several factors have slowed economic growth
 in recent years, and poverty and inequity remain major challenges. The Kenyan economy
 grew at 6.1 percent in 2006, up from 5.8 percent in 2005. This recovery has resulted mainly from
 improved macroeconomic management and progress in some structural reforms. Absolute
 poverty nationwide declined from 52 percent in 1997 to 47 percent in 2006. However, the post-
 election crisis in late 2007 and early 2008, high international food and fuel prices, the global
 financial crisis in 2008­09, and four consecutive failures of seasonal rains, resulting in
 widespread drought, brought growth down to 1.7 percent in 2008 and 2.5 percent in 2009.
 Economic performance over the past two decades has not matched the annual population growth
 rate of 2.3 percent.

 3.    The striking spatial variation in income, poverty, and human development in Kenya
 indicates the severe underdevelopment and marginalization of the ASALs. The sources of
 this underdevelopment are many and encompass climate and agro-ecological factors as well as
 socioeconomic conditions, such as poor access to markets and services. Poverty rates in most
 ASAL districts exceed 70 percent, which is well above the national average. Unemployment is
 particularly acute in North Eastern Province, reaching 40 percent in 2006. Because they are
 relatively isolated and their population is so dispersed, the ASALs have long been at a
 disadvantage in obtaining public services and infrastructure. In North Eastern Province, only 4
 percent of the population use electricity and less than one-third has access to safe water. Eighty-
 eight percent of adults have not completed primary education.

 4.   By making a disadvantaged and vulnerable population even more vulnerable, the
 increasingly variable and changing climate threatens efforts to reduce poverty and increase
 economic growth in the ASALs. Kenya has among the highest climate-related risk of any
 country in the world, particularly because of persistent drought and the growing problem of
 flooding. Droughts between 1998 and 2002 reduced GDP by 16 percent in the two subsequent

 1
     Greater districts as of 2006.


                                                 1
years. Flood damage during the 1997­98 El Niño cycle is estimated to have equaled about 11
percent of annual GDP. Repeated rain failures and the severe droughts of 2001­02, 2006, and
2009 could be early signals of climate change. These extreme climate events have affected
agricultural performance and food security. People in the ASALs are already vulnerable because
they live in such challenging agro-ecological and socioeconomic conditions. For example, 35
percent of ASAL land is subject to degradation and desertification. Rainfall is low and erratic.
Annual rainfall in arid districts ranges from 150 to 450 millimeters per year; in semi-arid
districts, it ranges from 500 to 850 millimeters per year. Water availability and accessibility vary
greatly. In North Eastern and Eastern Provinces, 43 percent and 42 percent of households have
been affected by droughts and floods, respectively. Unfavorable socioeconomic conditions
include poor access to services and infrastructure, such as water and sanitation, electricity,
financial services, and roads.

5.    The lack of investments adapted to climate risk is reducing the impact of development
efforts. Observations and projections predict that climate variability and the number of extreme
events will rise and hence increase the risk to livelihoods based on natural resources--the
mainstay of the ASALs. Global general climate models indicate that the region will experience a
warming trend, with an increase of up to 2 degrees Celsius in the annual average temperature by
2030. Rainfall is likely to be more intense in northeastern Kenya and to diminish elsewhere in
the country. The growing season is likely to become shorter in some parts of Kenya, and its onset
will be more variable. Since the frequency and intensity of these events are expected to increase,
traditional and autonomous adaptation is not likely to be sufficient for coping with them.2

6.    The Government of Kenya has increased its attention to the development of the
ASALs to unleash their full economic and livelihood potential. Kenya`s Vision 2030, which
follows the Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation, includes
enhanced equity and wealth creation opportunities for the poor as one of its main pillars. This
pillar explicitly states that special attention has to be given to investments in the ASALs. The
Vision 2030 also emphasizes the sound management of the ASALs` natural resource base, on
which many economic sectors depend, including agriculture and livestock, water, tourism,
health, and education. The Vision 2030 also indicates that Kenya will enhance disaster
preparedness in all disaster-prone areas and improve the capacity to adapt to climate variability
and change.

7.   The government has prepared a National Policy for the Sustainable Development of
Arid and Semi Arid Lands. The policy, which awaits cabinet approval, aims to enhance the
role of communities in the ASALs` development with a focus on longer-term planning. Its main
objective is to improve food security, increase living standards, and reduce dependency on food
aid. The policy envisages a reduction in the vulnerability of the population and an increase in
capacities to adapt to climate variability and change. Its priorities include support to: sound
natural resource and environmental management; agro-pastoral livelihood systems; mixed
farming; water resource management; diversification in livestock; and active adaptation to short-
to longer-term climate risks. The policy highlights a number of capacity-related constraints, such
as inadequate development of local human resources, poor livestock marketing, limited health
and movement control systems, and inadequate provision of basic services. It also emphasizes

                                                 2
the importance of complementing the disaster management outlook, which focuses on food aid
and emergency response, with long-term solutions to sustain livelihoods despite heightened
climate risk.

8.   The Arid Lands Resource Management Project II (ALRMP II) has been highly
successful in enhancing food security in drought-prone and marginalized communities.
Now in its second phase, ALRMP, as part of a long-standing government program for rural
development in the ASALs, has been very effective in reaching marginalized communities and
establishing sound implementation systems. ALRMP started as an emergency drought recovery
operation in 1994 (Emergency Drought Recovery Project, Credit 2460). It then became apparent
that a longer-term program was needed to build a drought management system as well as
community capacity to cope with drought. Two phases of this project have been supported so far:
ALRMP I (Credit 2797), with US$ 21 million in 1996, and ALRMP II (Credit 3795), with US$
60 million in 2003. A supplemental credit for US$ 60 million in 2006 expanded the scale and
scope of operations and replenished the depleted drought contingency fund. ALRMP now covers
28 arid and semi-arid districts3 and has strengthened its focus on natural resource management,
now a distinct component of the project. ALRMP`s strengths include a sound, decentralized
structure and effective coordination mechanisms at the national, district, and community levels,
which have resulted in an effective multi-sectoral approach to development. Key results include
a rapid response to drought stress, reduced distances to key social services, as well as
diversification of livelihoods. The Government of Kenya has requested the World Bank and
other development partners to continue to strengthen ASAL development through an ASAL
SWAp (Sector-Wide Approach), which is scheduled for Board presentation in late 2010. The
ASAL SWAp will build on ALRMP II, which is being extended until June 2011.

9.    The Independent Evaluation Group rated the overall outcome of ALRMP I as
satisfactory.4 In particular, the impact on institutional development was rated as high, because
beyond developing the District Steering Groups (DSGs) as focal points in organizing the
response to drought, the project empowered both government staff at the district level and the
local communities, and increased their capacity to tackle emergencies and development
problems. The drought management system in Kenya has been cited as best practice and is
emulated in other countries, including Ethiopia. The proposed Kenya Adaptation to Climate
Change in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (KACCAL) Project will provide an overlay to ALRMP
to strengthen the adaptive response to risks associated with climate variability and change. It will
reinforce systems put into place by ALRMP by developing a forward-looking capacity to
respond to risks caused by multiple climate hazards and by supporting adaptive investments,
particularly in land and water management.

B. Rationale for Bank and Global Environment Facility/Special Climate Change Fund
involvement

10. The World Bank is accumulating substantial experience in addressing climate change
as part of its development and poverty reduction efforts. The World Bank Group is

implementing several projects, many funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), to
mitigate climate change risk, strengthen adaptation, and integrate climate risk in development
planning in several regions. Further, it has, together with other multilateral development
institutions, established the Climate Investment Funds, consisting of the Strategic Climate Fund
and the Clean Technology Fund. The Bank is also in the process of implementing its Strategic
Framework on Climate Change and Development. This strategic framework intends to guide the
scaling up of World Bank Group actions integrating planning for climate change within
development, while sustaining growth and poverty reduction efforts. The Africa Region of the
World Bank recently completed a climate change strategy, which highlights the need for
supporting capacity building to mainstream climate change considerations into development
planning. The Bank has also emphasized the need to scale up action on climate change for
development as part of the fifteenth replenishment of the International Development Association
(IDA 15). Given the Bank`s strengths in directly supporting countries--its lending and non-
lending instruments, its multi-sectoral perspective, and its role as a platform for various donors to
provide assistance--it is uniquely positioned to mainstream climate actions in countries most at
risk from climate change, such as Kenya. This mainstreaming is typified by KACCAL, which will
integrate adaptation to climate change into a key rural development program in collaboration with
other multilateral development institutions, including the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP).

11. The World Bank has a significant portfolio of activities aimed at climate-smart
development in Kenya. In addition to the ALRMP, these activities include the Western Kenya
Community Driven Development and Flood Mitigation (WKCDD&FM) Project and the Natural
Resource Management (NRM) Project covering humid and semi-humid areas of Kenya. The
BioCarbon Fund of the World Bank also supports two carbon finance operations in Kenya, one
on reforestation and one on agricultural land management. A GEF-supported project on
Agricultural Productivity and Sustainable Land Management, due for approval by the end of FY
2010, is expected to build major stakeholders` capacity to engage in sustainable land
management, especially with respect to climate change. Further, the proposed project will benefit
from two technical assistance activities: one to support the proposed land use policy and another
to establish a sound diagnostic on resource degradation and improving access to sustainable
natural resources.

12. ALRMP provides a clear opportunity for strengthening adaptation to climate
variability and change. The strengths of ALRMP in implementing multi-sectoral and demand-
driven investments provide a unique opportunity to address the obvious adaptation deficit in the
region. The ALRMP project area is clearly affected by the rising risks of climate variability and
change, and the program provides a very effective delivery mechanism for increasing the
adaptive capacity of the most vulnerable segments of the population. KACCAL is consistent
with the guidelines of the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF). It addresses several of its
priority areas, including water resource management, land management, agriculture, and fragile
ecosystems. Through KACCAL, GEF/SCCF incremental support would enhance the climate
information base, strengthen the adaptive capacity of stakeholders, and mainstream climate risk
management into development plans and investment programs. This mainstreaming approach fits
into the Bank`s strategy and its global commitment to scale up efforts to address the risks posed
by climate change.



                                                 4
13. KACCAL will contribute to climate change adaptation particularly through
sustainable land management. The proposed project is embedded within the country`s
programmatic framework for sustainable land management (Kenya Sustainable Land
Management Investment Framework), which the Government of Kenya is developing with
support from the TerrAfrica partnership. It will enhance the national dialogue on the intertwining
land and climate change agendas and help develop knowledge and methodologies for scaling up
climate risk management at the community level. The proposed project is also consistent with
priorities of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program of the New
Partnership for Africa`s Development, in particular with its pillars on land and water
management, food supply and hunger, and agricultural research.

C. Higher-level objectives to which the project contributes

14. KACCAL is consistent with government and development partner strategies. In the
Investment Program for Economic Recovery Strategy 2003­2007 and its successor, the Vision
2030, the government acknowledges that ASALs require special attention to achieve sustainable
poverty reduction and economic growth. Both documents highlight the need to address problems
of insecurity, degradation of rangelands, and poor access to water in these areas. They identify
agriculture as a prime driver of development and poverty reduction. They place special emphasis
on targeted programs aimed at reducing poverty among particularly disadvantaged communities,
such as the pastoralists. A key motivation for supporting adaptation to climate change in Kenya
is to help the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups adapt to short- and longer-term climate
risks. The proposed project is guided by the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2004) and the
Kenya Strategy for Revitalizing Agriculture (2005), which emphasize the importance of reducing
risk and vulnerability for groups whose livelihoods rely on the use of natural resources. The
proposed project also contributes to the objectives of the draft land policy, the draft ASAL
policy, and the draft disaster management policy.

15. The project is well aligned with the three objectives of the Country Partnership
Strategy 2010­2013: reducing inequality and social exclusion, managing resource constraints,
and unleashing Kenya`s growth potential. Both KACCAL and the ASAL SWAp are included in
the Country Partnership Strategy. The Kenya Joint Assistance Strategy 2007­2012 also
addresses the need for Kenya to invest in adaptation to climate change. The proposed project is
in line with the objectives of the Africa Action Plan, which include support for decentralized
institutional capacity and various investments that reduce the risk from extreme climate events.

16. Finally, KACCAL contributes to the country's global environmental commitments.
Kenya signed and ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) in 1994 and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in 1997. The
national communications to the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, the government`s key
document on climate change, regards actions to reduce vulnerability in the ASALs as a priority,
including options for adaptation in agriculture, water, and rangeland management. The proposed
project fits well with the GEF-4 long-term objective of supporting pilot and demonstration
projects for adaptation to climate change.

II.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION

 A. Lending instrument

 17. The proposed lending instrument is a GEF/SCCF grant in the amount of US$ 5.5
 million. The project will be implemented through the mechanisms and processes of the IDA-
 supported Arid Lands Resource Management Project (ALRMP II)/ASAL SWAp over a period of
 four years. Project activities will be piloted in four ASAL districts (Garissa, Turkana, Marsabit,
 and Malindi), with the intention of scaling up KACCAL climate change adaptation work in other
 districts of the baseline project. Related activities in a fifth district, Mwingi, will be supported by
 the proposed UNDP-implemented SCCF grant.

 B. Project development objective and key indicators

 18. The goal of the overall World Bank­UNDP project is to enhance the resilience of
 communities and the sustainability of rural livelihoods threatened by climate change in the arid
 and semi-arid lands of Kenya. To help achieve this goal, KACCAL's development objective is
 to improve the ability of participating districts and communities in the arid and semi-arid
 lands to plan and implement climate change adaptation measures. This objective will be
 achieved through: (i) strengthening climate risk management and the natural resource base
 related knowledge; (ii) building institutional and technical capacity for improved planning and
 coordination to manage current and future climate risks at the district and national levels; and
 (iii) investing in communities` priorities in sustainable land and water management and in
 alternative livelihoods that helps them adapt to climate risk.

 19. KACCAL will build on the outcomes of the baseline project with a focus on
 strengthening adaptation in the target areas. Key indicators include:

        (i)    Number of district management plans with concrete climate risk management
               activities reflected in the budget.
        (ii)   Percentage of community adaptation projects rated satisfactory or better by
               participating communities.

 C. Project components

 20. The project has three components: (i) climate information products, policy, and
 advocacy; (ii) climate risk management at the district level; and (iii) community-driven
 initiatives for climate resilience. The latter two components will be implemented in four ASAL
 districts, with similar activities implemented in a fifth district with funding from a UNDP SCCF
 grant. All three components contribute directly to the integration of climate actions into
 development processes in the ASALs, in particular through the ALRMP/ASAL SWAp. The
 components complement each other by focusing on generating and disseminating knowledge and
 by building capacity at the national, district, and community levels.




                                                   6
Component 1: Climate information products, policy, and advocacy (SCCF Increment US$
1.46 million)

21. This component will strengthen capacities among national institutions to better assess
and respond to current and future climate risks. It will generate and disseminate climate-
related knowledge and strengthen institutional coordination among currently fragmented
agencies managing disaster and climate risk. National stakeholders will be trained to further
disseminate the knowledge that is generated to the district and community levels.

22. Sub-component 1.1: Development of climate-related knowledge products to inform
climate risk management (CRM) strategies in ASALs. This subcomponent will help generate
and increase access to tailored climate information for strategic adaptation planning. Knowledge
products will include: (i) district climate risk profiles focusing on enhanced vulnerability
assessments (obtained, for example, by integrating climate information with available natural
resource and socioeconomic information); (ii) downscaled climate change scenarios for Kenya
(based on past and current observations and global and regional climate models); (iii)
methodologies and approaches for assessing climate-related risks in ALRMP/ASAL SWAp
investments and climate risk screening of community-driven development (CDD) micro-
projects; and (iv) improvements in the drought early warning system through more systematic
inclusion of climate information. These products will be tested and refined in the pilot districts
and made available more widely through the TerrAfrica regional knowledge base. This
subcomponent will finance: (i) international and local technical assistance; (ii) training; (iii)
procurement of required equipment; (iv) services (software development, data digitizing, and
others); (v) workshops, study tours, and exchange visits between relevant national and
international institutions and programs; (vi) climate risk knowledge and advisory service
partnerships with local and international institutions, as needed; and (vii) related operating costs
to carry out the above.

23. Subcomponent 1.2.: Integration of climate action into national ASAL development plans
and programs. This subcomponent will support coordination and capacity building for
integrating climate risk management within policies, strategies, and institutions. National
stakeholders will be trained to disseminate the generated knowledge in a user-friendly format to
districts and communities. This subcomponent will inform the implementation of the Climate
Change Strategy spearheaded by the Ministry of Environment and Mineral Resources with
particular emphasis on land management and community-based adaptation. It will support the
ongoing institutional efforts to strengthen a national Sustainable Land and Natural Resources
Management Platform technical working group within the framework of the multi-sector
Agriculture Sector Coordination Unit. This subcomponent will also support the development of
periodic policy notes and targeted capacity building of the ALRMP/ASAL SWAp Team, the
Kenya Food Security Meeting (KFSM) and its multi-sectoral working groups, the Agriculture
Sector Coordination Unit, and other entities based on the knowledge and advisory services
supported by this project. This effort will facilitate the mainstreaming of adaptation within
sectoral and disaster management policies and plans. Further, the subcomponent will support
project management and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). This subcomponent will finance:
(i) salaries for technical staff recruited for KACCAL implementation; (ii) training and workshops
for ALRMP staff, members of the KFSM, district officers, and other relevant stakeholders; (iii)



                                                 7
technical study tours and exchange visits, including South­South learning events; (iv)
independent evaluation consultancies and technical assistance; and (v) operational support and
equipment/materials for the ALRMP/KACCAL Secretariat.

Component 2: Climate risk management at the district level (SCCF Increment US$ 1.37
million)

24. This component will promote the integration of a climate risk management
perspective into district planning processes and programs. The component will build
capacity related to climate change among major stakeholders at the district level and support
public and private climate-smart investments.

25. Subcomponent 2.1: Capacity building to integrate climate risk management into district
planning processes. This subcomponent will strengthen the capacity of district officials and
other stakeholders to access and use relevant climate information and knowledge products
described in component 1. The target groups, including the District Coordination Unit (DCU),
the DSG, and other stakeholders, will be enabled to assess climate risks (including improving
early warning systems) to strengthen the climate resilience of plans, programs, and investments.
The subcomponent will also implement methodologies for assessing ALRMP/ASAL SWAp
investments and provide recommendations for risk-proofing.

26.   The additional SCCF funding will be focused on enhancing the technical capacity of
Mobile Extension Teams (METs) to access and use climate-related information and
knowledge. The ALRMP/ASAL SWAp structure provides communities with technical support
and backstopping through METs. Information and analysis will provide the teams with the
knowledge to provide advisory services in the context of climate variability and change.
Emphasis will be placed on training METs to understand and interpret the climate information
generated in component 1 and to communicate it in user-friendly and practical terms to end-users
(that is, the communities and resource users in the ASALs). In this way, the METs will be
enabled to provide guidance on adaptation measures in a format that is relevant, timely,
accessible, and comprehensible to their clients. The usefulness of the knowledge products and
information for the end users will be assessed through a combination of qualitative and
quantitative approaches, including the Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) approach used by
ALRMP. This subcomponent will finance: (i) training and workshops for district officials; (ii)
technical assistance and consultancies for scrutinizing risk in ALRMP investments; (iii) specific
equipment and software to use climate knowledge products; and (iv) operational costs (including
costs of PRAs and monitoring).

27. Subcomponent 2.2: Support for "climate-smart" public and private investments. This
subcomponent will support the implementation of selected public and private sector
interventions identified through adaptation-enhanced district plans. These investments will
typically be at a scale above the community level (for example, the micro-watershed or
intercommunity level) and will complement community investments for enhanced climate
resilience. These activities may include public­private sector partnerships. Investment areas
include but are not limited to: improving infrastructure to better manage floods and droughts
(including small check dams, water pans, and similar facilities); improving livestock monitoring



                                               8
and response systems (for example, improving conditions and risk factors contributing to
livestock diseases such as Rift Valley fever, supporting livestock off-take management, and
diversifying animal stocks); natural resource management investments (such as agroforestry or
rehabilitating water sources); and training in business/enterprise skills for investments in value
addition of ASAL products. These investments will be coordinated by the District Steering
Group.

28. This subcomponent will finance: (i) feasibility studies and preparation of public and
private investments, including operating costs; (ii) civil works and equipment for approved
district-level investments (public and private); and (iii) training for private investors.

Component 3: Community-driven initiatives for climate resilience (SCCF Increment US$
2.67 million)

29. This component will help communities to adopt climate change adaptation strategies
and investments. It will complement ALRMP/ASAL SWAp activities in reducing vulnerability
among the ASAL population by directly strengthening their resilience to climate risk.

30.   Subcomponent 3.1: Support for community capacity building. This subcomponent will
help to build awareness and capacity at the community level to assess climate risk and to plan
and invest for climate resilience. Multiple events and severe droughts and floods have sapped
communities` ability to adapt autonomously, using only indigenous knowledge. Communities are
well aware that climate anomalies are on the rise and affecting their local environment, but they
have limited understanding of the scale or scope of the causes of these anomalies, their potential
long-term impact, or opportunities to limit their impacts. Where adaptation measures are known,
communities are constrained in adopting them. This subcomponent will support: (i)
strengthening awareness of climate risks faced by specific groups and their ability to interpret
and respond to forecasts and related information; (ii) developing climate-resilient Community
Action Plans (CAPs); and (iii) planning and implementing climate-smart investments at the
community level. This subcomponent will finance: (i) training and workshops for communities
(including community-based monitoring) and (ii) training to develop enhanced CAPs, including
operating costs.

31. Subcomponent 3.2: Support for community-based micro-projects. This subcomponent will
support community-based micro-projects identified in the climate-resilient CAPs. This
subcomponent will finance grants to communities to implement micro-projects. Communities
will provide at least 10 percent of the total micro-project cost in kind or cash. At least 80
communities in the pilot districts will be targeted. Potential areas of support may include:
       (i)    Structural interventions for land and water management. In helping communities
              manage land and water resources across the entire spectrum of climate conditions
              in the ASALs, investments will support a variety of structures for land
              management, erosion control, and small-scale water harvesting, storage, and
              management.
       (ii)   Sustainable agricultural land and livestock management. Micro-projects will make
              agricultural practices more resilient to climate risks by promoting sustainable land
              management methods and technologies (such as intercropping, integrated nutrient


                                                9
                management, moisture and soil conservation techniques, agroforestry, and drought-
                tolerant crops) and rangeland/livestock management (such as silvopastoralism and
                drought-tolerant pasture species).
        (iii)   Opportunities to enhance carbon sequestration. Grants will facilitate assessments
                of the technical and financial feasibility of micro-projects focusing on ecosystem
                services, especially opportunities for carbon finance.
        (iv)    Livelihood enhancement and diversification. Support will be provided to increase
                the adoption of livelihood diversification projects. Areas of interest might include
                the promotion of sustainable production, value addition, and marketing of ASAL
                products such as dates, gum, aloe, jatropha, and sisal and promotion of sustainable
                production, value addition and marketing of indigenous crops and vegetables.
        (v)     Credit and micro-insurance. The feasibility of innovative credit and micro-
                insurance schemes for ASAL communities will be explored. If they are considered
                financially viable and technically sound, grants will help to scale up successful
                community-based credit and insurance mechanisms to facilitate the adoption of
                improved agropastoral practices and other livelihood strategies to reduce
                vulnerability and risks.
        (vi)    Human and livestock health. Support for investments to reduce human exposure to
                vector- and waterborne diseases and improve livestock health will be provided as
                appropriate.

32. The four KACCAL pilot districts (Garissa, Turkana, Marsabit, and Malindi)5 cover a
wide range of conditions relevant for adaptation to climate variability and change.
Together, these districts (i) cover arid as well as semi-arid areas; (ii) are exposed to climate risks
arising from multiple hazards (such as droughts and floods) and will probably continue to
experience climate variability; (iii) include a range of livelihood types (pastoral, agro-pastoral,
agricultural, and natural resource based); (iv) have varied implementation capacity; and (iv) are
among the poorest, most vulnerable areas of the country.

33. Malindi is a coastal, semi-arid district with mixed livelihoods. Agriculture (cash and food
cropping) accounts for half of land use. Lowland livestock production and ranching are also
important uses of land. Malindi is affected by seasonal flooding from the Sabaki River.
Turkana, Garissa, and Marsabit are mainly arid districts. Turkana, located in northwestern
Kenya, consists largely of low-lying plains with a few isolated hilly areas drained by seasonal
rivers that flow into Lake Turkana. This dominantly dry district has erratic, unimodal rainfall.
According to climate change projections, this area is likely to get wetter. The main source of
livelihoods is livestock, with some marginal cultivation. Garissa in North Eastern Province is a
large arid district, covering 7.5 percent of the country`s land mass. It is low lying and abuts the
Tana River. Frequent droughts and unreliable rains make it difficult to manage pastures for
livestock. Irrigation is practiced along the river, which has recently been subject to severe
seasonal flooding. Marsabit, bordering Ethiopia in northern Kenya, is the largest district in

5
 These greater districts have been subdivided into 16 districts, namely: Turkana North, Turkana Central, Turkana
South, Turkana East, Turkana West, and Loima; Marsabit Central, Marsabit South, Marsabit North, Loyangalani,
and North Horr; Fafi, Garissa, and Lagdera; and Malindi and Magarini.

Kenya, covering about 11.2 percent of the country`s total area. Except for some semi-arid areas
around Mount Marsabit, the district is largely arid. Its population is generally nomadic, although
there are a few sparsely populated settlements. The predominant land use is rangelands for
livestock, with some cultivation around Mt. Marsabit. The dryland forests of Mount Marsabit
and Mount Kulal are threatened by severe degradation.

D. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

34. Key lessons are reflected in the proposed project's scope and activities. A number of
lessons have been learned from the ALRMP in the last 14 years. Other valuable lessons come
from South Asia and Latin America, where the World Bank has supported innovative programs
for integrating climate risk management into local planning and development. Key guiding
elements include:

       (i)     Participation is the key to project impact and sustainability. When key
               stakeholders view information and knowledge on climate risk as irrelevant or
               inaccessible, the conditions for successful adaptation are not met. KACCAL will
               apply a participatory approach for developing and implementing knowledge
               products and investments.
       (ii)    Operational information on the ASALs' natural resource base is essential for
               successful and sustainable project interventions. Managing the resource base is
               crucial for sustaining livelihoods. The project will enhance community-based
               monitoring of the resource base and strategic planning of resource management.
       (iii)   Climate risk management in ASALs must be oriented to multiple hazards. Early
               warning systems developed by ALRMP need to be broadened to encompass
               floods as well as droughts. El Niño and other climate events have made recurrent
               flooding an additional threat to livelihoods in ASALs. In addition to managing
               flood risks, improved water management and storage can smooth the cycles of
               drought and flooding, and they are important areas for support in the proposed
               project.
       (iv)    Climate risk management needs to be mainstreamed into development processes.
               As noted, the proposed project reflects the UNFCCC and GEF focus on
               mainstreaming climate risk management into development processes. Key lessons
               from other climate risk management projects include:
                  Climate change is more than an environmental problem. Fundamentally it is a
                  major economic and social risk.
                  Preparation for longer-term impacts begins by addressing short-term
                  vulnerabilities. Thus disaster risk reduction goes hand-in-hand with climate
                  change adaptation.
                  Actions for adaptation to climate change encompass the local, district, and
                  national levels. Their scope and time horizon depend on the capacity of the
                  target group.
                  Adaptation planning is best situated where the key decision makers in
                  government reside, such as the Office of the President or the Prime Minister`s


                                               11
                    Office. At the same time, adaptation planning needs to be integrated into the
                    government`s budgetary plans.
         (v)     Identifying specific drivers of diversification and risk management is key. Reasons
                 and strategies for diversification differ significantly among various groups and
                 between male and female resource users. This project will apply a demand-driven
                 approach to ensure that group-specific adaptation needs are considered.

  E. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

  35. Blending KACCAL with other operations. KACCAL could have been overlaid with
  other investment programs, such as the Natural Resource Management Project or the Western
  Kenya CDD and Flood Mitigation Project. The key reasons to blend with ALRMP/ASAL SWAp
  derive from that project`s core features: (i) its multi-sectoral development program, which
  enables a broad-based adaptation approach to be piloted; (ii) its institutional home, which
  ensures the necessary political will and leverage for implementing a cross-sectoral operation; (iii)
  its focus, which is on the most vulnerable groups (poor communities in the ASALs); and (iv) its
  proven implementation structure, which spans national, regional, district, and local levels.

  36. Higher investment volume and broader geographical scope. The prospect for starting
  with a larger operational and geographical scope was explored. It was considered, however, that
  greater efficiency lay in piloting these specialized activities and scaling up proven actions into a
  broad-based rural development program. ALRMP/ASAL SWAp is present in all semi-arid and
  arid districts, and its institutional setup and thematic focus allow for relatively straightforward
  adoption of adaptation activities.

  37.   Limit scope either to improving the knowledge base at the national level or to limited
  district activities. Another alternative would have been to reduce the project`s thematic focus by
  supporting either the generation of climate-related knowledge and climate information products
  at the national level or limited activities in the districts. Issues related to climate change are
  knowledge-intensive, and climate change is a rapidly evolving field. For this reason, the
  generation of national and local knowledge was considered a necessary condition for the project
  to operate successfully. At the same time, the knowledge generated on climate change needed to
  benefit the most vulnerable sections of the population--the stakeholders at the district and
  community levels. Hence a consistent approach, which informs district and community planning
  and investments by generating relevant and user-friendly knowledge, was selected.


III.     IMPLEMENTATION

  A. Partnership arrangements

  38. The SCCF/GEF approved two proposals in its work program, a full-sized project
  (KACCAL) submitted by the World Bank and a medium-sized project submitted by UNDP, with
  guidance for close collaboration. Given the similar thematic scope of the proposals (albeit with
  areas of intervention at different scales), close collaboration between the Bank and UNDP
  ensured that the two proposals fit into a common framework and complement each other. Both


                                                  12
proposed activities will use the ALRMP structure and mechanisms. The UNDP-supported
activities will concentrate on Mwingi and on regional knowledge building, complementing the
activities under this project.

39. Partnerships will be established with other stakeholders and agencies to implement
project activities and share knowledge. South­South learning relationships--for example, with
adaptation operations in dry areas of India and other countries--will be important. In addition,
the project will be embedded within the planned Kenya Sustainable Land Management
Investment Framework. The Ministry of State for the Development of Northern Kenya and Other
Arid Lands will be represented in its thematic working group. The Kenya Sustainable Land
Management Investment Framework will help to further the land management and climate
adaptation agendas; it provides a link with the TerrAfrica partnership, which reaches across the
region, and with a variety of development partners.

B. Institutional and implementation arrangements

40. The project will be implemented through the ALRMP/ASAL SWAp institutional
structure, which will gain additional technical capacity for climate risk management and project
management to implement KACCAL activities. Once ALRMP has been closed, KACCAL will
be implemented through the ASAL SWAp institutional structure, which will be similar to
ALRMP. The ALRMP Project Implementation Plan is being modified to reflect KACCAL
implementation modalities. As mentioned, one of the factors in ALRMP`s success is its
institutional location. KACCAL will be managed by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) for the
ALRMP/ASAL SWAp, which reports to the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of State for the
Development of Northern Kenya and Other Arid Lands in the Prime Minister`s Office.6 Within
the PCU, the Natural Resource Management (NRM) Coordinator of the ALRMP will be
responsible for the overall implementation of KACCAL. The NRM Coordinator reports directly
to the national ALRMP Coordinator. The PCU will hire a Technical Expert on climate change
issues to support KACCAL implementation. The Project Implementation Plan of ALRMP II will
be revised to include updated institutional arrangements; financial, procurement, and
disbursement procedures to be used for implementing the project; and a detailed approval
mechanism, eligibility criteria, procedures, and terms and conditions for awarding micro-project
funds.

41. ALRMP is the focal point of disaster management planning and early warning
information and is in an effective position to coordinate adaptation activities. ALRMP
supported the establishment of the KFSM, an effective mechanism for intergovernmental and
donor­government coordination on drought and food security at the national level. The KFSM is
co-chaired by the ALRMP on behalf of the Government of Kenya and the World Food Program
and consists of key sectoral ministries and external partners. The KFSM continues to play a key
role in overall drought management and is formally linked with the government`s drought and

6
 The project changed its location from the State Ministry of Special Programmes, Office of the President, when
government ministries were split following the creation of the grand coalition government in May 2008. The
program continues to span the two ministries with regard to various activities and functions managed by both
entities. The role and function of the ministry vis-à-vis the PCU will be reviewed during the course of the ASAL
SWAp preparation.


                                                        13
disaster coordination mechanisms. Through KACCAL, the KFSM will expand its focus to more
explicitly include climate risk management issues. The KFSM is informed by the Kenya Food
Security Steering Group, which includes a broad range of agencies working on early warning
systems and vulnerabilities, such as the World Food Program, the Famine Early Warning
System-Network (FEWSNET), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), sectoral
ministries, ALRMP, and others.

42. At the district level, KACCAL will build on ALRMP's strong multi-sectoral and inter-
agency coordination. The KACCAL project will be coordinated at the district level through the
ALRMP/ASAL SWAp District Coordination Unit (DCU). The DCU is headed by the Drought
Management Officer, who also acts as the district ALRMP Coordinator. The Drought
Management Officer is supported by administrative staff including a Data Analyst and a Finance
and Procurement Officer. In arid districts, there are also a Community Development Officer and
Mobile Extension Team Leaders. KACCAL will supplement the existing technical and
management capacities established through ALRMP.

43. The District Steering Group (DSG) is responsible for planning, approving, and
coordinating all district- and community-level interventions. The DSG is a subcommittee of
the District Development Committee, the main administrative body of the district government.
The DSG is composed of local leaders, technical staff of the district, and partner agencies. It
seeks to coordinate financial resources and activities in the district and provide a forum for the
participation of stakeholders. The main delivery mechanism for project financing will be through
the DCU, based on a work plan developed and agreed by the DSG. KACCAL will rely on the
same mechanism for planning and budgeting its activities and will further seek to mainstream
climate risk management into overall district plans.

44. Communities are responsible for managing KACCAL community interventions.
ALRMP has strengthened community institutions, which have taken on decision-making and
fund-managing responsibilities. The process ensures that these institutions are representative of
the populace and have the appropriate management capacity. A community Participatory Rapid
Appraisal (PRA) is conducted, and priorities for funding are defined in CAPs. The CAPs are
updated regularly and will provide the basis for interventions that integrate climate change
adaptation into community decision-making. These climate-resilient CAPs will identify
specific community micro-projects for financing. Trained METs will support communities in
identifying, preparing, and implementing micro-projects.

45. Flow of funds. All project funds will be handled and accounted by the Ministry of State for
the Development of Northern Kenya and Other Arid Lands through the PCU. For the CDD
component, funds will be channeled to community groups under arrangements similar to those of
ALRMP, following the CDD Manual developed and improved under the second phase of
ALRMP. As stipulated in this manual, the project will sign a Memorandum of Understanding
with each community group to establish the basic financial management and accountability
arrangements. The CDD Manual, including guidelines for financial management and
procurement, should be cleared with the relevant government authority.




                                               14
C. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of outcomes/results

46. The M&E system of KACCAL will be fully integrated into the established M&E
system of ALRMP. The current M&E system tracks project implementation (delivery and
quality of inputs, activities, and outputs) through a management information system (MIS) and
assesses outcomes through an ongoing independent impact evaluation. The data and information
collected will be used to continuously measure the status of agreed outcome indicators. Impact
evaluations will be contracted to independent consultants, including the evaluation for the
Implementation Completion Report. The M&E system will enable project management and other
stakeholders to: (i) review the efficiency, effectiveness, and timeliness of project
implementation; (ii) identify issues requiring decisions and corrective action; (iii) identify
lessons learned about project design and implementation; and (iv) determine whether the project
is on track to deliver the expected results. The findings of this continuous monitoring will be
communicated through quarterly implementation reviews, semi-annual progress reports, and
other technical reports (see Annex 3).

47. The institutional setup of the M&E system will rely on ALRMP's structure and
institutions. The overall responsibility for coordinating M&E will be with the M&E Specialist in
the PCU for ALRMP/ASAL SWAp. The Specialist will work closely with the Central Planning
and Monitoring Unit in the Ministry of State for the Development of Northern Kenya and Other
Arid Lands. The Specialist reports directly to the National Project Coordinator and interacts
closely with counterparts in the DCUs to ensure that data, information, and reports are delivered
on time from pilot districts to the national level. Given the participatory nature of KACCAL and
the baseline project, the DSGs and the communities are of particular importance in this process.
As with ALRMP, community-based M&E will regularly track the performance of the micro-
projects. Continuous feedback from beneficiaries will be used to improve the relevance and
quality of all activities.

48. A results framework with outcome indicators and target values has been prepared to
help track performance towards the Project Development Objective. It will also help to alert
management to any changes required in the project`s design or implementation. A variety of
sources will provide information on the status of performance indicators, such as technical and
financial reports, qualitative and quantitative community and household surveys, and existing
and newly generated geo-referenced data. The recently implemented MIS for ALRMP is
designed to include KACCAL. It will be used to guide project implementation and inform the
results chain, covering inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes. The MIS will help the project
team make more effective use of the wealth of data and information created by the project and
design more efficient work plans that translate project resources into results. Project mid-term
and terminal evaluation will be carried out jointly with the UNDP-supported component.

D. Sustainability and replicability

49. Institutional sustainability. The core activities of the project will be fully integrated into
the baseline program. Activities in the four pilot districts will increase the capacity of local
institutions and stakeholders for to plan for adaptive measures. This capacity should in turn
increase the sustainability of development investments. The experience in the four pilot districts



                                               15
will provide products and mechanisms for enhancing climate risk management that could be
replicated in other districts supported by ALRMP/ASAL SWAp. The policy and advocacy work
to be carried out under KACCAL will increase the exposure of national policy and decision
makers to climate change adaptation issues. Furthermore, technical assistance will strengthen the
overall coordination mechanisms for climate risk management with leadership from
ALRMP/ASAL SWAp and the Prime Minister`s Office.

50. Social sustainability. Participation is the key to project impact and sustainability. ALRMP
has already developed and introduced an effective participatory approach to service delivery
based on a good understanding of pastoral and agro-pastoralist communities. The design of
KACCAL`s participatory approach will benefit from the extensive experience of the baseline
project. The project is structured through processes of consultation and collaboration at the
national, district, and community levels and will build on partnerships and linkages already
established by ALRMP.

51. Financial sustainability. Adaptation is a long-term process, and the activities initiated
under the proposed project will require sustained effort and resources. The key is to build
institutional capacity for adaptive planning, to put in place systems and networks of information
that can be used to improve development outcomes under climate risk, and to build experience
among communities for such microinvestments. Regardless of whether external financing
continues to be available, the tools for systematically diagnosing problems and evaluating
options will be in place to sustain climate risk management within the framework of
development planning.

52. Replicability. The lessons learned under the current project--whether they relate to
improved planning, specific community responses to climate risk, or improved institutional
coordination--will support the development of a broader program of climate risk management.
The immediate opportunity for replicability lies within the ALRMP/ASAL SWAp itself, through
which KACCAL activities can be expanded into all 28 arid and semi-arid districts. Beyond this
option, two main mechanisms can be used to communicate knowledge created through this
project. One is the TerrAfrica partnership, with its emphasis on the climate adaptation and land
use agenda, and the other is the GEF-supported regional networks on drought management, led
by the UNDP Drylands Development Center. While there is considerable scope for replication,
explicit attention to documentation of lessons is vital.

Sustaining                  M        Under the coalition government`s reorganized/divided ministries, ALRMP
coordination with                    was moved to the newly established Ministry of State for Development of
KFSM and other                       Northern Kenya and Other Arid Lands, reporting to the Prime Minister`s
disaster                             Office. This change could potentially affect the leverage and coordination
management                           power of ALRMP, which was previously located in the Office of the
platforms under                      President. The ALRMP and the World Bank have discussed this issue with
the new                              the highest level of government and been assured that the change will not
institutional                        negatively affect the implementation of ALRMP and KACCAL. The
arrangements                         implementation of ALRMP II has not been negatively affected by the
                                     restructuring so far.
Alternative                 H        Diversification in arid lands has been limited owing to poor market access,
sustainable                          poor access to credit, and weak links to the rest of the economy. This project
livelihood                           alone cannot change these fundamental constraints. It can, however, help
strategies to                        create a more conducive environment for diversified, sustainable livelihoods
pastoralism are not                  to take hold, especially by increasing the sustainable extraction, production,
taken up in the                      and value addition of dryland products. The project will provide technical
arid lands                           assistance and facilitate public­private­community partnerships towards this
                                     objective.
Continued and               M        Conflict management has been an integral part of ALRMP implementation,
growing conflict,                    in recognition of the severe competition for resources in the arid lands and
especially in arid                   spillover from conflict in neighboring countries. The potential for conflict
districts                            remains and could increase as the pressure over resources intensifies. By
                                     helping to reduce the vulnerability of communities amid resource scarcity,
                                     the project helps reduce the sources of conflict.
Technical capacity          M        In the arid lands, capacity constraints affect many sectors. This project alone
and services are                     cannot compensate for general capacity constraints, but it has a substantial
inadequate to                        focus on strengthening capacity. It will improve the capacity of service
support local                        providers and policy makers in technical aspects of climate risk management,
development                          and it will improve the capacity of communities to integrate climate risk in
                                     their development plans and monitoring. The project will use the same
                                     mechanism as the ALRMP/ASAL SWAp--mobile extension teams--for this
                                     purpose.
Recurrent droughts          M        This risk is mitigated partly by the fact that the baseline project created
during the project                   substantial capacity to respond to short-term emergencies and partly by
will divert                          building capacity in key agencies to be improve the immediate response to
attention from                       catastrophes. Recurrent climate extremes such as drought can also provide an
long-term planning                   additional motivation for addressing long-term vulnerabilities that might
                                     have remained hidden or tolerable under normal climate conditions.

Bank has been adopted and (ii) Community Action Plans are revised to include climate risk
management and adaptation issues. Other covenants include: (i) implementation of the project in
accordance with Anti-corruption Guidelines; (ii) compliance with the Government of Kenya
disclosure policy regarding information and social accountability mechanisms; (iii) conducting
an Annual Fiduciary Review of the project; (iv) submission of Annual Work Plans for the World
Bank`s prior approval; (v) preparation and submission of a report on monitoring and evaluation
results at mid-term; (vi) take all measures necessary to ensure that the project is implemented in
full compliance with the provisions of the Project Implementation Plan, Environmental
Management Framework (EMF), and Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) in a
timely manner; and (vii) increase the technical capacity of the PCU and districts with required
staffing, and procure appropriate technical consulting services in a timely manner, including a
dated covenant requiring the recruitment of a Climate Change Expert by the PCU.

IV.     APPRAISAL SUMMARY

 A. Economic and financial analyses

 55. The economic and financial analysis of the KACCAL project is structured as follows:
 (i) overview of the socioeconomic importance of the ASALs; (ii) summary of general issues for
 economic analysis of climate change adaptation projects; (iii) summary of a literature review on
 the economic impacts of climate change; (iv) calculation of the internal rate of return (IRR) and
 net present value (NPV) for potential CDD micro-projects; and (v) conclusions and
 recommendations (see Annex 9). Special challenges and issues need to be considered for the
 economic analysis of climate change adaptation projects. The Draft Guidance Note, Carrying
 Out Economic Analysis for Adaptation Projects (2008), points out that methodological issues
 arise mainly from uncertainties related to: (i) the benefits of adaptation interventions; (ii) the
 optimal timing of interventions; (iii) probability functions of climate variables; and (iv) and
 discount rates.

 56. Given these uncertainties, deciding to adapt now or to wait for more information on
 climate change impacts is not easy. Under KACCAL, the major share of financial resources
 will be allocated to no-regret investments or to investments that integrate adaptation in their
 original design. An example of no-regret investments is CDD investments that increase
 community welfare regardless of climate change. Investments that integrate adaptation include
 improving the early warning system developed under ALRMP to include information explicitly
 related to climate. For these types of investments, timing is not an issue.

 57. Another issue to consider in the economic analysis of KACCAL is that substantial
 resources are allocated for capacity building and institutional strengthening. All three
 components focus on national, regional, and local capacity building, based on generating
 knowledge products, improving coordination, training, and mainstreaming climate change
 adaptation into development planning. The availability of better climate information and the
 climate-proofing of investments will reduce the risk of losses to livelihoods, reduce livestock
 losses, and improve income security. Yet ex ante quantification of the economic benefits of these
 investments is difficult, if not impossible, owing to the long-run nature of these activities and the
 difficulty of linking causes and effects.

 58. Owing to these conceptual issues, the quantification of economic benefits for the
 project as a whole was not deemed to be meaningful or to add significant value to the
 project's design. Instead, the economic impacts of climate change are discussed based on a
 literature review. Economic analyses of the impacts of climate change have been conducted at
 fairly aggregated levels--that is, at global, regional, and national levels. All major studies agree
 that climate variability and change will have significant impacts, especially on agriculture and
 arid lands in sub-Saharan Africa. The Stern Review (2006) concluded that 250­550 million
 additional people may be at risk of hunger with a temperature increase of 3 degrees Celsius.
 More than half of these people will be concentrated in Africa and West Asia. The
 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) has projected that by 2020 between 75
 million and 250 million people in Africa will be exposed to increased water stress from climate



                                                  19
change. Cline (2007) estimated that agricultural output would fall by 28 percent by 2080 in sub-
Saharan Africa (without carbon fertilization). A World Bank study (2006) estimated that damage
from the La Niña drought in Kenya amounted to 16 percent of GDP in the 1998/99 and
1999/2000 financial years.

59. It is recommended that economic analysis be mainstreamed into a process of
evaluating cost effectiveness and sustainability of planned project activities. This approach
has proven useful under ALRMP, which also includes criteria for risk analysis, mitigation, and
sustainability. The KACCAL project will use this approach in some activities as an entry point to
assess climate risk and to assess the cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures as investments are
planned. The approach will be particularly relevant for some investments under components 1
and 2.

60. Despite the conceptual challenges outlined here, a preliminary economic analysis was
conducted for some potential CDD micro-projects, mainly for capacity building, and the
IRRs were promising. Precise parameters for CDD interventions cannot be known at present,
because these interventions are demand driven and will be defined in the course of the project. In
consultation with the KACCAL project team, technical experts, and communities in the project
area (particularly Marsabit and Garissa), some potential micro-projects were identified (small-
scale irrigation, woodlots, beekeeping, and sustainable land management). The IRRs for these
micro-projects were estimated to be between 13 percent and 30 percent. In the context of this
project, however, it is much more important that the economic and financial analysis informs the
selection process and specific design of community micro-projects once the communities have
drafted lists of potential interventions. In addition, complementary analytical work (included in
KACCAL but also occurring outside the project) will reduce the uncertainties regarding the costs
and benefits of climate adaptation interventions. Hence it was deemed inappropriate to allocate
additional resources for more in-depth quantitative assessments of limited use to the project.

B. Technical

61. The technical choices and recommendations underlying the KACCAL Project's design
are based on studies, analyses of sector issues, and lessons learned from the baseline
project. These resources include an assessment of climate risk in Kenya, an assessment of
institutional options, and an assessment of community vulnerability and coping strategies. Some
of the key issues that arose were:
   (i)   Climate information needs to be prepared and communicated in a user-friendly format.
         Coordination and communication between forecasters and end-users is often
         inadequate; end-users receive information without being able to provide feedback that
         would improve its usefulness. Communities and households can best use climate
         forecast information if it: (i) is interpreted at a local scale; (ii) includes information
         about timing (for example, its specifies when the rains will start); (iii) expresses the
         accuracy of projections in transparent, probabilistic terms; and (iv) can be interpreted in
         terms of resource management implications. The communication of climate
         information in simple terms and local languages is key. The probabilistic nature of
         forecasts must be explicit to avoid misunderstanding and mistrust. These challenges



                                                20
          need to be addressed through participatory and demand-driven approaches, concepts
          which have been successfully implemented by the baseline project.
   (ii)   Financially attractive and sustainable land and water management strategies are key to
          successfully promoting climate adaptation. Whether in arid areas (where traditional
          natural resource management regimes have often been abandoned), semi-arid areas
          (where increasing resource degradation threatens agricultural and pastoral livelihoods),
          or watershed areas (where flooding and drought imperil ecosystem services),
          communities are well aware of the need for greater attention to sustainable land and
          water management. They cannot easily meet this need because of issues related to
          communally held resources, limited funding, and limited capacity to improve
          management strategies. The proposed project will help to: improve community
          monitoring of the resource base; develop sustainable resource management plans for
          communities and districts, using a participatory approach; and strengthen local
          institutions to raise awareness of the need for NRM by-laws and regulations and
          improve their enforcement. The key for communities and households to adopt
          sustainable NRM practices is their financial attractiveness from the users` perspective.
          The project will therefore strengthen income-generating activities that are linked to
          sustainable management of resources.
   (iii) There is considerable attention to improving availability and access to water resources,
         but these investments need to be better planned. Permanent water sources, such as
         boreholes, have led to increased degradation in wide areas around the water point.
         Poorly planned dams and pans have been susceptible to high silting rates and have
         often not been maintained appropriately. The project will improve the planning of water
         investments and provide support to water harvesting and management by the
         communities. Irrigation water is most needed during the dry season, when river
         discharge is lowest and the water demand from other competing resource users
         upstream and downstream is greatest (including demand for water for livestock and
         domestic use). This situation highlights the need for: accelerated development of
         multipurpose water storage facilities, at various sizes and scales, and exploration of
         shallow groundwater adjacent to rivers wherever possible. Kenya has one of the lowest
         per capita water storage volumes in the world--less than five cubic meters--which is a
         major source of its vulnerability to floods and droughts. The Environmental
         Management Framework (EMF) defines appropriate criteria and methodologies for
         environmental impact assessments of water and other investments. Project interventions
         will strengthen technical partners` capacity to ensure that technical interventions are of
         high quality and are climate proofed.

C. Fiduciary

62. Governance and results in Bank-financed ASAL activities. Activities currently and
previously supported by the Bank in ASALs have good track records for governance, measurable
results, and arrangements for community monitoring. When additional financing of the baseline
project was approved in 2006, key recommendations to improve project design, implementation,
and supervision were taken on, such as measures to detect fraud and address the risk of fraud.
Institutional risk management was improved through: (i) an Independent Audit Committee at the
Project Steering Committee level, which is mandated to develop and maintain an Institutional


                                                21
Risk Management Policy Framework (IRMPF), oversee internal and external audit functions,
and monitor the implementation of internal control recommendations; (ii) a Finance Committee,
responsible for overseeing the effective use and safe custody of project resources; and (iii) an
internal audit function, responsible for overseeing activities of the project`s accounting and
internal control functions at the national and district levels. Explicit arrangements for public
disclosure and access to information facilitate managerial accountability. Monitoring increased at
the community, district, and national levels. A local accountability issue in 2007 in Tana River
and Nyeri Districts, involving community members and district staff, was dealt with effectively
through government mechanisms. District staff were dismissed and criminal investigations of
civil servants and community leaders is ongoing. The government has confirmed that throughout
the implementation of the proposed project, adequate social accountability mechanisms will be
maintained. These mechanisms include public reporting of the budget, disbursements, fiduciary
review reports, and project audit reports at the national, district, and community levels to ensure
that beneficiary communities and stakeholders participate in the monitoring and use of project
resources.

63. For the past two years, the baseline project has placed greater emphasis on
strengthening governance and accountability at various levels. At the trainers` level, all
METs--from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and line ministries--participated in a 21-
day accountability and governance training course. They conduct frequent visits to Community
Development Committees (CDCs) to check their financial records. At the community level,
training in financial management, procurement, and accountability was strengthened.
Communities are more empowered to hold CDCs accountable. It has become mandatory for
CDCs to report to communities regarding financial matters. In Tana River District, the Financial
and Procurement Manuals have been translated into Kiswahili. Funds are no longer transferred
directly to CDC bank accounts. To increase transparency, the communities are witnessing the
transfer of checks to CDCs.

64. Financial management. Financial management arrangements are already in place under
ALRMP, which was rated moderately satisfactory in the latest ISR. Robust financial
management arrangements have been designed for the project. Detailed project cost estimates/
budgets have been prepared, and arrangements agreed for regular monitoring. The Ministry of
State for Development of Northern Kenya and Other Arid Lands has professionally qualified
accountants (Certified Public Accountants) and other qualified staff to fill key financial
management and internal audit functions. Grant disbursements would be based on quarterly
unaudited Interim Financial Reports (IFRs). Project annual Financial Statements are prepared in
accordance with the Cash Basis Accounting of International Public Sector Accounting Standards.

65. The ministry will open a Designated Account denominated in US dollars in a local
commercial bank acceptable to the Bank, where the GEF Grant proceeds will be deposited.
The ministry will also open a Project Account in local currency from which the project payments
will be made. The Project Account will receive grant funds from the Designated Account. Both
accounts will be opened in local commercial banks acceptable to the Bank. The Grants proceeds
from the Designated Account will be channeled to Project Account and Exchequer Accounts in
the Treasury as required under government procedures.




                                                22
66. In addition to the measures to strengthen institutional financial management systems
outlined earlier, enhanced fiduciary safeguards have been put in place to respond to
identified country-level corruption and weak governance risks. These safeguards take into
account recommendations related to increased fiduciary safeguards from a government-
commissioned Fiduciary and Funds Flow Review by the Internal Audit Department of the
Ministry of Finance, conducted in January­March 2009 for all Bank-funded projects. They also
take into account a detailed implementation review of selected projects in the Kenya portfolio by
the Bank`s Integrity Department. A key recommendation of the Fiduciary and Funds Flow
Review was to track funds issued to communities on a quarterly basis by including an analysis of
outstanding balances at the community level in the IFR. This recommendation was implemented
with the March 31, 2009 IFR. The Bank has strengthened implementation of the IRMPF by
mainstreaming it at the portfolio level via Treasury Circular No.3/2009, which requires all
Accounting Officers in all public institutions in Kenya to adopt and implement an IRMPF. The
Internal Audit Department will provide the necessary technical support in implementing the
IRMPF. It has commenced annual Fiduciary and Funds Flow Reviews of Bank-funded projects.
The implementing ministry`s internal auditors have commenced risk-based, half-yearly internal
audit reviews of their respective Bank-funded projects as part of the implementation of
recommendations from the Fiduciary and Funds Flow Review.

67. Mainstreaming corruption prevention as part of portfolio-level financial management
reform: The Bank has reached an agreement with the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission and
the Treasury to harmonize the prevention of corruption in fiduciary activities of all agencies
implementing Bank projects. This agreement includes: (i) conducting corruption risk assessment;
(ii) developing corruption prevention policies and plans; (iii) setting up corruption reporting
structures; (iv) increasing corruption prevention awareness; and (v) reporting any allegations of
corruption in projects to the Bank.

68. The KACCAL project will be implemented by an existing agency in districts already
under ALRMP. Financial management procedures and capacity will be strengthened by
reviewing the financial management sections of the Project Implementation Plan to develop a
separate Financial Management Manual. The project will also hire four Accounts Clerks in the
four districts. Financial management arrangements will be monitored throughout
implementation, and appropriate capacity-building measures will be taken. Financial
management risk is rated moderate. This rating takes into account the overall governance and
public financial management environment in Kenya. ALRMP II is currently rated moderately
satisfactory as regards financial management.

69. Procurement. Consultancy and technical assistance services, and contracts for goods under
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures,
will be procured centrally by the PCU. The DCUs are responsible for district-level and
intercommunity procurement and for overseeing the smooth implementation of community
procurement. Procurement of goods, works, and services for community-related activities and
micro-projects is done by beneficiary communities under the guidance and supervision of the
respective DCU, using the Bank guidelines for community procurement. Procurement
management to date under ALRMP has been rated satisfactory by the Bank, and capacities at
district and community levels are judged sufficient for efficient and transparent procurement of



                                               23
project-financed assets. Procurement of goods and services under the Grant for the proposed
project will follow the same procedures used under the ongoing operation. Other than vehicles,
computers, cross-cutting studies, and consultancies (for which a Procurement Plan has been
developed), all procurement of goods, equipment, works, and training that will take place at the
district and community levels will not lend itself to international or national procurement
procedures. Government district procurement thresholds are in place. Procurement decisions will
be disclosed by the project on a quarterly basis, in publicly accessible ways that facilitate timely
and effective monitoring and accountability at the community, district, and national levels.

D. Social

70. Social analysis and participation. A number of stakeholders were involved in preparing
the KACCAL through workshops, PRAs, and community outreach. This process was built on the
participatory processes of ALRMP, which included a thorough Social Analysis (SA). That
analysis, along with the project`s participatory plan, has described the various entry points for
stakeholders at all levels. The baseline project has already developed and introduced an effective
participatory approach to service delivery. Community targeting through PRAs enables
communities to articulate their problems, needs, and priorities and request help in mapping the
necessary course of action. The PRAs have also been an effective tool for community
empowerment. The proposed project will implement a differentiated PRA, targeting vulnerable
communities, and enable the development of climate-resilient CAPs.

71. Key social issues identified in the SA are livelihood and coping strategies, the social
inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized groups, and gender mainstreaming inside the
communities in ASAL districts. The Social Analysis (and the key issues discussed below) covers
the broader ALRMP intervention area, but the issues it raises are pertinent (although not always
applicable in their entirety) to the KACCAL districts. Thus the Social Analysis is used to guide
the development of specific community interventions for KACCAL districts.

72. Livelihood and coping strategies. Most ALRMP districts are predominantly pastoral, with
varying levels of farming and other diversification strategies in each district. Clanism is a major
social factor, particularly in the Somali communities of Garissa and Wajir (plus Ijara and
Mandera, although these were not among the study districts). In Tana River, Isiolo, Marsabit,
and Baringo, ethnicity is a major factor. Religion is another factor that characterizes social
organization in these areas and thus influences the targeting and the eventual success of project
implementation. These factors are central to the definition of community and to how
interventions are targeted.

73. Social inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized groups. The SA sought to understand
which groups are likely to be excluded and what barriers the project can address to encourage the
participation of all communities, especially their most vulnerable members. The analysis
identified several groups that were isolated and to some extent excluded from previous project
efforts. These groups include widows, divorcees, urban poor, and street children, among others.
In the study districts, the marginalization of whole communities or groups within a community
results from a combination of factors, including historical influences, ethno-cultural factors,
livelihood strategies, population numbers, and sociopolitical and developmental issues. An



                                                24
Indigenous People Planning Framework (IPPF) has been prepared for the proposed project.
During ASAL SWAp preparation, an additional social assessment will be carried out to locate
indigenous people, determine how they could be affected, and (most important) how project
benefits will be extended to them in a social and culturally acceptable manner.

74. Gender mainstreaming: Lack of gender mainstreaming constrains the effective delivery of
services to communities in ASAL districts. The SA found that men and women traditionally
assumed very distinct roles in most of the communities visited in arid lands, but with time these
roles and the division of labor have changed. Men and women are assuming different roles
depending on the social and economic realities on the ground. The burden on women may
increase through the micro-projects, while not specifically changing their economic situation.
Women-headed households are on the increase because of divorce or the death of spouses
through conflicts and other calamities. Food insecurity forces men and women to move from
rural to urban areas where social support structures are difficult to maintain or nonexistent, thus
increasing the vulnerability of the affected population.

75. The project will promote social inclusion at all levels and give special attention to gender
issues, supporting efforts that will enable both men and women to be well represented in
decision-making in all areas pertaining to the project. If carbon finance activities are supported,
the project will ensure that implementing communities are major beneficiaries of the revenues
generated. Community benefits can be achieved through careful consultation with communities,
advocacy, indigenous people screening, and respective provisions in the carbon finance
documents, including the emission reduction purchase agreement.

E. Environment

76. The proposed project will help Kenya adapt to expected changes in climate that
threaten the sustainability of livelihoods in ASALs. The project will focus on opportunities for
economic diversification to provide Kenya`s rural population with alternative livelihood
perspectives. The project is designed to have mainly positive environmental and social impacts.
Expected positive environmental impacts include: (i) reduced soil erosion on agricultural and
rangelands; (ii) reduced soil nutrient depletion for all dominant land uses; (iii) increased
biodiversity through improved rangeland management; and (iv) reduced siltation of water
reservoirs.

77. The project could result in some adverse environmental impacts that are site-specific
and temporary in nature. The micro-projects will be small in scale, however, and any potential
negative impacts can be avoided or mitigated through the application of the EMF. Negative
impacts could include: (i) threats of contamination and disease around water points, hand pumps,
and other water sources; (ii) unsustainable bush clearing for agriculture, which could degrade
land and potentially affect the local ecosystem; and (iii) risks of overgrazing near water pans,
which could erode soils. To mitigate these and other potential negative impacts, the EMF has
recommended measures such as perimeter fencing, stabilization of walls around embankments,
and other soil conservation measures. Local availability of surface water, especially during the
dry season, could be improved by constructing water pans that arrest and detain surface runoff.
Micro-projects will have significant positive environmental impacts on natural resource



                                                25
management. Examples include community projects to propagate and sell tree seedlings or to
establish greenbelts around settlements to prevent degradation by livestock and collection of
fuelwood.

78.     The EMF will help identify any potential impacts on natural habitats and proposes
mitigation measures. It has provided adequate management measures to mitigate adverse
impacts of any activities in the project intervention areas. Additionally, ALRMP II has prepared
a baseline NRM and ecological survey of the area as well as a national ASAL NRM strategy
which covers the KACCAL districts. The results from these studies will be considered during
micro-project screening and approval.

79.      The project will not support the purchase or induce enhanced use of pesticides.
However, if the project proposes the use of herbicides to clear bush or proposes the use of
irrigation systems that could intensify agriculture and increase pesticide use, the EMF requires
screening for pesticide use to mitigate any potential negative environmental impacts. During
project implementation, any such micro-projects will prepare a brief Integrated Pest Management
Plan that will be in compliance with the World Bank Safeguard Policy OP 4.09. Such Integrated
Pest Management Plans will be prepared and disclosed before micro-project implementation.
Additionally, as recommended in the EMF, training on integrated pest management will be
included as a module for relevant stakeholders. The policy is therefore marked as triggered.

80. Additionally, the training plan recommended by the EMF includes training on some
very specific issues, such as: (i) training to improve awareness of mitigation and protective
measures related to waterborne diseases (such as disinfecting water, boiling water before use,
introducing fish to eat mosquito larvae, and preventing stagnant water from accumulating around
water points); (ii) training to sensitize relevant communities about basic surveillance procedures
to identify potential problems with boreholes, earth dams, water pans, and sand dams (including
silting or signs of potential collapse) at early stages; and (iii) training in the management,
handling, and operation of any resources/funds obtained during the operation of these structures.
These and other training modules will be delivered by the project to a variety of beneficiaries and
stakeholders during the life of the project.

81. KACCAL will build on the outcomes of the baseline project. ALRMP has a CDD
financing mechanism for an open menu of community-based micro-projects which are
developed from the PRA-based CAPs. KACCAL, with the SCCF financing, will facilitate
additional community-based micro-projects by creating a special CDD window with a restricted
menu of activities with a direct impact on preventing and mitigating the consequences of
climate variability and change in the four selected districts. Micro-projects will also support
diversification of livelihoods through non-pastoral on-farm and/or nonfarm enterprises or
educational and vocational opportunities that may help smooth outmigration over time from truly
marginal areas.

provisions of the Bank`s Safeguard Policy on Environmental Assessment OP 4.01. KACCAL
has triggered the Bank`s safeguard policies on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), Natural
Habitats (OP 4.04), Pest Management (OP 4.09), and Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10).

G.       Policy Exceptions and Readiness

83. The project will comply with all applicable Bank policies. The preparation process has
been supported by a PDF B grant in the amount of US$ 290,000, which supported the
preparation of several technical studies. The procurement documents for the first year`s activities
will be completed as part of the revision of the existing Project Implementation Plan for
ALRMP, which will be finalized as a condition of effectiveness.

84. The EMF and IPPF have been disclosed. The revised EMF has been redisclosed for the
KACCAL project in October 2007 in Kenya and in December 2007 in the InfoShop. The
updated EMF, which explicitly includes issues related to indigenous peoples, and the IPPF were
disclosed in October 2009 in Kenya and in the InfoShop.

Climate Change and Development Challenges in the ASALs

1.    Revitalization of the ASALs is key for sustainable economic development in Kenya.
The ASALs cover about 467,200 square kilometers or about 80 percent of the country`s land
mass. Annual rainfall ranges between 150 and 450 millimeters in the arid districts, and between
500 and 850 millimeters in the semi-arid districts. 35 percent of the ASALs are extremely
vulnerable to land degradation and desertification.7 The ASALs account for almost 30 percent of
Kenya`s population. The livestock sector is central to livelihoods and food security, accounting
for 90 percent of employment and 95 percent of household income. Pastoralism and agro-
pastoralism constitute the major livelihoods in the arid districts, while rainfed agriculture is an
additional important economic activity in the semi-arid areas. It is estimated that 70 percent of
the livestock population, with an estimated value of KShs 70 billion, is located in the ASALs.
Pastoralists are also the custodians of the dryland environments inhabited by Kenya`s wildlife,
which contribute to a tourist trade worth more than KShs 50 billion each year.

2.   Economic and political marginalization led to severe underdevelopment of the ASALs,
which is reflected by high poverty levels and low human development. Kenya`s GDP growth
picked up in the first half of the last decade after stagnating for many years, but several factors
have slowed economic growth in recent years. The Kenyan economy grew at 6.1 percent in
2006, up from 5.8 percent in 2005. This recovery has been mainly due to improved
macroeconomic management and progress of some structural reforms. However, the post-
election crisis in late 2007 and early 2008, high international food and fuel prices, the global
financial crisis in 2008­09, and four consecutive failures in seasonal rains, resulting in
widespread drought, brought growth down to 1.7 percent in 2008 and 2.5 percent in 2009.
Poverty and inequity are still major challenges for Kenya. These challenges are particularly
severe in the ASALs, where most districts have poverty rates of more than 70 percent. This
underdevelopment arises for a range of reasons, including climate and agro-ecological factors
and low levels of access to services and markets. Unemployment is particularly high in North
Eastern Province, reaching 40 percent in 2006. Due to their relatively isolated location and
dispersed population, ASALs have long been disadvantaged in public service and infrastructure
provision. This marginalization is manifested in the very low asset and endowment base. In the
North Eastern Province, only 4 percent of the population use electricity, less than one-third has
access to safe water, and 88 percent of adults have not completed primary education.

3.   Extreme climate events and climate variability exacerbate the already high
vulnerability of the ASAL population. Unfavorable agro-ecological and socioeconomic
conditions severely affect the livelihoods of the population in the ASALs. The land is highly
susceptible to degradation and desertification, and annual rainfall is low. Unfavorable
socioeconomic conditions include low access to markets, services, and infrastructure, including

water and sanitation, electricity, financial services, and roads. This high vulnerability is
aggravated by climate-related shocks, climate variability, and livestock-related shocks. In the
North Eastern and Eastern Provinces, 43 percent and 42 percent of households have been
affected by droughts and floods, respectively; 45 percent and 19 percent by livestock thefts or
deaths; and 39 percent and 29 percent by high food prices between 2000 and 2005.

4.   Climate events have severe socioeconomic impacts. The World Bank identified Kenya as
being among the countries with the highest climate-related risk, particularly because of drought.
In the ASALs, about 2 million people are permanently on famine relief, and this number can
approach 5 million during severe droughts. The drought from 1998 to 2000, associated with the
La Niña cycle, caused damages estimated at 16 percent of GDP in each of the following two
years.8 Impacts were felt in a broad range of sectors as the drought led to losses in hydropower,
industrial production, and crop and livestock production, in addition to its health impacts. Aside
from drought, floods are a major constraint to development in Kenya. The cost of the floods
associated with the 1997­98 El Niño cycle was estimated at 11 percent of annual GDP. In other
words, their economic magnitude was comparable to that of the subsequent drought.

Climate Variability and Change in the ASALs: Perceptions, Observations, and Projections

5.   Kenya's climate is defined by its equatorial location, its varied topography, and its
proximity to the Indian Ocean. Along the coast a humid tropical climate predominates. By
contrast, inland areas are largely arid (two-thirds of the country receives less than 500
millimeters of rainfall per year). The short rainy season lasts from October to December and the
long rainy season from March to May. While the largest proportion of annual precipitation falls
during the long rains, the short rains are critical for crop development in many districts.

6.   The arid and semi-arid areas of Kenya experience a high degree of inter-annual
climate variability (Figure A1.1), which is predominantly driven by the El Niño Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Zonal Temperature Gradient (or Indian Ocean Dipole
Mode). Hence, variations in the global sea surface temperature, especially over the equatorial
and Indian Ocean basin, have a strong effect on the weather and climate of Kenya. The warm
phase of ENSO (El Niño) and the Indian Ocean Dipole are associated with above-normal rainfall
and flooding. During El Niño years, the entire country tends to experience greater rainfall. The
change is particularly pronounced in the arid districts and associated with significant risk of
flooding. By contrast, during the cold phase of ENSO (La Niña), Kenya frequently experiences
extreme drought.

7.    Increased rainfall in El Niño years also yields positive effects, including revitalizing
vegetation and improving pastures for livestock. Instead of improving their assets by taking
advantage of these positive effects, however, communities often deplete their assets because they
are ill equipped to cope with El Niño`s negative effects, such as flooding or the spread of water-
and vectorborne diseases. The continuing ramifications for livelihoods can be significant when
El Niño`s serious weather events are followed by the droughts characteristics of La Niña, as in
1998.

8.    Climate-related risks are perceived as the biggest challenge by communities in the
ASALs. Communities are the most vulnerable stakeholders in the ASALs. Communities in four
ALRMP districts (Turkana, Marsabit, Garissa, and Malindi) were consulted about their risk
perceptions and strategies for coping and adaptation. These districts cover a range of
environmental characteristics and livelihood activities. Turkana, Marsabit, and Garissa are arid
districts, while Malindi is semi-arid to subhumid. Livelihood activities covered in the community
assessments included pastoral activities (Turkana, Garissa, Marsabit), agropastoral activities
(Garissa, Marsabit), fisheries (Turkana--freshwater--and Malindi), and mixed farming
(Malindi). The risks ranked by communities are either directly or indirectly linked to climate
(Figure A1.2). Drought (ranked second for present and future) and floods represent extreme
climate events with slow and fast onsets. Food insecurity and water scarcity are basically
outcomes of these events, but they may be exacerbated by other factors. Many human and
livestock diseases (ranked third and fourth) are also triggered by climate events. For example,
outbreaks of malaria and Rift Valley fever are closely linked to ENSO events; the same may be
true for crop pests and diseases. Finally, insecurity may be triggered indirectly by adverse
climate conditions, which may promote cattle poaching and robbery as coping strategies.

Figure A1.3: Current dominant risk concerns expressed by communities in Garissa, Malindi,
Marsabit, and Turkana

9.   Communities' perceptions of risk vary considerably across districts (Figure A1.3). In
the arid district of Garissa, floods are a major concern, aside from drought. The high ranking of
livestock diseases may be explained by the outbreak of Rift Valley fever after the floods in 2006.
In comparison to Garissa, in Turkana and Marsabit food security is a greater concern, which may


                                                                     31
be explained by the comparatively weaker road infrastructure and less reliable access to food aid.
Despite more favorable climate conditions, communities in Malindi rank food insecurity the
highest, perhaps because the small fractions of land they cultivate make them vulnerable to crop
failures.

10. Changes in Kenya's climate can already be detected through analysis of observational
data. Northwestern Kenya, particularly the arid district of Turkana, is experiencing increases in
rainfall, while minor to large decreases of precipitation are observed over most other areas of
Kenya (Figure A1.4). Just as total precipitation is changing, so are the characteristics of the rainy
seasons, with significant differences across regions. In northeastern Kenya, the mean variance in
duration of the short rains is about 26 days. The length of the short rains has been increasing over
the period of analysis (approximately 30 years) by about two weeks. The rains appear to be
ending later rather than starting earlier. Although this could be perceived as a positive
development, year-to-year fluctuations in the duration of the short rains also appear to be
increasing, suggesting that planning is becoming even more uncertain.




Figure A1.4: Observed changes in precipitation over Kenya. The positive (negative) loadings depict
increased (decreased) rainfall within the recent decades.

11. In contrast to northern Kenya, in eastern and southern districts the short rains have
been decreasing by about two weeks over the period of analysis. This decrease is consistent
with the Dipole Mode, in which northeastern Kenya is increasingly wetter and the eastern and
southern areas are drying up. The year-to-year fluctuations are becoming more extreme,
potentially increasing the burden on the climate-sensitive sectors of this region. The short rains
appear mainly to be starting later rather than withdrawing earlier. Droughts seem to have
occurred with greater intensity in the past decade than in previous decades. The droughts of
1998/99, 2005, and 2009 are recent examples of the devastating consequences and potentially
crippling impacts of drought on climate-sensitive economic sectors.


                                                 32
12. The characteristics of the long rains are also changing. In northern Kenya, the changes
are similar to changes in the short rains, although less pronounced. In southern Kenya, the long
rains show a drying trend.

13. Projections based on Global Climate Models indicate that temperatures in Kenya will
increase further. A recent analysis of climate models9 suggests that the average annual
temperature is likely to increase by 2.5­3 degrees Celsius, but the warming could be as high as 5
degrees Celsius. In addition, other recent analytical work10 indicates an increase in precipitation
for Kenya at an aggregate level. The models and scenarios selected suffer from considerable
uncertainty and inconsistency, however. It is possible that the drying trend currently observed in
some parts of the country may give way to an increase in average rainfall over time. However,
this does not mean that the rains will no longer fail in arid and semi-arid districts. Instead, the
rains are expected to become more erratic, with dry and wet spells.

14. Even if rainfall increases throughout Kenya, an increase will not necessarily translate
into an improved water balance. Gains in precipitation may be offset by increases in
evaporation rates due to the concomitant rise in temperature. The water balance also depends on
how the rain falls--in intense, erratic downpours or in a more equally distributed pattern across
the seasons.

15. These results underscore the importance of managing across the entire spectrum of
climate conditions in the ASALs. Climate change is already leading to more erratic and
variable rainy seasons. To better manage the continuous high risk of drought in the region,
people need to protect their livelihoods more effectively from the effects of intense rainfall and
become better equipped to benefit from the positive effects of above-normal rainfall. Managing
extremely dry and wet conditions will become more important as the climate changes.

Relevant Policies and Strategies for ASAL Development and Disaster Management

16. The Government of Kenya is giving greater attention to the development of the ASALs
to unleash their full economic and livelihood potential. Kenya`s Vision 2030, which follows
the Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation, includes enhanced
equity and wealth creation opportunities for the poor as one of its main pillars. This pillar
explicitly states that special attention has to be given to investments in the ASALs. The Vision
2030 also emphasizes managing the resource base of the ASALs, because it underpins the
development of many sectors, including agriculture and livestock, water, tourism, health, and
education. The Vision 2030 also highlights that Kenya will enhance disaster preparedness in all
disaster-prone areas and improve the capacity for adaptation to climate change.

17. The government also prepared the National Policy for the Sustainable Development of
Arid and Semi Arid Lands. The policy is awaiting cabinet approval. It enhances the role of
communities in ASAL development, with a focus on longer-term planning. Its main objective is
to enhance food security, increase living standards, and reduce dependency on food aid by the

ASAL population. It envisages a reduction in the vulnerability of the population and an increase
in capacities to adapt to climate change. Its priorities include natural resource and environmental
management, integration of agro-pastoralism, support to mixed farming, water resource
management, diversification in livestock, promoting sustainable land and natural resource
management and use, and active adaptation to longer-term climate risks. The policy highlights a
number of capacity-related constraints, such as inadequate development of local human
resources, poor livestock marketing, limited health and movement control systems, and
inadequate provision of basic services. In addition, the disaster management outlook is focused
on providing food aid and emergency responses rather than on establishing long term solutions
for sustainable livelihoods in a situation of heightened climate risk.

18. KACCAL is guided by the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2004) and the Kenya
Strategy for Revitalizing Agriculture (2005), which emphasize the importance of reducing risk
and vulnerability for groups that rely on natural resources for their livelihoods. The project also
contributes to the objectives of the draft land policy, the draft ASAL policy, and the draft disaster
management policy.

     KENYA ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN ARID AND SEMI-ARID LANDS
                            (KACCAL) PROJECT

1.   The World Bank supports several projects that in different ways contribute to
increasing Kenya's capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate variability and change.
These projects focus on various sectors, such as agriculture, environment, and natural resource
management. Some of the climate-related activities foster synergies between mitigation and
adaptation, in particular the carbon finance operations. All of these projects will provide useful
lessons for the proposed project.

2.    Natural Resource Management Project (NRM). This project aims to enhance the
institutional capacity to manage water and forest resources in a sustainable and participatory
way. It involves water resource management and irrigation, management of forest resources, and
livelihood investments in the upper Tana catchment. Most of the project`s activities contribute to
increased climate resilience through capacity building and sound management of natural
resources.

3.   Western Kenya Community Driven Development and Flood Mitigation Project
(WKCDD&FM). The objective of this project is to empower local communities to engage in
sustainable and wealth-creating livelihood activities and reduce their vulnerability to flooding.
The project supports an early warning system for flood mitigation as well as improved floodplain
management for major rivers in Western Kenya. In addition, detailed planning and preparation
for longer-term investments to provide greater protection against flooding, such as a
multipurpose dam, will be undertaken but not financed by the present investment.

4.   Kenya Agricultural Productivity and Agribusiness Project. The project`s development
objective is to increase agricultural productivity and incomes of participating smallholder
farmers in the project area. Project activities will contribute to these objectives by transforming
and improving the performance of agricultural technology systems, empowering stakeholders,
and promoting the development of agribusiness in the project area. The Project has four
components: (i) policy/institutional and project implementation; (ii) agricultural research
systems; (iii) agricultural extension and farmer and other stakeholder empowerment; and, (iv)
agribusiness and market development.

5.   Kenya Agricultural Productivity and Sustainable Land Management. This project aims at
assisting agricultural producers to adopt environmentally-sound land management practices
without sacrificing their economic welfare. It particularly focuses on strengthening the capacity
of agricultural producers to adopt sustainable land management practices and technologies to
mitigate land degradation and achieve greater productivity of crops, trees, and livestock. It also
assists agricultural producers to adopt alternative livelihood options where non-degrading
production methods are not feasible to reduce the pressure on natural resources. By addressing
land degradation, this project also deals with the vulnerability to future climate shocks.

6.  Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management. The project seeks to improve the
productivity and sustainability of land use systems in selected watersheds in the Nzoia, Yala, and

Nyando River basins through adoption of an integrated ecosystem management approach. It
supports on- and off-farm conservation strategies and develops capacity in local communities
and institutions to identify, formulate, and implement integrated ecosystem management
activities (including both on-and off-farm land use planning), capturing local and global
environmental benefits.

7.   Practical working linkages will and are being sought with other GEF projects in
Kenya that address land degradation and agricultural biodiversity. The project is closely
linked to the UNDP-implemented SCCF grant, which will implement similar activities as
KACCAL in Mwingi District. Links with other initiatives are also sought. The GEF-UNDP
Indigenous Vegetation Project has developed useful site-based participatory planning methods in
Arid Districts using indigenous technologies for rangeland management. The GEF­United
Nations Environment Program undertakes work relevant to the ASALs through two targeted
research initiatives: Land Use Change Analysis as an Approach for Investigating Biodiversity
Loss and Land Degradation, which includes southern Kenya, and the global program Land
Degradation Assessment in the Drylands. Experiences from these projects will provide useful
lessons. The United Nations Environment Program`s support to the Government of Kenya for
National Capacity Self Assessment processes will lay a foundation for synergies through the
National Environmental Management Agency. The United Nations Environment Program`s
Desert Margins Program again offers useful lessons.

indirectly increasing the adaptive capacity of several stakeholders. A detailed list of these
projects is provided below. They cover various sectors, including livestock, agriculture, and
natural resource management. Some projects explicitly address climate change capacity building,
drought management, specific challenges in the (semi)arid lands, and climate change mitigation.
A continuous dialogue on these activities occurs with development partners and the government
through a climate change thematic group.

   KENYA ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN ARID AND SEMI-ARID LANDS
                          (KACCAL) PROJECT

1. The M&E system of KACCAL will be fully integrated in the already established and
functioning M&E system of the ALRMP. The baseline project set up an M&E Unit to assist
project management in: (i) establishing a system of routine records and periodic monitoring
reports at the community, district, and national levels and (ii) to support and undertake a
program of periodic evaluations, including the final evaluation. The first component focuses
mainly on project implementation--specifically, on the delivery of inputs, activities, and
outputs. It will be a continuous process, which will collect information about actual
implementation of project activities compared to those scheduled in the Annual Work Plans. To
this end, the first component will monitor the delivery of quality outputs in a timely manner,
identify problems and constraints (including technical, human resource, and financial
constraints), make clear recommendations for corrective actions, and identify and share lessons
learned and best practices. This kind of information will be summarized in project
implementation quarterly reports by ALRMP/ASAL SWAp and DSGs in the pilot districts.

2. Based on the first component, the evaluation component of the M&E system will focus
on outcomes and impacts. Data and information collected will be used to measure the status of
the agreed outcome indicators. Independent consultants will be contracted by ALRMP to prepare
the project`s Implementation Completion Report. The Mid-Term Review will determine how
much progress has been made towards achieving the project`s outcomes and will suggest
corrective actions if necessary. The review will, among other things: (i) review the efficiency,
effectiveness, and timeliness of project implementation; (ii) analyze effectiveness of
implementation and partnership arrangements; (iii) identify issues requiring decisions and
remedial actions; (iv) identify lessons learned about project design, implementation, and
management; (v) highlight technical achievements for knowledge sharing; (vi) analyze whether
the project is on track to achieve the expected results; and (vii) propose any mid-term
adjustments to the project design, if necessary. The findings of this continuous process will be
communicated through quarterly implementation reviews, semi-annual progress reports, and
other technical reports.

3. The institutional setup of the M&E system will rely, as much as possible, on the
structure and institutions involved in the baseline project. The M&E Specialist in the PCU of
the ALRMP/ASAL SWAp will have overall responsibility for coordinating all M&E activities
conducted as part of KACCAL. This Specialist, who will report directly to the National Project
Coordinator, will compile information, data, and reports from different levels; conduct quality
checks; provide feedback to decentralized counterparts; and analyze data to compute the selected
indicators. Based on specific project needs, project staff will carry out internal M&E work, as
well as entrust their M&E tasks to partner agencies and external consultants.

4. ALRMP strengthened and institutionalized M&E capacity at the district and
community levels, and KACCAL will build on this achievement. The PCU M&E Specialist
will interact directly with counterparts in the DCU to ensure timely delivery and exchange of
data, information, and reports of high quality from the pilot districts to the national level. Given


                                                39
the project`s participatory nature, the DSGs and the communities are particularly important for
the KACCAL/ALRMP M&E system. The DSGs are composed of local leaders and technical
staff of district and partner agencies. These members are receiving M&E training and are
responsible for collecting data, making quantitative and qualitative assessments, and preparing
M&E reports at the district and community level. The DSGs will interact directly with the DCUs
on all relevant M&E issues. Each district is encouraged to identify and undertake evaluation
studies of a diagnostic and troubleshooting nature in response to information emerging from
monitoring activities. These studies will receive technical support from the national M&E Unit.

5. Communities implementing and benefiting from the project will also be involved in
project M&E. Community-based M&E will regularly track the performance of the micro-
projects. This work will be enhanced through social accountability mechanisms (such as the
community scorecard and report card systems, social audits, and participatory budgeting and
expenditure reviews) and through participatory poverty assessments. Information obtained from
community-based M&E will be linked closely with the project`s public awareness and
communications initiatives. Community-based M&E will provide a steady flow of qualitative
information on the performance of services, enhance stakeholders` engagement in continuously
reviewing progress, and offer the opportunity to take action when performance is not adequate.

6. A Results Framework has been prepared and summarizes the Project Development
Objective, project outcome indicators, intermediate outcome indicators, and the use of project
outcome and intermediate outcome information. This information will be used to track progress
towards the project development objective and change the project design if necessary. Sources of
information for assessing the status of key performance indicators will include: (i) data collected
through the project`s MIS, such as date from progress, technical, and financial reports; (ii) geo-
referenced ecological data and natural resource mapping information; and (iii) and participatory
surveys and evaluations.

7. ALRMP recently finished implementing its MIS. The customized MIS is designed for
managing all operations under KACCAL. It will be used to guide project implementation and
elaborate on the results chain. Thus it will not only perform the function of managing project
data but will enable the project management teams to monitor and evaluate the performance of
individual project components and subcomponents. It will improve the capacity of project
management teams to design efficient work plans that translate resources into results and
ultimately achieve the project development objective.

                            Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
     KENYA ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN ARID AND SEMI-ARID LANDS
                            (KACCAL) PROJECT

1.    The project has three components: (i) climate information products, policy, and
advocacy; (ii) climate risk management at the district level; and (iii) community-driven
initiatives for climate resilience. The latter two components will be implemented in four ASAL
districts, with similar activities implemented in a fifth district with funding from a UNDP­SCCF
grant. All three components are contributing directly to the integration of climate actions into
development processes in the ASALs, in particular through the ALRMP/ASAL SWAp.

2.   The four pilot districts, Garissa, Turkana, Marsabit, and Malindi, cover a wide range
of ecological and socioeconomic conditions relevant for adaptation in Kenya. These districts
were selected to include districts that: (i) have arid and semi-arid areas; (ii) are exposed to
climate risks arising from multiple hazards (droughts and floods) and are likely to experience
continuing climate variability; (iii) include a range of livelihood types (pastoral, agro-pastoral,
agricultural, natural resource based) (iv) have varied implementation capacity; and (v) are among
the poorest, most vulnerable districts.

3.     Malindi is a coastal, semi-arid district with mixed livelihoods. Agriculture (cash and food
crops) accounts for half of the land use. Lowland livestock and ranching are also important land
uses. Malindi is affected seasonally by flooding from the Sabaki River. Turkana, Garissa, and
Marsabit are arid districts. Turkana lies in the northwestern corner of Kenya. It consists largely
of low-lying plains, with a few isolated hilly areas drained by seasonal rivers that flow into Lake
Turkana. This largely dry district has erratic, unimodal rainfall. This area is projected to get
wetter in the future. Livelihoods are mainly livestock based, with some marginal cultivation.
Garissa, in North Eastern Province, is a large arid district covering 7.45 percent of the country.
It is low lying and abuts the Tana River. Frequent droughts and unreliable rains make it difficult
to manage pastures for livestock. Irrigation is practiced along the river, which has recently been
subject to severe seasonal flooding. Marsabit, bordering Ethiopia in northern Kenya, is the
largest district in Kenya, covering about 11.2 percent of the country`s area. It includes both arid
and some semi-arid areas around Mount Marsabit. The population is nomadic in general, with a
few sparsely populated settlements. The predominant land use is rangelands for livestock, with
cultivation around Mount Marsabit. Dryland forests on Mount Marsabit and Mount Kulal are
threatened by severe degradation.

Component 1: Climate information products, policy, and advocacy

4.   National institutions need to systematically integrate climate change into development
plans and programs. This effort will require a culture of climate awareness, enhanced capacity
for effective climate risk management at various levels, and improved coordination and
knowledge sharing among the relevant institutions. Effective climate risk management involves
managing the full range of variability and balances hazard management with efforts to capitalize
on opportunities. It combines the systematic use of climate information with technologies that
reduce vulnerability among the most vulnerable segments of the population. The capacity to
better understand and respond to current and future climate risks must be strengthened. This
component aims at increasing the capacity of national institutions to generate and disseminate


                                                45
knowledge on climate impacts and risks and identify adequate adaptation options that are
tailored to the specific needs of ASALs.

5.    Institutional efforts focused on disaster risk management and climate change need
better coordination. Programs and activities in this field are largely fragmented, which has led
to inefficiencies and duplication. This component will address this challenge by supporting
improved coordination and knowledge and information sharing among the relevant institutions.
The institutional setup and leverage of ALRMP will be used to bring crucial stakeholders
together, create awareness of the challenges of climate variability and change, and coordinate
activities.

Subcomponent 1.1: Development of climate-related knowledge products to inform climate risk
management strategies in ASALs

6.   Strategic planning of climate change adaptation programs needs to be informed by
relevant and tailored climate information products. This critical need was identified by a
review of climate information and stakeholder consultations to better guide adaptive measures in
the ASALs. Several knowledge products are envisaged, including:
     (i) Climate risk profiling. This activity will strengthen monitoring processes and the
         capacity for climate risk management at the national level and in selected districts. The
         first step will be to assess the potential for rescuing and digitizing historical climate
         data. The data collection capacity of meteorological services and other stakeholders will
         be assessed. Data to be collected include monthly, seasonal, and annual climate
         characteristics (averages, variability). Extremes and return periods will be characterized
         using trend analysis. To the extent possible, raw climate information (observations and
         predictions) will be combined with data on natural resources and socioeconomic
         conditions of interest (such as soil water status, pest or disease risk, the condition of
         vegetation, and crop yields) to assess climate risks in agricultural, livestock, and natural
         resource based production and explore interventions to reduce those risks. The
         information and profiles that are generated will be disseminated through enhanced
         ALRMP bulletins and the early warning system.
     (ii) Refined and downscaled climate scenarios. This activity will improve the resolution and
          format of climate change scenarios that are available only at the global or regional level.
          Refined scenarios will help assess the implications for sustaining livelihoods in ASALs.
          Climate scenarios will be linked with socioeconomic and environmental data (such the
          International Livestock Research Institute`s data sets on ecosystems, water resources,
          and development indicators). The information generated in this way would guide
          dialogues on ASAL strategies at the national and district levels.
     (iii) Assessment of adaptive measures. This activity focuses on climate-proofing and
           assessing adaptation strategies and investments in the selected districts. The suitability
           of current and traditional risk-mitigating measures will be assessed, and benefits and
           shortcomings will be identified to inform the design of new strategies. Approaches will
           be developed for decision makers at various levels, including METs, to identify
           promising adaptation activities and screen them for climate resilience. Such approaches
           would also be used to screen community investments. Data and information directly
           relevant to climate-proofing ALRMP/ASAL SWAp investments and activities will be

         made publicly available to stimulate external research, the development of knowledge,
         and scaling-up.
     (iv) Integration of climate change information into early warning and information systems.
          Emphasis will be placed on refining information formats and dissemination structures
          and on improving the integration of climate change information into existing bottom-up
          and top-down early warning systems, such as ALRMP, FEWSNET, LINKS, the IGAD
          Climate Predictions and Applications Center (ICPAC), and FAO forecasts. Under
          KACCAL, the early warning system will broaden its focus to enhance its capacity to
          detect early signs of stress in agricultural and natural ecosystems based on the
          integration of climate information.
     (v) Knowledge and advisory service partnerships. The project will develop targeted
         knowledge partnerships between ALRMP and various key national and international
         institutions and programs, such as the Kenya Meteorological Department, ICPAC,
         Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI), International Livestock Research
         Institute and other research centers supported through the Consultative Group on
         International Agricultural Research, and South­South learning partnerships. Information
         products will be informed and tested by ALRMP/ASAL SWAp District Officers and the
         District Steering Committees. The information products will be tested based on
         community feedback and refined accordingly. Partnerships, study tours, and knowledge
         exchanges are critical in a rapidly evolving field like climate change. Given that many
         countries in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere face similar challenges, efficient and
         effective responses to climate change require that experience, knowledge, technologies,
         and lessons from other programs, researchers, and communities are transferred and
         shared.

7.    This subcomponent will finance (i) international and local technical assistance to develop
these information and knowledge products; (ii) training in application and maintenance of these
products; (iii) software development and procurement of required equipment; (iv) services for
collecting and digitizing relevant climate, socioeconomic and agroecological data; (v)
workshops, study tours, and exchange visits between relevant national and international
institutions and programs; (vi) climate risk knowledge and advisory service partnerships with
local and international institutions, as needed; and (vii) related operating costs to carry out the
above.

Subcomponent 1.2: Integration of climate action into ASAL development strategies and
programs

8.   The integration of climate change into development strategies requires a
comprehensive approach, including capacity building, policy dialogue, and sound
communication. The knowledge products that are developed need to be complemented with
capacity building to ensure their practical use and maintenance. They can also be used as part of
the policy dialogue and awareness raising.

9.    The following coordination and capacity-building activities will be supported:

      (i) Strengthening the technical capacities of ALRMP/ASAL SWAp and other institutions
          on climate change. A combination of additional technical staffing and capacity

                                                47
          development initiatives will reinforce technical capacities with respect to climate
          change. The objective is to assist ALRMP/ASAL SWAp in advancing the integration
          of climate risk management perspectives into planning frameworks at the national
          level (such as KFSM, sectoral strategies through the Kenya Food Security Steering
          Group) and district level (DSGs) and to strengthen the flow of information between
          these entities and levels. While technical assistance will be used to develop some of
          the knowledge products listed in the first subcomponent, it is important that in-country
          expertise is built to use and maintain these products. It is particularly important for all
          relevant stakeholders across (and beyond) the ALRMP institutional setup to be trained.
     (ii) Project implementation support to the ALRMP/ASAL SWAp Secretariat, including
          M&E of project processes and performance. The ALRMP­KACCAL secretariat will
          be responsible for ensuring appropriate documentation and reporting on lessons
          learned to facilitate replication and scaling up within ASALs as well as other areas
          affected by climate change, in the region and beyond. This effort will require
          additional resources, which will be made available under this project. The integration
          of climate change issues into the M&E system for ALRMP/ASAL SWAp (including
          the newly established MIS) requires special attention. Given the innovative character
          of KACCAL, it is important that issues and challenges are detected and addressed
          early.
     (iii) Policy dialogue and awareness raising through targeted consultations and advisory
           products. The knowledge and advisory services supported by this project will build
           capacity on climate risk management through existing coordination mechanisms such
           as the KFSM and KFSG. A variety of mechanisms will be used, including periodic
           policy notes and targeted training. The newly established Ministry of State for the
           Development of Northern Kenya and Other Arid Lands in the Office of the Prime
           Minister, with its close coordination with Special Programs under the Office of the
           President, is well placed to facilitate this capacity building.

10. Project funds will be used for: (i) salaries for technical staff recruited for KACCAL
implementation; (ii) training and workshops for ALRMP staff, members of the KFSM, District
Officers, and other relevant stakeholders; (iii) technical study tours and exchange visits,
including South­South learning events; (iv) independent evaluation consultancies and technical
assistance; and (v) operational support, equipment, and material for the ALRMP/KACCAL
Secretariat.

Component 2: Climate Risk Management at the District Level

11. This component aims to strengthen climate-resilient planning at the district level by
integrating a climate risk management perspective in district planning processes, identifying
opportunities for public and private sector investments, and assessing opportunities for economic
diversification to reduce vulnerabilities to climate risks over time.

12. Climate change, combined with current land use patterns, is likely to lead to further
marginalization of some areas and activities. The communities that are affected will need to
diversify their income sources and find new sources of income that are less vulnerable to the
expected directions of climate change. This subcomponent will give specific attention to
identifying livelihoods at risk, assessing opportunities, and identifying ways to bring the private
sector into constructive responses. It will assess the best means of adapting livelihood systems,

                                                48
including agricultural and livestock management strategies, without compromising productivity
objectives. All major stakeholders at the district and local levels would need to engage in
capacity building and planning processes, in particular the ALRMP/ASAL SWAp District
Coordination Units (DCUs), DSGs, METs, local government, civil society organizations, and
NGOs.

Subcomponent 2.1: Capacity building to integrate climate risk management into district
planning processes

13. District officials and others at the district level need the capacity to use relevant
climate information and knowledge products from all levels. District officials (including the
DCUs, DSGs, local leaders, and other stakeholders) will be enabled to assess risks posed by
climate variability and change and to adapt their early warning systems, development planning,
and actions accordingly. These actors will have increased capacity to identify and support
adaptation opportunities, whether through improved planning of current investments or climate-
proofing of new investments.

14. The Mobile Extension Teams (METs) will play a key role in providing technical advice
on climate change adaptation to communities and households. In ALRMP, the METs have
proven particularly useful in providing advisory services in the socioeconomic and agro-
ecological setting of the (semi)arid lands. They successfully assist communities throughout the
community development process. The METs have already received substantial training under the
baseline project, but KACCAL will add specific technical capacity in climate change adaptation.
METs serve as the crucial link between the generation of climate information and its practical
application. They will master and interpret climate change information and communicate it in a
user-friendly way. Through feedback from communities, METs will ensure that the knowledge
products provide useful, relevant guidance on adaptation measures in a format that is
comprehensible to their clients. Management responses by communities will be monitored, and a
combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches, including PRAs, will be used to assess
the usefulness for end-users of the knowledge products and information provided.

15. District Coordination Units (DCUs), District Steering Groups (DSGs), and other
district and local stakeholders need to integrate climate change adaptation into district
plans and programs. The development of district and local plans has been strengthened under
ALRMP. By raising awareness and offering training to a range of stakeholders, KACCAL will
ensure that these plans explicitly consider the challenges of climate change and help to improve
resilience to its effects. District institutions will learn to use climate information products
generated as part of the first project component. The METs and district teams will be trained to
collect local and traditional information from communities to monitor vulnerability and to design
better adaptation and coping strategies.

16. SCCF funding will be used for: (i) training and workshops for district and local officials;
(ii) technical assistance and consultancies for scrutinizing risk in ALRMP investments; (iii)
specific equipment and software to use climate knowledge products; and (iv) operational costs
(including costs of PRAs and monitoring).

Subcomponent 2.2: Support for "climate-smart" public and private investments



                                               49
17. This subcomponent will support the implementation of selected public and private
sector interventions, identified in the district plans, that promote resilience to climate
change. These investments will typically be at a scale above the community level (the
microwatershed or intercommunity level, for example) and will complement community
investments for greater climate change resilience. These activities may include public­private
sector partnerships. Investment areas include, but are not limited to, infrastructure to manage
floods and droughts (including small check dams, water pans); improving livestock monitoring
and response systems (for example, monitoring conditions and risk factors for livestock diseases
such as Rift Valley fever, supporting livestock off-take management, and diversifying animal
stocks); natural resource management investments (water source rehabilitation and agroforestry);
and training in business/enterprise skills for investments that add value to ASAL products.

18. This subcomponent will also facilitate public­private partnerships to link communities
to markets. It will support feasibility studies and pilot measures where appropriate. Areas of
interest include the promotion of sustainable production, value addition, and marketing of ASAL
products such as dates, gum, aloe, jatropha, and sisal; promotion of sustainable production, value
addition and marketing of indigenous crops and vegetables; provision of livestock market
information through FM radio and mobile phones. The modalities of these incremental
investments will follow the ALRMP/ASAL SWAp implementation structures as closely as
possible. The project will work with industry groups and entities such as the Network of Gums
and Resins in Africa to support their engagement with communities in sustainably extracting and
marketing ASAL products.

19. This subcomponent will finance: (i) feasibility studies and preparation of public and
private investments; (ii) civil works and equipment for approved district-level investments
(public and private); and (iii) training for community/private investors.


Component 3: Community-driven Initiatives for Climate Resilience

20. KACCAL will enhance ALRMP's CDD approach to foster appropriate adaptation
strategies and investments at the community level. In the ASALs, livelihoods become
vulnerable when multiple climate and non-climate risk factors and constraints converge. Non-
climate factors include physical, human, technological, socioeconomic, and institutional
constraints. ALRMP helps communities address many of the non-climate factors, and KACCAL
will help them to address the climate factors more directly and explicitly. The ALRMP CDD
Manual will be revised to incorporate the KACCAL project.

Subcomponent 3.1: Support for community capacity building

21. Communities find it difficult to adapt autonomously and solely on the basis of
indigenous knowledge to increasingly frequent and severe climate events. Communities are
well aware that climate anomalies are on the rise and affecting their local environment, but they
have limited understanding of the scale or scope of the causes of these anomalies, their potential
long-term impact, or opportunities to limit those impacts. Where measures for adapting to
climate change (in addition to traditional coping measures) are known, communities are
constrained in adopting them. ALRMP includes substantial training to increase communities`
ability to identify, implement, and monitor priority community investments, but investments to


                                               50
manage climate risk are not prioritized because communities still lack awareness about climate
risk management.

22. This subcomponent will foster awareness and advocacy related to climate risk and
build capacity within communities to integrate climate risk into ALRMP/ASAL SWAp
processes. Capacity building will focus on (i) strengthening awareness of the type of climate
risks faced by specific communities; (ii) strengthening their ability to interpret, evaluate, and
respond to climate forecasts and related information; (iii) improving awareness of the links
between environmental degradation and climate-related vulnerabilities; and (iv) aiding
communities to incorporate climate-related risk factors in their action plans and in developing
options to resist climate shocks. Financing will be provided for: (i) training and workshops for
communities, including community-based monitoring and (ii) training for developing enhanced
(climate-resilient) community action plans, including operating costs.

Subcomponent 3.2: Support for community based micro-projects

23. This subcomponent will finance grants to communities to implement micro-projects
identified in the climate-resilient CAPs. The project will enter into micro-project grant
agreements with community groups on the basis of new or revised CAPs. Communities will
provide at least 10 percent of the total micro-project cost in kind or cash. At least 80
communities in the pilot districts will be targeted. Potential areas of support include:
       a.    Structural interventions for land and water management. To help communities
             manage land and water resources across the spectrum of climate conditions in the
             ASALs, investments in a variety of measures will be supported, such as land
             management and erosion control, small-scale water harvesting, and water storage
             and management.
        b.    Sustainable agricultural land and livestock management. Micro-projects will help
              to insulate agricultural and livestock production against climate risks by
              promoting sustainable land management methods and technologies (examples
              include intercropping, integrated nutrient management, moisture and soil
              conservation techniques, agroforestry, and drought-tolerant crops) as well as
              rangeland and livestock management practices (including silvopastoralism and
              drought-tolerant pasture species).
        c.    Opportunities to enhance carbon sequestration. Grants will facilitate assessments
              of the technical and financial feasibility of micro-projects focusing on ecosystem
              services, especially opportunities for carbon finance.
        d.    Livelihood enhancement and diversification. Support will be provided for projects
              to help people diversify their livelihoods. Examples include piloting plantations of
              tree species such as Jatropha curcas, Acacia senegal (gum arabic), or Acacia
              seyal, which are suited to semi-arid or arid conditions, have economic value, and
              provide important ecosystem services.
        e.    Credit and micro-insurance. If studies find that innovative credit and micro-
              insurance schemes for ASAL communities are financially viable and technically
              sound, grants will be used to scale up successful mechanisms and facilitate the
              adoption of improved agropastoral practices and other livelihood strategies that
              reduce vulnerability and risks.

                                               51
f.   Human and livestock health. Support for investments to reduce human exposure
     to vector- and waterborne diseases and improve livestock health will be provided
     as appropriate.

                                        Annex 5: Project Costs
   KENYA ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN ARID AND SEMI-ARID LANDS
                          (KACCAL) PROJECT

1. The project cost of the second phase of ALRMP is US$ 60 million. The project covered 21
districts. Additional financing in the same amount enabled the project to expand to 28 districts,
where it continues to emphasize decentralized and community-oriented rural development and
service delivery. The project has concentrated on emergency rehabilitation and immediate
drought recovery. For the duration of the KACCAL project, an estimated US$ 40 million from
both ALRMP II and the ASAL SWAp will strengthen national institutions, strengthen district
capacities, support CDD micro-projects for service delivery and drought rehabilitation, address
immediate needs, and provide the baseline for the KACCAL project. The incremental resources
provided through KACCAL will support the integration of a longer-term perspective in national
and district planning and a variety of local interventions to adapt to climate variability and
change.

                            Annex 6: Implementation Arrangements
   KENYA ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN ARID AND SEMI-ARID LANDS
                          (KACCAL) PROJECT

1. KACCAL builds on substantial management and institutional capacity developed
during the first and second phases of ALRMP. The management structure will be slightly
modified to account for the integration of climate change aspects. The ALRMP Project
Implementation Plan will be modified to reflect these changes. KACCAL will be implemented
over four years and will be managed by the ALRMP/ASAL SWAp Project Coordination Unit
(PCU). One of the success factors of the ALRMP is its institutional location. Locating the PCU
of multi-sectoral, decentralized project such as this in the Prime Minister`s Office is an effective
means of coordinating climate change programs and activities. The PCU will report directly to
the Ministry of State for the Development of Northern Kenya and Other Arid Lands, Prime
Minister`s Office. These arrangements differ from the previous arrangements for ALRMP
because of the division of ministries under the coalition government in 2008. Before the
elections, the PCU was located in the Ministry of State for Special Programs in the Office of the
President, which has the mandate for food security and drought management. Project
implementation in regions and districts was facilitated through the Ministry of State for
Provincial Administration and Internal Security, Office of the President. The PCU has ensured
that the project retains its coordination function, liaising between the Prime Minister`s Office and
the Office of the President, to ensure that recent institutional changes do not negatively affect the
leverage of ALRMP. Strong ties to the Ministry of State for Provincial Administration and the
Ministry of State for Special Programs are ensured through the KFSM and through the
management of the early warning and drought management systems.

2. Under ALRMP, the KFSM became an effective mechanism for intergovernment and
development partner­government coordination for drought and food security. The KFSM
consists of key sectoral ministries and external partners. It is the main body for coordinating food
security actors, operating through a forum where information is exchanged, options debated, and
decisions on activities formulated for referral to the Government of Kenya and donors. This open
forum is characterized by high-level representation from a broad group of organizations at the
national level with interest in food security. It will continue to play a key role in overall drought
management and has been formally linked with government drought and disaster coordination
mechanisms. However, given its closely related mandate, the KFSM will expand its focus under
KACCAL and will also assume responsibility for explicitly coordinating programs and activities
addressing climate change.

3. The PCU has been strengthened throughout the implementation of ALRMP I and II.
Within the PCU, the Project Coordinator is assisted by the Deputy Project Coordinator and four
Component Coordinators. The PCU has been strengthened to reflect the wider geographical
coverage and increased level of activity under ALRMP II. For example, the PCU`s analytical
capacity for improving drought management was strengthened. To manage and implement
KACCAL, the PCU will hire a Technical Expert on climate change issues. The Technical Expert
will possess sound knowledge of the scientific basics of climate change along with practical
experience in designing and implementing cross-sectoral activities to adapt to climate change,
especially in agriculture, livestock, and natural resource management. Other core PCU staff will
be trained in climate change to ensure that climate issues are broadly integrated into project


                                                 55
implementation. The M&E team will be trained to expand their system to account for the
inclusion of KACCAL.

4. At the district level, ALRMP/KACCAL (and the ASAL SWAp) will continue to be
coordinated by the District Coordination Unit (DCU), situated within the district-level
Provincial Administration. Multisectoral, interagency coordination at the district level has been
one of the strengths of the baseline project. The DCU is headed by a Drought Management
Officer, who will act as the district ALRMP/KACCAL Coordinator. He/she is supported by a
Community Development Officer to manage the CDD component, a Training Officer, a Data
Analyst, and three Mobile Extension Team Leaders. In the semi-arid districts, where only natural
resource and drought management are implemented, the Drought Management Officer works
with a Data Analyst and a Finance and Supplies and Procurement Officer. As detailed in the
project description (Annex 4), the district team will be trained to ensure sound implementation of
activities related to climate change under KACCAL.

5. The District Steering Group (DSG) is responsible for planning, approval, and
coordination of all district and community interventions. The DSG is a subcommittee of the
District Development Committee and is composed of local leaders and technical staff of district
and partner agencies. Under ALRMP, the DSGs expanded traditional membership from
government line ministry teams to nongovernmental actors such as NGOs, community-based
organizations, and the private sector. This arrangement has fostered collaboration between
agencies and helped to reduce duplication. The DSG is the key coordinating body for natural
resource and drought management in the district and, under KACCAL, will assume
responsibility for coordinating activities related to climate change adaptation. KACCAL will
enhance the capacity of the DSGs in decision-making processes and planning related to
adaptation.

6. At the district level, guidelines and rules will be developed for the KACCAL funding
mechanism that supports adaptation to climate change. The baseline project provides various
windows of support through which districts and communities can determine their priority
activities, including a drought contingency fund as well as funding for drought preparedness,
various CDD activities, and enhanced local service delivery through the use of the district
services allocation. Under KACCAL a special window for adaptation to climate change will be
opened. Funds will be channeled to community groups under arrangements similar to those of
ALRMP, following the CDD Manual developed and improved under ALRMP II. Under this
Manual, the project will sign a Memorandum of Understanding with each community group,
which would provide basic financial management and accountability arrangements. As for each
of the other funding mechanisms, guidelines and rules will also be developed for the climate
change window. This process will improve the planning and implementation of development
activities at the district and community levels.

7. The project will prepare an Annual Work Plan, including the annual training program and
budgets for all proposed micro-projects to be carried out in the following fiscal year, for review
and approval by the World Bank. A Mid-Term Review will be conducted in 2012, jointly with
the World Bank, aimed at: (i) documenting progress towards project objectives; (ii) identifying
and resolving obstacles to project implementation; (iii) adjusting, in agreement with the World
Bank, targets and corresponding programs to reflect progress achieved in the implementation of
the project as of the date of the review; and (iv) evaluating the project against project
performance indicators.
                                               56
8. Communities bear responsibility for managing KACCAL community interventions.
Communities are defined loosely to allow a variety of community groups in different socio-
cultural settings to participate in the CDD process. Thus far, communities have defined
themselves as groups sharing common resources. Implementation of the recommendations of the
Social Assessment should provide good targeting of marginalized communities that are most
vulnerable to climate change. Community institutions taking on decision-making and fund-
managing responsibilities are strengthened to ensure that they represent the community and have
the appropriate management capacity. Community PRA processes result in CAPs, which are
updated on a regular basis and provide the basis for interventions in CDD. The mobile extension
team concept will be continued and strengthened under KACCAL. The METs are central to
helping communities prepare their action plans and implement them (specifically the METs work
with community members, equipping them with the skills to prioritize and design projects that
meet their needs). Communities in KACCAL pilot areas will also receive procurement and
financial management training, using the Bank guidelines for community procurement, because
they are responsible for procuring the items needed to implement specific community micro-
projects.

9. The institutional structures, especially those anchored in government, will be subject to
revision throughout the implementation phase in view of potential institutional changes
proposed by the new government in line with the constitutional review process.

   KENYA ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN ARID AND SEMI-ARID LANDS
                          (KACCAL) PROJECT


Introduction

1. The financial management assessment covers the financial management functions of the
project-implementing entity, which is the ALRMP PCU, reporting to the Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of State for Development of Northern Kenya and Other Arid Lands in the Prime
Minister`s Office. The Ministry also implements ALRMP II, and the same project team will be
in charge of managing KACCAL. The assessment was based on (i) information obtained from
the implementing entity; (ii) a review of documents such as Auditors` Reports and Management
Letters; (iii) discussion with government and the implementing entity; (iv) the Fiduciary and
Funds Flow Review commissioned by the government, conducted by the Internal Audit
Department of the Ministry of Finance in January­March 2009, and covering all Bank-funded
projects in Kenya; and (v) a review of ALRMP II`s performance.

Country Financial Management Issues

2. The most recent diagnostic work on Kenya's public financial management system is the
Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (draft, September 2006). The assessment reviewed
the government`s performance in the interim since the last Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (in 2001) and Country Assistance Strategy (in 1998). The Country Integrated
Fiduciary Assessment adopted the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability performance
measure framework to diagnose the key challenges facing policy makers, report on recent
progress, and outline priority areas for attention.

3. The Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment highlighted that the government had
been putting new laws and regulations into place to strengthen the public financial
management system. In 2005, the government enacted the Public Procurement and Disposal
Act, which provides for an independent public procurement oversight authority. Parliament also
passed legislation establishing an independent Auditor General`s Office and was expected to
debate new legislation to give that body a stronger role in budget preparation. The government`s
capacity to manage public finances was also strengthened. Over the past two years the budget
preparation process was substantially reformed. Budgetary allocations were reoriented towards
investments in infrastructure and the delivery of services to the poor. Reforms have also led to
more direct participation of stakeholders in reviewing policy choices prior to finalization of the
budget. Budget reporting has improved as well, both through technical changes in the way the
budget is presented and through a dramatic reduction in the audit backlog for central government
operations. It is expected that these reforms will enable Parliament`s Public Accounts Committee
to play a more effective role in reviewing government expenditures and the concerns raised by
these audits, thereby increasing the strength of parliamentary oversight.

4. Significant challenges remain, however. Substantial areas of government spending are not
properly scrutinized. A number of ministries returned funds to the Treasury, underscoring
weaknesses in budget implementation and procurement across the public sector. And while good
progress has been made in addressing the backlog of audits of central government operations,

                                               58
local authorities have yet to produce audited accounts, raising concerns that corruption at this
level remains unchecked.

5. Through its Public Financial Management Reform Strategy, the Government of Kenya
remains committed to strengthening fiduciary safeguards with a view to achieving efficiency
and effectiveness in the use of public funds. With the support of a number of development
partner-assisted initiatives, including the IDA-funded Institutional Reform and Capacity Building
Project, the government is seeking to rapidly enhance the financial accountability framework,
particularly through strengthening legislation related to public financial accounting and audit.

6. Other country-level financial management risks arise from the country's overall
governance environment, a weak judiciary, and corruption concerns. The government has
prepared a governance action plan that has been implemented and is being monitored. The
government has also mandated the setting up of independent oversight committees, especially
the audit and finance subcommittees for public bodies.

7. On the Bank-financed portfolio, project implementation has generally been slowed by
constraints in the flow of resources and limited absorptive capacity arising from
bureaucratic processes. The government is committed to improving portfolio performance.
Agreements have been reached on several key issues in the context of Country Portfolio
Performance Reviews and other discussions. These issues include actions to improve audit
compliance, closer monitoring of project performance by the Ministry of Finance, and
improvements in the flow of project resources, although significant improvements are still
required.

8. The findings of the government-commissioned Fiduciary and Funds Flow Review by
the Internal Audit Department of the Treasury include the following issues related to
financial management: (i) the long delay in funds flow arrangements for most projects,
compounded by having Special/Designated Accounts offshore in commercial banks in London
and Washington; (ii) failure to track funds disbursed to communities in CDD projects through
the project accounting system; (iii) weak internal audit arrangements at the project level and
ineffective audit committees; (iv) delays in rolling out the Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS) have resulted in major weaknesses in country-level accounting
systems and forced projects to use parallel manual accounting systems for financial reporting;
and (v) weaknesses in the budget process at the Treasury, implementing ministry, and project
levels and inadequate and untimely arrival of government counterpart funds. These weaknesses
delay funds flow and affect overall project implementation. They are being addressed through
the Country Portfolio Performance Review 2009 process, and the Permanent Secretary, the
Treasury has formed a high-level Task Team under the Director, External Resources Department
and the Accountant General to implement the findings of the Fiduciary and Funds Flow Report,
with support from the Bank.

Project Financial Management System

9. The project's financial management system will fully use the existing government
financial management systems. It will be anchored in the ongoing Bank-funded ALRMP II.




                                               59
Budgeting

10. Budgeting for the project has been undertaken by the implementing ministry. Detailed
cost tables for the project have been prepared and agreed. The budget process is participatory and
has a high level of community participation. The work plans are prepared at the district level and
passed to the ministry headquarters for checking and onward transmission to the Ministry of
Finance.

11. The project's budgeting system will be consistent with the government's budget system
and will be integrated in the annual budget cycle of the ministry. Existing budgeting systems are
considered sufficient for this purpose.

12. Budget implementation will be monitored using the ministry's financial reporting
systems. As discussed later in this Annex, proposed periodic reporting includes quarterly reports
on project finances, cash flow projection, variance analysis, and review on an ongoing basis
through the IFRs.

Accounting

13. General project accounting. Project activities will be integrated into and accounted for
under the ministry`s accounting systems, which are well established. The codes relating to the
project will be integrated in the Chart of Accounts that match the classification used in respective
periodic financial statements. The ministry`s accounting and reporting systems, which include
General Ledger systems, will be used to account for project resources and activities. System
standards will include (i) monthly balancing of accounts and reconciliation with the ministry`s
general ledger; (ii) arrangements for safe custody and sequential filing of accounting documents;
(iii) timely and accurate production of periodic reports; (iv) reconciliation of subsidiary accounts;
and (v) effective internal control arrangements.

14. Computerized accounting system. The ministry is using the IFMIS software, which is
being rolled out for Central Government Accounting by the World Bank under the Institutional
Reform and Capacity Building Project as part of public financial management reforms. The
IFMIS system is still in its infant stages and has been experiencing some teething problems.
The system has not been rolled out to the district level, where the bulk of the accounting work
for the proposed project will occur. Even at ministry headquarters, IFMIS is currently moving
slowly. Only one module (the general ledger) has been installed. The IFMIS system therefore is
not adequate for project financial reporting. The ministry has therefore been running a manual
parallel system using stand-alone computers to meet the financial reporting requirements of
ALRMP II. Nevertheless, the manual system is assessed as adequate.

15. Community-driven development component accounting. All project funds will be handled
and accounted by the ministry through the PCU. The proposed project has a CDD component
that channels funds to community groups under arrangements similar to those of ALRMP II.
Under ALRMP II, all districts have opened bank accounts to which the funds from the Project
Account are channeled. A CDD Manual has already been developed and implemented under
ALRMP II. The CDD Manual is being revised for KACCAL as a condition of disbursement for
micro-project grants. Under the procedures specified in this manual, the project will sign a
Memorandum of Understanding with each community group, which provides for basic financial
management and accountability arrangements. The beneficiary communities are required to

                                                 60
prepare simplified cash books and to submit basic quarterly financial reports using formats
already agreed upon by the project. Funds are disbursed to communities based on submission of
satisfactory financial reports on a quarterly basis. The project`s District Finance Officers and
Finance Clerks have been involved in training for communities to improve the quality of
financial reports. KACCAL will benefit from these existing CDD arrangements. An additional
financial management requirement introduced as a result of the Fiduciary and Funds Flow
Review by the Internal Audit Department in January 2009 is the tracking of community funds by
way of aged analysis every quarter through the IFRs. This requirement was implemented starting
with the March 31, 2009 IFR.

Staffing

16. At project headquarters. At project headquarters, the Finance and Administration
Coordinator is assisted by an Assistant Finance Officer with respect to accounting functions.
Under the Assistant Finance Officer, there is one Accountant and four Accounts Clerks. The
Finance and Administration Coordinator, the Assistant, and the Accountant are professionally
qualified accountants. The total staff in the Financial Management Department, including the
Finance and Administration Coordinator, is seven. This level of staffing is sufficient to support
both ALRMP II and KACCAL. Apart from the accounting staff, the Internal Auditor General in
the Ministry of Finance has seconded three qualified Internal Auditors to the ministry, which is
deemed adequate for ALRMP II and KACCAL.

17. At the district level. At the district level, there is one Finance Officer and a Finance Clerk.
The accounting process is done through the District Accountant at the District Treasury as
required by government procedures. However, one additional Accounts Clerk will be recruited
for each KACCAL district as a condition of effectiveness. The financial management
arrangements and the staffing at both the national and community level will continue to be
monitored throughout project implementation and any appropriate actions taken.


Internal controls

18. Fraud and Corruption Reports in two districts under ALRMP II. Cases of fraud and
corruption were reported in two districts (Nyeri and Tana River) of ALRMP II during 2006.
Preliminary investigations were conducted by the PCU and the matter was later referred by the
ministry to the Internal Auditor General in the Ministry of Finance for thorough investigation.
The audit was completed and discussed by the Ministerial Audit Committee. The ministry has
substantially implemented the recommendations of the report. For instance, the district project
team--consisting of the Drought Management Officer, Community Development Officer, and
District Finance Officer (DFO)--were dismissed, and a criminal investigation is underway for
Tana River. Nevertheless, the Bank`s Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) is conducting a review of
the project to assess the integrity of the internal controls. The Fiduciary and Funds Flow Review
by the Internal Audit Department also revealed material fiduciary weakness in the project`s
financial management arrangements. The project is in the process of addressing the issues raised.
As noted, some recommendations from this government-commissioned review, such as the
tracking of CDD funds through the IFRs, have been implemented. The project also reviewed its
CDD training program. All CDCs participated in an improved training program to enhance
management and accountability of funds that go to communities. The measures taken by the
ministry in this regard are deemed adequate.

                                                61
19. Mainstreaming corruption prevention as part of the portfolio-level IRMPF. The Bank
has reached an agreement with the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission and the Treasury to
harmonize the prevention of corruption in fiduciary activities of implementing agencies for all
Bank projects. This efforts includes: (i) conducting a corruption risk assessment; (ii) developing
corruption prevention policies and plans; (iii) setting up corruption reporting structures; (iv)
increasing corruption prevention awareness; and (v) reporting any allegations of corruption in
projects to the Bank.

20. The proposed project will be implemented by the existing implementing agency. The
financial management arrangements will be monitored throughout implementation, and
appropriate capacity-building measures will be taken. Financial management risk is rated
moderate. This takes into account the portfolio-level financial management reforms initiated by
the government, including: (i) adoption of International Public Sector Accounting Standards for
Bank projects; (ii) submission of Management Letters as part of the annual audit reports; (iii)
adoption of IRMPF at the country level, including public institutions not funded by the Bank,
such as local authorities and state corporations; (iv) adoption of government-commissioned
annual Fiduciary and Funds Flow Reviews; (v) strengthening of the internal audit function and
management oversight committees, including audit committees; introduction of procurement
audits as part of internal and external audits; capacity development for internal and external audit
staff involved in auditing Bank projects through training supported by the Bank; extending the
scope of internal and external audits to include audits of funds disbursed to communities
(including visits to various community groups to verify the impact of the funds that have been
used); (vi) harmonization of corruption prevention mechanisms between the Kenya Anti-
Corruption Commission and the Treasury for Bank-funded projects as well for the public sector;
(vii) on-shoring of offshore Special Accounts; and (viii) the current moderately satisfactory
performance of ALRMP II.

21. Financial Management Manuals. The accounting, internal control processes, policies, and
procedures for the ministry have been captured in the government`s Financial Management
Procedures Manuals, which have been developed by the Ministry of Finance. The community
financial management component has been captured in the CDD Manual. The CDD Manuals are
being revised as a condition of KACCAL effectiveness.

22. Internal audit. The internal audit function has three qualified auditors and is assessed as
adequate. The Bank has been providing capacity building for the Internal Audit Department to
enhance their effectiveness. The Internal Auditors conduct half-yearly, risk-based internal audit
reviews of the project. The ministry has set up a functioning Audit Committee in line with
government policy. The Portfolio-wide Fiduciary and Funds Flow Review conducted by the
Internal Audit Department raises issues of material weakness in the fiduciary controls at
headquarters and in the districts. The project is addressing the issues raised.

23. Accountability and anti-corruption mechanisms. The ministry has constituted Corruption
Prevention Committees (CPC) and trained Integrity Assurance Officers as a corruption
prevention measure in line with the Government`s Public Service Integrity Program (PSIP). It
has also set up corruption reporting boxes and is in the process of setting up a website and
installing a hotline for public reporting and receiving complaints. The government confirmed
that it will maintain adequate social accountability mechanisms throughout the implementation
of the project, including public reporting of the budget, disbursements, fiduciary review reports,
                                                62
and project audit reports at the national, district, and community levels to ensure that beneficiary
communities and stakeholders participate in the monitoring and use of project resources.

24. Major oversight mechanisms include:

   (i) The Ministry of Finance External Resources Department carries out regular project
         monitoring.
   (ii) The ministry will oversee the utilization of funds to meet the eligible expenditure based
         on approved budgets and work plans, following the procedures as set out in respective
         Financial Management Guidelines and Manuals.
   (iii) The Audit Committee has been constituted and the committee is operational in the
         ministry.

Financial Reporting

25. The ministry operates a ledger management system and has been generating quarterly and
annual financial reports using spreadsheets.

26. Un-audited Quarterly Interim Financial Reporting (IFR). A report-based method of
disbursement is used for ALRMP II, and the PCU has been preparing and submitting Financial
Management Reports on a quarterly basis to the Bank on time, in form and content acceptable to
the Bank. KACCAL will adopt the same report-based method of disbursement. The ministry,
through the PCU, will submit quarterly IFRs for the project within 45 days after the end of the
quarter to which they relate. The format of the IFRs has been discussed and agreed with the
project. The IFRs consist of: (i) a statement of sources and uses of funds (by main expenditure
classification); (ii) opening and closing balances of the funds from the Bank; and (iii) actual and
budgeted expenditures by component and/or activity within component and explanations of any
variances, for the quarter and cumulatively for the project. The IFRs will also contain forecasts
for the next six months.

27. Annual Audited Financial Statements. The annual audited Financial Statements for
KACCAL together with the Auditor`s Report and the Management Letter will be submitted to
the Bank within six months after the end of the financial year to which they relate. The Financial
Statements will be prepared in accordance with the Cash Basis of Accounting of the International
Public Sector Accounting Standards as per Treasury Directive of September 1, 2008, Ref. No.
MF/AG. 3/088 Vol.5 (84).

Flow of Funds

28. Designated and Project Accounts. The Ministry of Finance will open a Designated Account
denominated in US dollars where the GEF Grant proceeds will be deposited. The ministry will
also open a Project Account in local currency from which project payments will be made. The
Project Account will receive grant funds from the Designated Account. Both accounts will be
opened in local banks acceptable to the Bank. The Grants proceeds from the Designated Account
will be channeled to the Project Account and Exchequer Accounts in the Treasury as required by
government procedures.

29. District Bank Accounts. These will be segregated bank accounts which will be opened in all
districts where the KACCAL will be operating. The purpose of these accounts is to channel
                                                63
funds from the Project Account to the various beneficiary communities on the basis of an
approved work plan.

30. Bank signatories. The Designated Account and the Project Account will be operated under
the existing Government Financial Procedures and Regulations issued by the Treasury, which
provide for two mandatory signatories. The categories of signatories are as follows: (i)
Accounting Officer: The Permanent Secretary of the implementing ministry as the ministry`s
Accounting Officer or his/her appointed representative and/or (ii) Accounts Department staff:
The Principal Accounts Controller or any of four ministry Accountants appropriately authorized
as account signatories. Any two signatories can sign a check for making payments for the
project.

31. The district bank account, on the other hand, is operated by the District Drought
Management Officer and the District Accountant under the District Treasury. Funds will
pass Exchequer Accounts in the Ministry of Finance. These banking arrangement are satisfactory
and apply for KACCAL.

32. Flow of funds. The funds flow procedures for KACCAL are relatively simple (Figure A7.1):
(i) the Bank will make initial advance disbursements from the proceeds of the Grant by
depositing into the Borrower-operated Designated Account through Exchequer accounts in the
Ministry of Finance; (ii) thereafter the Bank will replenish the Designated Account based on cash
forecasts given in the IFRs; (iii) funds from the Designated Account will be channeled through
the Project Account (denominated in Kenya shillings and opened in a local commercial bank
acceptable to the Bank) in accordance with government exchequer control and funding
arrangements.

Bank Disbursement Methods

33. Report-based disbursements.       Grant disbursements will be made into the respective
Designated Account based on quarterly IFRs which will provide actual expenditure and cash
flow projections for the next two quarters. Initial cash flow forecasts upon which the advance
disbursement will be made from the GEF Grant should be prepared within two months
after project effectiveness. A duly authorized withdrawal application for the additional cash
replenishment required into the Project Account will be provided along with the IFRs. The IFR
together with the withdrawal application will be reviewed by the Bank`s Financial Management
Specialist and approved by the Task Team Leader before the request for disbursement is
processed.

34. Other Methods: In addition, whenever needed, the direct payment method of
disbursement, involving direct payments to suppliers for works, goods, and services upon the
Borrower`s request may also be used. Payments may also be made to a commercial bank for
expenditures against pre-agreed special commitments. These payments will also be reported in
quarterly IFRs. The Bank Disbursement Letter will stipulate the minimum application value for
direct payment and special commitment procedures as well as detailed procedures to be
complied with under these disbursement arrangements.




                                               64
35. Remedies for non-compliance. If ineligible expenditures are found to have been made from
the Project Account, the Borrower will be obligated to refund the same. If the Project Account
remains inactive for more than six months, the Bank may reduce the amount advanced. The
Bank will have the right, as will be reflected in the terms of the Funding Agreement, to suspend
disbursement of the funds if significant conditions, including reporting requirements, are not
complied with.

External Auditing

36. The external audit for the ministry is conducted by the Kenya National Audit Office.
Under Kenyan legislation, the responsibility to audit all government funds and activities is vested
in the Kenya National Audit Office (KENAO), which is mandated to subcontract such services
to private audit firms in the event of capacity or other constraints. The Kenya National Audit
Office is considered to be sufficiently independent, applies internationally acceptable auditing
guidelines, and therefore is acceptable to the Bank.

37. ALRMP II has been submitting its Project Financial Statements to the Bank in
accordance with the terms of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA). The audit
processes of ALRMP have improved significantly, and the project has been submitting the
project audit reports and Management Letters to the Bank on time. The Bank has received all the
required financial reports, including the IFR up to and including December 2009, and the FY09
audit report and management letters. The reports have been reviewed by the Bank and found to
be satisfactory. The Project has submitted a letter of audit clearance from KENAO clearly stating
that the FY09 audit report qualification has been resolved to the satisfaction of the auditors.
There therefore no outstanding FM issues on the ALRMP.

38. The audited Financial Statements, Auditor's Report, and Management Letter for the
project will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the financial year to
which they relate. Audit reports to be submitted are the Project Financial Statements
(incorporating the Special Account Opinion) by December 31 each year. To meet the above
deadline, the ministry has committed to the timetable indicated in Table A7.1.

Summary of Strengths and Weaknesses

39. The major strengths of the project financial management system are:

         The project team has experience in implementing a World Bank-financed project, namely
         ALRMP I and II.
         Oversight mechanisms are strong, with a relatively independent Audit Committee.
         The ministry has well-qualified professionals in the financial management and internal
         audit functions.
         Project financial management arrangements are well integrated into the existing central
         government financial management systems.
         Strong audit arrangements are in place, including audit by the KENAO.
         Funds flow arrangements are simple and straightforward.

40. Areas of weakness that need to be addressed and monitored are:

         Reports of fraud/corruption in two districts point at material weaknesses in internal
         control systems. This weakness has already been addressed by the ministry by taking
         action against the employees suspected of involvement.
         The IFMIS computerized accounting system in the ministry has not been fully
         implemented and hence the reports generated are not reliable. The ministry operates a
         nonintegrated ledger management system, and project accounts are prepared by use of
         spreadsheets, which is deemed to be adequate. The Treasury, through the Bank-funded
         Public Financial Management Project, is in the process of rolling out IFMIS as required.

41. Actions to address risks and weaknesses have been discussed in preceding paragraphs
and are summarized in the Financial Management Risk Assessment and the Financial
Management Action Plan (Tables A7.2 and A7.3).

                           Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements
   KENYA ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN ARID AND SEMI-ARID LANDS
                          (KACCAL) PROJECT

1. The last Kenya Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was conducted
in 1997. Following the findings and recommendations of that review, the Government of Kenya
applied for the Bank's support to implement the recommendations of the review and
subsequently received from the Bank an IDF Grant which was approved in 1998. Using the
proceeds of the grant, the Government of Kenya started a procurement reform program. One of
the main outcomes of the reform program was the establishment and gazettment in March
2001 of National Public Procurement Regulations, which govern all public procuring entities,
and the production of standard bidding documents for works and goods. The Public
Procurement Regulations allow the Bank procedures to take precedence over any contrary
provisions in the national regulations. National Standard Bidding Documents that are acceptable
to the Bank will be used for National Competitive Bidding (NCB) contracts whose value is
greater than US$ 50,000 per contract. Bank Standard Bidding Documents shall be utilized until
these National Standard Bidding Documents have been cleared by the Bank.

2. Procurement of goods and works for all grant-financed components will be carried
out in accordance with the World Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans
and IDA Credits (May 2004, revised October 2006). Consulting services by firms or
individuals financed by the grant will be awarded in accordance with the World Bank's
Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (May 2004,
revised October 2006). The appropriate World Bank standard bidding documents will be used
for all International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and the World Bank's standard Request for
Proposals for the selection of consultants.

Procurement Plan

3. A Procurement Plan covering the goods, works, and consultancy service contracts for
the first year of project implementation has been prepared. The plan includes relevant
information on consulting services under the project as well as the timing of each milestone in
the procurement process. The procurement schedule will be updated once every six months and
reviewed by the Bank during supervision missions. As community demand-driven
investments cannot be identified up-front, the Project Implementation Plan provides
guidelines that will be used in preparing, screening, and implementing micro-projects. The
existing Project Implementation Plan will be amended before project effectiveness.

Advertising

4. Two General Procurement Notices, one for consulting services and the other for
goods, will be prepared for the project and published in United Nations Development
Business. General Procurement Notices will describe all ICB for goods, as well as consulting
assignments costing US$ 200,000 equivalent or more per contract.




                                              71
Procurement Implementation

5. Consultancy services and technical assistance and ICB and NCB contracts for goods
will be procured centrally by PCU. However, procurement of goods, works, and services for
community-related activities will be carried out by beneficiary communities under the guidance
and supervision of the respective DCUs. Procurement of community-based requirements could
be classified into two categories: (i) simple procurements, which communities can carry out
themselves with minimum external assistance, and (ii) relatively complex procurements, for
which communities would need technical expertise or suitable local contractors may not exist.
For the second category of procurement, communities will seek assistance from the relevant
district government departments or PCU through their DCUs. DCUs will be responsible for the
procurement of their unit-specific needs but will also oversee the smooth implementation of
community procurements, prepare periodic reports on the procurement status of their respective
communities, and submit those reports to the PCU.

Goods

6. The total cost of goods under the GEF grant is estimated at US$ 300,000. Vehicles and
office equipment (including computers, copiers, and so on) will be procured centrally by the
PCU under ICB contracts. CDD procurement will be carried out by beneficiary communities in
separate small contracts. As no ICB contracts are anticipated as part of community procurement,
goods may be procured through NCB procedures as detailed in Section III B (2) of the Legal
Agreement. Smaller value goods may be procured through Shopping procedures in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Project Implementation Plan and the approved Procurement
Plan. The request for quotations will be made in writing to at least three qualified suppliers.
Procuring directly from the supplier without getting other quotations may be allowed, upon
prior clearance with the Bank, when there is only one supplier and/or the amount is small as
prescribed in the Project Implementation Plan.

Contracts for Small Works

7. The project will finance community-based works contracts with an estimated GEF
contribution of US$ 600,000. Contracts for small works as per the approved Procurement
Plan may be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations
obtained in writing from at least three local contractors. The request for quotations will include a
description of the works, including plans and technical specifications as appropriate, required
completion time, and a standard form of contract acceptable to the Bank.

8. Direct contracting. Direct contracting of one contractor without getting other quotations
may be allowed, upon prior clearance of the Community Project Committee, when there is only
one qualified contractor and/or the amount is small as prescribed in the Project Implementation
Plan.

Community Procurement

9. Communities will implement micro-projects with a GEF contribution of US$ 2.75
million. Communities will use their own resources (skilled/unskilled labor, materials,
equipment) or hire labor and purchase materials themselves and subcontract the rest of the


                                                72
work to petty contractors by obtaining three quotations as prescribed in the Project
Implementation Plan.

Consultant Services

10. The total cost of GEF-financed consultant services and technical assistance, including
consultants' services for training, is estimated at US$ 1,300,000 million equivalent. Except
as detailed below, consulting services will be selected through competition among qualified
shortlisted firms based on Quality- and Cost-Based Selection. Consultants for financial audits
and other repetitive services will be selected through Least Cost Selection method. Consultants'
services for training will be procured through the Selection Based on Consultants' Qualifications
method. In exceptional cases when selection of consultants through competitive process is not
practicable, the Borrower may, upon prior clearance with the Bank, hire consultants through the
Single-Source Selection method stipulated in paragraphs 3.8-3.11 of the Guidelines.

11. Consultants for services meeting the requirements of Section V of the Consultant
Guidelines will be selected under the provisions for the Selection of Individual Consultants
method. Individual consultants will be selected through comparison of job description
requirements against the qualifications of those expressing interest in the assignment or those
approached directly. Communities that may not be capable of implementing their micro-projects
may procure the assistance of NGOs and other consultants to provide technical assistance and
help them manage the community micro-projects. PCU or DCUs will assist such communities in
the selection of NGOs following the procedure prescribed in paragraph 3.14 of the Consultants'
Guidelines.

Bank Reviews

15. The Procurement Plan shall set forth those contracts which shall be subject to the
World Bank's Prior Review. The first two NCB contracts for goods and works will be subject
to prior review. All other contracts shall be subject to post review by the World Bank. Post
reviews of contracts awarded below the agreed threshold levels will be carried out selectively by
the Bank during supervision missions and/or by an independent Procurement Auditor. Terms of
reference for all consultancy contracts as well as all Single Source Selections, irrespective of the
contract value, will be subject to prior review.

16. PCU will prepare and submit to the Bank for its review an annual training program as
part of the project Annual Work Plan. The training will, among other things, identify: (i)
the training envisaged; (ii) the personnel to be trained; (iii) the selection methods of institutions
or individuals conducting such training; (iv) the institutions which will conduct training, if
already selected; (v) the duration of proposed training; and (vi) the cost estimate of the training.

Procurement Situation and Proposed Course of Action

17. The same institutional arrangement, both at the national and district levels, which was
constituted for the implementation of Phase I of ALRMP will be retained to
continue managing the second phase (ALRMP II) and KACCAL. The KACCAL
districts are included in the ALRMP districts. The national PCU and each of the DCUs in the
ALRMP II districts have Procurement Officers who are conversant with the Bank
procurement procedures and government procurement regulations.

18. Consultant services and technical assistance that may be required to undertake services
on cross-cutting project issues will be procured centrally by the PCU. A Procurement Post
Review conducted on ALRMP I in five project units (PCU plus 4 of the 11 project districts) in
2002 rated the project as one of the Bank-funded projects in the Kenya portfolio with the best
filing system of procurement documentation. The latest Post Procurement Review (2009) did not
detect any irregularities in the documentation of the sample contracts covered by the review.

19. However, unlike the procurement implementation arrangement under ALRMP I,
community micro-project activities, including procurement of goods and services for the
micro-projects under ALRMP II and KACCAL, will be carried out by the beneficiary
communities themselves (instead of DCUs), under the close supervision and guidance of
DCUs. KACCAL will primarily work with communities that are already implementing as per
ALRMP community procurement guidelines. Lack of basic knowledge and experience of the
beneficiary communities in public procurement procedures coupled with high illiteracy in
arid areas is taken into account in the training program already developed by ALRMP .
Measures will be taken to educate beneficiary communities that may not have adequate
capacity in the institutional and procedural arrangements that are fundamental to timely and
proper implementation of their respective micro-projects. The areas that may need strengthening,
recommended actions, appropriate institution(s) for the implementation of each action, and
recommended completion time of the actions are presented in the following matrix (Table A8.2).

   KENYA ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN ARID AND SEMI-ARID LANDS
                          (KACCAL) PROJECT

1. The economic and financial analysis of the KACCAL project is structured as follows: (i)
an overview of the socioeconomic importance of the ASALs; (ii) a summary of general issues
for economic analysis of climate change adaptation projects; (iii) a summary of the literature on
the economic impacts of climate change; (iv) a review of an economic analysis for CDD projects
in Kenya; and (v) conclusions and recommendations.

Summary of Socioeconomic Importance and Characteristics of the ASALs
2. The development of the ASALs is important for sustainable economic growth and
poverty reduction in Kenya. The Government of Kenya states in the National Policy for the
Development of the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands of Kenya that Kenya will not achieve sustained
growth in the national economy as long as the ASALs and their enormous resources are not
factored into effective national planning and development. The ASALs are home to about 30
percent of Kenya`s population and cover 80 percent of the land mass. Pastoralism makes a
significant contribution to GDP even without achieving its full potential. The ASALs support 75
percent of the country`s livestock production. While agriculture contributes almost 30 percent to
national GDP, one-fourth of agricultural GDP comes from the livestock sector. In addition, over
90 percent of the wild game that support the tourist industry can be found in the ASALs.
Wildlife, coupled with the rich cultural heritage of pastoral and agropastoral communities, is a
major tourist attraction that has earned Kenya in excess of KShs 50 billion annually.

3. Pastoralism, agropastoralism, and rainfed agriculture are the dominant forms of
livelihood in the ASALs. The population in the arid districts is predominantly pastoral, but the
characteristics of livestock ownership and movement vary significantly across different ethnic
groups and food economy zones. Pastoral lifestyles range from fully nomadic patterns in the arid
parts of Marsabit, to nomadic patterns that are closely linked through family ties, to partially
sedentarized communities relying predominantly on crops. The semi-arid districts are
predominantly characterized by marginal dryland agriculture, complemented by pockets of
agropastoral livelihoods and some pastoral livelihoods.

4. The ASALs face the challenge of chronic underdevelopment for a range of reasons,
including climate and agro-ecological factors and poor market access and levels of services.
Most districts have poverty rates of 70 percent, and unemployment is reaching 40 percent in the
North Eastern Province. The very low asset and endowment base in these areas reflects their
isolation. In North Eastern Province, only 4 percent of the population has access to electricity
and 88 percent of adults have not completed primary education. The risk of infant death is over
six times greater in Nyanza and North Eastern Provinces than in Central Province.

General Issues for the Economic Analysis of Climate Change Adaptation Projects

5. Special issues need to be considered for economic analyses of climate change projects.
The Draft Guidance Note Carrying Out Economic Analysis for Adaptation Projects (2008)
reviews challenges and issues to consider for economic analyses of climate change adaptation
projects. The methodological issues mainly concern uncertainties related to: (i) the benefits of

                                               76
adaptation interventions; (ii) the optimal timing of the intervention; (iii) probability functions of
climate variables; and (iv) discount rates. Uncertainties related to the benefits of adaptation
interventions arise from underlying physical or ecological processes. The relationships between
greenhouse gas concentrations, temperatures (regional or global), and climate patterns are very
complex and partly random (Pindyck 2007). Hence even if greenhouse gas concentrations in the
next 20­50 years were known, estimating the expected impacts on precipitation, biodiversity,
agricultural yields, and other parameters in the absence of adaptation would not be
straightforward. In addition, many expected (or avoided) damages from climate change, such as
losses of human life, biodiversity, and environmental services, are difficult to quantify.

6. Given these uncertainties, deciding to adapt now or to wait for more information on
climate change impacts is not easy. If the decision is to adapt now, the costs to be incurred are
certain, while the benefits of the interventions may or may not materialize and may be more or
less distant from the educated ex ante guesses. For KACCAL, however, the major part of
financial resources will be allocated to no-regret investments or to investments that integrate
adaptation in their original design. An example of the former would be CDD investments that
help communities increase their welfare independent of climate change. An example of the latter
would be to upgrade the early warning system developed under ALRMP to more explicitly
integrate climate-related information. For these types of investments, timing is not an issue per
se.

7. The determination of discount rates in the context of climate change has been subject to
fierce debates. In ex ante economic analyses for investment projects, future costs and benefits
are discounted to a common base year. In the context of climate change mitigation and
adaptation, where costs are incurred early and benefits may materialize only after a lengthy
period, the practice of discounting future benefits has led to fierce debates on the moral and
economic justifications of using specific discounting rates and on the practice of discounting
itself. However, in the case of no-regret adaptation and investments integrating adaptation
(such as those proposed under the KACCAL project), discount rates should not be controversial.
The costs and benefits of adaptation measures are usually less far apart in time, and the ancillary
benefits of investments make projects similar to other public investments.

8. Another issue to consider in an economic analysis of KACCAL is the fact that a
substantial proportion of the resources is allocated for capacity building and institutional
strengthening. All three components focus on building national, regional, and local capacity
based on the generation of knowledge products, improved coordination, training, and
mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into development planning. Ex ante quantification
of the economic benefits of these investments is difficult, if not impossible, mainly because of
the long-run nature of these activities and difficulties in linking causes and effects.

9. A range of approaches and methodologies to quantify economic costs and benefits of
adaptation is available for the agricultural sector, particularly crop models and Ricardian
models. Both types of models have significant constraints and require intensive data collection.
Given the complexity of the models, the uncertainty of the results, and the fact that investments
that directly target agricultural land management are relatively small, the quantification of
economic benefits was not deemed to add significant value to investment decisions or project
design.

Literature Review of Economic Impacts of Climate Change

10. Economic analyses of the impacts of climate change have been conducted mainly at a
fairly aggregated level--at a global, regional, or country level. The Stern Review (2006)
provides an overall evaluation of the prospective damages of global warming and the costs of
limiting climate change through the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions. The review noted
that sub-Saharan African will be under severe pressure from climate change, in particular the
arid/semi-arid rangeland systems of eastern Africa. According to the report, 25­550 million
additional people may be at risk of hunger if temperatures increase by 3 degrees Celsius, and
more than half of these people will be concentrated in Africa and West Asia. Climate change is
also predicted to reduce the area with suitable climates for 81­97 percent of Africa`s plant
species. Tens of millions of people could be at risk from malaria.

11. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) noted that warmer and drier
conditions have already reduced the length of growing seasons, with detrimental effects on
crops. The report projected that by 2020, between 75 million and 250 million people in Africa
would be exposed to increased water stress from climate change. The area suitable for
agriculture, the length of the growing season, and yield potential, particularly at the margins of
semi-arid and arid areas, are expected to decrease. Such trends would heighten food insecurity
and exacerbate malnutrition across Africa. In some countries, yields from rainfed agriculture
could fall by up to 50 percent. At the national level, a World Bank study (2006) estimated that
the La Niña drought in Kenya caused damage equivalent to 16 percent of GDP in the 1998/99
and 1999/2000 financial years. Cline (2007) estimated that agricultural output would be reduced
by 28 percent by 2080 in sub-Saharan Africa (without carbon fertilization).

Calculation of Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value for Community-driven
Micro-projects

12. Potential CDD micro-projects were selected and evaluated as part of the economic
analysis. KACCAL would support the preparation and implementation of community-driven
micro-projects to reduce the vulnerability of communities and individuals to climate variability
and change. The investment component of the CDD interventions is difficult know beforehand.
These interventions are demand driven and will be defined in the course of the project, which
complicates any attempt to undertake a rigorous financial and economic analysis of all of these
investments. As mentioned, in the context of this project it is considered much more important
that the economic and financial analysis informs the selection process and specific design of
community projects once the communities have drafted lists of potential interventions. In
addition, on-going complementary analytical work--undertaken within and outside KACCAL--
aims to reduce uncertainties regarding the costs and benefits of actions to adapt to climate
change. It was deemed inappropriate to allocate additional resources for more in-depth
quantitative assessments with limited use for the project.

13. Simple cost-benefit analysis of a limited number of potential CDD activities has been
conducted, mainly to begin building capacity on the basic concepts of economic analysis.
The activities were selected based on discussions with communities in the project area
(particularly Marsabit and Garissa) and on evaluations of ALRMP I and II. Data were collected
during field visits and evaluations of the baseline project. The analysis assumes a discount rate of
10 percent. A simple calculation of IRR and NPV was done for potential projects involving
small-scale irrigation, woodlots, and beekeeping. In addition, results of a cost-benefit analysis for
                                                 78
sustainable land management done as part of the Kenya Agricultural Productivity and
Sustainable Land Management Project are discussed.

14. Irrigated agriculture is likely to be one micro-project within KACCAL. The cost-benefit
analysis is based on crop budgets collected during field visits in Marsabit. It is assumed that a
farmer would have to invest about KShs 150,000 for the construction of small water storage
tanks and pipes. The opportunity costs would be the foregone benefits for rainfed agriculture.
The crops under consideration are tomato and kale. The financial IRR (NPV) from the farmers`
perspective would be 13 percent (KShs 14,150 per hectare).

15. Woodlots on private, community, or public land are another type of micro-project that
communities potentially will select. Woodlots could be established, for example, with pine for
sawtimber or pulpwood. For this analysis, the first option was selected. Data for the cost-benefit
analysis are taken from Sedjo (2004). For a pine sawtimber woodlot, a rotation of 26 years was
assumed. The volume of wood is expected to be 285 cubic meters and the price KShs 1,400 per
cubic meter. The opportunity costs of land are based on the forgone benefit for grazing and
maize. The analysis considers two scenarios: The first one would include the benefit from
fuelwood collection and the second would include no other benefit than timber. For the first
scenario, the IRR was estimated to be 19 percent (NPV of US$ 818 per hectare). Without
fuelwood benefits, the IRR was estimated to be 10 percent (NPV of US$ 13 per hectare).
Assuming benefits from maize production as the forgone benefit changed the IRR and NPV only
slightly.

16. Communities identified beekeeping on forest land or woodlots as another potential
micro-project. Benefits from honey production and fuelwood collection could be realized. A
benefit of US$ 246 could be realized from 6 beehives per hectare. In addition, the benefit of
fuelwood collection is estimated to be about US$ 39 per hectare. The analysis does not include
the benefits of wax (a byproduct of honey production). If the forgone benefit of grazing
constitutes the opportunity cost of land, the private IRR from the community`s perspective would
be 19 percent (NPV US$ 64 per hectare). For the scenario in which maize production determines
the opportunity cost of land, the private IRR would be 9 percent (with a negative NPV of US$ ­
103 per hectare). The profitability can be improved through more intensive beekeeping (that is,
by increasing the number of hives per hectare). If a woodlot with 10 beehives per hectare can be
established, the IRR (including overhead costs, and assuming that maize production determines
the opportunity costs of land) would increase to 14 percent (compared to 4 percent with 6 hives
per hectare) and the NPV to US$ 476 per hectare (compared to a negative NPV of US$ ­579 per
hectare). It is important to determine beforehand how many beehives could realistically be
managed and whether market demand is sufficient for increased honey production.

17. Sustainable land management practices are another potential micro-project. The
adoption of sustainable land management practices is expected to reduce soil nutrient losses and
soil erosion and thereby increase yields and farmers` income. Off-site effects would include
reduced sedimentation and thus siltation of reservoirs and pipes, regulated water flows and
improved water quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon sequestration. As part of
the cost-benefit analysis, financial returns of sustainable land management practices from
farmers` perspective are assessed over a period of 50 years, using a discount rate of 10 percent.
KARI has identified integrated soil fertility management, agroforestry, and soil and water
conservation structures as interventions suitable for a wide range of agro-ecological conditions in
Kenya. The analysis mainly uses data from long-term experiments by KARI. The IRR of
                                                79
selected sustainable land management interventions can be expected to be around 30 percent,
excluding off-site benefits. It is important to interpret these results carefully, however, since the
experimental data were collected in environmental conditions that are not equivalent to those in
the project area.

Conclusions and Recommendations

18. The quantification of economic benefits for a climate change adaptation project as a
whole is not necessarily warranted. Given an array of methodological issues, the uncertainties
related to climate change, and the fact that a significant share of project resources is allocated for
capacity building, institutional strengthening, and knowledge management, it was decided not to
quantify the impacts of climate change or the costs and benefits of all planned interventions
based on a single summary measure. That information would have limited usefulness for project
planning and implementation and would have to be based on a wide range of assumptions. (In
fact, an objective of KACCAL is to reduce uncertainties related to climate change to allow for
better planning and implementation of adaptation activities, and complementary analytical work
is expected to refine quantitative assessments of the impact of climate change in Kenya.) For
present purposes, in addition to the estimates of IRR and NPV derived for potential micro-
projects, it seemed more appropriate to review the literature to obtain the best available estimates
of the potential economic impact of climate change on agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa,
particularly Kenya.

19. Rather than conducting an in-depth ex ante quantitative assessment, it is recommended
to mainstream economic analysis into evaluations of the cost-effectiveness and
sustainability of planned project activities. This approach has proven to be useful under
ALRMP, which also includes criteria for risk analysis, mitigation, and sustainability. For some
relevant activities, KACCAL will use this approach as an entry point for the analysis of climate
risk and assess the cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures as investments are planned. This
approach will be particularly relevant for some of the investments under components 1 and 2.

20. It is recommended that communities focus on no-regret investments that increase
community welfare independent of the severity of climate variability and change. This option
should be preferred to ad hoc adaptation investments designed exclusively in response to
expected changes in climate conditions. Given the uncertainty remaining at this point, the former
approach would more reliably increase the adaptive capacity and welfare of communities. Once
KACCAL has started reducing the uncertainties related to climate change impacts and the
capacity of all stakeholders has been improved, both kinds of adaptation measures can be
explored. However, it remains crucial to introduce and maintain systematic screening of the
financial benefits for communities and individuals. KACCAL will contribute to the required
capacity building.

21. It is important to note that the financial analysis of potential micro-projects was based
on case studies and experimental data that cannot reflect the diverse agro-ecological and
socioeconomic conditions in the ASALs. The actual selection of micro-projects should be
informed by an analysis reflecting local conditions. The impact of climate variability on
productivity could not be included in the economic analysis, because reliable data are lacking. It
can be assumed, however, that the financial attractiveness of most of the potential micro-projects
would increase, because the with project scenario would reduce communities` vulnerability to
climate change compared to the without project scenario.

Environmental Safeguards

1. Environmental impacts of project activities are expected to be positive, and the project
has therefore been classified as a Category B project. The proposed project aims to further
strengthen positive environmental impacts through new risk management activities, with local
community participation, to mitigate extreme weather conditions.

2.  Based on a review of the proposed activities, the safeguard policies triggered by the
project include Environmental Assessment (OP4.01), Natural Habitats (OP4.04), Pest
Management (OP4.09), and Indigenous Peoples (OP4.10).

3. Safeguard policies not triggered by the project are: Physical Cultural Resources (OP
4.11); Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12); Forests (OP/BP 4.36), Projects on International
Waterways (OP 7.50); Projects in Disputed Areas (OP/BP 7.60), and Safety of Dams (OP 4.37).

Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01)

4. This is an environmental project, and no major adverse or irreversible environmental
impacts are expected as a result of project activities. The project is designed to be entirely
positive from an environmental and social point of view, by assisting Kenya in adapting to
expected changes in climactic conditions that otherwise threaten the sustainability of rural
livelihoods in ASALs. To be in compliance with the safeguard policies, and to ensure that
project activities will be implemented in an environmentally sustainable manner, an EA and
EMF prepared by the Government of Kenya during 2003 for ALRMP II will be used during
implementation of KACCAL. However, as found necessary during KACCAL project

*
 By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties'
claims on the disputed areas.

                                                         81
preparation, an addendum to the ALRMP II EMF has now been included and the enhanced EMF
will be used during KACCAL implementation. Subsequently, environmental audits were carried
out by an independent consulting firm in 2006 and 2008 for ALRMP II. The audits showed that
most issues and risks related to environmental and natural resource management were identified,
and corrective measures were agreed upon with the Borrower. The audit report contains some
comprehensive Best Practice Guidelines that can be used by district staff when developing and
implementing micro-projects. Additionally, at the Mid-Term Review of ALRMP II, the project
team reviewed environmental and social safeguard issues along with the EA/EMF and found
implementation to be mostly consistent with project design. This conclusion is documented in
the environmental audit. The EMF has been re-disclosed at the InfoShop and in-country with a
separate cover letter from the Borrower to satisfy the disclosure requirements for KACCAL.
Since the addendum to the EMF has been updated recently to reflect the decision to trigger
Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10), the document was disclosed again in October 2009.

5. The EA/EMF that will be used during KACCAL implementation will help identify any
potential environmental impacts related to project activities. The EA study was conducted in
a participatory manner and included: (i) public consultation with stakeholders, NGOs, and
communities; (ii) a review of selected documentation from ALRMP I and II, World Bank and
Kenyan guidelines and policies on environment, and other documents relevant to environmental
issues in the ASALs of Kenya; and (iii) site visits to a number of pilot communities under
ALRMP. The main findings of the EA suggest that overall, at a strategic level, ALRMP II has
the potential to make a significant positive contribution to environmental sustainability and
specifically pastoral sustainability. The EA has identified impacts and proposed mitigation
measures that will appropriately address potential localized negative environmental impacts in
line with the project`s sustainable development objectives.

6. The EMF includes:
       Relevant Kenyan and World Bank Safeguard Procedures (Chapter 3).
       Guidance on potential impacts (Chapter 5).
       Reporting systems and responsibilities of officers in implementing the EMF (Chapter 6).
       Policy issues to be addressed to remove constraints to environmental sustainability in
       Kenya`s Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (Chapter 7).
       Capacity-building and training requirements (Chapter 8).
       Costs to be mainstreamed into project design (Chapter 9).

7. The details of the EMF will continue to be integrated into the micro-project cycle for
the KACCAL project. The EMF also sets out the reporting systems and responsibilities of
officers in implementing it. It details specific steps which will be taken to put the EMF into
practice, including:
       Flowchart for reporting and advice.
       Screening form for community projects.
       Triggers for environmental impact assessments of projects conducted under the
       components for support to local development and for natural resource and drought
       management.
       Annual report forms for District Officers and PCU Officer.
       Descriptions of roles and responsibilities.


                                              82
8. The independent environmental audit report done in 2006 also has several
recommendations that will be implemented during the KACCAL project. The
recommendations include:
       Increase the training targeted to DSGs and the PCU in several areas that will help with
       the satisfactory implementation of EMF (environmental impact assessment for CDD
       projects; environmental monitoring and evaluation for CDD projects; and environmental
       screening).
       Provide appropriate targeted training for local communities implementing micro-projects.
       Appoint an Environmental Mitigation Officer, as indicated in the Project Implementation
       Plan for ALRMP.
       Revise the screening checklist based on Best Practice Guidelines.

9. Once ALRMP II is closed, funds for EMF implementation will come from KACCAL
and the ASAL SWAp. Currently, capacity building and training measures required for
implementation of the EMF are funded by ALRMP II (costs as outlined in Chapter 9, Table 9.1
of the EMF report).

10. The EMF provides a specific tool to mainstream environmental concerns into the
project design, appraisal, and implementation process. As implementation of the EMF is
crucial for sustainable project management and implementation, the project will follow the
successful institutional and management structure put into place for ALRMP II. To ensure
smooth implementation, KACCAL will continue working with the implementing agencies to
make certain that competent authorities are assigned the responsibility of carrying out
appropriate actions.

11. At the national level, a staff member has been appointed within the ALRMP PCU with
specific responsibility for addressing environmental issues. The staff member will be
supported by an Environmental Impact Assessment Expert, who will provide technical advice,
review, and backstopping. The staff member will stimulate District Environmental Committees
and DSGs to develop strategic approaches to environmental sustainability in their districts and
ensure that the EMF is integrated into the project cycle. The Community Development Officers
will be responsible for ensuring that the environmental screening and review system included in
the EMF is integrated into the micro-project cycle. Sensitizing DSGs to environmental issues, as
well as partnerships with government and NGO officers on the DSG, will contribute significantly
to integrating the EMF into the project and micro-project cycle. The Environmental Officers may
need to draw on the technical advice of their government colleagues in other departments. Each
District Officer will compile a brief annual report for delivery to District Environmental
Committees and to the NRM Coordinator within the PCU. The NRM Coordinator in the PCU
will provide guidance to the District Environmental Officer (as well as stimulating District
Environmental Committees) and serve as the key link between districts, the National
Environmental Management Agency, and the Prime Minister`s Office. ALRMP will provide
training for DSGs, District Environmental Officers, METs, and community workers on specific
environmental issues.

12. Specific training at the national, district, and local levels will be carried out in: (i)
operation of the EMF; (ii) environmental impact assessment techniques and Kenyan policies on
environmental impact assessment; and (iii) issues related to the cumulative and strategic
environmental impact of the project. Different levels of training will be provided: (i) in-depth

                                              83
training to a level that allows trainees to go on to train others, including training in technical
procedures, where relevant; (ii) sensitization, in which the trainees become familiar enough with
the issues to formulate and demand their precise requirements for further technical assistance;
and (iii) awareness-raising, in which the participants acknowledge the significance or relevance
of the issues but are not required to have technical or in-depth knowledge of the issues.

13. Monitoring has been built into the EMF screening and review procedures at the district
and national levels and includes an annual independent environmental audit. Monitoring is
being carried out for ALRMP II with specific criteria and indicators. Monitoring indicators will
depend very much on the specific contexts of the micro-projects. Prior to the commencement of
any micro-project, an appropriate environmental and social impact assessment will be
undertaken and, if environmental and social risks are identified, an appropriate Environmental
Management Plan, Integrated Pest Management Plan, and/or Indigenous Peoples Plan will be
adopted and carried out in accordance with the provisions in the EMF and IPPF.

Natural Habitats (OP 4.04)

14. This policy has been triggered because of the potential for activities to border on or
operate in natural habitats or protected areas. The EMF will address these concerns through
an environmental screening applied to all micro-projects before approval. The EMF will help
identify any potential impacts on natural habitats and proposes mitigation measures. It has
provided adequate management measures to mitigate adverse impacts of any activities in the
project intervention areas. Additionally, ALRMP II has prepared a baseline NRM and ecological
survey of the area as well as a national ASAL NRM strategy which covers the KACCAL
districts. The results from these studies will be considered during micro-project screening and
approval.

Pest Management (OP 4.09)

15. Pesticide use among beneficiary communities of the project is very low to nonexistent.
The project will not support the purchase or induce enhanced use of pesticides. However, if the
project proposes the use of herbicides to clear bush or proposes the use of irrigation systems that
could intensify agriculture and increase pesticide use, the EMF requires screening for pesticide
use to mitigate any potential negative environmental impacts. During project implementation,
any such micro-projects will prepare a brief Integrated Pest Management Plan that will be in
compliance with the World Bank Safeguard Policy OP 4.09. Such Integrated Pest Management
Plans will be prepared and disclosed before micro-project implementation. Additionally, as
recommended in the EMF, training on integrated pest management will be included as a module
for relevant stakeholders. The policy is therefore marked as triggered.

Forests (OP 4.36)

16. Forest operations such as forest restoration or plantation development will not be
carried out under this project. Small-scale infrastructure may be financed under the project
which may place pressure on forest resources (wood for construction). However, the EMF
provides the necessary measures in the screening process to identify impacts on forests and forest
resources. Good practice measures are provided in the EMF to address these concerns.
Moreover, through highly participatory mechanisms built into the CDD design, the project will


                                                84
raise awareness and empower communities to increase protection of forests and other resources.
The policy is not triggered.
Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10)

17. The ALRMP project did not trigger OP 4.10. The project`s main goal is to target the
marginalized and vulnerable communities in the arid and semi-arid districts in Kenya. The
community empowerment tools used were tailored specifically to reach and impact these groups.
However, during the course of KACCAL preparation, it was decided to trigger this OP,
considering that the Wasanya, the Boni, and other groups could be present in some parts of
Malindi, Lamu, and possibly other districts. The project has therefore prepared an IPPF for
KACCAL, which will be used to guide work with these and any other groups that might be
found in the area.

Training and Capacity Building

Activities funded

18. The following activities will be funded as part of the ASAL SWAp, after closure of
ALRMP II:

       Annual environmental performance audit.
       Provision for EA studies for specific micro-projects.
       Specific training related to implementing the EMF for various groups at various levels, as
       outlined in Table 8.1 of the EMF report.
       Additionally, targeted training and capacity building as a result of KACCAL components
       in the following areas (this list is not exhaustive):
       -   Training relevant staff in line ministries to translate scientific concepts on climate
           variability and change into operational activities.
       -   Training METs to provide guidance to communities regarding climate risk in relation
           to land use and natural resource management issues in ASALs. The METs will help
           communities formulate specific activities in the CAPs and ensure that they receive
           appropriate training and awareness-raising on risks and impacts related to climate
           change. The METs will also be trained to receive feedback from communities on
           local climate indicators and environmental change and to forward this information to
           specified scientific institutions.
       -   Training communities about opportunities for diversifying their sources of income
           (alternative livelihoods in ASALs), which will facilitate a shift from unsustainable
           activities to activities that are economically viable and less vulnerable to climate
           risks.
       -   Training communities (farmers, pastoralists, and other stakeholders) on peace
           building, conflict resolution, constitution-writing, group dynamics, and leadership
           skills.
       -   Continue activities relating to interdistrict learning and knowledge sharing about
           environmental and social issues.
       -   Training of the PCU, DSG, District Environment and Forestry Officers, METs, and
           community workers on the implementation of the social assessment and IPPF.



                                               85
Training modules

19. A Training Needs Assessment has been conducted, including needs for training on
environmental and social issues. The environmental audit that was conducted for ALRMP II
recommended that the project prepare a comprehensive, well-designed training program to be
outsourced to a competent institution for implementation during the life of the project. In line
with this recommendation, ALRMP II contracted a training, management, and research
consulting firm, Professional Training Consultants (PTC), which drafted a Training Needs
Assessment (TNA) dated October 15, 2007. The modules encompass components of both
ALRMP II and KACCAL and have been implemented by PTC in a participatory manner, for
various categories of stakeholders covering all project districts. The modules included topics that
covered both environmental and social issues. The training was completed in 2008.

20. In addition to the topics suggested in the Training Needs Assessment, it is
recommended that the following modules be included:
   (i) Boreholes, rock catchments, earth dams, water pans, and sand dams that were
       constructed under ALRMP II. Periodic training would be given to relevant communities
       on basic surveillance procedures so that they can identify potential problems (such as
       silting or signs of collapse) at early stages. Training would also be given on the
       management, handling and operation of any resources or funds obtained during operation
       of these structures. The ideal resource person for the training is the engineer from the
       Ministry of Water who oversaw construction.

   (ii) Integrated pest management. This module would include agroforestry, preparation of a
       brief pest management plan, organic farming, safe storage and handling of pesticides, and
       sensitization to integrated pest management. Training would stress the importance of
       avoiding reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides alone and would promote the use of
       organic, biological, or environmental pest control methods based on prevention,
       surveillance, monitoring, and ultimately intervention using multiple pest control tactics in
       a compatible manner. The resource person for the training could be the Ministry of
       Agriculture representative on the DSG or relevant staff from KARI.

   (iii) Cumulative impacts of micro-projects. The compilation of screening forms will enable
       the approving authority to decide whether additional cumulative impact assessments are
       required to determine the impacts of micro-projects (for example, on groundwater
       resources, surface water resources, or the attraction of immigrant populations to
       communities that have improved production systems and social infrastructure). This
       training module should also guide stakeholders in instances where there could be
       cumulative impacts and when cumulative impact assessment should be carried out before
       micro-project implementation.

   (iv) Waterborne diseases. Training would increase awareness of mitigation and protective
       measures, such as disinfecting or boiling water before use, introducing fish that eat
       mosquito larvae, and preventing stagnant water from accumulating around water points
       and hand pumps. The resource person should be the District Health Officer.



                                                86
   (v) Indigenous people. Training would raise awareness and build capacity for: identifying
       indigenous people (screening and assessment); assessing the impacts of micro-projects on
       indigenous people; averting any potentially adverse effects on indigenous peoples`
       communities; minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for negative impacts if they
       cannot be avoided; and actively involving indigenous people in micro-project planning
       and implementation.

Potential Micro-projects

21. An indicative list of potential micro-projects includes:

       Propagation and possible sale of tree seedlings.
       Establishment of greenbelts around settlements to prevent degradation from livestock and
       fuelwood collection.
       Soil erosion control structures, such as live fencing around boreholes, earth dams, and
       water pans.
       Tree planting and live fencing around schools and dispensaries.
       Rehabilitation of water pans and earth dams.
       Roof catchment water harvesting.
       Maintenance of rock catchments.
       Gully prevention.
       Water harvesting and storage structures (shallow wells).
       Tapping and protection of springs.
       Small-scale irrigation (provision of hand pumps).
       Small-scale agricultural projects (tree/bush crops, reseeding, and tree planting).
       Rehabilitation of denuded sites (promoting reseeding, filling up gullies).
       Agricultural advisory services.
       Education and health advisory services.
       Small-scale, income-generating activities such as apiculture, tanning hides, quarrying,
       milk processing, and collecting herbs.
       Commercialization of dryland products such as aloe and sisal.
       Small-scale fishing as an alternative source of food for pastoralists.
       Protection of the natural resource base (planting, tree nurseries).
       Farming fish (to feed on mosquito larvae).
       Organic farming (spray made from herbs; promotion of farm manure).

Monitoring and Supervision of Safeguards Performance

22. Regular monitoring and evaluation are needed to ensure that project safeguard
measures are systematically implemented throughout the life of the project, to measure
performance in implementing safeguards, and to ensure that project activities comply with
national and World Bank safeguard policies.

23. Possible indicators for environmental monitoring are included in the EMF, which will
be included in the M&E system of the project, as appropriate. In addition, an independent annual
environmental and social performance audit will be carried out by the project, which will be
reviewed by the Bank.

                                              87
Social Analysis and Recommendations

Analysis

24. The project will not support any activities that trigger OP 4.12, Involuntary
Resettlement. Screening of micro-projects will ensure that the project does not finance activities
involving the involuntary taking of land or the involuntary restriction of access to legally
designated parks and protected areas.

25. Social analysis and participation: A number of stakeholders were involved in preparing the
KACCAL through workshops, PRAs, and community outreach. This process was built on the
participatory processes of ALRMP, which included a thorough Social Analysis (SA). That
analysis, along with the project`s participatory plan, has described the various entry points for
stakeholders at all levels.

26. The baseline project has already developed and introduced an effective participatory
approach to service delivery based on a good understanding of pastoralist communities.
Community targeting through PRAs enables communities to articulate their problems, needs, and
priorities and request help in mapping the necessary course of action. The PRAs have also been
an effective tool for community empowerment. The proposed project will implement a
differentiated PRA, targeting vulnerable communities, and enable the development of climate-
resilient CAPs.

27. The SA for ALRMP confirmed that the key social issues are livelihood and coping
strategies, the social inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized groups, and gender mainstreaming
inside the communities in ASAL districts. A summary of the SA report follows.

28. Livelihood and coping strategies. Most of the study districts are predominantly pastoral,
with varying levels of farming and other livelihood strategies in each district. Clanism is a major
social factor, particularly in the Somali communities of Garissa and Wajir (and Ijara and
Mandera, although these were not among the study districts). In Tana River, Isiolo, Marsabit,
and Baringo, ethnicity is a major factor. Another factor that characterizes social organization in
the study districts and has a great influence on targeting and the project`s eventual success is
religion, particularly Islam in the northeastern districts and parts of Tana River and traditional
religion among various ethnic communities in Marsabit and Samburu. These factors are key to
defining community and targeting interventions.

29. Three principal livelihood bases were found in the study districts. Some districts have all
three to varying degrees; some have two, and others only one. They include:

       Pastoralism, the principal livelihood base in Garissa, Wajir, Isiolo, Turkana (and Moyale,
       Ijara, and Mandera). Pastoralism is also the principal livelihood base in the hinterland of
       Tana River and the lowlands of Marsabit, Samburu, and Baringo.
       Agropastoralism is the principal livelihood base of the communities in the highlands of
       Baringo, Samburu, and Marsabit. Farming on a small scale is also found in some parts of
       the Baringo lowlands.

                                                88
         Farming is the principal livelihood base of the riverine communities of Tana River.

30. Coping strategies were analyzed in terms of difficult times or times of hardships
resulting from natural phenomena such as drought and famine, which affect both farming
and pastoral livelihood bases. In addition, livestock rustling, which is rampant in the North Rift
districts, was considered. The various coping strategies depend to a large extent on the livelihood
base and traditional socio-cultural organization (including religion, particularly among the
Muslims).

31. Among the pastoral communities, migration in search of pasture and water is the first
and main coping mechanism. If drought or famine persists, pastoralists slaughter their animals,
preserve meat and milk, and use or purchase grain. In extreme cases, people consume blood and
even skin to stay alive. Most pastoral communities in the study districts have a tradition of
lending milk animals to poor households to cushion the children and the aged from famine.

32. The farming and agropastoralist communities store grain in underground facilities or
above-ground granaries at harvest, specifically for use in difficult times. During such
times, people of all livelihoods also expect relief from the government and other actors. In
extreme cases, they turn to the forest for wild fruit and honey, hunt wild animals, and burn and
sell charcoal or firewood. Another coping mechanism for pastoralists and farmers is migration to
urban areas to seek casual labor, live with relatives, or beg. Many times these groups turn to
burning and selling of charcoal and firewood.

33. In most pastoralist communities, some coping mechanisms, such as lending milking
animals to ensure food (or milk) for a needy household, are also a form of safety net. In
some cases, the lending community member allows a household to use (even sell) some male
offspring of any type of livestock that is lent. The household can use the sale of these offspring
to start its own herd.

34. The main safety net used by individual pastoralists is diversification of the herd. At
times, especially among the Turkana and Tugen, herds are split and grazed in different parts of
the district as a precaution against drought and raids. Camels and goats are known to be hardy
and will resist harsh conditions for long periods. At the community level, traditional coping
mechanisms include the Muslim Zakat11 and the lending of milk animals to the poor. In Tana
River, the safety net among Pokomo farmers is mango trees, whereas for agro-pastoralists it is
the diversification of livelihood bases or the practice of both crop and livestock agriculture.
Agro-pastoralist and farming communities increasingly request the introduction of drought-
tolerant crops to guard against dry weather. Farmland may also be lent to the poor for cultivation
over a given period. Investments in educating children are increasingly seen as a safety net,
particularly by pastoralists. According to the Gabra elders in Marsabit, Educated children are
always assisting their fathers to restock animals.

35. Social inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized groups: The SA sought to understand
which groups are likely to be excluded and which barriers the project can address to encourage
participation of all communities, including the most vulnerable. The SA found several isolated

11
  Zakat is an annual religious tax paid to the poor by all Muslims. Zakat is calculated on the basis of cash (or of the
number of livestock) owned for the last 12 months. Zakat is meant to assist the poor to start herds of their own.
Because of the per capita decline in livestock and other resources owned by households, this restocking method is
now scarcely effective.

                                                         89
groups that to some extent had been excluded from past project efforts. These groups include
widows, divorcees, the urban poor, street children, and other marginalized groups. In the study
districts, the marginalization of whole communities or groups within a community arises from a
combination of factors, including historical influences, ethno-cultural factors, livelihood
strategies, population numbers, and sociopolitical and developmental issues.

36. The marginalized communities and groups found in the study districts include the Watta
of Tana River and the northeastern districts covered by the study, the Munyo Yaya and Malakote
of Tana River and Garissa, the Gagabey of Wajir, the Bantu or Nywele Ngumu in several
northeastern districts, and the Ndorois12 and the Ogieks of Baringo. Other marginalized groups
include the Rer-Bahars of Wajir Town and the Ngikebootoks (hunter/gatherers) of Turkana. The
main needs of marginalized communities are identity and recognition, access to the means of
gaining a livelihood, and shelter (this last request came specifically from the Gagabey
community of Habsawen in Wajir).

37. Continuous conflict in arid lands has been a major social obstacle to development.
Conflict comes from animosity between various ethnic groups, most of which centers on
conflicting land use systems. Land tenure systems in pastoral areas are communal under the
Trust Lands Act. The roots of these conflicts are many. There is inter-ethnic animosity between
the Turkana and the Samburu, between Turkana and the Pokot, and in Tana River between
Pokomo and the Orma over pastoralist access to the Tana River through cultivated farmland. In
Garissa, the Malakote and others fight over access to the river. Intercommunity conflicts were
also found. For example, settlements of agropastoralists in Turkana, particularly in Turkwell,
Molem, Katilu, and Lokori, cause hostility within these same communities. Conflicts also exist
between communities in northern and northeastern Kenya with neighboring Somalia, Ethiopia,
and northern Uganda.

38. Conflict remains a major issue that not only affects economic activities but shapes social
values and community dispositions. Most conflicts revolve around livestock, divergent
livelihood strategies, and cultural identity. In Baringo, perpetual conflict between the Pokot and
the neighboring Marakwet, Turkana, and Keiyo is occasioned by competition over water and
pasture and, more recently, cattle rustling driven by mischief and commercial imperatives.

39. Lack of gender mainstreaming constrains the effective delivery of services to
communities in ASAL districts. The SA shows that traditionally men and women played very
different roles in most of the communities visited, but over time these roles and the division of
labor have changed. Both men and women are assuming different roles depending on the
socioeconomic realities on the ground. Women-headed households are on the increase due to
divorce and the death of spouses through conflicts and other calamities. Persistent famine forces
men and women to move from rural to urban areas where social support structures are difficult to
maintain or nonexistent, thus increasing the vulnerability of the affected population.

40. Most projects that have benefited women, particularly ALRMP, work with women in
groups, with projects such as posho mills and start-up efforts for petty trade. These activities,
though beneficial, are not seen to change women`s conditions in a significant way. In projects
that support cropping, where they exist, women transplant, weed, chase birds, and harvest,
whereas men sell the produce and may or may not disclose the income to their wives. Such

12
     Information is taken from the SA document, as the study team did not get to meet the Ndorois and the Ogieks.

                                                          90
projects increase the burden of labor on women. The principal issue in the area of health is
female genital mutilation, which as per the findings of the SA is commonly practiced in all arid
districts except Turkana.

41. In some instances, women, men, young boys, and girls need to be targeted specifically.
For instance, when the burden of caring for the sick rests solely on women, boys are kept away
from school to look after animals, and girls are married off early at the expense of their
education. In some communities, education for girls is not a priority. Their enrolment in
secondary and primary schools is far below that of boys. At the age of 15, a girl can be married.
There are few girls` boarding schools in the districts, and even then, enrolments are below
capacity. On the whole, the general attitude towards educating girls is negative.

42. The SA shows that in Turkana District, many men and women no longer have livestock
to herd owing to the effects of drought and increasing poverty, which causes migration to
larger towns in search of wage labor. Women in this situation have various income-generating
activities, such as basket making, shop keeping, and charcoal burning. Men are also involved in
activities such as herding and beekeeping. However, the majority, particularly young men with
little education, want wage employment. Where wage labor is not forthcoming, they are at risk of
becoming idle and engaging in anti-social activities. An enhanced role for women is seen in
communities where they are involved in peace making. In Tana River, Pokomo women are
involved in peace initiatives and so are the Turkana women.

43. As a response to the above issues, the project will give gender special attention by
supporting efforts that will enable both men and women to be well represented in decision-
making at all areas pertaining to the project. The project will invest in activities that help women
to have access to and control over resources. A key concern is to ensure there are sufficient
gender disaggregated data and sufficient analysis of the situation of men and women to inform
implementation of the various interventions. The key approach will be gender mainstreaming
through all components of this project.

44. At the community level, representation and training for gender sensitivity and response
will be the dominant approach. Support to CAPs, which focus on interventions that directly
and equitably affect both men and women, will be the focus for screening micro-project
proposals. The proposals will reflect gender concerns in their design, implementation strategies,
and most importantly the relationship between proposed activities and empowerment of men and
women.

Recommendations

45. On livelihoods and coping strategies:

   (i)    Continue to strengthen traditional restocking systems, but give special attention to the
          conditions leading to loss of livestock and the period between loss and restocking.
          Attention to these issues is important for ensuring that the person/household being
          restocked is still capable of managing the intervention.
   (ii)   Encourage the diversification of livelihood strategies by identifying and supporting
          appropriate income-generating and farming activities that are at the same time friendly
          to pastoral livelihoods.


                                                91
   (iii) Organize and support women milk traders, with a view to adding value to the product,
         increasing its shelf life, and improving the hygienic environment in which it is handled.
   (iv) Support livestock marketing and trade, particularly by women and youth, through the
         provision of loans/credit to small-scale livestock traders and by addressing livestock
         marketing facilities and policies.
   (v) Introduce modern beekeeping and handling techniques to encourage the adoption of
         nontraditional safety nets and honey harvesting.
   (vi) Educate livestock farmers on the commercial/monetary value of livestock and facilitate
         the development of markets and the establishment of marketing chains.

46. On social inclusion of the vulnerable and marginalized groups:

   (i)    Initiate preferential targeting of vulnerable and marginalized groups.
   (ii)   Capitalize on the importance of traditional social structures among pastoralist
          communities and strengthen them to improve governance in the projects` activities. To
          this end, engage in dialogue and consultations with traditional institutions (leadership)
          and facilitate their efforts to be more inclusive and accommodating, particularly in
          terms of governance, gender, and age.
   (iii) In addition to procurement, financial management, and leadership training, identify
          other training needs of community organizations and develop appropriate capacity-
          building strategies to address them.
   (iv) Develop and implement training programs aimed at building the capacity of community
          organizations, particularly in participatory planning and decision-making, monitoring
          of progress, and accountability.
   (v) Institute an elaborate sensitization and training program aimed at raising the level of
          awareness, particularly among the poor, the marginalized, and other special-needs
          groups, about their rights to development and how to access these rights from CDCs,
          other development actors, and government departments.
   (vi) At the project level, formulate and implement policies and strategies that support the
          integration of marginalized and vulnerable groups into mainstream development. Such
          policies and strategies should include preferential treatment or affirmative action in
          targeting and in establishing indicators for measuring implementation rates and impact,
          within a given time frame.
   (vii) Institute advocacy measures (rights-based empowerment) aimed at drawing attention to
          the integration needs of the marginalized communities, particularly the need for
          identity, recognition, and voice, at the national (political and development) levels.
   (viii) Train field staff to internalize and recognize the plight of marginalized communities
          and appreciate the need for their special targeting.
   (ix) If carbon finance activities are supported, the project needs to ensure that implementing
          communities are major beneficiaries of any carbon revenues that are generated. These
          benefits can be secured through careful consultation of communities, advocacy,
          indigenous people screening, and provisions in the carbon finance documents,
          including the emission reduction purchase agreement.

47. On gender mainstreaming:

   (i)    Develop a clear, simple mission statement on gender that expresses the project`s
          commitment on gender and is understandable to all staff and partners at the district
          level. Ensure that the mission statement explains the benefits of gender mainstreaming

                                               92
       for men and women (for example, that gender mainstreaming is intended to ensure that
       women`s and men`s needs and interests are met and that women and men participate
       actively and fully in project activities).
(ii) Examine decision-making processes, especially when financing decisions are made,
       and assess the extent to which gender issues are taken into account. If little or no
       attention is given to gender, include gender in the decision-making criteria and
       processes, and ensure that people who are knowledgeable about gender are involved in
       the decisions.
(iii) Develop, disseminate, and ensure the use of some basic tools for integrating gender into
       project activities, including a basic method for gender analysis for planning project
       activities and some feasible monitoring indicators (for example, indicators for women`s
       participation at different levels and in different types of activities). Establish a system
       for follow-up, monitoring, and reporting.
(iv) At the district level, address the links between culture and gender. Explore how
       traditions and culture can be used positively to support women and men to
       participate equally--albeit in different ways that respond to women`s and men`s
       different roles and interests--in project activities.
(v) Formulate and deliver a carefully planned program of training for staff, especially at the
       district level, solidly based on an understanding of gender issues in ASALs and their
       communities.
(vi) Link equal opportunities for women and men in the organization, especially at the
       district level, with gender mainstreaming in project activities. It is much easier to
       promote gender equality in project activities if equality and mutual respect among staff
       are also encouraged and supported.
(vii) At the community/project level, identify the improvements wanted and needed by
       female and male beneficiaries, for example, through PRAs and participatory integrated
       community development.
(viii) Build into CAPs and program activities components that address the specific
       constraints preventing women from participating in and benefiting from project
       activities. The multiple roles and responsibilities of women, which are clearly far
       greater than those of men, must become a major concern of project staff and must be
       taken into account in gender analysis and consultation/participation exercises at the
       community level.
(ix) Involve men at all levels in gender-related work. Start from those men who are already
       supportive. Involve influential male community leaders, particularly the elders,
       traditional leaders, and male youth.
(x) Give support also to women who are able to influence opinions at community level, and
       find out how to assist them in their efforts to strengthen the voices of women and
       women`s participation at the community level and in project activities.
(xi) Initiate a pilot project on mobile school services targeting the mobile pastoralist
       communities to enable their boys and girls to have access to basic education.

   KENYA ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN ARID AND SEMI-ARID LANDS
                          (KACCAL) PROJECT


                                  GEFSEC Project ID: 3249
                          Review by STAP Roster Member: Ian Burton

Overall Assessment of the Project

This is a well- and thoughtfully designed project which is also most timely. In principle the
World Bank`s approach to adaptation through mainstreaming of climate risks into
development has now been widely accepted among the regional banks, the bilateral donors, and
the developing countries themselves. It is one thing to agree to a principle however and quite
another to apply it. This is one of the early projects to attempt such an application, and there is
little by way of past experience to draw upon. The project may be viewed therefore as something
of an experiment. The hypothesis may be specified as follows: It is possible to incorporate
climate risks into major development programs and projects in such a way that practical and no-
regret` measures are developed and applied, and make a real difference to the projects, and result
in safer investments and better returns on investments than would otherwise have been realized.

This project is well designed to test this hypothesis. An important implication of this is that the
project should be very carefully monitored and assessed, not simply in the usual post-audit
fashion, but from start to finish and on a continuous basis. Such an ongoing assessment should be
as arms-length and independent as possible. This would enhance the probability of its success by
facilitating course corrections during the execution of the project, and also drawing systematic
lessons that could be applied as the work is followed up and extended both in Kenya and
elsewhere.

Scientific and Technical Soundness of the Project

In conceptual terms the project is scientifically and technically sound. There is at least one big
unknown that is likely to affect the outcome of the project. Will it be possible to design and
specify adaptation measures and see them adopted at the local and community level, given the
remaining large uncertainties about the magnitude and rate of warming, and the even greater
uncertainties about future precipitation? To put the question another way: Do the farmers and
pastoralists in the arid and semi-arid lands of Kenya have the capacity to adopt adaptive
measures, given their poverty, the likely costs of the measures, the uncertainty about future
climate, and the multiple other stresses that are impacting on the system? The framers of this
project are well aware of this concern but I wonder if enough attention has been given to it, and
what strategies the project proponents have in mind to employ if they encounter difficulties in
gaining the credibility and confidence and trust of the stakeholders and communities?

Another feature of the science of climate change which has to be recognized is that climate
change is not a shift from one climate equilibrium to another. We are moving into a new
situation in which the climate will continue to change into the indefinite future. Much of the past
management of climate impacts, such as drought, has been based on the idea that it is necessary
to cope with the drought for a limited period of time until it is over and normal conditions

                                                97
return. Henceforth there will be no normal climate, only a continually changing climate. This is
quite a different mind-set, and while the experts can usually grasp it, the task of communicating
such an idea to the local communities and stakeholders will not be easy or straightforward. As
the project develops more attention to this problem is likely to be required.

Integration between the KACCAL and the baseline ALRMP

Integration between KACCAL and the existing ALRMP is crucial to the success of KACCAL.
The whole raison d`être of the KACCAL is to add climate change risks into the ALRMP. At the
present time the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) is a bit short on how the integration will in
fact occur at the ground and local operational levels. Presumably this and related issues can be
sorted out in the PDF stage. At present however the PAD gives the impression of a rather top-
down design, and not enough evidence to be completely reassuring that integration will be fully
achieved. Component 1 refers to national coordination and the use of climate risk information.
Component 2 refers to local/district planning, and Component 4 refers to program management
and monitoring and evaluation. These words, coordination, planning, program
management, and monitoring and evaluation give the reader an impression of top-down
thinking from the President`s Office. The strongest bottom-up part of the project is Component
3, where some US$ 2.3 million or over one-third of the funds will be spent on community-driven
initiatives to enhance long-term livelihood strategies.

It seems likely from the PAD that all or most of this money will be spent in only 4 of the 28
districts in the ALRMP. A full integration between KACCAL and ALRMP would seem to be
difficult if KACCAL works mainly in only 4 districts. Surely some aspects of the KACCAL
should be carried out in all the ALRMP districts? Selection of 4 districts out of 28 for the most
integrating and community-driven part of the project seems a bit restrictive, especially if the
selection is made in a top-down manner as seems inevitable.

Fit with the Goals of the SCCF

The KACCAL project seems to fit perfectly within SCCF goals and is an early and important test
case of how to mainstream climate risks into other ongoing development projects.

Replicability of the Project

To the extent that the project is successful it should be capable of being replicated elsewhere. To
begin with this might be in the ALRMP districts not included. It seems likely that there will be a
demand for scaling up investments in those districts not included in the first stage.

The decision to focus the scaling up of investments in only four districts seems to offer a
potential tool for assessing the value of the project. If the KACCAL investments are focused in
about 4 districts out of 21 or 28 it should be possible to compare at a later date the success of the
ALRMP program in those 4 districts with results in the non-scaled-up districts! Presumably this
was not the reason for limiting the KACCAL to 4 districts, but some explanation might be
helpful.

If the project is successful in practical and methodological ways there are likely to be many
demands for this sort add-on in other projects by no means limited to arid lands. A question
that might arise in this context therefore is: Will mainstreaming of climate risks always be
                                                 98
regarded as an add-on? Or can a stage be reached where all ODA-type investments automatically
include climate risks? Will the incorporation of climate risks by task managers be limited to
those projects where additional funds are available from the GEF?

Linkage to Other Focal Areas

The project is a multisectoral project and as such includes other focal areas in addition to its
focus upon farming and pastoralism in arid and semi-arid lands. How the project will actually
link with other ongoing work in water management, health, and fragile ecosystems is not yet
spelled out in detail. But the PAD gives every indication that the project will involve partners
and stakeholders from other focal areas and that the multiple objectives of the project will serve
their interests and not have any unintended impacts, and will contribute to global environmental
benefits.

Linkage to Other Programs and Action Plans at the National or Regional Level

The KACCAL is closely linked and integrated with the ALRMP and through it to other
development activities in the arid lands of Kenya, and other ongoing initiatives.

Other Beneficial or Damaging Environmental Effects

It is difficult without a full environmental impact assessment to be sure that there can be no
adverse effects. It is clear that in taking pressure off land resources the project might have
substantial environmental benefits including the improved management of water resources and
the preservation or enhancement of ecosystems. On the other hand the project will explore the
creation of alternative livelihoods through small-scale investments and could also contribute to
rural­urban migration. In advance of those choices it is impossible to state categorically that
there could be no adverse environmental consequences. It is clear however from the PAD that
the project is designed to the extent possible to avoid any such consequences and that in any case
choices will be made on the basis of careful assessments of consequences including community-
led development.

Stakeholder Involvement

Stakeholder involvement is a key component of this project. At the moment the precise
mechanisms of stakeholder involvement are not specified in the PAD, but it seems clear that they
will follow the practices already well established in the baseline project, ALRMP. An important
component of the project is work on the resolution of conflict among diverse stakeholders. This
conflict resolution work will necessarily involve close cooperation with stakeholders and the
development of trust.

Capacity Building

A considerable part of the project is devoted to capacity building. As presently formulated the
capacities to be strengthened are concentrated in the provision of services and the administration
of advice and assistance from government agencies to local communities. There is a certain
flavor of top-down in the PAD. Perhaps this is because the project has been formulated as an
integral part (or add-on) to a large and on-going successful project. The modalities of the
ALRMP seem likely to be used as an approach to capacity building, although the capacities
                                               99
themselves (how to incorporate climate risks into arid land management) are different and
additional.

It is difficult to know at this stage if there is sufficient human capacity to tackle the issues
addressed in the project. The wide array of topics to be addressed in the project (including the
operationalization of scientific information related to climate risk, the promotion of public and
private investments, community capacity building, facilitating community-based micro-projects,
and the examination of insurance possibilities), is truly formidable. It seems to this reviewer that
the project might be in danger of promising too much.

Further Suggestions

A number of other suggestions relating to the project will be sent separately. The suggestions are
keyed in to specific points in the text.

                                 Response to the STAP Review

                The response (in italics) follows the structure of the STAP review:

Overall Assessment.

Response: Overall the review of the project is positive. In order to evaluate the success of
adaptation measures, the team agrees with the importance of monitoring and reevaluating the
effectiveness of adaptation measures over the project time frame. For example, a continuous
monitoring of assets at the household level over time is suggested in the project proposal. Given
comparable exposure to risks over time, adaptation measures should contribute to the general
ability of households to maintain or increase their asset base.

The project actually takes an experimental design approach by selecting 4­5 districts and by
comparing them to 4­5 other districts included in the ALRMP (but not part of the KACCAL's
focus) which will serve as control cases. At the end of the project, it will be possible to get an
indication as to whether the additional "adaptation" activities have improved resilience, created
more alternative livelihoods, increased incomes, helped responsiveness to climate fluctuations,
and helped local communities respond in beyond what happened in the control group. This
information will help increase the overall understanding of adaptation and its needs.

One general problem of any climate change adaptation project is the discrepancy between the
long-term dimension of climate change and relative short duration of the project (in this case
four years). Hence, while a monitoring process can be started with this project it is important
that the monitoring be continued beyond the lifetime of the project. This implies also limitations
in the ability of gauging the success within this short time frame.

Scientific and Technical Soundness

Response: In the review it is questioned whether adaptation measures to climate change can be
incorporated, given other immediate pressing development needs.

This dilemma is explicitly recognized in project design by taking a differentiated approach at
various levels (national, district, local). At the local level, emphasis is placed first and foremost
on addressing the vulnerability to present climate risks and already visible changes. This
represents the first step in preparing for the longer-term challenges of climate change.

By working across scales, the project, however, aims to ensure that current risks are addressed
in policy frameworks and incentive structures in such a way that they do not lead to mal-
adaptive development paths in the medium- to long-term. Especially at the district and national
governance level attention is paid to integrate awareness of climate change impacts into
decision-making processes.

Furthermore, while the project recognizes that the existing adaptation deficit to current climate
variability and trends has to be addressed first at the local level, it is also fully acknowledge in
the design of the project components that current livelihood practices may become unsustainable
in the long run. Hence the identification of economic diversification and alternative livelihood
options, which are less vulnerable to climate change, represents an important aspect of the
project. At the local level, climate change will hence be addressed in a variety of ways:
                                                101
       Near term: Improve access to climate information, improve land-use and natural
       resource management, strengthen extension systems.
       Near to medium term: Improve buffering against climate shocks coupled with incentives
       for vulnerability reduction, e.g., insurance mechanisms are being investigated for this
       purpose.
       Medium to long term: Preparation begins now with the goal to identify and help initiate
       processes that lead to economic diversification and livelihood activities that are more
       resilient to climate variability and change in the medium- to long-term. Hence the project
       aims to identify market opportunities for more climate-resilient produce, identify
       opportunities for private sector engagement, etc.

Another important point in the review under section 2 is that climate is likely to continue to
change. The project team is aware of this. This is part of the reason why extension systems
should be strengthened with an increased emphasis on educating communities to understand
climate variability and change and also improve their capability of monitoring the climate and
relating it to their livelihood activities. The Asian Disaster Preparedness Center has successfully
carried out projects in Asia, where communities were trained to monitor climate parameters
over time and incorporate the additional knowledge into their planning processes. The project
would aim to draw on such initiatives with the goal of adjusting it to the African context.

Integration between the KACCAL and the Baseline ALRMP

Response: In conjunction with the above comments, it should be evident that the project is not
top-down driven, but rather combines top-down and bottom-up approaches. Given that the
project is closely linked to CDD activities and includes micro-projects that are identified by the
communities themselves, this combined approach is further emphasized.

Fit with the Goals of the SCCF

No response required.

Replicability

Response: The reviewer poses the question whether the activities conducted in the KACCAL
should always be an add-on to project activities or whether this should become an integral part
of ODA-type investments. This is somewhat related to ongoing debate, which is beyond the scope
of the project itself. However, it could be argued that under current circumstances and given that
adaptation to climate change is a new concern, early project activities will require an add-on in
order to address such concerns in project activities. And this is the mandate of the SCCF. Over
time, as more knowledge and experience are available, it can be envisioned that the reduction of
vulnerabilities to climate change should become a standard consideration of project planning
and implementation. However, answering where the funding would come from and how this is
being achieved are academic and political questions and cannot be answered here.

Linkage to Other Focal Areas

Response: The project is multisectoral in its scope. As the reviewer points out himself, the PAD
recognizes that links need to be established with water management, health, fragile ecosystem

                                               102
management, etc., and this is indicated in the Project Appraisal Document. How this links will
be addressed in detail and which stakeholders will be involved will be further described in the
Project Implementation Plan. Components 1 and 2 will be instrumental to foster this integrated
approach.

Linkage to Other Programs and Action Plans

No response required.

Other Beneficial or Damaging Environmental Effects

Response: It is a central objective of the project to improve land use and natural resource
management in ASAL areas to reduce the vulnerability to climate impacts. The effect of the
project on the environment has to be monitored. Reducing environmental degradation and other
harmful local effects is however clearly central in reducing the vulnerability to climate change.
In addition, and as indicated in the project brief, a full environmental and social management
framework will be finalized and disclosed by the time of appraisal.

Stakeholder Involvement

Response: Stakeholder involvement is a key feature of this project and crucial to its success. As
explained in the PAD (see for example sections on "lessons learned" and "sustainability"), the
project builds on and expands on the detailed and proven mechanisms of the ALRMP, which
include a focus on gender, conflict resolution, and involvement of disadvantaged groups. This
aspect will be further developed by the time of project appraisal.

Capacity Building

Response: Capacity building at all levels is required to address climate change successfully. This
is fully recognized in the project approach. Concerning the comments on top-down approach,
please refer to earlier feedback under points two and three.

Regarding the breadth of the project activities, the reviewer wonders whether the project is
trying to achieve too much. The project indeed has taken on a complex challenge. However, it
should be noted that the SCCF support is in connection with substantial IDA funding and links to
structures and activities that are already established under the ALRMP and have proven to be
successful. The project team therefore feels that the stated objectives can be achieved. The high
vulnerability of the region to climate changes requires a broad and integrative effort that links
adaptation activities at different levels.

   KENYA ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN ARID AND SEMI-ARID LANDS
                          (KACCAL) PROJECT

1. The project requests a total of US$ 5.5 million of SCCF funding (UNDP requested an
additional US$ 1 million of SCCF funding, which is covered in their project document).
Consistent with SCCF guidelines, the SCCF will finance less than one-third of the total costs of
the project.

2. The US$ 40 million IDA for the Arid Lands Resource Management Program
(ALRMP)/ASAL SWAp meets the proportional scale financing requirements to be considered
for funding under the SCCF. In addition, the Government of Kenya has made a very clear
commitment to reducing climate risk vulnerability in the arid and semi-arid lands of Kenya.

3. The World Bank has a well-established dialogue with the Government of Kenya, which helps
to meet development priorities and respond to drought-related emergency support in the ASALs
through ALRMP, a key government planning and investment program. The ALRMP is highly
successful and well embedded institutionally, with a home in the Office of the Prime Minister
and effective linkages to the district and community levels. However, risks related to climate
change will significantly impact activities in support of poverty reduction and development of
the area. The ALRMP is clearly addressing short-term impact of climate variability, and at the
same time it can provide a very effective delivery mechanism for mainstreaming additional,
longer-term adaptation measures.

4. Adaptation activities are designed to strengthen local adaptive capacity, reduce risks, and
contribute to the adoption of more sustainable practices within current programs. The SCCF
additional financing under KACCAL targets actions that are clearly part of the priority areas for
adaptation activities under the SCCF. They will operationalize and mainstream climate risk
management through the ALRMP by embedding a longer-term perspective in planning and in
on-the-ground interventions, improving the information chain between scientific climate-related
knowledge at one end and anticipatory responses at the local level at the other end, translating
into a strategic adaptive response to climate change risk.

5. The objective of the KACCAL is to assist Kenya in adapting to expected changes in climate
conditions that otherwise threaten the sustainability of rural livelihoods in ASALs. The project
will focus on (i) improving the ability to reduce the near-term vulnerability to current climate
variability and trends in conjunction with the ALRMP and (ii) strengthening the medium- to
long-term ability to address climate change impacts related to increased climate variability,
higher temperature, and changes in the magnitude and frequency of extreme climate events.

6. Climate change requires a broadening and strengthening of climate risk management efforts
in ASALs. Increases in temperature are already evident and are expected to become more
extreme over time for the entirety of Kenya. Trends in rainfall vary by region, while more
intense precipitation events can generally be expected. These changes are superimposed on an
already pronounced interannual climate variability associated with ENSO and fluctuations in the
surface temperature of the Indian Ocean.



                                              104
7. As a consequence of climate change, the capacity of ASALs to manage across the entire
spectrum of climate risks needs to be strengthened. Drought risk management remains crucial.
The ability to manage flood risks has to be improved, and the benefit from sporadic precipitation
events has to be improved. In addition, ASALs have to be equipped to cope with more erratic
rainy seasons.

8. Investments of KACCAL are focused on strengthening the adaptive capacity to manage
increased climate variability and change in the near, medium, and long term. By working
through the well-established structure of ALRMP, the project is able to foster strong linkages
between adaptation efforts at the national, district, and local levels.

9. At the local level, emphasis will be placed on strengthening the capacity of communities to
manage increased climate variability over the near term through targeted capacity development
and microinvestments. In addition to strengthening the enabling framework for near-term climate
risk management through the provision of knowledge, training, and coordinated investments, the
emphasis of activities at the national and district levels will also include a longer-term
perspective. Here, the focus is on identifying the processes and strategies that must be initiated
now to provide more climate-resilient options for livelihoods in ASALs in the future.
