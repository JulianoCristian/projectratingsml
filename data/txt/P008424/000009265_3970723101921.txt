Project Completion Report
Preface
This is a completion report of the Yannitsa Irrigation Project in
the Hellemic State for which a Loan of US$30.OM was approved on April 4, 1974.
The final disbursement in respect to this loan was made in July, 1983.
The report consists of a Project Completion Report (PCR) dated
March 31. 1984, which was prepared by the Greek Government, and a PCR overview
memorandum prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Projects
Department Agriculture 1 Division. The project was not selected for audit by
the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The  completion  mission  visited  Greece  in  June  1984.  The  PCR
overview memorandum is based on a review of the relevant documents, dis-
cussions with Government and with officials at the project site, where field
observations were made.
Copies of the draft report were sent to the Borrower on
December 12, 1984 for comments; however, no comments were received.
The valuable assistance provided by the Government for the prepara-
tion of this report is gratefully acknowledged.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GREECE YANNITSA IRRIGATION PROJECT
(LOAN 991-GR)
Highlights
The loan was granted to support the Government's efforts to increase
agricultural production and productivity in the Saloniki Plain through the
improvement (provision of drainage) and expansion (provision of irrigation) of
the irrigated area in Yanritsa, which was one of the least developed areas in
the country. The project was financed by a Bank Loan of US$30.OM equivalent
approved in April 4, 1974 and fully disbursed in July, 1983.
During the initial stage and due to changes in project design and
reparian problems with the Bulgarian Government over the Nestos River, it was
necessary to substantially change project scope. In addition, Project Comple-
tion had to be extended from December 1979 to December 1982 to fully disburse
the Loan. However, completion of all required physical works is estimated to
be achieved not before April 1986. These delays, exacerbated by continuous
modifications in the project's plans and contracts, and coupled with the
effects of prevailing high inflation rates during project implementation,
resulted in a total cost overrun for the modified project of about lO0Z. Main
lessons to be learned from this project are that a clear definition of tech-
nology and preparation of detailed designs before Board approval are necessary
specially when trying to introduce a technology for which domestic expertise
is not available.
The following points are of special interest:
- Appraisal without a clear definition of project's pressurized
system at feasibility level caused substantial initial delays and
changes in project scope (para 6 of overview).
- Decision to entrust preparation of final designs of modified
irrigation system to a new relatively inexperienced (for a
pressurized system) team of consultants caused further delays
(para 22 of overview);
- Changes in contractual arrangements together with cumbersome
procedures for reviewing and approving documents further delayed
project implementation (para 9 of overview); and
- Due to delays in project implementation, irrigation water has to
be channelled through drainage ditches to bring about expected
benefits (para 11 of overview).

YANNII'SA IRRIGATION PROJECT
(LOAN 991-CR)
IBRD Overview of Proiect Completion Report
I. INTRODUCTION
1.       The attached PCR was prepared by the Ministries of Agriculture and
Public Works. It provides a comprehensive description of the project origin
and implementation and it analyzes the results achieved to date and expected
to be achieved at full development. This overview memorandum comments on a
number of points which require elaboration.  It was prepared by staff of
Agriculture I Division, EMENA Project Department.
2.       Background.  In 1971, a year prior to project appraisal, agriculture
in Greece accounted for about 17.5X of GDP (in constant 1970 prices) and
employed about 40S of the total active  population.   During  the  following
decade, the active rural population decreased gradually, and in 1981 only
about 30X of the total labor force was employed in agriculture while agricul-
tural share of total GDP decreased to just over 141, although the agricultural
gross domestic product, expressed in 1970 prices, increased by over 201. During
that period, significant increases in the use of inputs (such as fertilizers,
insecticides, and pesticides) improved genetic material, and farm machinery as
well as increases in irrigated agriculture resulted in notable increases in
yields and enabled Greece to achieve food self sufficiency by the end of the
decade.   Improvements in, and expansion of, irrigated agriculture have been
and will continue to be an essential factor in the intensification and develop-
ment of Greek Agriculture.
3.       Origin, Preparation and Justification.  The Yannitsa project was the
second irrigation project to be financed by the Bank in Greece.  Although
public investment directed to the agricultural sector in the sixties had
largely been concentrated on irrigation projects, their implementation, spread
over a large number of projects, suffered from inadequate project preparation
and absence of institutional coordination, both leading to long gestation
periods.  In an attempt to rectify this situation and to concentrate invest-
ments on high priority projects, an FAOIIBRD Cooperative Program mission
visited Greece in September 1969 to review and discuss with Government the
irrigation sub-sector, to prioritize investment needs and to identify irriga-
tion projects with potential for Bank financing.
4.       During the following years, a number of investment alternatives were
reviewed by the Government and the Bank. In addition, a water balance assess-
ment for the Central Thessaly Plain was prepared by Electro-Watt in 1968 and
one for the Saloniki Plain by Efstradiatis-Angelakis Consultants in early 1971.
These reports indicated great potential for irrigation development of those two
areas. As a result of this and of further studies, the first irrigation pro-
ject, the Groundwater Development Project located in the Thessaly Plain, was
formulated and approved by the Bank in June 1971. Thereafter in October 1971,
the Government and the Bank agreed to prepare a feasibility study to rehabili-
tate and expand the existing irrigation facilities in the Nestos and Yannitsa
areas.  In mid-1972, the Ministry of Public Works, assisted by Greek consul-
tants, completed the feasibility report for an area of 26,800 ha (17,700 ha in
Yannitsa and 9,700 ha in Nestos) to be equipped with a sprinkler irrigation
system driven by diesel pumps.



- 2 -
5.       The project was appraised by the Bank at the end of 1972.  Extensive
discussions between Government and the Bank on cost recovery issues and the
passage of the law exempting farmers from repayments of irrigation investment
costs delayed the processing of the loan and a reappraisal of the project
became necessary by the end of 1973. The main objective of the then appraised
project was to intensify and increase agricultural production in the Saloniki
Plain.   It envisaged the provision of 23,600 ha (net) with (a) sprinkler
irrigation system with a tertiary pipe network fed by electrical pumps; (b)
drainage facilities for the whole area; (c) consolidation of fragmented
holdings and (d) improved extension services. The loan was signed on June 6,
1974. Under the Loan Agreement the design of the tertiary irrigation network
had to be reviewed as a condition of loan-effectiveness.
II. IMPLEMENTATION
6.       Changes in Project Scope.  In March 1975, six months after the pro-
ject was to become effective, Government appointed a group of foreign Consul-
tants to review the original designs prepared by Greek Consultants for the
tertiary irrigation network of the two sub-projects. Government's decision to
review not only the tertiary system as agreed during negotiations but the
entire irrigation system of the two sub-projects delayed appointment of consul-
tants beyond expectations. The consultant's recommendation submitted and
approved by the Government and the Bank in June 1975, (based on preliminary
designs of the tertiary network) called for substantial reduction in the number
of proposed pumping stations along the lines proposed in the appraisal report.
Although the number of pumps was reduced, changes in project design together
with higher inflation rates than estimated at appraisal in both Greece and the
rest of the world increased estimated project cost to US$90.2M for Yannitsa
(compared with US$50.9M at appraisal) and at US$36.4M for Nestos (compared with
US$21.8M at appraisal), while the internal rate of return was reestimated at
12X (compared with 14% at appraisal).
7.       To bridge the financial gap created by the cost overrun, the Govern-
ment requested the European Investment Bank (EIB) in September 1975, to consi-
der financing the foreign exchange cost of the Nestos sub-project, thus
limiting Bank financing to the Yannitsa sub-project.   However,  in December
1975, EIB informed the Greek Government and the Bank that available funds had
been fully committed and that future funds would not be forthcoming until
calendar  1977.   Furthermore,  the Bulgarian Government  informed  the  Greek
authorities their intention to use a much larger part of the Nestos River
water resources than that foreseen in previous agreements signed between che
two countries in 1964 and in 1971, and than that envisaged at appraisal.
Therefore, consideration was given by Government and the Bank to reducing the
project scope without jeopardizing the integrity and economic viability of the
project.  To that end, and after long discussions between the two parties, it
was decided to concentrate the Bank Loan on the Yannitsa sub-project and to
postpone construction of the Nestos sub-project until negotiations with the
Bulgarian Government had been completed and additional funds had been assured.
Finally, in November, 1977, and after reevaluating the viability of the pro-
ject, the Loan Agreement was amended to exclude the Nestos sub-project and to
channel all Bank resources to the foreign exchange component of the Yannitsa
sub-project.



-3-
d.       Physical Implementation.  In view of the additional time required to
complete the final designs of the tertiary network (entrusted to Greek consul-
tants under the direct supervision of Gersar-Sogreah) and to expedite project
implementation, the Government and the Bank agreed in June 1975, to split the
Yannitsa project works into at least two contracts, to be tendered interna-
tionally, one, "The First Contract", for the main and primary canals, drainage
system and road networks, and the other, for the remaining project works. This
decision was taken as designs of works included under the First Contract did
not need to await finalization of designs for tertiary network (pressurized
pipe distribution).  However, it was not until October 1976 that the bidding
process was concluded and the contract signed at a cost which was 46S below
tendering cost estimate.   Delays  in signing this contract were due to the
cumbersome bureaucratic procedures within the Greek administration for approval
of tenders and contracts.  In addition, start up of works under this contract
faced initial delays due to the contractors' difficulties in obtaining land
for project works. Although most lands were owned by Government, these had
been cultivated by private farmers over the last 30 years. The expropriation
process was finally concluded in October 1978. At that time, however, project
implementation had already slipped by about two years. Project completion was
not expected until end 1981 (as compared with December 1979 estimated at
appraisal).
9.       In August 1976, and prior to completing final designs for the ter-
tiary network, the Government and the Bank agreed again to split the remaining
project works into two contracts, one, the "Second Contract", for the civil
works of the pumping stations and the buried distribution network, and the
other, the "Third Contract", for the supply and installation of electrical
equipment for the pumping stations. Following completion of final designs for
the distribution network in December 1976, bids for the Second Contract were
tendered in April 1977 and the contract finally signed in January 1978 with,
the same contractor as under the First Contract.  The tendering process for
this contract was delayed due to unrest among Greek contractors during 1977,
as a consequence of Government's decision to introduce changes to the con-
tracting law.  Subsequent delays of well over a year were faced on start up
works due to Government's considerations and final approval of the contractor's
request to use PVC pipes for the distribution network instead of concrete pipes
as provided for in the signed contract.  With respect to the Third Contract
(for the supply and installation of pumps and associated electrical equipment),
the preparation of tender documents took till October 1978 to be finally com-
pleted and approved by Government. Shortcomings in the preparation of adequate
technical specifications and the cumbersome procedures for reviewing and
approving such documents explain those delay. Tendering documents were finally
issued in January 1979 and the contract awarded in August 1979. At that time
Project completion was not expected until end 1982.
10.      Beyond the shortcomings in preparing tenders and awarding contracts,
work planned and scheduled by the Ministry of Public Works until 1979 did not
give due consideration to interconnecting activities. Monitoring and super-
vision of project implementation by the ministries concerned (Public Works,
Agriculture, and Coordination) were weak. To overcome implementation problems,
common not only to this project but to other projects funded by the Bank in
Greece, the Bank and the Government agreed to undertake Joint Problem Project
Reviews starting in May 1979 and to focus the attention of the Economic Coor-
dination  Committee  of  the  Cabinet  on  project  implementation  issues.



Detailed revised project implementation schedules were prepared and approved
and management monitoring systems introduced as the basis for future monitoring
by all concerned parties. In addition, and due to the Bank's suggestion, a
Monitoring and Supervision Unit was established in November 1979 within the
Public Investment Department of the Ministry of Coordination. Since then, pro-
ject implementation improved substantially and, for a short period, achieve-
ments were close to agreed targets. However, shortfalls on allocation of funds
to the project, together with contractors' financial difficulties, slowed down
project implementation during the period 1981-1983.  These problems have now
been resolved and it is expected that the project will be completed by mid-
1986, six years and a half after the completion date expected at appraisal.
Additional time, until April 1986, may be required to adapt networks for higher
pressure sprinklers (cannons) which require about 60% additional pressure at
the pumping stations. This alternative is now under Government's consideration
and a decision is expected no later than September 1984.
11.      Despite these delays, the Yannitsa area started to benefit as early
as 1978, from project irrigation water provided through the new drainage sub-
systems constructed under the project; currently, the whole project area is
fully irrigated.   As a temporary arrangement, irrigation water is currently
channelled through the drainage ditches which are blocked during the irriga-
tion season, the best use being made of the facilities currently available to
farmers. Individual farmers use tractors and diesel engines to pump water
into the sprinklers to irrigate their fields. Most of the sprinklers are of
the high-pressure type, preferred because of its low labor requirements.
12.      Quality and Performance of Structures.  In general the quality of pro-
ject structures is good.  The main irrigation system, with its lined open main
canals, has functioned satisfactorily.  This  includes automatic water level
control gates and lined reservoirs which provide storage during the night when
the farmers do not irrigate. The pressure pumping stations and the buried PVC
pipe systems have so far not been tested under normal operational conditions.
However, in the near-by Kavasila area a similar system (3.5 ATO at pumping
station) is operating satisfactorily for over ten years.  The drainage system
in the project area has also functioned adequately. Although it is temporarily
used to provide irrigation water, no waterlogging problems have occurred.
Dur.ig the wet months, in the off season, the drainage pumping stations have
kept water at adequately low levels in areas which cannot be drained by
gravity.
13.      Water Demand and Supply.  The Yannitsa project area and adjacent irri-
gated areas in the Saloniki Plain depend for their water supply on the Axios
and Aliaknon rivers. The natural flows, supplemented by the Polyphyton dam on
the Aliakmon River, are more than adequate for presently irrigated areas even
in the months of maximum demand (July and August).  Currently 90,000 ha are
irrigated by two weirs (one on each river) which together can divert 60-70
m3/s for the whole irrigated area in the Plain.  Data on annual water require-
ments in the Yannitsa area are not yet available. However, the O&M organiza-
tion which coordinates the eight  water users associations of the Saloniki
Plain estimates that 503.5M m3 were diverted in 1983 for an irrigated crop
area of 80,000 ha (an average use of 6,600m3/ha); this area includes among
others 7,000 ha of rice.  Because rice is not cultivated in the project area,
and assuming that it uses twice the quantity of irrigation water required by
other crops, the irrigation water used in the Yannitsa area could average
about 5,000 m31ha.   A considerable part of the losses are due to wastige
during  the  night  when  farmers  do  not  irrigate.   However,  the  Yannitsa



-5-
irrigation system is equipped with night reservoirs, with a combined capacity
of 180,000 m3. Therefore such wastage is not expected to occur in the project
area. In addition, the closed distribution system will have higher efficiency
than the open systems operating in other areas. Hence, it is quite likely that
the irrigation efficiency in the Yannitsa project area will equal the overall
irrigation efficiency of 0.765 assumed at appraisal, and that the system will
be able to meet peak demands even in dry years.
Proiect Costs.
14.      In 1975, when the changes in project design were approved by the Bank
and the Government, the cost of the Yannitsa sub-project was estimated at
US$90.2 M (Dr 3,067 M) compared to US$ 50.9M(Dr 1,530 M) at appraisal, an
increase of about 77Z in dollar cost and just over 100% in terms of drachmas.
This large cost overrun was mainly due to changes in project design and higher
inflation rates than originally estimated at appraisal. In 1977, however, at
the time the loan was amended to exclude the Nestos sub-project (and after
having awarded the First Contract at a discounted price of 46X of the tender
estimates) the total project cost was reestimated at US$71.2 M (Dr 2,600 M).
Between 1977 and June 1984, US$87.0 M (Dr 4,980 M) have been spent in project
works. An additional US$ 13.0 M (Dr 1359 M) are estimated to be required from
July 1984 to April 1986, for the project to be completed. Total project cost
then would amount to US$ lOOM or Dr 6,339 M, an increase of about 402 in dollar
cost with respect to the cost estimated at the time the loan was amended. Due
to the large depreciation of the drachma, especially after 1979, increased pro-
ject cost in local currency terms would be well over 140X. These large cost
overruns are not only due to higher inflation rates than previously estimated,
but also to substantial project delays and, to a lesser extent, to additional
works identified during project implementation. Additional works, on the aver-
age, account for about 20X of the original three main contracts (see Annex 1).
III. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
15.      The  diversion  structures  and the main and primary irrigation and
drainage canals in the Saloniki Plain are operated and maintained by the
General Farmer's Water Users Association  (GOEV).   They plan and coordinate
water supply to the head of the areas of their 26, Local Farmer's Water Users
Association (TOEV). The TOEVS are responsible for the secondary and tertiary
irrigation networks and drainage systems in their area.  The GOEV has seven
excavators, two draglines, five backhoes, two graders, one bulldozer, and
other miscellaneous equipment to maintain the main system and to rent it to
the TOEVS; some TOEVS have also additional equipment. Small maintenance works
are done manually, by labor hired directly by the TOEVS. Drains are, however,
currently overgrown with weed partly because they are used temporarily as
irrigation canals. When their irrigation function becomes redundant, condi-
tions will be more conductive for controlling weeds.
16.      Farmers in the Central Saloniki Plain pay, on average,  Dr 4,000/ha
for the full O&M costs of the irrigation systems by means a per hectare levy.
About Dr 1,000/ha is contributed to the GOEV to meet O&M costs of the main
systems. In the Yannitsa area, farmers pay Dr 2,600 to 3,800/ha according to
the degree of completion of the systems in their particular area which cover
the current full O&M cost. Farmers pay, and will continue to pay, the full
financial O&M cost.  No recovery of investment cost is realized at present
although the loan agreement requires farmers to repay a portion of capital cost



- 6-
for replacement of drainage and irrigation facilities and for new investments.
When the Yannitsa system will be completed, the O&M cost and the farmers per
ha levy vill be increased. The O&M cost at full development Is estimated as
follows:
Dr
1.     Operation and maintenance of main systems (diversion,
feeders and  primary canals).                                  1000
2.     O&M of secondary and tertiary systems and drainage systems
in TOEV area                                                   4000
3.     Energy pressure pumping stations 500 Kwh/ha at Dr 3/Kwh
(4000 m3/ha)                                                   1500
4.     Energy drainage stations 100 Kwh/ha                             300
Dr. 6800
17.      However,  if higher pressure equipment (cannons), requiring 5.5 ATO
instead of 3.5 ATO at the pumping stations, is adopted, the OUM cost would
increase further due to extra energy requirements. Assuming that 501 of the
area would be irrigated with high pressure equipment, the total O&M cost would
increase from Dr 6,800/ha to Dr 7,600/ha. This amount will be fully charged
to farmers.  Use of higher pressure equipment would, however, substantially
reduce labor requirements  for irrigation.   The cost of energy is currently
subsidized at  Dr  3/Kwh.   Economic  energy  cost  for  similar  countries  is
estimated at about US$.06/Kwh. On that basis total O&M would increase to an
economic cost of about Dr 8,900/ha, about 30% higher than the cost estimated
in  the  PCR.   The  difference  between  economic  and  financial  cost  is not
recovered from farmers.
IV. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT.
18.      As expected at appraisal, improved irrigation facilities and inten-
sified extension services have reoriented farmers' interest from rainfed crops
to more intensive irrigated agriculture. Despite the delays in construction,
the Yannitsa area started to receive more irrigation water beginning from 1978
and currently the whole area is being irrigated. At full development cropping
intensity (as projected in Government's PCR) is expected to be 1002, the same
intensity as that without the project, compared with 1101 projected at
appraisal. This shortfall is mainly due to farmers' lack of interest to grow,
and agricultural extension's difficulties to introduce, a secund crop of maize.
Area under rainfed winter cereals (2,100 ha) is still above appraisal estimates
(1600 ha), but is expected to decline to that level by 1987, one year after the
new irrigation system is to be in full operation. Areas under cotton, maize,
fruit trees and sugar beets have already exceeded appraisal estimates while
that under alfalfa is expected to remain at the pre-project level, and the
area under tobacco to substantially decreased due mainly to its high labor
demand.
19.      Improved irrigation water availability in the Yannitsa area together
with increases in the use of inputs (fertilizer, pesticides, and insecticides)
and improved genetic material have already brought about substantial increases
in yields.  Yield levels in the project area are close to or higher than
appraisal estimates. Therefore yields for all crops at full development (1987)



-7-
are expected to be substantially higher than appraisal estimates.  Projected
yields are cooparable to actual yields obtained in the Kavasila Irrigation
project which is adjacent to the Yannitsa Project and hence they are considered
tn be realistic and attainable. Farmers in the project area have adequate
access to agricultural inputs and credit. In addition, agricultural extension
is well established.
V. ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
20.      At the time of appraisal, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) on the
proposed investments for the Yannitsa sub-projects was estimated at about
14X. Following the Government's request to cancel the Nestos sub-project from
the Loan Agreement, the ERR was estimated at 12% under the assumptions that
works would start  inmediately  in 1977, irrigation benefits using the new
irrigation network in 1979, and full development achieved in 1984.  Since
then, the estimated total project cost has increased further from US$71M to
about US$1OOM while the utilization of the new irrigation system on the whole
area is not expected until 1986. Despite the delays in the construction of
the irrigation system, the Yannitsa area started to receive more irrigation
water as early as 1978 and current yield levels in the project area are already
close to or higher than appraisal estimates (see paras 18 & 19). As a result,
the ERR recalculated in the Government's PCR is 11%, compared with 12% esti-
mated at the time of tne Loan amendment1'. Because the report was done close
to, but not after project completion, it still contains a number of assumptions
which could differ from final outcome. To test the sensitivity of the project
to changing conditions,  sensitivity analysis against some of the main key
assumptions has been carried out. Such analysis shows that the project's ERR
is rather insensitive to further plausible increases in project costs.  It
would fall to about 10% under a combined effect of a 30% increase in O&M and a
10% increase in investment costs after 1983. ERR would fall however, to about
8? if a 10% decrease in incremental benefits is added to above mentioned
increases in costs. The probability of lower production is, however, consi-
dered to be rather low.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
21.      Government Performance.  Considerable difficulties had been exper-
ienced in implementing this project, the most serious of which concerned
changes in designs requiring several modifications in project's plans, costs
and financing. The Government did not have a sufficient number of qualified
experts to prepare alternative construction plans, but was willing to hire
local and foreign experts to assist the Ministry of Public Works in undertaking
its responsibilities. The considerable delays in implementing the project, and
the associated significant cost overruns were caused mainly by delays in pre-
paring detailed designs and technical specifications (paras 8 & 9). Although
the project was the second of its kind in Greece, it was the first being
implemented by the Ministry of Public Works which was responsible for super-
vision of designs and construction of the main irrigation and drainage systems;
the first was implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture.
22.      Performance  of  Consultants.   The  foreign  consultants  which  were
appointed to review the original designs prepared by Greek Consultants for the
pressurized part of the irrigation network came up, after preliminary studies,
with sound proposals which reduced the number of pumping stations to manage-
able quantities. It also incorporated most of the secondary system in the
1/ EEC prices were used in calculating the ERR as the bulk of the agricultural
Greek trade is with EEC countries.



-8-
pressurized pipe systems. Their role at the end of their contract, October
1977, was t_ supervise the Greek consultants in preparing the final designs and
technical specifications for the pressurized system. Shortfalls in the Greek
consultants' performance in preparing tenders for the pressurized systems
resulted mainly from their lack of experience with this type of systems (see
para 9).
23.      Performance of the Bank.  During appraisal the Bank recommended the
appointment of consultants to review and introduce necessary modifications to
improve the layout of the pressurized part of the irrigation systems. It under-
estimated, however, the time required to prepare the final designs for ten-
dering, allowing for the lack of experience of Greek consultants and cumbersome
country procedures for reviewing and approving the proposed modifications. To
expedite project implementation, the Bank and the Government undertook since
May 1979, to conduct Joint Project Implementation Reviews which contributed to
the improvement of project planning and monitoring (see para 10).
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
24.      In geaeral and in spite of long implementation delays, the project is
expected to fulfill its major objective of increasing agricultural production
of the Saloniki Plain through the improvement and expansion of the irrigated
area in Yannitsa- However, the comLined effect of changes in project design,
substantial delays in project completion and hence substantial increase in
project costs, have orought down the expected ERR from 14Z estimated at
appraisal to about 11 at the time the PCR was prepared.
25.      Appraisal without a clear definition of the project's  pressurized
system at feasibility level, and Government's decision to review the whole pro-
ject design after loan signature, were the main causes of the initial delay of
well over a year prior to loan effectiveness. Based on such experience, the
Bank has since established as a basic rule that projects should be prepared
upto detailed design (for at least the first year of project works) before
Board approval, unless it could be shown that a less defined stage of prepar-
ation would not affect initial project implementation. Application of such a
rule to the project would have been beneficial.
26.      Government's decision to entrust preparation of final designs of the
modified irrigation system to a new and relatively inexperienced team of
consultants for pressurized system caused further and substantial project
delays. At the Bank's request, Gover-nment appointed a group of foreign consul-
tants, the ones who prepared the preliminary layouts, to supervise the design
wcrk of the Greek consultants. Although this was a compromise which ensured
quality control for the final designs, it proved to be time consuming and the
caused of substantial cost overruns due to delays in project implementation.
27.      Delays were also caused by the fact that 30 years of cultivation by
farmers of Government lands required for the project works had given them de
facto ownership rights. Expropriation activities required elaborate procedures
which took too much time tecause of insufficient cadastral  information.  A
more thorough check of actual land tenancy conditions during preparation and
appraisal would have avoided complications which were aggravated because land
is a scarce resource in the project area



-9-
28.      The management planning and monitoring system within the ministries
concerned was, until 1979, unsatisfactory and did not provide sufficient infor-
mation to coordinate interconnecting project activities. The introduction of
Joint Problem Project Reviews between the Bank and the Government, and of a
management monitoring system, together with the establishment of the Monitoring
and Supervision Unit within the Ministry of Coordination, have proven to be
important measures taken towards improving implementation not only of this pro-
ject but also of all externally financed projects in Greece. With hindsight,
it would appear that such reviews ought to have been initiate earlier.

YIANNITSA IRRIGATION PROJECT

INTRODUCTION
The text which follows is the Completion Report of the Yiannitsa
Irrigation Project in the ex-lake of Yiannitsa in Greece, prepared at the
time the I.B.R.D. loan for this project was completely disbursed.  By
tracing back from the time of project preparation and loan negotiations
this report attempts to throw lielt on the project implementation steps
and to arrive at some conclusiono.  However, because this report  is
prepared close to, but in any case, before project completion it was
necessary .to be based, though to a limited extend, on new projections and
estimations. Of course, this is something incompatible with the purpose
of this study, which is the presentation and the analysis of real facts.
Nevertheless, it is hoped that regardless of this report's weaknesses, it
will contribute positively to a better manipulation of future similar
projects.
The Completion Report of the Yiannitsa Irrigation Project has
been prepared by the staff* of the Ministries of Public Works and Agri-
culture. The necessary information has been gathered from the project
records existing in the central and regional services while the discus-
s;,s with the people involved in project preparation and implementation
both in Thessaloniki, headquarters of the Regional Services of the two
Hinistries, and in Athens were fruitful.

I. GREEK AGRICULTURE
1.1      General
The total area of Greece is 13,199,000 Ha of which the plains
constitute 30.3%, the mountains 42.62 and the balance (27.1%) is charac-
terized as semi-mountainous area.  The arable land is estimated to be
3,900,000 Ha which represents about 1/3 of the total area of the
country.  The arable land in the plains constitutes 55Z of the total,
that on the hills (semi-mountainous area) 252 and that on the mountains
20%; that is, the mountainous and semi-mountainous arable land consti-
tutes 45% of the total, which implies that a very large part of the
country's arable land presents serious morphological problems which in
turn results in higher production cost.
The mediterranean climate of the country, characterized by toc
much rainfall during winter and inadequate rainfall during late spring
and summer, adds to the above mentioned problems which also are magnified
by the very small size and the fragmentation of the farm ho'ldings.
(Fragmentation remains the first structural problem of the Greek agricul-
ture since the progress during the seventies was not satisfactory (Table
3). During the 1970-1980 period a significant increase in the use of
fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, herbicides, as well as in the use
of improved genetic material and farm machinery, resulted in a notable
increase  in the yields.  At  the same time a remarkable  change  took
place.  In parallel with the traditional crops such as tobacco, wheat,
currants and olives new and more dynamic crops develop. These are vege-
tables, sugar-beets, cotton, fruits and more recently maize. Of course,
that intensification of the Greek agriculture would be impossible without
irrigation. Taking into account that for the Greek farmer with the small
fragmented holding, intensification is the only possibility to earn an
acceptable income, one can understand why irrigation is a prerequisite
for any development in the Greek agriculture.
1.2      The agricultural sector in the Greek economy during the seventies
In 1971, one year earlier than the Project appraisal, 40% of the
total active population was employed in agriculture, whereas agriculture
contributed to the G.D.P. by 18.2% in current prices (or 17.5% in 1970
prices).  During the following ten years (1971-1981)  the rural active
population is reduced gradually and in 1981 constitutes 292 of the total
(Table 1). At the same time, the contribution of agriculture to G.D.P.,
expressed as percentage of it, remains constant (Table 2), although the
agricultural gross product expressed in 1970 prices is tripled as a
result of an increase in farm products production, which by the end of
this decade, is adequate to meet the demand for food (except of livestock
products).

1.3      Public Investment in Agriculture
Priority is given to infructure works during the decade of
1970-1980. In this period, public investment in agriculture constituting
30 to 40% of the total investment in agriculture decreases gradually, as
a  percentage  of  the  total  public  investment,  from  14Z  to  9-10%
(Table 4). The larger part of the public investment is directed towards
land reclamation projects while forestry and fishery absorb significantly
smaller amounts.
1.4      Land Reclamation Projects
The programme of Land Reclamation (Irrigation) Projects consti-
tutes the back bone of the Public Investment Programme during the seven-
ties. In 1971 the Irrigation Projects absorbed 3/4 of the funds alloca-
ted to agriculture and approximately 1/5 of the country's Public Invest-
ment Programme.   (The amounts expressed in current prices.   Table 5).
However, although the irrigation projects continue attracting the lion's
share of the public investment in agriculture, their share in the total
public investment programme decreases (Table 5).
As a result of this relative decrease in the public investment
directed towards irrigation projects, the rate of increase of the newly
irrigated land falls continually.  Thus,  from 1970 to 1972, 60,000 Ha
were irrigated for the first time, from 1972 to 1974, 40,000 Ha, from
1974 to 1976, 30,000 Ha, etc..
Now-a-days 1,000,000 Ha of 1,600,000 Ha of potentially irrigable
land is equipped with irrigation networks usually accompanied by comple-
mentary drainage and road networks.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
2.1      Topography, soils, climate
The area within the project perimeter, that is the former lake
Yiannitsa, constitute the central and lower part of the Thessaloniki
plain in northern Greece and is a tectonic basin in the Axios river
area.  The depth of this tectonic basin is more than 600 meters in the
center and is reduced gradually towards the perimeter of the basin. The
basin, being initially a lake, has been filled up by alluvial, colluvial
and limnic deposits.  The soils of the former lake derived from those
deposits are characterized by a high percentage of organic matter and
high productivity.   The slopes of the former lake are gentle ranging
between 0.02Z and 0.10%.   The total area lies between  lm  (close and
alongside the Loudias River and the Limni main drain) and Sm close to
perimeter. The Thessaloniki plain has a Mediterranean type climate with



- 18 -
hot dry summers and relatively mild winters. However, some frost days do
occur during winter and early spring. Wind velocities are acceptable for
springler irrigation.
Annual average precipitation for the total area is 540mm and
ranges from minimum of 450mm in the area surrounding the city of
Thessaloniki to 900mm in the eastern part of Vermion.
2.2      Water resources
The plain of Thessaloniki is irrigated3from the waters of the
Axios  river,  (summer  average  discl erge 40-50m /sec)  of  the Aliakmon
river (summer average3 discharge 30m /sec which in periods of drought,
may be reduced to 15m /sec) other smaller rivers or torrents (Edesseos,
Gallikos, Moglenitsa, Rychios) of several springs (Tripotamos Verria,
Arpitsa Naussa, Aravissos)  and  from boreholes.  The dam of Polyphyto
Kozani has an important contribution to the irrigation of the area. The
discharge of Aliskmon river during the irrigation season, without this
dam, would not be enough to feed the 17 irrigation networks as also the
sugar Factory in Platy, which are served by the deviation dam of the
Aliakmon river.
The area which could be irrigated in the plain of Thessaloniki
in 1982 from permanent or temporary networks was 1.08 million stremmas.
From this area in the same year 72Z was irrigated, i.e. 0.78 million
stremmas from which 14Z, i.e. 0.11 million stremmas are located in the
area of the Giannitsa project.
2.3      Main Crops
Early in the decade of 1970 the crop dominating the plain of
Thessaloniki, although at a lesser extent in other plains in Greece, was
the winter grains, covering about 1/3 of the cultivated area.
But as the possibilities for irrigation increase, new crops more
intensive replace the grains while the area of intensive crops which had
been introduced in the area increases. Actually the winter grains repre-
sent only 10-15Z of the total cultivated area within the irrigation net-
works, the larger area is covered by the maize, followed by cotton,
trees, sugar beats and alfalfa.
III. THE PROJECT
3.1      Project Origin
A FAO/IBRD mission visited Greece in September 1969 in order to
review the irrigation sector and make a choice among irrigation projects,
vhich might be financed by the World Bank. Their report was submitted to



- 19 -
the Bank in February 1970. In May 1970 a new World Bank mission arrived
in Greece to consider the financing of the irrigation project.
A Greek civil servants committee was set up simultaneously in
Athens together with a working group assigned the preparation of a loan
request to IBRD. The project of the above loan request was extended to
areas of Thessalid, Macedonia and Thrace.
This loan request was completed in August 1970 and submitted to
the World Bank in September.  The IBRD mission which arrived in 1970,
following the discussions with the Greek officials, agreed to limit the
Project to the area of Thessaly leaving aside Macedonia and Thrace due to
inadequacy of hydrogeologic data.
Later on, the Greek Government and the World Bank started again
discussions for a new loan.  Following these discussions two appraisal
missions came to Greece, one in October - November 1972 and another one
in October 1973. An appraisal report regarding the Nestos and Yiannitsa
projects was drawn up based on their conclusions and completed in April
1974.   The  loan agreement  concerning  the  above  two  sub-projects  was
signed in June 1974.
In  1977  the  loan  agreement  was  amended  and  the  Nestos
sub-project was excluded. The title of the project changed from "Nestos
and Yiannitsa Irrigation Project" to "Yiannitsa Irrigation Project".
3.2      Project Description
According to the initial loan agreement the project consists of:
(a) construction of primary and secondary concretelined irriga-
tion canals and related structures, and installation of
tertiary irrigation systems;
(b) construction of drainage channels to connect existing
gravity main drains, and installation of drainage pumping
stations as required to drain waterlogged areas;
(c) construction of farm access roads;
td) installation of a power network (transmission and trans-
formers) to serve adequately the irrigation and drainage
pumps installed in the abovementioned areas;
(e)  supply  of  sufficient  portable  sprinkler  equipment  to
farmers  to  realize   the  benefits  of  the   irrigation
facilities included in this project;



- 20 -
(f) installation of electrical pumps in adequate capacity and
numbers to serve the beforementioned sprinkler or equipment;
(g) supply of operation and maintenance equipment to L.R.S.; and
(h) land consolidation.
Consultants
In the initial loan agreement (Section 3.02 (a)) is stated that
the Borrower shall employ engineering consultants acceptable to, and upon
terms and conditions satisfactory to, the Borrower and the Bank:
(a)  to provide a design of the tertiary irrigation facilities
included in the Project which in the judgment of the
consultants shall represent the most economic and techni-
cally efficient design of such facilities; and
(b)  to assist the Borrower in the preparation or revision of
other designs, in the preparation of procurement specifi-
cations and in the evaluation of bids required under the
project.
3.3      Amendments to the works of the Project
The Bank and the Greek state agreed to replace the open canal
tertiary network with pipelines under pressure. Accordingly the studies
for the primary and secondary networks had to be revised to fit to the
new tertiary network.  Thus the project works have been rescheduled as
follows:
(a)  drainage network construction of 700km length;
(b)  six pumping stations;
(c)  irrigation channels of 78km length;
(d)  farm road network of 820km length;
(e)  road construction and paving with asphalt of 18.6km length;
(f)  8 bridges;
(g)  43 irrigation pumping stations with the E/l  equipment; and
(h)  pipeline networks  of  a  total  area  of  174,000  stremmas
(17,400 hectares).

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.1      Studies
Under the terms of the contract signed in November 17, 1971 with
the Group of Technical Offices, "Hydromichaniki A.E. and N. Nicolaidis
and Cooperators", as amended by the complementary contract, dated July
20, 1972, the above offices have been assigned to draw up the final study
of the complementary drainage and flood control works in the area of
Yannitsa ex-lake.
By virtue of a contract signed with the Group of Technical
Offices, "Hydromichaniki A.E. and N. Nikolaidis and Cooperators", on
January 16, 1973, the drawing up of the study for the irrigation projects
in the area of the former lake Yannitsa has been assigned. According to
the relative contract terms the two studies mentioned above took the form
of one study entitled "Final study of projects for the land reclamation
of the former Yannitsa lake area".  The estimated prcject expenditure, at
1973 prices, came up to 1,420,000,000 drs and the study has been approved
by the Ministry of Public Works.
By virtue of decision No. D.43702/10-17-75, it has been approved
to assign the project following an international bidding.
By virtue of the contract signed in November 22, 1975 the
Technical Office, "Zeris - Sotiriades", as assigned as the technical
consultant to the Ministry of Public Works.
The study of the tertiary irrigation network of th-e former lake
Yiannitsa area has been assigned to the Technical Offices, "Zeris -
Sotiriadis" and "TINEEAE Hydraulic Projects Company", on June 25, 1976.
4.2      Execution of the Project Works
During the project implementation various problems arose result-
ing in a considerable delay of the work. The above delay is mainly due
to the following:
(a) Reconsideration of the study of the tertiary network which
according to the study, was to be constructed with open
canals and finally has been approved to consist of pipe-
lines  under  pressure.   The  above  amendment  has  been
effected following the signing of the contract with the
World Bank.  Furthermore, it resulted in the also partial
redesign of the primary and the secondary network in order
to comply with the pipelines tertiary network under
pressure.



- 22 -
(b) Delimitation of the zone occupied by the works, as designed
by the Ministry of Agriculture.
(c) Provisory irrigations through the drainage network during
the project implementation.
(d) Amendment of the study for the electromechanical equipment
for the irrigation pumping stations to comply with the
Greek standards since the relevant study had applied French
standards.
(e) Financing constraints.
By December 31, 1979, which is the first closing date of the
loan agreement, the following works have been executed:
(a) drainage network construction of a length of 495km, i.e.
75%;
(b) road construction of a length of 465km, i.e 55Z;
Cc) channels of a total length of 22km, i.e. 28%;
(d) one drainage pumping station as well as works coming up to
60% for the five remaining ones;
Ce) two bridges, i.e. 30%;
(f) pipelines net-works under pressure covering area of 12,000
streimmas, i.e. 7%;
(g) two irrigation pumping station buildings, i.e. 4.5%; and
Ch)  ele- .omechanical  equipment  installation  in  one  punping
station, i.e. 22.
By December 31, 1982, the amended loan agreement closing date
and the following works have been implemented;
(a) the drainage network and all six drainage pumping stations;
(b) the farm road network up to 70% (580km);
(c) channels of a total length of 65km and 4 tanks;
(d) pipelines network under pressure of a total area of 70,000
stremmas of whicb 40,000 stremmas (Chamili Schina area)
have been completed and may be put into operation;



- 23 -
(e) buildings for 28 irrigation pumping stations and installa-
tion of their electromechanical equipment;
(f) land leveling of 40,000 streumas; and
(g) land consolidation accomplishment.
The reasons for the delay until the end of 1982 are those stated
above taking furthermore into consideration the Contractor's inability to
accelerate the rate of works implementation necessary to recover the time
spent due to known financial problems faced by the contractor.
4.3      The present situation of the project
By the end of 1983 the following works had been completed:
(a) drainage network and six drainage pumping stations;
(b) channels up to 942;
(c) 8 big bridges;
(d) road network up to 90Z;
(e)  pipelines network over a total area of 90,000 stremmas of
which 40,000 stremmas (Chamili Schina area) are ready to be
put into operation; and
(f) 34 irrigation pumping stations with their electromechanical
equipment and 9 pumping station buildings.
Expected to be completed by the end of 1984 are:
(a) the channels' construction;
(b) the small scale technical works (canals) over ditches and
channels;
(c) the road network;
(d) the pipelines network in the remaining south regions (Nisi,
Nichori, Kavasila) of an area of 35,000 stremmas in order
to operate in the 1984 irrigation period; and
(e) the installation of the electromechanical equipment in the
remaining nine irrigation pumping stations.



- 24 -
The renaining works for the total project implementation, i.e.
the accomplishment of the pipelines network in the Northern areas (Zorba,
Tsekre, Giannitsa, Balitsa, Kria Vrisi) coming up to 69,000 stremas,
will hare been completed during 1984. Finally, the land levelling works
will have been completed during 1986.
4.4      Consultant's services
The loan agreement provides for the allocation of 30 million
dollars of the loan as following:
I.    Civil works                    $11,600,000
II.    Materials and equipment           9,600,000
III.    Consultant's service                300,000
IV.    Unallocated                       8,500,000
Total           30,000,000
The $300,000 would be spent in order to employ an appropriate
consultant according to Article III, 3.02 of the loan agreement.
On April 21, 1975, the Hellenic State signed a contract with the
French consultant "GERSAR and SOGREAR INGENIEURS CONSEILS", providing for
supervision by the consultant of the study of the tertiary irrigation
networks: (a) Giannitsa in Thessaloniki plain and (b) Evlalo - Decarcho
and Erasmio of Mirodato in the Nestos plain.
The initial contract expired on June 2, 1976 extended up to
December 2, 1976 and subsequently up to June 2, 1977 to examine the study
and to evaluate the biddings for the tertiary irrigation network at the
area of the Former Giannitsa Lake. Finally, a third extension was agreed
on October 23, 1977.  (The consultant would continue to furnish the same
as previous type of consultancy.)
4.5      Project Cost
By the end of 1982 3,480,000,000 drs had been spent.  In 1983
1,153,000,000  drs were  spent.   It  is estimated  that to complete  the
project an amount of 1,650,000,000 drs is required.  The estimated total
project cost shall rise up to the sum of 6,300,000,000 drs.  The above
project expenditure over time broken down by Ministry and by works cate-
gory appear respectively in Tables 7 and 8.  The significant rise in the
project cost is mainly due to its long implementation period as well as
tc the high inflation rates recorded from 1976 until today, and especial-
ly from 1979 and on.



- 25 -
The Bank accepted this amendment by its letter dated in November
1977. The Loan closing date has been amended from December 31, 1979
initially,  to December 31,  1982  following the Bank acceptance  letter
dated January 9, 1980.
A Greek side proposition for a new extention until the end of
1983 has been rejected.  However, the Bank has accepted to keep the loan
account open until June 30, 1983.
Both, the loan allocation, according to the items of expenditure
and the respective disbursement percentages have been amended as shown in
Table 8.
V. THE LOAN
5.1      Loan description (according to the initial loan agreement)
In the Appraisal Report of April 17, 1974 the total cost of the
Nestos and Ciannitsa irrigation projects had been estimated to 72.7
million dollars.
Out of this, 30 million dollars, according to the Appraisal
report,  represent expenses in foreign currency.   Thus,  the World Bank
made its decision to grant a 30 million dollar loan requested by the
Greek Government. The loan agreement was signed on June 3, 1974 and
ratified by Law 60/1975.  The loan duration is 20 years and the grace
period is 5 years. The rate of interest is fixed at 7.5X yearly and the
commitment charge at 0.75Z for the non-disbursed loan funds.  The con-
tract closing date was December 31, 1979, allowing its potential amend-
ment following an agreement between the Bank and the Contractor as provi-
ded by Article II, paragraph 2.04 of the Contract.
The Loan amortization shall be realized according to a amorti-
zation table (Annex 3) attached to the loan agreement document.
5.2      Loan amendment
As already mentioned, the loan initially concerned Land Reclama-
tion works for Nestos and Giannitsa. However, it was finally agreed to
amend the Contract and limit it to the Giannitsa project assigning the
entire fund. This is attributed on the one hand to problems - affecting
the Nestos area arising from the absense of an agreement between Greece
and Bulgaria for the use of the Nestos water and, on the other hand, to
the delay in the commencement of the Giannitsa project implementation
which led to cost increases (due to both, the rise in prices and shift
from the open to the pipe-line under pressure tertiary network).



- 26 -
The Bank accepted this amendment by its letter dated in November
1977. The loan closing date has been amended from December 31, 1979
initially, to December 31, 1982 following the Bank acceptance letter
dated January 9, 1980.
A Greek side proposition for a new extension until the end of
1983 has been rejected. However, the Bank has accepted to keep the loan
account open until June 30, 1983.
Both the loan allocation, according to the items of expenditure,
and the respective disbursement percentages have been amended as shown in
Table 8.
5.3      Loan disbursement
The loan disbursement appear in Table 9 on a three month basis.
The Loan disbursement started after a certain delay in August 1978. The
above delay is mostly attributed to the delays in the project implementa-
tion commencement. Moreover delays arised also during the project imple-
mentation.  The above delays were firstly inter allia, due to the con-
tractors inefficiencies and to the contractors staff strikes during
project construction.
VI. PROJECT OPERATION
The new networks had not operated at all until 1982, and only
one pumping station operated in 1983. Even that, the areas, which were
irrigated in 1976 were 5,650 Ha, in 1977, 7,100, in 1979, 8,500 Ha, in
1980, 5,850 Ha (reduced the irrigation areas because of high rain fall)
in 1981, 11,470 Ha and in 1982, 11,350. That means that during 1981 and
1982, 82-83% of the total area which was provided to be irrigated, was
irrigated (i.e. 13,800 Ha, the area, resulting if from the total equipped
area of the 15,400 Ha we subtract the 1,600 Ha which is provided to be
cultivated with winter cereals for agrotechnical reasons).
The irrigation of this area is realized with water received from
the drainage ditches which are blocked during the irrigation season.
Tractors and small pumping sets are used for the pumping of the water.
The opening or the closing of the ditches is regulated by the T.0.E.V. of
the area which employs also seasonal staff for this job.  Of course,
except for the "operation" of this temporary irrigation network the
T.O.E.V.s (Table 10) have undertaken or are going to undertake also the
maintenance of the works which have been completed or are going to be
completed in the future.
The "operation" cost, administration and maintenance in 1982 and
1983 was 21, 31 million drs and 28.28 million drs respectively.

VII. COSTS' BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC POST-EVALUATION
I. Agricultural Production
7.1      Cropped Area
As it was anticipated the irrigation of the project area would
reorient the interests of the farmers from the rainfed crops to the
irrigation intensive agriculture.  The area under wheat and barley is
reduced from 5,100 Ha in 1972 (Appraisal Report) to 3,758 Ha in 1976 to
3,115 Ha in 1982 and a further reduction is projected for 1987 when this
area is expected to be 16,000 Ha. In the same period the rainfed crops
of maize, sugar beets and alfalfa are displaced completely whereas that
of cotton is reduced significantly and it is anticipated to disappear in
1987.  In Table II the development of the cropping patterns from 1972 to
1982 and the projected one in 1987 appear side by side to the projections
made by the appraisal mission.
The most remarkable difference between the two projections is
the cropping intensity which according to the available data is not going
to be much higher than 10OZ vis-a-vis the expected 110%.
7.2      Yields
The realized yields for the irrigated crops have exceeded those
of the appraisal report projections particularly when the irrigation was
accompanied by the introduction of new improved genetic material, as in
the case of the maize. As it is shown in Table 12 the yields realized in
1982 were on satisfactory levels or higher than those of the Appraisal
Report projections. With the irrigation and drainage network in opera-
tion it is expected that till the end of the development period (1987)
the realized yields will be higher than the Appraisal Report projections.
7.3      Farm income
As it is shown in Table 13 and 14 (denoting cropped areas,
yields, gross product, production cost and farm income in the project
area without the project and with the project in the full production
stage respectively), the agricultural gross product and the farm income
in the project area are expected to increase about two (2) times in 1987
due to project implementation. A summary of the two tables is shown
below:
Situation
Without the            With the project
project         (full production stage)
1.  Gross value of production      1,723,959                 3,288,693
2a. Production cost                   697,177                 1,077,680
2b. Irrigation cost                    99,650                   107,800
3.  Farm income (1, 2a, 2b)           927,132                 2,103,213

II. Calculation of Internal Rate of Return
7.4      General
The project works commenced virtually in 1976 which in the
present draft of the project completion report, is considered as "year
1".  As project life is taken a period of fifty (50) years.  The "period
of development" ends in 1986 and the "full development period" starts
from 1987.  Till the end of 1982 (closing date of the loan of IBRD)
calculations for costs and benefits are based on actual data for 1983 on
estimates and for then and on projections.
7.5      Project cost
7.5.1    Initial investment cost
The total cost of works executed under the supervision of the
ministries of Public Works and Agriculture is presented in Table 7, both
in current and 1982 constant prices.
7.5.2    Replacement cost
The following assumptions have been made for the calculation ot
the "replacement cost":
(a) The buildings of the pumping stations, the open canals, the
drainage and the road networks have the same economic life
with that of the project.
(b)  The underground pipe networks (683 km) are replaced every
twenty (20) years.  The pipe networks have been installed
gradually as follows;
1979       27 km         (95.82 m.drs)
1980      137 km        (479.09 m.drs)
1981       74 km        (263.5' m.drs)
1982       59 km        (215.59 m.drs)
1983       85 km         287.46 m.drs)
The number in parenthesis denotes the cost of the purchase and
the installation of the part of the pipe network installed in the given
year in constant 1982 prices.
(c) The equipment for each pumping station costs 10.2 m.drs in
constant  1982  prices  and  is  replaced  every  20  years.   The  pumping
stations, 43 for irrigation and 6 for drainage, have been or will be
equipped over time as follows:



- 29 -
In 1981, 15 pumping stations equipped
In 1982,  8 pumping stations equipped
In 1983,  8 pumping stations equipped
in 1984, 18 pumping stations equipped
(d) The mobile irrigation equipment, which cost 336.0 m.drs in
total and in 1982 constant prices, is replaced every 15
years. The total "replacement cost" year by year in 1982
constant prices is shown in Table 16.
7.5.3    0 and 1M cost
The irrigation cost not included in the total production cost in
both tables describing the situation "without" and "with" the project is
presented separately in Table 16.
From 1976 to 1983 the irrigation cost is the sum of the cost
(1,500 drs/stremma) of operation, maintenance and depreciation of the
tractors or the small pumping sets used in water pumping and the admini-
stration and maintenance cost of the constructed drainage and road net-
work estimated each year by the Local Water Users Associations (T.O.E.V.)
and actually paid by the farmers in the project area.  In 1976 the total
amount paid by the farmers to T.O.E.V.s was 5.62 m.drs.  In 1977, 7.08
m.drs, in 1978, 9.60 m.drs, in 1979, 12.00 m.drs, in 1980, 15.75 m.drs,
in 1981, 17.43 m.drs, in 1982, 21.31 m.drs. and in 1983, 28.28 m.drs in
current prices.
In 1984 it is anticipa:ed that 55,000 stremmas will continue to
be irrigated with water pumped from the drains.
In 1985 the total area will be irrigated from the newly con-
structed networks and the total irrigation cost is estimated to be 700
drs/stremma in 1982 constant prices.
7.6      Project Benefits
The development period is assumed to be rather short extended
only till 1986 due to the fact that the larger part of the project area
is already irrigated and therefore the farmers are familiar with the
irrigation and modern farming techniques. For each year of the develop-
ment period (1977 to 1986) as well as for 1976 (situation without the
project) and for the 1987 (situation with the project - beginning of the
full development period) the incremental benefits have been calculated
and shown in Table 13, 14 and 15.
The calculations for the years till 1982 have been based on crop
areas, yields, and production cost data supplied by the local services of
the Ministry of Agriculture.  For 1983 the calculations for the incre-
mental benefits are based on estimates and for 1984, 1985, 1986 and



- 30 -
1987 on projections.  It is pointed out that the agricultural situation
of the year 1976 (situation without the project) would not change signif-
icantly till 1986, without the project irplementation and therefore the
"Farm income" calculated for the year 1976 in Table 13 is expected to
remain fairly stable during the next decade.
7.7      Internal Rate of Return
The I.R.R. was found to be 12.3% compared to that of the
Appraisal Report of the IBRD, (14.32) this I.R.R. is moderately lower.
The decrease is due to the much longer than the planned ini-
tially one, construction period and the higher project cost.
On the other hand the irrigation of significant parts of the
project area (from the first year of the construction period) by pumping
the drain water, and the achievement of higher yields in several impor-
tant crops than those anticipated at appraisal constitute two factors
which alleviated the negative effects of the abovementioned longer con-
struction period and higher cost.
7.8      Sensitivity tests
The project cost used in the I.R.R. calculations of the present
study includes an element of taxes not been deducted. Assuming that this
tax element is 10% of the total initial cost, a new I.R.R. was calcu-
lated.  Also, new I.R.R.s were calculated by assuming lower benefits or
higher operation, maintenance and administration cost aftcr 1985.
In the following, the assumptions made and the I.R.R. found are
presented.
Assumptions                            I.R.R.
a.       10% reduction in the initial
investment cost                               13.6%

In the IBRD Appraisal Report it was reported that in 1972 300 Ha are cultivated with
second maize crop and it was projected that this area would become 1,600 Ha in the full
Development Report. Eventually, the total area under 2hd maize crops constitutes an
insignificant percentage of that anticipated.
