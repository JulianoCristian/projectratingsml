and sustainability is high. The key lessons\n            address institutional, technical/social, and operational\n            issues as follows: 1) Institutionally, the central\n            government needs to play a leading role to initiate a\n            national response, in the face of a new public health\n            threat, namely HIV/AIDS, inadequately recognized by society,\n            particularly when institutional capacity is limited. It is\n            suggested that following the initial program implementation,\n            decentralization to states, and municipal corporations,\n            should take place, to ensure appropriate local responses to\n            epidemiological patterns, institutional capacities, and\n            commitment to the program. The government should establish\n            partnerships across sectors, with NGOs, and include the\n            participation of the private sector. 2) Technically and\n            socially, there is a need to create effective coverage to\n            plan program interventions, through public information,\n            enabling policy adjustments, and behavior changes. Improved\n            health methods should be ensured, through broader blood\n            banking systems, rather than the HIV testing alone, and,\n            epidemic differentials should be considered. Financial\n            management systems should be strengthened to maintain\n            epidemiological quality. 3) Operationally, the development\n            of a computerized financial management system would\n            alleviate financial, and accounting practices, and\n            forecasting systems could be included."}, "docdt": "2000-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
