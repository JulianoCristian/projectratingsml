a start-up investment for the\n            national HIV/AIDS response, project outcome is rated\n            satisfactory. Institutional development impact is rated\n            substantial, and sustainability is rated likely. World Bank\n            and Borrower performances are rated satisfactory. This\n            project's experience suggests a number of lessons that\n            may be relevant in other countries: Building robust\n            institutions for a national response requires substantial\n            innovation and flexibility in implementation.\n            Epidemiological and behavioral surveillance provide key\n            information to build support for the response where denial\n            is high and the epidemic is otherwise \"invisible.\"\n            Projects that seek to enlist nongovernmental organizations\n            (NGOs)to implement HIV/AIDS interventions need to carefully\n            assess NGO capacity in light of what is expected, and to\n            ensure continuous training and technical support. When\n            political commitment is heterogeneous in a decentralized\n            system, channeling resources to effective programs in areas\n            with higher commitment can serve as a powerful demonstration\n            of the local feasibility of otherwise controversial\n            programs. Targeted awareness and interventions for high-risk\n            groups can be successful only to the extent that\n            complementary efforts are launched to improve the\n            environment for HIV prevention among these groups. Campaigns\n            to increase awareness of HIV/AIDS and promote changes in\n            attitudes and behavior should be informed by local research\n            in their design and implementation and in such a way as to\n            reduce the stigma of people living with HIV/AIDS. Where most\n            clients seek treatment for sexually transmitted diseases in\n            the private sector, engaging private and even traditional,\n            nonallopathic practitioners is necessary to ensure coverage\n            and impact."}, "docdt": "2003-07-02T00:00:00Z"}
