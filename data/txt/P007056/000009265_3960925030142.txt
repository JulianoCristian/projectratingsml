PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECUADOR - SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(LOAN S-006-EC)
PREFACE
1.       The Bank approved a loan  of US$11 million equivalent (Loan S-006-EC)
in August 1977 to the Government of Ecuador, to assist in the financing of
preinvestment studies and technical assistance for institutional development.
The project was executed by FONAPRE (National Preinvestment Fund), the
Government's agency for preinvestment activities.
2.       The Project was  designed  to  assist  the  Government,  in an era of
rising petroleum revenues, to address a major constraint in the development of
modern infrastructure, namely, the lack of public administrative capacity for
project preparation and execution.    The  Project  was,  thus, conceived as a
means for the Bank to assist Ecuador in the modernizing and strengthening of
the public investment process, while  expanding  the pipe-line of projects for
Ecuador's investment program.   This  Project  was  the second such opuration.
*            nThe First Technical Assistance Project  (Loan 1230-EC) aimed at preparation of
a series of  rural  development  projects.    The  Second Technical Assistance
Project scope included preinvestment  studies in the agriculture, hydrocarbon,
power, transportation, and urban sectors; institutional development assistance
to FONAPRE; and assistance to the development of the Ecuadorian consulting
industry. The Bank loan was fully disbursed by June 30, 1985.
3.       In  accordance  with   the   revised  project  performance  reporting
procedures, this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED), but the Project was not audited by OED staff. The Report was sent to
the Borrower in draft form for review and reaction.   However, they had no
comments to make.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECUADOR - SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(LOAN S-006-EC)
HIGHLIGHTS
This is the Project Completion Report for the Second Technical
Assistance Project - Ecuador (Loan S-006-EC) which was approved by the
Executive Directors in August, 1977 and became effective in March, 1978. The
project consisted  of  three  components:    (i)  preinvestment  studies; (ii)
institutional development assista'ce to FONAPRE (National Preinvestment Fund);
and (iii) assistance to the development of the Ecuadorian consulting industry.
The institutional development assistance component was co-financed by UNDP.
The first  years  of  project  implementation  were  difficult.   The
environment in which FONAPRE was operating proved to be more demanding than
envisaged during appraisal, and the appointment of the experts (whose
contribution  was  essential  to  get  the  project  started)  was  delayed by
bureaucratic difficulties (paras. 3.1 - 3.2).   After two slow years, the pace
*          of project execution improved and all components were finally implements.  The
closing date had to be postponed by more than three years, to June 30, 1985
(paras. 3.3 - 3.5).
Apart from the underestimation of the initial difficulties, the
analysis in the appraisal report and the general thrust of project activities
proved to be correct. Finally, several important project objectives were met.
Notable achievements were the completion of some majo. preinvestment studies
(in the agriculture, hydrocarbons, power and transportation fields)(paras. 6.1
- 6.8), good progress in the institutional development of FONAPRE (paras. 5.1
- 5.6, 6.9), and the preparation of a new law on consulting activities (para.
6.10). On balance, a difficult but useful project (paras. 8.1 - 8.3).



ECUADOR
SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT (LOAN S-006-EC)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT 1
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      In the mid 1970's rising petroleum revenues allowed the Ecuadorian
Government to expand the level, of public expenditure rapidly. The country
lacked  modern  infrastructure  and   large   programs  were  initiated  in
agriculture,  energy,  transportation  and  water  supply.    However,  the
improved financial situation made even  more apparent a major constraint in
Ecuador's public investment  process:    the  lack of public administration
capacity for proiect preparation and execution.
1.2      Several steps were taken to strengthen the Government's investment
planning machinery. A National Development Fund (FONADE) was established
to finance public investments with the rapidly rising petroleum revenues;
the role of the National Planning and Economic Cocrdination Board (JUNAPLA)
in the formulation and execution of development projects was strengthened;
and the National Preinvestment Fund (FONAPRE), which later became the
beneficiary of the prcject reviewed in this Report, was created. The
project was conceived as a tool for the Bank's assistance to Ecuador in
this administrative strengthening and modernization process. Preparation
work started in Septembzr, 1976.
II. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1      FONAPRE is the  Ecuadorian  Government's  agency for preinvestment
activities.  Its main functions are:    to lend funds to public and private
entities for the preparation of studies; to promote the elaboration of
studies and design work for high priority projects and to provide technical
assistance to its borrowers.    FONAPRE  classifies the studies it finances
into three  categories:    (i)  general  studies,  i.e., sectoral planning,
social/scientific/technological studies and natural resources studies; (ii)
project studies, i.e., prefeasibility, feasibility. design and engineering;
and (iii) other studies, i.e., complementary studies, and special studies
covering for example cartography, aerophotography, cadastral surveys,
1/    This Project Completion Report is based on a review of Bank files, on
conversations with Bank staff members who worked on the project, on the
P,resident's Report and Loan Agreement of 1977 and on discussions wit
the management and staff of FONAPRE in December, 198?. Final reports
were also issued by UNDP for the institutional assistance component
(Informe Final del Proyecto de Asistencia Tecnica a las Actividades
Nacionales de Preinversion - Proyecto ECU/77/09) and by FONAPRE
(Informe Final, Prestamo S-006-EC-BIRF).



organizational studies. At the time of project preparation FONAPRE had a
professional  staff  of  18,  which   grew   to  about  40  during  project
implementation.
2.2      The Second Technical  Assistance  Project  was preceded by another
operation  (Technical  Assistance  Project   -  Loan  1230-EC),  which  was
appraised in 1975, during the process of preparing a series of rural
development projects. The earlier project included the following principal
activities:    (i)  establishment  and  operation  of  a  Rural Development
P'lanning Unit; (ii) scudies to improve flood control and drainage in the
lower Guayas Basin; (iii) completion of the Tungurahua and Esmeraldas Rural
Development Projects feasibility studies and project preparation reports;
and (iv) a pilot rice scheme which was added later, during project
implementation.   Funds  were  channeled  through  FONAPRE,  which  was the
coordinating agency for project administration, but each project component
had its executing agency. The project was approved by the Board in 1976
and  implemented  between  1977  and  1985.    Results  were  mixed.    The
institutional objectives (which were to strengthen the institutional
framework for rural development policy formulation, planning, project
preparation and project execution)were not achieved, while the preparation
of specific projects was finally carried out (to the pre-feasibility
stage), although with major delays.    A  full evaluation of the results of
the First Technical Assistance Project is in the Project Completion Report
issued in February, 1986.
2.3      The Second Technical Assistance Project was prepared in late 1976
and early 1977, when the initial difficulties in the implementation of the
first project were already apparent and aimed at addressing in particular
some major institutional problems.    The President's Report indicated that
weaknesses were mainly due to: (i) the lack in most Government executing
agencies of technical personnel with adequate experiences in project
preparation; (ii) the insufficient number of qualified FONAPRE staff
members  to  substitute  for  the   required  expertise  elsewhere  in  the
Government; and (iii) the cumbersome procedures for approving FONAPRE's
loans to executing agencies and for hiring foreign consultants to be
financed by these loans.   The  procedural problems emerged mainly from the
need to obtain repeated and multiple authorizations from various Government
agencies for each FONAPRE loan agreement and for each foreign consultant
contract. The need to strengthen FONAPRE and to streamline its procedures
was therefore one of the key objectives of the new project.
2.4      The  Second  Technical  Assistance   Project  consisted  of  three
components:   (i)  preinvestment  studies;  (ii)  institutional development
assistance to FONAPRE (cofinanced by UNDP); (iii) assistance to the
de-elopment of the Ecuadorian consulting industry. Its main objective was
.o improve the efficiency  of  the  Government's investment machinery while
expanding the pipeline of projects for Ecuador's investment program.
2.5      The p:oject rationale --  as  stated  in the President's Report --
was to help strengthening the ability of FONAPRE and other Ecuadorian
agencies to carry out priority development tasks, and thus reduce the
effects of the national shortage of manpower skilled in project preparation
activities. It was thought that FONAPRE, as the central coordinating
agency for all government activities related to project preparation, had a
considerable potential for achieving an adequate level of technical

competence. Furthermore it was expected that by increasing the number of
well prepared projects tnle Second Technical Assistance project would
encourage better resource allocation, thus contributing to more substantial
benefits from the allocation, thus contributing to more substantial
benefits from the public investment  effort.    The project was approved by
the Board in August, 1977, was signed in November, and became effective in
March, 1978. The UNDP Technical Assistance Program (which was part of the
institutional development component) was signed in November, 1977.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.1      Project implementation started at a  very slow pace.  Appointments
of expatriate experts were repeatedly postponed, in some cases by up to two
years. These delays resulted in major changed in the nature of the first
phase of project activities.   While the technical assistance component had
been  cuirceived  as   an   integrated   effort   of  five  experts  working
simultaneously in different areas, the delays resulted in only one expert
being present in the first nine months, and only two being present in the
first two year.
3.2      Moreover, the environment in which FONAPRE was operating proved to
be more demanding than envisaged during appraijal. Although FONAPRE was a
young institution, with a comparatively small staff (18 professionals,
several of whom lacked in-depth sectoral and project experience), it chose
to develop a substantial,  steady  pipeline  of  projects.  This required a
concentration of staff efforts on project identification, sometimes at the
expense of supervisior  of  ongoing  studies.    Lack  of outside technical
assistance -- caused by the above mentioned delays -- compounded the
difficulties. By mid 1980 the project was at a standstill. Supervision
efforts by the Bank were intensified, and a series of tripartite reviews
(in which the Ecuadorian Government, UNDP and the Bank were represented)
were carried out.   During  the  reviews  it  was decided that the original
objectives of the project were  still  valid, but that more emphasis should
be  given  to  technical  assistance   to  the  beneficiaries  and  to  the
preparation of the preinvestment studies under the first project component.
In addition, the cronogram for the work of the experts was modified and
procedures for the hiring of experts were streamlined.
3.3      In the second half of  1980  there  was a major improvement in the
pace of project implementation.   FONAPRE  was under new management and the
agreements reached dnring the tripartite r3views started giving positive
effects. By 1981 most of the studies under the first component were under
way, and the experts financed by UNDP and by the second component of the
loan were in place.
3.4      Implementation of the third  project  component (assistance to the
development of the Ecuadorian consulting industry) received a substantial
input  from  the  Bank.    The  objective  was  to  improve  the  legal and
institutional environment in which the consulting profession operated in
Ecuador, in order to enhance the competitive position and the potential of
local consulting firms. In the first years of project implementation it
became apparent that a major effort was needed, and that the appointment of



-4-
an expatriate expert was needed to coordinate the studies. One of the
experts Zinanced by UNDP ja Bank staff member seconded to FONAPRE) devoted
a major part of his time during the first half of 1982 to guiding the
preparation of the study.    The  study  was  completed  in  late 1982.  It
consisted of a full review of the status and prospects of the consulting
industry in Ecuador and contained an analysis of the constraints to its
development.   Specific  proposals  for  changes  in  legislation were also
included. A long and complex legislative process started with the study.
A new law was drafted, it was discussed by the Ecuadorian Congress in the
next five years and was at the final stages of approval by the end of 1987.
3.5      On  balance,  project  implementation  did  not  pose unmanageable
problems. The project was rated 2 during most of the implementation
period. The difficulties were concentrated in the initial years, and after
1981 most project activities  ran  in  a  satisfactory  way.   The loan was
closed on June 30, 1985, more than three years after the date envisaged at
appraisal, and the full loan amount was disbursed.

4.2      Actual costs were  very  much  in  line  with appraisal estimates,
which is normal because the Preinvestment Studies component was essentially
a line of credit. A comparison is in Table 2.

The cost of the Consulting  Industry  Development Assistance was lower than
estimated at appraisal but  a  substantial  contribution  to this item came
from the Institutional Development Assistance component through the work of
one of the expatriate experts who led the preparation of the Consulting
Industry Study.
4.3      Actual disbursements are shown in Table 3.  The President's Report
estimated that disbursements would take place over a four-year period, but
gave no year-by-year breakdown.

Disbursements were extremely slow at  the beginning, reflecting the initial
difficulties in project  implementation.    They  reached only $0.5 million
after three years and were only at 40Z at the time originally envisaged for
project completion.   Disbursements  accelerated  thereafter,  and the full
amount was finally disbursed, but with a delay of more than three years
after the closing date envisaged during appraisal.
4.4      A financial covenant in the  Loan Agreement requested that FONAPRE
have its accounts audited by the Contraloria General de la Nacion or by
other independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Audit reports for the
years up to and including 1984 were received by the Bank -- with some
delays -- and found satisfactory. In 1986, the responsibility for auditing
the FONAPRE accounts was transferred to the Superintendencia de Bancos.
This transfer has caused delays in the preparation of the Audit Report for
1985 (the last calendar year during which Loan disbursements took place).
It is expected that the 1985 Audit Report will be completed in 1988.

V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.1      One of the mai..  objectives  of  the project was the institutional
development of FONAPRE. A brief description of the present structure and
operations of FONAPRE follows.
5.2      FONAPRE operates under  the  supervision  of  a Board of Directors
chaired  by  the   Vice-President   of   the   Republic   and  composed  of
representatives of the Ministry of Finance. the National Security Council,
CONADE and the Association of Consulting Firms of Ecuador. Its principal
functions remain the same as described in Chapter II above,  i.th the
addition of the development and updating of the Registry of Consulting
Firms, which is a newly added responsibility. FONAPRE's loans cover up to
902 of the cost of the  studies  financed.   Interest charged is 80? of the
prime rate at the time of loan approval.
5.3      At the  end  of  1987  FONAPRE  had  a  professional  staff of 41,
including 18 engineers and architects, 15 economists and sociologists, 4
lawyers  and  4  business  administration  professionals.    The  operating
department is divided into four units (each headed by a deputy director)
which are in charge of infrastructure development, agriculture and the
private sector. In 1986, FONAPRE received 69 applications for studies,
started  34  new  contracts  and   completed   17  studies.    The  largest
concentration of  new  contracts  is  for  urban  studies  (14) followed by
fisheries (6). The latter cover studies and technical assistance for the
shrimp industry which are of special interest to the private sector.
5.4      An interesting feature of the  present  work program of FONAPRE is
the heavy emphasis  on  urban  and  water  supply  activities.    This is a
comparatively recent development.   While  in  the  years 1975-83 the urban
studies were  20?  of  the  total  in  number,  in  the  years  1984-86 the
percentage increased to 342.   This  is  a very positive development, which
was actively encouraged by the Bank during the supervision of Loan 006.
This trend is likely to  continue  as  the large sectoral agencies (such as
INECEL) show a decreasing need for  FONAPRE's services while a multitude of
medium and small projects in the municipal development field will require
an increasing amount of planning and coordination efforts.
5.5      The shift towards a  larger  number  of  smaller studies will also
require a strengthening of  FONAPRE's evaluation capabilities, particularly
in the field of economic e.nalysis, because the typical client will be a
smaller, less sophisticated institution  than  the large agencies served in
the past.  Economic  analysis  has  been  a  weakness  of FONAPRE since the
completion of  the  institutional  development  assistance  component.  The
present  management  team  intends  to   address  this  problem  through  a
combination of hiring and training. Progress on this should be watched --
and perhaps further assistance should be considered -- if FONAPRE will be
associated with Bank projects in the  future.  Prospects of improvement are
good, based on the fact that on the technical, financial and administrative
side  FONAPRE  has  developed  the  staff  skills  and  expertise  that are
necessary to perform its functions successfully.



5.6      On balance, the close association  of  FONAPRE with the Bank which
resulted from the project activities seems to have given useful results.
Although some weaknesses remain (see above) FONAPRE is well on its way to
becoming a well-structured, mature institution.    As a part of its central
role in Ecuador's development planning structure, it can act as a useful
counterpart for the Bank, particularly in the urban and water sector-.
VI. IMPACT

6.2      Five studies stand  out  as  particularly  successful.   The Cocoa
Rehabilitation feasibility study aimed at preparing a national plan for the
rehabilitaLion  and  renovation   of   cocoa   plantations  (including  the
introduction of disease-resistant varieties, modernization of input and
cultivation techniques and improvements to the marketing system). The
study was completed in 1983 and resuiced in the beginning of the first
phase of a naticnal Cocoa Rehabilitation program which is very promising.



- 8 -
6.3      The Hydrocarbon Reserves study was  carried out at a crucial time.
when the Ecuadorian Government needed an independent evaluation of the
country's  petroleum   reserves   to   establish   its  policies  regarding
concessions and  rates  of  exploitation.    The  study  contributed to the
formulation of policies and helped establish a fruitful relationship
between CEPE (Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana) and the Bank,
which has resulted in subsequent projects.
6.4      The Hydroelectric Resources  Inventory  and  the Power Master Plan
were   carried   out   to   assist   INECEL   (Instituto   Ecuatoriano   de
Electrificacion) in planning a major expansion of tne Ecuadorian power
system. The studies were successfully completed and constitute the basis
for the planning of the system (including the substitution of thermal with
hydroelectric generation). The plan is being used a'. present and is being
updated, particularly in view of the changes in demand forecast. On
balance these studiet had a major impact on the power sector and were a
full success.
6.5      The Azuay Rural Roads study  was completed.  A usable construction
program based on  this  study  is  under  implementation.    The study also
contributed to strengthening the planning and implementation capabilities
of the Provincial Council of Azuay which is the executing agency for the
project. The study also had a useful demonstration effect for similar
pro_ects in other parts of the country.
6.6      Two studies failed.   The  Banco  de  Cooperativas Credit Line was
abandoned with only one sub-project (which accounts for the cost incurred)
completed. The intention was to put together a pilot scheme to finance
studies for small projects in rural areas. However, financial conditions
were not competitive with alternatives offered by other institutions, and
the project was discontinued.
6.7      The Guayaquil Sites and Services  study started with the ambitious
objectiv- of providing a model for the provision of services to the
inhabitants of the Guayaquil slums (which were and are in disastrous
condition). The study was technically completed but an invasion of the
site took place and the project was not implemented.
6.8      The remaining studies were completed and at the time of the review
had achieved or were on their way to achieving their objectives in a
satisfactory way.   As  usual  with  preinvestment activities, some studies
played a useful role even if the projects reviewed were not implemented.
For example, the Petrochemical Complex study was an attempt to take
advantage of an earlier intention to assign to Ecuador the production,
within the Andean Pact Market, of certain petrochemical products (ethylene
oxide, ethylene glicol, ethylamines,  etc.).    The study was completed but
production of petrochemicals -- also in the light of the evolution of
international prices -- was not found economically feasible and the project
was abandoned.
6.9      The impact of the Institutional Assistance Component, which can be
measured in terms of the extent to which FONAPRE is performing its
institutional objectives, is discussed in Chapter V above. This component
included (see Table enclosed as Annex 1) a pilot scheme for Municipal
Development.   Diagnostic  studies  on  the  organization  and provision of



services   in   five   medium-sized   municipalities   were   carried  out.
Interventions based on the studies were implemented with promisinp results.
This scheme had useful demonstration effects and constitutes the basis for
the expansion of FONAPRE's activities in municipal development.
6.10     The  Consulting  Industry  Assistance  Component  resulted  in the
preparation of a comprehensive study and the drafting of a new law which
restructures  the  legal   and   administrative  framework  for  consulting
activities (see Chapter III above). Thus, the impact has been substantial.
Time will tell whether the profession will respond positively to the new
regulatory system.
VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
7.1      On the basis of the  successful  implementation of the project and
of its overall positive impact, one can conclude that the Bank's analysis
and interpretation of the constraints affecting investment planning and
project preparation in Ecuador at the time of appraisal was correct.
Subsequent events, including the initial difficulties and delays in project
implementation, confirm the validity of the approach used. On balance,
results suggest that thee size and structure of the project -- although
complex and rather ambitious given the prevailing circumstances -- were
appropriate.
7.2      While appraisal costs in  terms  of  Bank  staff time were modest,
supervision has been costly. In addition to the time spent by the project
officer, substantial contributions were made by sector experts. The high
supervision input was associated with the transfer of expertise through
comments cn terms of reference, consultant selection, contract preparation,
revision of studies, etc.,  which  required  the involvement of specialized
staff and coordination within the Bank.   Given the multisectoral nature of
the project, it was not deemed appropriate to assign the supervision
responsibility to a project division, and the coordination work was handled
directly by the LAC Projects Department front office.
7.3      Working   relationships   have   been   good   throughout  project
preparation and implementation. The decision to do the coordination in the
LAC Projects Department front office proved effective. Both FONAPRE and
UNDP officers have expressed appreciation for the extent and the quality of
Bank cooperation.
7.4      In conclusion, the Bank's  contribution  to the overall success of
the project was critical.   However,  the  cost  in terms of management and
specialized staff input  was  high.    This  confirms  the  validity of the
approach used in the LAC Region in recent years, i.e. that technical
assistance in the preinvestment field would normally be associated with
project and sector lending, and that multisectoral technical assistance to
preinvestment funds should be given only in exceptional cases, like the
present one.    An  informal  division  of work  with  the  Inter American
Development Bank (IDB)  has  also  taken  place.    IDB  is  very active in
financing preinvestment funds (including FONAPRE) and has been able to
allocate low-interest resources from its Fund for Special Operations for



- 10 -
this purpose. As a result, while five preinvestment fund loans/credits
were made by the Bank between 1974 and 1980, no such lending has taken
place in recent years.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.1      This was an ambitious project.   It was weli conceived, but it was
overoptimistic in assessing the constraints of institutional nature and in
estimating the time needed  for  execution.   Implementation was difficult,
with long initial delays that resulted in the postponement of several
activities. The closing date was delayed by more than three years.
8.2      Apart from the  underestimation  of  the initial difficulties, the
analysis in the President's report and the general thrust of project
activities proved to be correct. Several important project objectives have
been met.    Notable  achievements  were  the  completion  of several major
preinvestment studies, good progress in the institutional development of
FONAPRE and the preparation of a new law on consulting activities.
8.3      Project supervision required  an  unusually  large  amount of Bank
staff time  for  coordination.    The  overall  experience  of this project
confirmed that technical assistance should normally be provided on a
sectoral basis, and that complex multisectoral operations should be limited
to exceptional cases when a sector-by-sector approach is not feasible and
alternative sources of financing are not available.
