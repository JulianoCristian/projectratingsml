The project also includes technical assistance\n            for advising and training FONAPRE's staff and that of\n            other public agencies in project preparation and management;\n            and assisting local consulting firms. There are no special\n            risks involved in the project. The principal difficulty will\n            be recruiting suitable experts and obtaining effective\n            coordination with the local staff."}, "docdt": "1977-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
