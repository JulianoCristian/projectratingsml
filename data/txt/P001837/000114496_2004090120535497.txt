    Re: SONADER Project Agreement dated February 26, 1990, related to
        Development Credit Agreement (Agricultural Sector Adjustment
        and Investment Project) of even date therewith (Credit No. 2093 MAU)
        Amendment
Sir:
  We refer to discussions held between the International Development
Association and representatives of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania in
view of replacing the functions of the liquidated Union des Banques de
Developpement (UBD) by similar ones to be executed by the Union des
Cooperatives Agricoles de Credit et d'Epargne (UNCACEM).  Copies of the new
UNCACEM Project Agreement and the Agreement providing for Amendment and
Restatement of Development Credit Agreement, as well as the cover letters
referring to the aforementioned Agreements, are attached hereto.
  In view of the above, we agree that the afore-mentioned SONADER Project
Agreement be amended as follows:  Section 2.06 (a) is deleted; the letter
"(b)" preceding the Section following it is also deleted.
  Please indicate your agreement to the foregoing Amendment by authorizing
H.E. the Ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania in Washington,
D.C. to sign the form of confirmation on the copy of this letter.
                                           Very truly yours,
                                        /s/ Edward V. K. Jaycox
                                            Vice President
