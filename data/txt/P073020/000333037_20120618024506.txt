1. Project Context, Development and Environmental Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and sector background

1.       Occupying more than 475,000 square kilometers between Central and Western
Africa, Cameroon extends from the arid fringes of the Sahara in the north to the humid
rainforest biome of the Congo Basin in the south—with a range of climatic and
vegetative zones in between. While this ecological diversity favors varied economic and
agricultural activities, 70 percent of the population depends on agriculture and pastoral
activities for their livelihood. The country is endowed with significant natural resources,
including oil, high-value timber species, and agricultural products (coffee, cotton, cocoa).
Untapped resources include natural gas, bauxite, diamonds, gold, iron, and cobalt, much
of which is located in forested areas. Forest exploitation and related activities contribute
significantly to the economy of Cameroon. They made up 8.9 percent of national gross
domestic product (GDP) between 1992 and 2000 and have grown at a rate of 4.7 percent
per year since 2000. The forestry sector likewise contributes significantly to exports,
accounting for 28.2 percent of total nonoil exports in the same period.

Program background

2.       The Government of Cameroon initiated and led the development of a 10-year
multidonor national Forest and Environment Sector Program (FESP). The FESP was
adopted in June 2004 as a common sector-development framework for government
institutions, local governing bodies, communities, the private sector, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), and development partners active in the forest domain. Grounded
in the implementation of Cameroon’s 1993 Forest Policy and 1994 Forest Law, the FESP
was designed to deepen and scale up forest policy reforms and secure those reforms
initiated under the Third Structural Adjustment Credit for Cameroon (SAC III, 1998–
2004). 1 The FESP focused on strengthening national institutions and the role of civil
society to create conditions in which local communities and the private sector could
gainfully engage in the sustainable management, conservation, and development of
forests and other natural resources. The FESP was also designed to contribute to the
poverty objectives laid out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Program (PRSP, 2003–06)
and to play a vital role in enacting the environmental policies laid out in the National
Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and the Strategy for Conservation of Wildlife and
Protected Areas. During elaboration of the FESP, Cameroon was also working toward the

  The forest sector reforms under the SAC III include (i) the establishment of a regulatory framework for
the design, approval, and monitoring of sustainable management in production forests; (ii) a competitive
system to award commercial forest logging rights in the presence of an independent observer; (iii) profound
changes in the forest taxation system supported by a joint forest revenue enhancements program by the
Ministries in charge of Forests and Finance; (iv) a forest operation control and supervision system
involving independent observers in field inspections and periodic interpretations of satellite imagery; (v)
the establishment of a consultative body through which the Ministries in charge of Justice, Finance and
Forest could exchange information on pending civil and criminal court cases (Program Document, page 10).

completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. It reached
that point on May 1, 2006. Once achieved, this made a difference to the leverage of
partners involved in FESP, as discussed later in this ICR.

3.      The participation of the World Bank and bilateral partners in the FESP was
guided by the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.2 Together, the
World Bank, the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, France,
and the Netherlands acknowledged that fragmentation and poor coordination had
undermined the success of their past assistance in the forest and environment sector. In
line with the Paris Declaration, these donors undertook to harmonize their assistance
within the framework of the FESP and to channel their support through this program
using common mechanisms. The common mechanisms agreed upon were: (i) budgetary
support aimed at supplementing national forest and environment budget allocations and
expanding sector programs; and (ii) pooled technical assistance known as the ―Basket
Fund‖ aimed at financing the capacity building required for the smooth implementation
of the FESP.3

4.      The Bank, through this Development Program Operation (DPO), participated in
the budgetary support, but did not provide any financial resources to the Basket Fund; it
remained a key participant in the Basket Fund through its participation in the common
implementation framework followed by the donors. The Basket Fund totaling USD24.3
million equivalent, was financed by bilateral partners—U.K. Department for International
Development (DFID), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), German
International Development Bank (KfW), and Agence Française de Développement
(AFD) —and executed by GiZ, the German cooperation agency. The scope of the Basket
Fund is detailed in annex 4 of the Bank DPO Program Document.

5.     These bilateral partners, along with the World Bank, were joined by other donors
in the sector—the African Development Bank (AfDB), Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), United Nations Development Programme, World Wide Fund for

  The Paris Declaration 2005 outlines the following five fundamental principles for making aid more
effective: (i) ownership: developing countries set their own strategies for poverty reduction, improve their
institutions, and tackle corruption; (ii) alignment: donor countries align behind these objectives and use
local systems; (iii) harmonisation: donor countries coordinate, simplify procedures, and share information
to avoid duplication; (iv) results: developing countries and donors shift focus to development results and
results get measured; and (v) mutual accountability: donors and partners are accountable for development
results (www.oecd.org/document/18/0,3746,en_2649_3236398_35401554_1_1_1_1,00.html).

  Excerpts from annex 4 of the World Bank Program Document: ―The Basket Fund was designed to build
sufficient capacity to implement the FESP, and will: (i) provide funding for quick, targeted and efficient
provision of the technical assistance and training envisaged in the FESP, as well as any equipment directly
related to this capacity building; (ii) enhance the financial and administrative capacity of the ministries
(MINFOF and MINEP) in charge of implementing the FESP; (iii) support capacity building of the
Ministries to enable them to implement, monitor and evaluate the FESP activities; (iii) enhance donor
coordination and minimise transaction costs for the Ministries and (iv) attract it is hoped additional external
funding in support of the FESP through the establishment and demonstration of an efficient financing
mechanism.‖

Nature (WWF), International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and SNV
Netherlands Development Organization). All signed a code of conduct on January 5,
2006, committing to maintain alignment and harmonization in the forest sector by using
common monitoring and evaluation tools and organizing joint review missions. The Bank
led the donor partnership, acting as chef de file. These agreements, linked with the Paris
Declaration, would later conflict with the Bank’s own requirements for the DPO
implementation, as discussed later in this ICR (see section 5.1.b).

6.      It should be noted that, during the preparation of the World Bankfinanced
operation, internal consultations occurred between 2002 and 2004 to define the most
suitable financing instruments for the Bank, including a parallel capacity-building credit
to accompany the budgetary support.4 The aim of the credit was ―(i) to create adequate
capacity within the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MINEF) to plan, implement,
control, and monitor activities, including budget planning, financial management, and
procurement matters; and (ii) to provide an independent assessment of MINEF’s
performance, especially for financial management, procurement, and physical
implementation of its program of work.‖ However, due to resource constraints at the
International Development Association (IDA),5 the parallel capacity-building operation
was not pursued. This would eventually impose several constraints on the Bank’s role in
DPO implementation, as noted later in this ICR (see section 5.1.a).

Rationale for Bank involvement

7.      The Forest and Environment Development Policy Grant (FEDPG)—which will
also be referred to as the DPO in this ICR—is a fully blended IDA and Global
Environment Facility (GEF) contribution to support implementation of the FESP through
budgetary support. The FEDPG was featured in the base case lending scenario of the
August 2003 joint IDA–International Finance Corporation country assistance strategy
(FY 04-06 CAS) for Cameroon. The FEDPG related strongly to two broader objectives
set out in the CAS. First, it built on Cameroon’s reform and poverty reduction gains of
recent years through its treatment of governance issues. Second, it embodied the
transition from project-specific investment to programmatic lending that the CAS
prescribed for FY 04-06. The FEDPG was therefore a sectoral pilot budget-support grant
being used for the first time in Cameroon and in Africa. It was expected to contribute to
CAS objectives by helping the Government expand its budget allocation to sector
programs using newly reformed national procurement and financial management
procedures.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDOs), Global Environmental
Objectives (GEOs), and Key Indicators (as Approved)

8.      The PDOs and GEOs were combined and were to strengthen public and private
efforts to achieve socially, economically, and ecologically sustainable use of national
forest and wildlife resources. The outcome indicators of the program are detailed in the
policy matrix included in the Program Document (annex 1, page 34) and the
Government’s policy letter attached to the Program Document (annex 5, page 56).

9.     For the first time, OP 9.01 related to the Procedures for Investment Operations
under the Global Environment Facility, was waived to enable the GEF funds to be fully
blended with IDA financing to support a DPO based on the same modalities and matrix
of conditions and triggers. To enable this to happen, the GEF Council reviewed carefully
and approved the design of the operation on May 1921, 2004. A waiver of OP 9.01 was
granted on April 13, 2005. This ICR therefore covers both the GEF and IDA financing.

1.3 Revised PDOs/GEOs (as Approved by Original Approving Authority), Key
Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

10.    The PDOs/GEOs outcome indicators remained unchanged during implementation.
The indicators in the Implementation Support and Results (ISR) reports, however, are
formulated differently to fit the ISR system but are broadly in line with the policy matrix
in annex 1 of the Program Document.


1.4. Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

The FEDPG covered the following five policy areas:

11.    Component/policy area 1: Environmental regulations and information
management. The objective was to help the Government strengthen the capacity of the
Ministry of Environment and Nature Protection (MINEP) to monitor the natural
environment, observe the environmental impact of the country’s national forest and
environment program, and ensure that the FESP’s environmental management plan was
implemented thoroughly and successfully.

12.    Component/policy area 2: Management of production forests. The focus was to
help complete the forest estate zoning plan; ensure implementation on the ground of
forest management policies and plans; promote efficiency and value-added in timber
processing and reduce waste; ensure efficient monitoring of forest production field
operations by industry, enforce the law, apply penalties; and exploit nontimber forest
products.

13.     Component/policy area 3: Management of protected areas and wildlife. The
objective was to help secure Cameroon’s protected area network by improving
regulations, increasing human and organizational capacity, adopting a landscape


                                             4
approach, and pursuing a well-structured, phased approach to increasing the effectiveness
of protected areas management.

14.     Component/policy area 4: Management of community forest resources. The
purpose was to deepen understanding of communal forest issues and strategies, improve
the quality of ongoing community efforts in natural forests, improve and scale up
community-based tree-planting schemes, help communities and local cooperatives
manage woodlands to trade sustainably produced fuel wood around urban centers
(through a fuel wood master plan), and reassign to communities or other managers state
plantations formerly controlled by ONADEF (the National Office for the Development of
Forests), a recently dissolved parastatal.

15.    Component/policy area 5: Strengthening of institutions, training, and research.
This component was intended to support capacity building across forest institutions and
to stimulate the Government to make investments in infrastructure and human resources,
thereby enabling the MINEP and the Ministry of Forests and Wildlife (MINFOF) to
develop sufficient capacity to fulfill their mandates under the forest policy framework
and the regulatory instruments created through SAC III.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

The policy areas were not revised.

1.6 Other Significant Changes

16.     Changes were made to the project’s (i) scope and scale, (ii) schedule, and (iii)
funding allocations.

Scope and scale. The project was designed around the fulfillment of selected conditions
that would trigger the release of funds in three phases. All conditions for the release of
the first tranche were met prior to effectiveness (see Key Dates), and funds were
disbursed in September 2006. The project was closed before disbursement of the two
subsequent tranches because the last trigger for the second tranche was not achieved. As
a result, the project scope and scale were reduced (ex post).

Schedule. The project closing date was extended once, from December 31, 2009, to
December 31, 2011, for two main reasons: (i) to correct the discrepancy between the
Program Document, which indicates the actual duration of the DPO (48 months), and the
IDA financing and GEF grant agreements which show a mistaken duration of 42 months;
and (ii) to enable the Government to fulfill the last trigger of the second tranche, relating
to the signing of final forest concession agreements and so make the transition to the third
tranche. Despite the extension, that trigger was not achieved. At the request of the
Government, the project was closed on October 11, 2011, before the scheduled closing
date of December 31, 2011, with the second and third tranches left undisbursed.

Funding allocation. As a result of the non release of the second and third tranches, the


                                              5
total undisbursed IDA fund was $16.53 million, and the undisbursed GEF fund was $6.20
million.

Government adoption of the Forest and Environment Development Policy Grant (FEDPG)              Met
Environmental Impact Mitigation Plan (EMP) and funding for first year’s relevant activities are
included in the draft 2005 national budget for the forest sector.
Suitable premises and a team of adequately trained and fully equipped staff are assigned to       Met
monitor implementation of the FEDPG EMP.
Regulations on environmental impact assessment are issued. The decree on environmental            Met
impact assessment (EIA) is satisfactory to the Bank.
The EIA, including the EMP, the Resettlement Policy Framework, and the Indigenous Peoples Met
Development Plan are disclosed in two national newspapers and made accessible to the public
in municipal administration facilities.
Terms of reference for main EMP activities launched in January 2005 are made public.              Met
Forest management plans (FMP) for all concessions (unités forestières d’aménagement, UFAs, Met
long-term forest management unit) awarded prior to 2000 are examined. Those deemed to
conform with requirements are approved.
Forest ministry’s comprehensive regulatory system is adopted: chain of custody control,           Met
control methods and procedures, and procedures for applying sanctions against forest crimes.
Work programs for eight focus technical operations units (Unité Technique Opérationnelle,         Met
UTO, comprising a forest concession and adjacent park) are prepared and ready for
implementation.
Baseline data are made available to measure the management effectiveness of Cameroon’s            Met

Tranche 2 (Triggers, as per Development Grant Agreement)
List of conditions                                                                                  Status
Budget allocation and execution. As of December 31 of the fiscal year during which the first      Met
tranche was released, the recipient has committed not less than 75 percent of the fraction of its
forest and green environment sectoral annual budget financed out of the IDA grant, the GEF
Trust Fund, and its own resources.
Comments. This trigger was formally met in late 2009, based on financial records made available to the
Bank (that is, financial audit for the fiscal years 2007 and 2008) and public expenditure reviews performed
by other donors (such as DFID’s review of the budget support performed in 2009 and the 2010 review of
budget support by the Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GiZ), MINFOF, and MINEP).
According to data obtained during donor joint supervision missions carried out in December 2009, the
consumption rate of the external resources (first tranche) reached 86 percent (that is, 9.1 billion CFA
francs out of the 10.6 billion allocated), whereas the utilization of internal resources stood at 96 percent for
the MINFOF and 94 percent for the MINEP (as per 2008 data). The stakeholders’ workshop held in Douala
in November 2011 confirmed these figures.
Environmental and social monitoring. The recipient has successfully implemented activities          Met
defined for 2006 in the EMP and established an environmental and social monitoring
mechanism, as evidenced by work programs, reports, and implementation of mitigation
measures.
Comments. This trigger was formally achieved in 2009. The MINEP’s Environmental Information System
(EIS) is fully operational at the central level. The GéoBIEP Impact Monitoring Tool (base d’information et
d’evaluation permanente), developed by the GiZ, was integrated into the EIS.
Sustainable management of production forests. The recipient has: (i) reviewed management          Not met
plans for all UFAs awarded before January 2002 and for all existing communal forests, and (ii)
signed final concession agreements for UFAs with companies having fulfilled their obligations
and taken appropriate measures against companies that are in violation of their obligations
(including, as the case may be, the termination of the concession), all as evidenced by copies of
the signed final concession agreements and relevant notifications to companies.
Comments. Based on the February 2012 assessment by the MINFOF:


                                                       7
(i) Management plans of all 65 UFAs awarded before January 2002 have been reviewed6 and 64 were
approved; 42 have an approved EIA. Of the 65 UFAs, 47 have been officially gazetted as part of the
permanent forest estate. Six communal forests have reviewed and approved management plans, and seven
have plans under preparation. 12 communal forests have a gazette decree already signed; another 28 are in
preparation.
(ii) Final concession agreements (conventions définitives) have been signed for 20 out of the 65 UFAs. 19
of the concessions include a provision by the Government allowing for mining activities in the event of
mines discovered in these UFAs. This is a potential threat to sustained management of forest resources.
Three UFAs have been abandoned. For the remaining 42 UFAs, the conditions for signature of a final
concession agreement are not yet fulfilled for a variety of reasons: no evidence of an existing or planned
wood processing unit, no gazetting or missing EIAs.
Achievement of this trigger was the most important element of the DPO with respect to long-term
sustainability of the forest sector. Without it, the long-term management of forests remains uncertain.
Wildlife and protected areas management. Three focus UTOs have received a management            Met
effectiveness score (MES) between 40 and 55; three focus UTOs have received an MES
between 20 and 40; one focus UTO has received an MES of at least 17, and one has received
an MES of at least 6, all as evidenced by a third-party evaluation carried out on terms of
reference satisfactory to IDA.
Comments. This trigger was also considered as the GEO indicator. It was met in 2007. The assessment
made by the WWF indicates efficiency scores that are higher than expected: 5 UTOs have an MES above
55 (Benue 79; Korup 77; Waza 76; Campo Ma’an 69; Mbam and Djerem 56); one has an MES between 40
and 55 (Boumba Bek-Nki 45), and two have an MES between 2 0 and 40 (Bakossi 28; Ndongoré 28).
Community management of forest resources. Simple management plans of good quality have Met
been prepared and/or satisfactorily implemented in 10 community forests, as evidenced by said
plans, a report on their implementation has been prepared by the MINFOF and supervision
assessments undertaken.
Comments. This trigger was achieved in 2010. More than 10 (that is, 15) community forests are well
managed in accordance with their simple management plan. This was formally confirmed by an assessment
mission held by the MINFOF in January 2010. The October 2010 joint supervision mission was provided
with a copy of the MINFOF report.
Institutional strengthening. Satisfactory computerized financial management and monitoring      Met
mechanisms are operational within the MINFOF and MINEP at the central, provincial, and
departmental levels and are consistent with the DEPMI, all as evidenced by documentation
showing ongoing internal and external monitoring of the MINFOF and MINEP expenses and
financial management.
Comments. This trigger was met in February 2010. The computerized application for financial management
(DEPMI Ordonnateur) is operational at the central level and is being deployed in the regions and
departments. A presentation of the device was performed during the joint donor supervision mission in
October 2010. This trigger was deemed met by the latter, although the DEPMI Ordonnateur was not fully
operational at the decentralized level, owing to the time needed to shift from the former financial system
(SICAF) to DEPMI, because of insufficient training of and equipment for the staff in the regions and
departments.

 As evidenced by reports from the MINEP on review of EIAs, monitoring implementation of mitigation
measures in existing concessions.

List of conditions                                                                               Status
Budget allocation and execution. As of December 31 of the fiscal year during which the second Not met
tranche was released, the recipient has committed not less than 75 percent of the fraction of its
forest and green environment sectoral annual budget financed out of the grant, the GEF Trust
Fund, and its own resources.
Environmental and social monitoring. An evaluation of the program activities’ quantitative and Not met
qualitative impacts has been carried out, as evidenced by a publicly available report prepared
on the basis of terms of reference defined in a participatory manner.
Comments. The terms of reference for an evaluation of the qualitative and quantitative impacts of the
activities of the FESP were prepared in 2011 and the process to hire a competent consultant was underway.
Sustainable management of production forests. Illegal logging is under control in all UFAs not Not met
awarded by December 2005 and in protected areas, as evidenced by satellite images used in the
Global Forest Watch Report dated December 2005 and comparable satellite images and/or
field visits of the same areas showing a significant decrease in the number of illegal logging
roads in comparison to the level observed in 2005.
Comments. The World Research Institute recently updated the 2005 baseline data regarding illegal roads
adopted at appraisal, which is now 1,024 kilometers. The institute will be commissioned to provide satellite
images (terms of reference are under preparation) to measure the extent of illegal logging roads for the
period 2008–11.
Wildlife and protected areas management. Three focus UTOs have received an MES over 55; Partially
three focus UTOs have received an MES between 40 and 55; one has received an MES of at            met
least 26, and one has received an MES of at least 17—all as evidenced on the basis of a third-
party evaluation carried out on terms of reference satisfactory to IDA; the National Biodiversity
Strategy and Action Plan has been updated and adopted by the MINFOF and MINEP; and the
fraction of the Deng Deng zone retained for conservation purposes has been transformed into a
wildlife reserve and the protection of this site has been guaranteed in the field. Terms of
reference were prepared for an updated study to further review the scores.
Comments. This trigger was achieved in substance. The MESs assessed by the WWF in 2007 were rated
above the target values to be reached for the release of the third tranche. Terms of reference for a new
assessment to update the 2007 scores have been prepared. The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action
Plan have not been finalized. Beyond expectation, the total area of the Deng Deng retained for conservation
has been converted into a national park, instead of a fraction of it converted into a wildlife reserve.
Community management of forest resources. At least 90 percent of plantations established on Not met
state-owned gazetted land and previously under management of ONADEF (now ANAFOR) are
reassigned to appropriate management structures, with competitive award of management
contracts to the private sector, management contract with local communities, transformation
into UFAs, integration into existing UFAs, transformation into protected areas with no
productive purpose (conservation and/or protection), integration into national parks or
environmental protection areas, or declassification of plantations into urban zones—all as
evidenced by official signed acts by the MINFOF and/or MINEP in support of the new status.
Comments. 49 percent of plantations previously under ONADEF were reassigned. Out of the 17,306
hectares (ha) managed by the latter, 8,446 ha are now being managed under UFAs, 23 ha have become
protected areas, 8,077 ha are planned to be transferred to municipalities, and 760 ha are awaiting
reassignment.




                                                     9
Institutional strengthening. At least 50 forestry facilities have been rehabilitated (including     Not met
through infrastructure, equipment, and/or training) at the technical directorate, provincial, and
departmental levels, as evidenced by upgrade reports, listings of works carried out, equipment
bought, and field visits.
Comments. Results show that 50 percent of the objective was met. The stakeholders’ workshop held in
Douala in November 2011 performed a review of all the investments toward forestry facilities. A list of
investments was given to the Bank.

Closing of the operation                                   October 11, 2011              61.63            5.07



18.    The initial delay was due mainly to: (i) the change of instrument from a Specific
Investment Loan (SIL) to a DPO in the course of preparation, which required extensive
consultations within the Bank to ensure the program’s sound design, and externally, with
the Cameroon Government, development partners, and NGOs, to ensure that this new
instrument would be well adapted and understood by all stakeholders; (ii) the delay in the
preparation and adoption of the Government’s multidonor FESP, the sole instrument for
donor support for forest sector development (the donor coordination process led by the
Government was laborious, and the FESP was not adopted until June 2004); and (iii)
delay in completion of prior conditions, mainly the restructuring of ONADEF into
ANAFOR and adoption of several pending forest-related decrees.

19.     Implementation was delayed owing to: (i) underuse of the IDA and GEF grant
proceeds owing to a lack of understanding of the DPO flow-of-funds mechanisms in the
ministries of finance (MINFI), forests (MINFOF), and environment (MINEP), after the
departure of key staff involved in the preparation of the DPO7; (ii) institutional conflicts;


7
    Many of the FESP champions had left the ministries.


                                                      10
(iii) weak interministerial collaboration; (iv) multiple implementation committees; and
(v) the delay in meeting the last trigger of the second tranche.8

Belated availability of funds

20.    There was a lack of understanding by the MINFI, MINFOF, and MINEP of the
budget-support mechanism and flow of funds procedures, mainly owing to the staff
turnover mentioned above. Enhancement of stakeholders’ technical and financial
management capacity through the multidonor Basket Fund put in place to accompany
implementation of the DPO and FESP proved insufficient. Until 2007 the Treasury
appeared to be unaware of the central bank (BEAC) account into which budget-support
resources were deposited and did not draw on those resources, which resulted in
disbursement delays. Instead, it continued to use its own resources (such as the Special
Fund for Forestry Development) to reach the DPO objectives. To address this issue, the
Budget Act was amended in 2007 to mainstream budget support into the finance law, and
a manual on budget-support utilization was developed. A DPO line was added to the
Government budget by updating the budget coding system.

Institutional changes and conflicts

21.     Poor cooperation between the MINFOF and MINEP deeply affected program
implementation. The program was initially designed to benefit the Ministry of
Environment and Forests, which was split into the MINEP and MINFOF in 2004. The
former became responsible for component 1, and the latter for components 2–5. The two
new ministries conflicted over their respective responsibilities on management of
protected areas, and over the distribution of financial resources, which led the
Government to establish a specific interministerial committee in a facilitation role. These
conflicts, which persisted for four years, resulted in significant delays for environment-
related activities under components 3 and 5. Because the MINFOF was managing the
Basket Fund, the MINEP was at a disadvantage to receive funds for training and
technical assistance, causing frustration.

22.      Conflict over financial resources. During implementation of the DPO, the conflict
was mainly over control of the budget for the environmental policy part of the DPO,
because the newly established MINEP did not understand the nature of the operation and
was insisting on getting its ―piece of the pie‖ directly from the Bank. These kinds of
conflicts could not be envisioned, especially because the Ministry of Finance clearly
agreed to provide the MINEP with the necessary financing to implement its part of the
program. For the Ministry of the Economy, Planning, and Regional Government
(MINEPAT) the issue was different, because this ministry traditionally does not involve
itself in implementation and would rather play a facilitating role between the Bank and


8
  That trigger required the Government to have signed final concession agreements for UFAs with
companies having fulfilled their obligations and to have taken appropriate measures against companies in
violation of their obligations (including, as the case may be, the termination of the concession)—all as
evidenced by copies of the signed final concession agreements and relevant notifications to companies.


                                                  11
the implementing agencies. This type of ―conflict‖ had existed in other DPOs, for
example, in Latin America, for which reason parallel technical assistance loans were
developed to provide some direct support to the implementing ministry and to enhance
their ownership of the DPOs, the resources from which normally went into the Treasury
to help provide overall balance-of-payments support.

Weak interministerial cooperation

23.     Weak interministerial cooperation also hampered several activities of the program.
Completing the forest estate zoning plan, a successful MINFOF-led process that is
essential for sustained forest management, was stalled soon after responsibility for the
process was transferred to the MINEPAT. The latter did not take the zoning of the forest
estate as a priority and made no efforts to stimulate and organize the much-needed
cooperation among ministries in the sectors most relevant to this zoning process (for
example, agriculture, mining, and infrastructure). Program objectives for the wood-
processing industry in the South (see Policy Area 2 in the Program Document) and
household energy in the North (see Policy Area 4 in the Program Document) were not
reached, in a significant part due to weak cooperation between the MINFOF and the
ministries of industry and energy.

Multiple implementation committees

24.     The institutional structure organized to plan, coordinate, facilitate, and monitor
implementation of the DPO was complex and did not perform in an efficient manner. The
structure included regional planning committees in each of the regions where the program
was active, five component program committees, the COMREM (Comité chargé de la
mise en œuvre de la revue institutionnelle, de la coordination et du pilotage du PSFE),
and the FESP facilitation committee, which was created to improve cooperation between
the MINFOF, MINEP, and MINFI. These committees did not meet regularly, owing to
Government funding constraints, and therefore could not closely monitor program
implementation. The FESP facilitation committee (chaired by the MINFI) also had
decision-making problems because its leadership was not at the appropriate level of
authority. Furthermore, meetings were often chaired by a subordinate, further weakening
the facilitation process. This committee could have been more effective if it had been led
at the Prime Minister’s level.

Tranche 2 triggers

25.     The trigger that related to final forest concessions9 (also referred to as the UFA
trigger) was the only tranche 2 trigger (of six) that did not reach its target value. From a
target of 65 UFAs, only 20 obtained their final concessions (conventions définitives),


9
  That is, the recipient has signed final concession agreements for UFAs with companies having fulfilled
their obligations and taken appropriate measures against companies that are in violation of their obligations
(including, as the case may be, the termination of the concession), all as evidenced by copies of the signed
final concession agreements and relevant notifications to companies.


                                                     12
leading to nonrelease of tranches 2 and 3, and ultimately the failure of the DPO. The
nonachievement of the UFA trigger was due to the decision by the Prime Minister’s
office not to sign the pending final concessions because of their nonconformity with
article 50 (2) of the 1994 Forest Law, which required that each concessionaire build a
sawmill in the area of the UFA to create local employment. Since there were 33
concession requests with sawmills inside the UFA, and only 20 were finally signed, it is
clear that the nonachievement of the UFA trigger was also caused by other problems,
other than the formal reason given by the Government. Among these are the inefficient
processing of the concession dossiers by the MINFOF (including losing key documents,
such as environmental assessments and even originals of the gazetting decrees, or decrets
de classement).

26.     It should be noted that the sawmill clause had created an overcapacity of wood
processing in the country, which resulted in new concessionaires opting to associate with
existing units and submitting their final concessions requests without a plan to create a
new unit. The Presidency had proposed in the past that this be addressed by redrafting the
forest law, a process that would take several years. Therefore, the Bank and the
Government agreed in 2009 that an ordinance should be drafted for the President’s
signature that would alter the relevant section of the law to allow concession holders to
have a single sawmill for multiple forest concessions, and for some concession holders
that lacked sawmills to partner with existing sawmills rather than for each to build its
own.

27.     The ordinance was reviewed and cleared by the Prime Minister’s Office and
forwarded to the Presidency for signature, where it stalled. The Bank senior management
team—during the November 2010 visit to Cameroon of the director of the Africa
Sustainable Development Network (SDN)—requested the Prime Minister and the
Minister of Forests to further follow up with the Presidency to sign the ordinance. Bank
management (the AFTEN sector manager and staff based in the Cameroon country office,
the sector leader, and the Country Management Unit) met with a senior adviser at the
Presidency in February 2011 to follow up on the ordinance issue and later approached the
Presidency to reiterate the need for a signature and for approval of the final concessions.
Both the Presidency (during the February 2011 meeting) and the Minister of Finance
(during the 2011 spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund,
and on other occasions) made clear that they did not perceive that permanent allocation of
land to timber companies would bring ―sufficient economic benefits to the State‖ (versus
other land-use options). This Government perception could explain the delays in the final
concession allocations and in promulgation of the ordinance (which would have removed
the obstacle to the allocations).

28.     A shortcoming on the Bank side that may have contributed to the Government’s
reluctance to sign the pending concessions is that while management was working with
the Government to address the matter of the UFA trigger through the promulgation of a
presidential ordinance, several supervision missions suggested that the trigger could
either be reformulated or postponed to tranche 3 (see aide-memoire of June 2008, May
2009, and October 2010). These proposals may have raised expectations on the


                                            13
Government side that tranche 2 could be released without full achievement of the UFA
trigger. But the task team’s suggested options were not viable, as they entailed the
restructuring of the operation, which conflicted with the essence of the DPO instrument
under OP/BP8.60. The confusion between the SIL instrument (which can be restructured)
and the DPO (which cannot unless the unmet trigger is waived by the Board) could
explain the task team’s suggested strategies. Another important drawback of these
options, independent from DPO rules, was that they were risky, given that there was no
guarantee that postponing the issue to the third tranche would yield the desired results.
Therefore, working with the Government to issue an ordinance appeared to be the best
option to ensure sustainable management of forests.

29.     Accordingly, the task team’s proposals were not approved by management.
Following the visit of the director of the Africa SDN to Cameroon in November 2010, the
Cameroon country director wrote to the Government recommending that action plans be
developed by the Ministry of Forests (i) for the fulfillment of the UFA trigger with target
dates for end-January, March, and June 2011, and (ii) for the achievement of tranche 3
triggers before September 2011. The action plan was not achieved by the time the DPO
was closed on October 11, 2011, at the request of the Government but precipitated
through Bank discussions.

30.     In reality, the forestry sector in Cameroon today faces increasing pressures,
driven by growing demand for land for mining and industrial plantations and now backed
by attractive investment opportunities. Economic opportunities in the mining sector, in
particular, are likely to overtake those for the forestry sector at the highest levels of the
Government. In addition to this, one cannot ignore the fact that there was likely ―reform
fatigue‖ following completion of the HIPC requirements on May 1, 2006, when the
Government was probably not feeling ready to reengage in another set of reforms
probably considered cumbersome, as opposed to actual investments on the ground.

31.     A general shift in the Government’s focus and interest can be observed—from
sustainable livelihoods and natural resources management at the time the DPO was
prepared toward a greater emphasis on economic growth and employment in the latter
years of its implementation. Although the forestry sector is a key source of employment,
it appears to have been facing new competition from other sectors in the recent growth
and employment strategy (stratégie pour la croissance et l’emploi).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

32.     Design. The design of the M&E system was based on (i) the ―Policy Matrix of
Key Actions and Indicators‖ (annex 1 of the Program Document), which details the
baseline and expected outcomes for each component, the conditions for tranche release,
and the key milestones of the program, and (ii) the ―Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators
and Baseline Values‖ (annex 10 of the Program Document), which described, for each
condition and milestone, the results indicators, their baseline and target values, and the
verification source.




                                             14
33.     Overall, the indicators used to monitor and evaluate implementation of the
program were relevant and well structured to measure the outcomes expected from the
DPO. But the 0-or-1 rating system adopted for many indicators was not suitable for
measuring the intermediate progress achieved by several aspects of the program (that is,
key steps actually taken in upgrading/developing a system or a policy, with only few
steps left to make the system or the policy operational).
34.     Implementation. The Government was in charge of implementing the M&E
system, with core responsibility given to a monitoring unit (cellule de suivi) within the
MINFOF. Some external monitoring of the program was provided under an independent
review commissioned by the MINFOF and by the joint donor supervision missions
organized on a yearly basis. The MINFOF established a set of M&E procedures pursuant
to a manual developed in a participatory manner and issued in early 2007. The manual
fully integrated M&E in the planning and implementation process of the FESP as a whole.
Collecting and synthesizing data on past activities were supposed to be performed using
the same bottom-up approach used to plan future activities. Regional planning
committees, component program committees, the COMREM, the monitoring committee,
and the FESP facilitation committee were to meet twice a year to plan and to feed the
M&E system.

35.     The system worked reasonably well, with a few shortcomings resulting from
inadequate funding of M&E activities. It produced annual reports and Rapports de
rendement (progress reports) that provided cumulative assessments of progress of the
FESP activities. But it was not fully able to meet the needs of the Bank. The system could
not cope with the diversity and complexity of the FESP. Only one annual meeting could
be organized at each level of the planning/M&E process because of funding constraints
(because they were not eligible for Bank or other donor support, such meetings were
funded only partially by the Government); and planning was thus given precedence over
M&E, often resulting in incomplete data collection and superficial evaluation of
indicators. Because of the same funding constraints, little verification of data could be
organized in the field. Finally the Rapports de rendement ended up feeding into a matrix,
known as ―CIDA matrix,‖ developed with Canadian bilateral assistance. This matrix was
designed to monitor and evaluate the FESP at large, beyond the activities funded by the
Bank. To meet the needs of the Government and of all the donors supporting the FESP, it
gradually superseded and deviated from the World Bank matrix presented in annex 10 of
the Program Document, which was eventually effectively ignored by the M&E system as
implemented by the MINFOF.
36.     External monitoring proved helpful but did not seem to make a real difference.
Only one late independent review was carried out in 2010. This review was descriptive,
rather than analytical, and mainly highlighted the positive aspects of the implementation
of the FESP. The joint donor supervision missions gave good opportunities for donors
and Government representatives to assess results in the field. But they focused mostly on
conditions for tranche release and often overlooked broader aspects of overall program
implementation. In addition, these missions referred to the Rapports de rendement and
the CIDA matrix during most of the DPO implementation and also gradually abandoned
the annex 10 matrix. When, in the end, they had to return to the latter, it became difficult
to quantify indicators with the same level of accuracy.


                                             15
37.     Utilization. The M&E system served mainly as an overall reporting tool and as
the instrument used to assess progress for tranche release. It helped only partially in
assessing the overall outcomes and results achieved by the DPO because its indicators
were not quantified with the same level of reliability and accuracy.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (If Any)

38.     No follow-up operation or next phase was planned when the ICR was prepared.
But the need for continuing some level of dialogue in the forestry sector is acknowledged.
The intensity of that dialogue must be guided by the findings of the ICR and the present
political economy of the sector.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation to Current Country and
Global Priorities, and Bank Assistance Strategy

39.     Relevance to past global country priorities. At the time of project preparation, the
project objectives were highly relevant to the Government’s global priorities of ensuring
macroeconomic stability, reducing poverty, investing in social services, and making
progress on privatization and reform of the forestry sector. These priorities were also
triggers for Cameroon to reach the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative
completion point, which became effective on May 1, 2006. In line with the forestry sector
reform, the Government, in coordination with its development partners, including the
World Bank, was engaged in the preparation of a 10-year FESP to implement reforms in
the sector. The FESP was adopted in June 2004. The DPO objectives were in line with
the FESP, as well as with the 2003 results-based country assistance strategy (CAS), by
supporting two poverty reduction pillars: (i) improvement of pro-poor economic
management and service delivery and (ii) economic diversification and accelerated
growth. The operation was also meant to make the transition from project-specific
investment to programmatic policy-based lending that the CAS prescribed for FY 0406,
and was therefore used as a pilot program for sectoral budget support in Cameroon.

40.     Relevance to current global priorities. The project objectives remained relevant
throughout implementation and are relevant to the current CAS (FY10–13), more
particularly with respect to its first strategic theme (―increasing Cameroon’s
competitiveness‖) and its axis 2 (―activities geared toward ensuring the transparent,
equitable, and sustainable use of natural resources, including mining, agriculture,
fisheries, and protected areas‖). The FEDPG is key to achieving CAS outcome 6
pertaining to improved transparency, equity, and sustainability in the use of natural
resources.

41.     In the context of current development priorities expressed in the Government’s
Vision 2035 and the new PRSP for the 201020 period, the program objectives appear to
be less relevant than during its preparation and implementation period. The time elapsed


                                             16
between setting the program’s goals and the latter years of its implementation was so
great that the national policy agenda moved on, putting more emphasis on economic
growth and employment. ―Cameroon Vision 2035‖ serves as the long-term anchor for the
PRSP, known as the Growth and Employment Strategy (Document de stratégie pour la
croissance et l’emploi, DSCE). The Government’s current declared long-term
development priorities are: (i) to reduce poverty to less than 10 percent, (ii) to become a
middle-income country, (iii) to industrialize, and (iv) to consolidate democracy and
national unity. To achieve this national vision, the strategy aims at increasing growth,
employment, and industrialization. The forestry and environment sectors, in general—
and the sustainable use of national forests and wildlife resources, in particular—are not
explicitly identified as priority growth and employment avenues for the development of
the economy. Rather, emphasis is put on value chains that add more value within the
country and improved competitiveness through the use of natural resources, including
mining and extensive agriculture (which, if not managed properly, could have a
significant adverse impact on the sustainable use of such resources).

42.    Although the Government changed its priorities, the forest industry remains a
very important employer in Cameroon (in both the formal and informal economies), and
fuel wood is a major source of energy. In the context of a jobs-and-industry–oriented
growth strategy, a well-managed forest industry and small- and large-scale fuel wood and
charcoal production have a role to play in meeting domestic demands, just as much (and
perhaps more) than supplying external markets. This is important because ―becoming a
middle-income industrialized country with growth and jobs‖ and having a vibrant, well-
managed forest sector with a transparent investment environment can go hand in hand.
The operation was ―about‖ this, and so in that regard is still highly relevant.

3.2 Achievement of PDOs

43.    Achievement of PDOs is measured through the PDO/GEO) outcome indicators,
tranche triggers, and milestones. The PDO/GEO outcome indicators, as described in
section F of the datasheet are worded differently from the Program Document for the
purpose of the ISR system. But they are broadly in line with the policy matrix in annex 1
of the Program Document which provides a much more thorough basis for assessing
PDOs. The ICR will therefore base its assessment on the policy matrix.

44.     PDOs and GEOs are combined ―to strengthen public and private efforts to achieve
socially, economically, and ecologically sustainable use of national forest and wildlife
resources.‖ In line with ICR good practice and guidelines, and considering that ―the DO
is so broad and/or vaguely worded as to preclude a meaningful evaluation‖ (ICR
Guidelines-OPCS, August 2006, updated on May 10, 2011), the assessment of
achievement of the development objective is inferred from associated outcome targets as
defined at the component level in the policy matrix. To achieve its overall development
objective, the FEDPG had 14 interdependent outcomes (defined in the policy matrix) to
be pursued under the 5 components. The table below describes the FEDPG’s 14 proposed
outcomes and their actual degree of achievement.




                                            17
45.    Compared with the baseline outlined at the component level (see Policy Matrix of
Key Actions and Indicators, annex 1 of the Program Document), and based on the
assessment provided in the table below, the overall achievements of the operation appear
modest.

46.    However, the GEO level indicator, that is, an ―increase of average protected area
management effectiveness score (MES) from 28 to 50+ for 8 key protected areas existing
in 2005‖ was fully achieved, thereby adhering to the GEF Strategic Objective 1 (SO-1, to
catalyze sustainability of protected area systems) and Strategic Program 3 (SP3,
―Strengthening Terrestrial Protected Area Networks‖) of the GEF Biodiversity Program.
Considering this, the project’s overall achievement with respect to the GEF’s concerns
was substantial.

Outcomes and Evidence of Achievement                                                      Status

Outcome 1 (component 1, implemented by MINEP). Adequate regulatory                        Achieved
instruments and institutional capacity enable the Environment Ministry to monitor and
evaluate the social and environmental impact of national forest policies and programs,
particularly the impact of the FEDPG. Public consultation mechanisms and
collaboration with civil society are improved.
This outcome was linked to two tranche 1 prior actions, and one condition for the release of the second
tranche.
 (i) Regulations on environmental impact assessment (EIA) were issued and the decree on EIA was
satisfactory to the Bank. The Government adopted general regulations on EIA procedures and standards in
2005 through a decree (2005/0577/PM–23/02/2005) and an enforcement regulation (arrêté 0070/MINEP–
22/04/2005) spelling out the activities subject to an EIA. Three other arrêtés provided rules for EIAs
(00001/MINEP–03/02/2007), procedures allowing consulting firms to perform EIAs (00004/MINEP–
03/07/2007), and terms of reference specific to EIAs in production forests (plantations and reforestation)
and communal forests (00002/MINEP–13/02/2007).
(ii) Suitable premises and a team of adequately trained and fully equipped staff were assigned to monitor
and evaluate the implementation of the FEDPG’s environmental impact mitigation plan (EMP). The
organizational chart of the Ministry of Environment and Nature Protection (MINEP) was approved (Decree
2005/117, adopted on April 14, 2005; Decree 2005/496, adopted on December 31, 2005). To date, out of
the 596 positions listed in the organizational chart of the MINEP, 482 positions are filled (81 percent of the
objective).
(iii) FY 2005 EMP activities were carried out with adequate institutional capacity for social and
environmental monitoring.
(iv) As regards public consultations and collaboration with the civil society, see outcome 14.
Outcome 2 (component 1). The public has access to information on the environment          Partially Achieved
and the management of public environmental goods.
This outcome was implemented by the MINEP. The MINEP has created an environmental information
system (EIS) that is online (www.SIE-cameroun.com), and is also made directly accessible to the public
through the CIDE (Centre d’Information et de Documentation sur l’Environnement), located in the
MINEP, thanks to a facility providing computers and tutorial support to selected users (primarily students
and NGOs. The EIS fully integrates the German Cooperation Agency’s (GiZ’s) GéoBIEP system. Further
integration of other environmental information systems, such as the EMIS and the CPSP/CAPECE
information system, has not been achieved, although planned since 2009.
Outcome 3 (component 2, implemented by MINFOF). 100 percent of production                 Achieved
forests allocated, 75 percent managed according to approved FMPs, and the
remainder having FMPs under preparation.



                                                      18
According to the MINFOF’s February 2012 assessment of the situation of all forest management units
(UFAs) awarded in Cameroon since 1996, 83 out of a total of 92 (or 90 percent) have an approved
management plan (PDO indicator 1). All management plans have been reviewed.

Outcome 4 (component 2). Illegal logging is halted or very significantly reduced in         Partially achieved
state-managed forests (in production and protected areas), and violators of the forest
code are actively and publicly pursued.
As per the third trigger to release the third tranche—halting or reducing illegal logging, as evidenced by
satellite images assessing the extent of illegal forest roads—could not be documented (PDO indicator 2).
Although illegal logging has been significantly reduced and strong action has been taken (limitation of
petits-titres) in nonpermanent State forests (which was not subject of the trigger), it has not been fully
halted. Illegal logging in unallocated UFAs and Protected Areas was measured by the World Research
Institute in 2008 using a very specific methodology. They were to repeat this assessment in 2011, and terms
or reference were prepared. But due to the fact that it was becoming clear that the Government was failing
to meet trigger 2, pressure to achieve all tranche 3 triggers was reduced.
The national forest control strategy is implemented. From 2006 to 2011, the coverage rate of forests visited
by the Central Control Unit (UCC) of the MINFOF and/or by regional control brigades each year, with the
support of the independent observer, increased from 60 percent to 100 percent. Violations are published
now quarterly in official and private newspapers. But there was a long period (several years) when
violations were not published regularly, which was subject of much criticism by the civil society.
Outcome 5 (component 2). A draft land-use plan is prepared collaboratively by               Not achieved
concerned ministries through a highly participatory process.
The ministries of planning, land administration, forests and environment, and agriculture and animal
husbandry have not yet agreed on a common approach to land-use/zone planning for areas not yet covered
(zones 6 and 7 and the Northern Provinces), and the forest-zoning plan earlier prepared by the MINFOF for
zone 5 has not yet been validated by the Government. A specialized firm has been selected to undertake
socioeconomic surveys, mapping, and other tasks related to land-use planning in preparation for the zoning
of zones 6 and 7.
Outcome 6 (component 3, implemented by MINFOF). 50 percent of protected areas Achieved
achieve a satisfactory management effectiveness rating. Endangered species are
effectively protected.
Pursuant to the fourth trigger for the second tranche and the fourth trigger for the third tranche, the
management effectiveness scores of protected areas assessed by the WWF for the eight focus UTOs
(Technical Operational Unit) in 2007 were rated above the target values to be reached for release of the two
tranches (a GEO indicator), thus confirming that endangered species were reasonably well protected in the
eight focus UTOs.
Outcome 7 (component 3). Local communities participate in the management of                 Partially achieved
protected areas and hunting zones.
Existing regulations relevant to participatory development, approval, and implementation of management
plans for protected areas clearly stipulate local people’s rights and obligations in protected areas,
particularly with respect to: (i) modalities of access, (ii) type of activities allowed, (iii) implementation of
agreed regulation, and (iv) conflict resolution mechanisms and application of sanctions. So far, 10
management plans for protected areas have been developed along these lines and approved.
No community-based wildlife management plan was prepared, and only terms of reference for preliminary
studies were prepared. Community hunting zones are managed on the basis of a Cahier des charges signed
by the communities and MINFOF.
Outcome 8 (component 3). Forest logging companies implement biodiversity                    Partially Achieved
protection measures in concessions located near ecologically sensitive areas.




                                                       19
FMPs incorporate measures to protect wildlife and preserve biodiversity. All FMPs were reviewed and are
being implemented under regular control by the MINFOF’s central and regional control units. But reports
by the independent observer show that about 40 percent of logging companies comply only partially or not
at all with the requirements of their FMPs. A GiZ-financed study also clearly showed that the quality of
FMPs was often not good, or consistent.
Outcome 9 (component 3). The foundation for modern and autonomous management Achieved
of protected areas and wildlife has been created.
The MINFOF and MINEP made regulatory, institutional, and financing adjustments to conform with the
2003 Wildlife and Protected Area Strategy. With respect to regulations, decree 95/466 on concession
procedures, surveillance, contractual obligations in ZIC/ZICCGs (zone d’intéret cynégétique), and
community access to wildlife management (for example, the MINFOF cahier des charges appended to
game and wildlife management contracts with communities in the vicinity of protected areas) was revised.
With respect to institutions for autonomous Protected Areas and wildlife management, nonessential
functions were delegated to private entities and local communities (for example, the MINFOF arrêtés
allocating 25 ZICGCs to local communities). With respect to financing, measures were taken for the
utilization and distribution of revenues and taxes, diversification, budget and financial control, and
partnership with foundations (for example, Joint Ministerial Order 520 on the management and
redistribution of forest and wildlife taxes).
Outcome 10 (component 4, implemented by MINFOF). A comprehensive incentive Not achieved
framework stimulates communities to engage in and benefit from: (i) community-based
management of natural forests and hunting zones; (ii) tree planting; and (iii)
woodland management of trade in wood fuels.
Although 15 community-based management plans (plans simples de gestion) were successfully
implemented (fifth trigger for the second tranche), the MINFOF has not yet enacted regulations to stimulate
the development of community woodland management or fuel wood master plans and tree planting
schemes by communities, individuals, and investors. This appears to be due to the MINFOF’s
unwillingness to decentralize its power over forest management to the community level. This is a
significant failure of the Program.
Outcome 11 (component 4). All state-owned plantations and other areas previously Partially achieved
under the National Office for the Development of Forests’ (ONADEF’s) responsibility
are reassigned to more appropriate management structures.
With reference to the fifth trigger for release of the third tranche, only 49 percent of the 17,306 hectares of
previous ONADEF plantations were transferred to more appropriate structures.
Outcome 12 (component 5, implemented by MINFOF). Revitalized public                   Partially Achieved
institutions are able to provide fundamental oversight and management services at the
field level.




                                                       20
Public institutions were revitalized based on the following three criteria: (i) human resources, (ii)
computerized financial management, and (iii) rehabilitation of offices.
Human resources: All the MINFOF vacancies are filled, both at the central and local levels, and job
descriptions revised (condition for first tranche release). The management of the MINFOF personnel has
been improved through the SIGIPES (Système Informatisé de Gestion du Personnel et de la Solde).
Personnel have been trained on policy, law, and regulation (2,000 man-days of training were provided on
these topics) and incentives (such as performance awards) were introduced. But these incentives were
ineffective. They were only aimed at some staff and not performance based, but became entitlements,
regardless of performance. This was a significant failure of the program.
Computerized financial management. The MINFOF and MINEP managers at the central level are using the
new financial management software named ―DEPMI Ordonnateur‖ for financial management and control
of public expenditures; SICAF, the software previously used, has been abandoned, a condition for second
tranche release).
Rehabilitation of offices: 25 new facilities were built or rehabilitated, a condition for third tranche release.
Outcome 13 (component 5). The National Agency for Forests Development                         Partially achieved
(ANAFOR) is successful in its new capacity to support private tree planting and has
shed the old functions of the ONADEF.
The ANAFOR (the new National Agency for Forests Development which replaced ONADEF) is not yet
fully operational since the National Program for the Development of Forest Plantation (PNDPF), which is
supposed to be its core strategic and planning basis, is not yet ready. The same goes with the Fund for the
Development of Plantations (FDP), which should be its main instrument to fund the development of forest
plantations. But the ANAFOR made significant progress in improving the regulatory environment for
smallholders forest plantations, developing its staff capacities in line with its specific new mandate,
informing stakeholders, and transferring the ONADEF plantations to more appropriate management
structures.
Outcome 14 (component 5). The MINFOF effectively enforces forest laws and                     Partially achieved
regulations and maintains a constructive dialogue with the private sector and civil
society.
Results show some progress has been made in law enforcement. This could be reflected by the ratio
between the number of sanctions effectively applied to the number sanction decisions related to illegal
exploitation. That ratio grew from 37 percent in 2007 to 60 percent in 2011 (intermediate outcome indicator
2). But several cases were never properly recorded and submitted as ―cases for judgment.‖ Regular
consultations with the private sector (comités consultatifs) are held through at least six meetings a year.
Multipartner consultations are also held at the regional level to prepare and monitor annual work plans.

achievement from the PDO indicators and M&E indicators identified in annex 10 of the Project Document.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating, Combining Relevance, and
Achievement of PDOs

Rating: Unsatisfactory

47.     This operation achieved some positive results despite the difficulties encountered
in its execution. First, all 18 prior actions of the first tranche were achieved, leading to
the disbursement of $13.6 million of which $9.8 million (from IDA) and $3.8 million
(from GEF) on September 18, 2006, before the original planned disbursement date of
September 30, 2006. Second, despite the nonrelease of tranches 2 and 3, totaling $21.4
million (of which GEF gave $6.2 million and IDA $15.2 million), 8 of the 14 outcomes
(57 percent) were either fully or partially achieved. The main reason for rating the overall


                                                        21
outcome unsatisfactory is the fact that the one tranche 2 trigger that was not achieved was
the most important part of the operation with respect to long-term sustainability of the
forest sector. Without it, the long-term management of forests remains uncertain.
Furthermore, failure to complete this trigger led to the closure of the project without
further disbursement over the five-year duration of the operation, thereby totally
defeating the fast-disbursing purpose of the DPO.

48.     More importantly, some of the unachieved indicators—for example, halting
illegal logging, preparation of a draft land-use plan, enforcement of forest laws and
regulations, participation of communities in the management of protected areas and
hunting zones, implementation of biodiversity protection measures by forest-logging
companies—have undeniable implications for the sustainable use of national forest and
wildlife resources by public and private stakeholders and, thus, for achievement of the
PDO/GEO of strengthening public and private efforts to achieve socially, economically,
and ecologically sustainable use of national forest and wildlife resources.

49.    Finally, substantial delays and issues in achieving some of the outcomes, along
with the cost to the Government and the Bank of keeping a program running this long and
then not achieving the desired outcomes or disbursing the full amount of the DPO, reflect
shortcomings in efficiency, whereas apparent inconsistencies in the country’s current
development priorities point to shortcomings in relevance. Thus, the overall outcome is
rated Unsatisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty impacts and social development

Poverty impacts
50.     Although there was no specific indicator in this regard, FEDPG components 2, 3,
and 4 had an impact on poverty reduction. An evaluation was not conducted to
substantiate this, but the ICR mission had discussions with stakeholders, including a UFA,
one with a signed final concession, that provided relevant evidence. This UFA informed
the mission that ―improved management of [the] UFA has resulted in local employment
to meet the demands of forest management plans, to do field work (for example, forest
inventories, organized felling and skidding, registration of stumps and logs) and
administrative work (for example, recording field data, preparing the documentation
required by the forest and customs administrations). Improved management of wildlife
and protected areas is also bound to provide employment in relation to tourism and
hunting. Direct income to neighboring communities is generated by activities, such as
hunting, allowed in the protected areas or in their buffer zones.‖ According to people
engaged in community forest management encountered during the ICR mission, this
activity has provided the community with income from wood sales, increased
employment opportunities (for example, inventories, felling and processing of logs,
manual transportation of sawn products, provision of food to field workers, and some
administrative work), and also additional indirect benefits, such as improved access to
and control over the forest land allocated to the community.


                                             22
51.     Although this impact could not be quantified during the FEDPG implementation,
it will be possible to do so in the future as the result of the Base d’information et
d’evaluation permanente (GéoBIEP), an impact-monitoring tool developed with German
support and now integrated in the Environmental Information Management System
recently developed by the MINEP with the FEDPG support. GéoBIEP was designed to
link forest management with the evolution of poverty levels, governance, and natural
resources. To date, however, no poverty data are available to document changes since
2007 and evaluate how the latter relates to the FESP in general and to the FEDPG in
particular.

Social development
52.      FEDPG policy areas 2 and 4 also affected social development in forest areas.
Under the modern forest management plans (FMPs) of UFAs, concessionaires are
delivering various social services to the population under a Cahier des charges, which is
negotiated with village communities and stipulates the concessionaires’ social obligations
(for example, building schools and health centers, maintaining roads and bridges,
building sawmills to provide jobs locally, or creating facilities for poultry farming to
replace bush meat). This social impact is particularly important in UFAs managed under
a certification scheme. In the most successful communal forests, a significant part of the
revenues generated by wood sales is also used to fund some social investments, mainly
schools and village health centers.

53.     The FEDPG has also helped to consolidate the achievements of SAC III regarding
redistribution of the proceeds of the annual forest fee (redevance forestière annuelle,
RFA) at the local level for development initiatives. It advocated for an improved culture
of transparency (through the regular publication of forest fees in newspapers), which is
crucial due to prevalent corruption risks. In addition, the findings of a 2007 Review of the
use of local forest tax revenues has indicated an urgent need to strengthen the governance
of the RFA and the larger system of political representation in which it operates. To date,
the RFA functions under Joint Order 520/MINATD/MINFI/MINFOF of June 3, 2010
(enforced by the Finance Law 2009/019, under which non-forest-producing councils are
included as beneficiaries of the forest royalties). Joint Order 520 provides that 10 percent
of the RFA proceeds are directed to the local population (communautés villageoises
riveraines, 90 percent for investments in micro-projects and 10 percent for operating
costs), 20 percent to municipalities located in forest areas (forest-producing councils),
and 20 percent to fund projects drafted by the national fund for strengthening
municipalities (Fonds Spécial d’Equipement et d’Intervention Intercommunale,
FEICOM). The remaining 50 percent goes to the state treasury. Tax revenues collected
by local governing bodies are to be directed to finance microprojects that deliver local
public goods, such as social infrastructure and rural roads. The quality of these
microprojects (targeting and implementation) would have benefited from further
assessment. But in the course of program implementation, the RFA allocation key was
revised and the new formula is less attractive for communities near forest concessions.
Under political pressure, 20 percent of revenues are now channeled through the FEICOM
to all municipalities in Cameroon.


                                             23
 (b) Institutional change and strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on
longer-term capacity and institutional development)
54.     The MINFOF and MINEP were the first ministries in Cameroon to adopt, during
the implementing phase of the FESP, a new results-based budget allocation to sector
programs. Capacity for operational planning, monitoring, and evaluation improved
significantly after regular supervision by technical assistants (for the preparation of
annual work plans and activity reports). A central and transparent system for planning,
budgeting, and monitoring all ministry activities (the DEPMI Ordonnateur) became
operational in 2011. An audit of the multidonor budget-support mechanism for FY07 and
FY08 demonstrated weaknesses in record-keeping and accountability, but, according to
the ISRs, the situation is reported to have improved in FY09 and FY10. The MINFOF
and MINEP are now recognized as vanguards in the field of the results-based program
budgeting and serve as examples for other ministries. Under the Document de stratégie
pour la croissance et l’emploi, this approach will be integrated gradually in all other
sectoral ministries as part of the implementation of administrative reform.

(c) Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive and negative)

55.     In the context of the lack of subsequent Bank disbursements owing to the
unfulfilled condition for the second tranche, the Government (more particularly the
MINEP) prefinanced and pursued environmental activities following its medium-term
expenditure framework and annual workplans. An external evaluation in 2010 reported
that, from budget support of 1.03 billion CFA francs, the MINEP had eventually
disbursed 1.595 billion (as of 2009). Besides, a number of supervision missions (June
2008, May 2009, and October 2010), suggesting that signature of the remaining final
concession agreements could be postponed to the third tranche, might have reinforced the
Government’s expectations that the trigger issue would be solved and second tranche
funds released. When it became official that the FEDPG would be closed, the
Government requested that the Bank reimburse it (about 10 billion CFA francs according
to the Government’s ICR) for the activities that were prefinanced. During the ICR
mission, the Government reiterated its request to be reimbursed for funds expensed and
the Country Management Unit representative explained that this was not doable
according to the Bank guidelines.

56.     This reinforces the fact that the newly created MINEF did not understand the
purpose of the DPO, which do not provide funds for specific investments for Ministries,
but are essentially balance of payments support through the provision of rapid injections
of foreign exchange (against the meeting of a set of conditions/triggers for specific
tranches) to the Treasury.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

57.    Consultations were conducted by the ICR mission in February 2012 with civil
society organizations (CSOs, NGOs represented by their apex organization),
representatives from a communal forest, and several delegates from the private sector


                                           24
(concessionaires and wood-processing industries). Overall, CSOs have emphasized an
important number of issues and expressed critical concerns (see annex 2 for more details)
as follows: (i) although CSOs were involved in program formulation, participation in
program implementation was very limited and unsatisfactory (for example, the CSOs
were not involved in the preparation of annual work plans, and no mechanisms were
devised to fund NGO involvement in program implementation); (ii) the procedures
manual for managing and acquiring community forests was a success and has improved
communities’ access to natural resources (no data was provided by the CSOs to
substantiate this); (iii) the adoption of the regulation regarding the redistribution of
annual forest fees is a significant benefit from the program to communities and local
governments 10 ; (iv) the FESP and FEDPG are credited by the private sector for the
improvements resulting from mandatory forest management plans and for more
professional and equitable forest control, law enforcement, and application of penalties;
and (v) the FESP and FEDPG fell short of providing the forest industry with the fiscal
incentives that were much in demand by the private sector to promote lesser-known
species and exports of processed wood.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes

58.      Risks to development outcomes and sustainability are assessed against
institutional support, political/Government ownership, and environmental and social risk
criteria.
Rating: Given the risks and the mitigation measures presented below, the overall risk to
the development outcome is rated Significant.

59.     The institutional support risk to development outcome is moderate. Through the
results-based budget-allocation approach to sector programs, the FEDPG contributed
greatly to institutional strengthening (through improved financial transfer mechanisms
between the Treasury and line ministries and preparation of annual work plans at the
national and regional levels), empowerment, and capacity building. Although some gaps
(cumbersome and nontransparent procurement procedures) still need to be filled to ensure
sustainability, the MINFOF is now considered as a positive example in Cameroon for
implementing results-oriented programming, budgeting, and monitoring.
60.     The environmental risk to development outcome is significant. The FEDPG
significantly improved the management of wildlife and protected areas, promoting
environmentally conscious management of production forests. The sustainability of
outcomes, however, may be at risk for three main reasons: (i) the lack of predictable and
adequate funding that may affect the sustainability of the protected areas network; (ii)
increasing pressure from other sectors (commercial agriculture and mining) on forest
resources; and (iii) the absence of coordination between line ministries (MINFOF, the
MINEPAT, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, and the Ministry of


10
  After the initial formula was very beneficial for forested communities, it was revised to be more evenly
shared across Cameroon, thereby diminishing benefits for communities


                                                     25
Industry, Mines, and Technology Development [MINIMIDT]) to agree on land-allocation
measures and use. The risks of allowing mining activities in the permanent forest estate
are particularly significant given that the MINIMIDT grants operating permits to mining
companies without consulting with the forest and environment ministries. Furthermore,
the allowance of mining activities in the final concession agreement appears to be a
highly significant risk for the sustained management of forest resources and protected
areas. There are already many examples where mining exploration permits have been
issued that overlap with Protected Areas and Forest Concessions.

61.     The social risk to the development outcome is low. The FEDPG played a major
role in altering the forest taxation system (RFA) to transfer revenues to local governing
bodies for development initiatives. There is a low probability that the Government will
overturn social reforms begun under the SAC III and reinforced under the present DPO
that have boosted local development.

62.     Government ownership and political risks to the development outcome are
significant. Government ownership, which seemed strong during preparation, declined
during project implementation period, mainly due to shifting national priorities from
forestry to mining and industrial agriculture, the root cause of the nonsignature of the
final concession agreements. But the risk to the development outcomes may be
considered moderate, since the Government signed the Voluntary Partnership Agreement
(VPA) with the EU under the auspices of the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance, and
Trade (FLEGT) initiative in 2010. As previously noted, significant political risk to
development outcomes, however, resides in the lack of interministerial coordination and
vision on land use. In this regard, the FEDPG missed the opportunity to establish, under
the leadership of the MINEPAT, institutional mechanisms to strengthen collaboration
between ministries.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank performance with respect to quality at entry (that is, performance through the
lending phase)

Rating: Unsatisfactory

Quality at entry

63.     Background analysis. The DPO background analysis was generally adequate. The
background analysis reviewed the Bank support to the Cameroon forest sector which
started in 1978 supporting small-scale industrial plantations and erosion control and later
in 1982, a $17 million forest project was approved. Owing to poor implementation, this
project closed in 1990 with cancellation of $12 million. As indicated in the Program
Document (page 12), the background analysis highlighted lessons learned from this
failure as well as results of the policy dialogue (199097) between the Bank and the


                                            26
Government to enhance the country policy framework. The Program Document also
identifies (page 13, para. 51) a series of analytical studies that were undertaken during
preparation, further substantiating the adequacy of the background analysis at entry.

64.     Lessons reflected in project design. The project design benefitted from the
following lessons (Program Document, page 12): the 2002 evaluation of overall World
Bank involvement in the forest sector in Cameroon (OED, ISBN 0-7658-0940-0); (ii) the
2003 evaluation of quality at supervision by the Bank’s Quality Assessment Group (QAG
SAC III, Review of Quality of Supervision Report); and (iii) the evaluation of the GEF-
supported Cameroon Biodiversity Conservation Program. Specific lessons that informed
the project design through these reports are presented in the box below drawn from the
Program Document, one of which being that results-based instrument tends to be more
effective than traditional lending instruments:

(i) To ensure success of reforms and reform implementation efforts, development partners should work not
only with the executive branch of the Government, but with a broader range of partners including the
legislature, the public at large, NGOs, and community development partners; (ii)
Getting the correct framework and high-level Government buy-in are more important than physical
investments. Through the forest component of SAC III, the Bank realized that, unless healthy institutions
are created and distortions eliminated, results on the ground cannot be achieved; (iii) Forest sector reforms
require a clear understanding of issues and options by all stakeholders. Clarity of expected outcomes, a
focus on fundamental objectives, and flexibility to adapt to changing situations are important factors for the
success of forest sector reforms and operations; (iv) Creating a strongly appropriate regulatory,
institutional, legal, and incentive framework is critical for achieving desired goals. Establishing an effective
and legitimate rule of law provides a balance between positive incentives that reward compliance to the
law, and the deterrent value of penalties for breaking the law; (v) In the context of Cameroon’s forest
sector, a results-based instrument such as sectoral structural adjustment tends to be far more effective and
feasible than other types of lending instruments; (vi) Biodiversity values should be given more prominence
in land use planning. Individual area-based project interventions can be very complex to manage and are
less likely to have an enduring impact than broad landscape-based national programs

65.    The project design also took into account the lessons from the July 2000
Cameroon country case study entitled ―Forest Sector Development in a Difficult Political
Economy‖ undertaken by the Operations Evaluation Department, World Bank (OED).
The project team, fully knowledgeable of the forest sector issues in Cameroon, also
provided inputs11 to this study.

Assessment of project design. The project design was informed by all the above cited
lessons, as reflected in the policy areas covered by the DPO. Furthermore, the DPO was
crafted based on extensive internal and external consultations to ensure buy-in at all
levels, especially by the Government and forest sector stakeholders. ―The design was
embraced by all donors, cited as innovative by the Board, and referred to as best practice



11
  Quote from page xi of the July 2000 Cameroon country case study entitled ―Forest Sector Development
in a Difficult Political Economy‖ by OED ―Mr. Giuseppe Topa of the Africa Region of the World Bank
offered excellent cooperation in sharing with the authors all relevant information at his disposal and his
insights into the forest sector in Cameroon. He also provided very useful comments on the first draft of the
report.‖


                                                      27
and used in training sessions on DPOs, SWAPs, and Safeguards.‖12 But the design which
included both aspects of DPOs and SILs turned out to be complex for the monitoring of
both SIL-related activities and results indicators typical to DPOs. The addition of SIL
features to this DPO instrument could be attributed to the fact that the operation was
initially prepared as a SIL and later changed to a DPO. But the PD still included aspects
of SILs and DPOs, although in the Legal Agreements it was identified as a DPO
instrument. Another major shortcoming of the design was the rejection of the Bank-
financed capacity building operation owing to IDA resource constraints at the time of
preparation, which affected the delivery of much-needed technical assistance to the
government on many aspects of the DPO. The Bank has since noted this failure, and the
new generation of DPOs include a technical assistance line, if judged necessary.

66.    It should be noted that this was the first DPO of the Bank in Africa; therefore, the
team could not draw lessons on past experiences in the region to further inform the
design of the operation. In hindsight and based on the clarity that now exists on what a
DPO is as an instrument, we would rate quality at entry unsatisfactory mainly due to the
mix of instruments in the project appraisal document and the rejection of the capacity
building operation to accompany the DPO.

67.     Lending instrument. At the outset of design (concept review meeting), the Bank
management requested that ―project preparation should address head-on the challenges
that have prevented success for most traditional investment operations in Cameroon.‖ It
recommended reviewing options such as sectoral adjustment lending with tranches
released as results are achieved, or sector lending supported by a public expenditure
review.‖13 Based on this recommendation, the project team engaged in a series of internal
consultations with OPCS, AFTQK, LEGAL, and LOAAF, as well as external
consultations with the key players of Government authorities (ministries of finance,
forestry, and environment), other donors, and NGOs. The following design was
submitted for management approval: (i) budget support to the forest sector; and (ii) a
capacity-building credit to accompany the budget support. After further in-depth
consultations on the proposal with all stakeholders involved in the forest sector in
Cameroon, and two ROC meetings (September 9, 2003, and May 4, 2004), the first
option was adopted as the best suited lending instrument. The capacity-building
component would be supported as a parallel financing by bilateral partners (United
Kingdom, Germany, France, and Canada, known as ―Basket Fund‖) in line with the Paris
Declaration and aid effectiveness. This approach was similar to approaches previously
undertaken in other Bank regions, particularly Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC),
by combining a policy-based loan with a parallel technical assistance project, although in
most cases, the parallel technical-assistance operations were Bank-financed and managed
in tandem with the associated DPOs rather than being administered by other donors.

68.      Assessment of risks and their mitigation. Risks related to financial sustainability
were adequately identified and mitigation measures put in place. The fiduciary risk being
significant at the time, a comprehensive fiduciary risk assessment of the FEDPG was
carried out by the Bank, and mitigation measures were adequately implemented. But the
political risks related to the signing by the UFA of final concessions to forest companies
were inadequately assessed, given that the issue of overabundant wood-processing units
was already known at the project preparation stage. This should have been identified as a
risk at preparation.

(b) Quality of supervision (including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

69.    The Bank team made significant efforts to resolve the UFA trigger impasse. Bank
management and senior management deserve credit for their involvement in conducting
policy dialogue at the highest political level. The Bank task team should also be
recognized for its efforts to explore options to resolve the issue, even if their suggestions
were not feasible, for the reasons explained earlier. In the end, the Bank as a whole acted
in good faith to ensure a satisfactory outcome of the operation, which should be highly
commended.

70.     Implementation support and supervision missions in accordance with the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness proved challenging for the Bank. A single, annual joint
donor supervision mission had been agreed upon in the code of conduct, implying joint
annual aide-memoires that would provide a broad assessment of the FESP. But the Bank
also was obliged to monitor and evaluate its specific interventions and to present them in
aide-memoire formats consistent with Bank rules and procedures. Therefore, in addition
to leading the joint donor supervisions (including the general forestry sector, Basket Fund
supervision, and donor coordination), and producing joint aide-memoires, the Bank had
to comply with its own institutional requirements by developing additional aide-
memoires specific to the DPO. This resulted in the transmittal to the Government of two
different aide-memoires for the same mission, creating tension between a ―unified partner
approach‖ and the Bank’s own requirements. Communication issues surfaced, alongside
conflicted opinions, and the Government received mixed signals from the donors. The
Government and the donors supporting the forestry sector through the Basket Fund also
had a problem understanding Bank requirements. Confirmation of understanding should
have been obtained by the Bank up front and, if possible, included in the code of conduct.

71.     The quality of Bank supervision was also hindered by the high turnover of task
team leaders (TTLs), some of whom were new to the Bank. Continued involvement of a
single experienced TTL was secured from preparation until May 2009, when he moved to
another region of the Bank. From that period to project closure, TTLs changed regularly.
The program had four successive TTLs between May 2009 until the project closed on
October 11, 2011, and all of them had recently joined the Bank.14


14
     It should be noted that one of the four TTLs undertook this role only for a few weeks. As a matter of fact,


                                                        29
72.   Based on the above discussion, the rating of the Bank at supervision is
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of rating for overall Bank performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)

73.    Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Adequate
background analysis was performed at entry; lessons learnt were incorporated in the
design; in-depth consultations were conducted to ensure sound design in the absence of
previous experience to build upon, as this was the very first DPO in Africa,. However,
the presence of aspects of SIL and DPO in the Program Document, the rejection of the
Bank-financed capacity building component to support the DPO implementation, high
turnover of TTLs and the sending of mixed signals to the client about the UFA trigger
should have been avoided. These shortcomings led to the MU rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)

74.     The Government deserves credit for taking all 18 prior actions required by the
Bank to release the first tranche of the IDA and GEF grants. But the nonachievement of
the UFA trigger that ultimately led to the failure of the DPO was clearly due to the
changing priorities of the Government, as indicated in section 2.2. Although
noncompliance with the 1994 Forest Law was given as the formal 15 reason for not
signing the final concession agreements, this issue could have been resolved by means of
the presidential ordinance discussed earlier.

75.     Furthermore, support to the FEDPG program from other high-level ministries was
uneven. It took some time for the Ministry of Finance to implement the changes required
by the new budget-support approach, resulting in significant delays in delivering Bank
support. While preserving an excellent relationship with the Bank as the Government
interface with the international donor community, the MINEPAT did not play its
essential role in stimulating interministerial coordination, which was much needed by the
MINFOF and MINEP to implement the FEDPG program.




it turned out that the TTL, who was on secondment from DFID, was paid by the trust fund he would be
managing, as DFID was a donor participating in the budget support to the forestry sector. There was
therefore a conflict of interest, and the TTL had to be removed, but he continued to be a team member.
15
   The fact that 33 UFAs had timber-processing units inside the concession, but that only 20 final
concession contracts were signed, clearly shows that the alleged legal problems caused by the location of
the processing unit, though important, were not the only problem.


                                                   30
76.    Overall Government performance is therefore rated Moderately Unsatisfactory
because of its failure to communicate clearly and much earlier to the Bank that, owing to
changing priorities, it would not take action to ensure completion of the UFA trigger.

(b) Performance of implementing agency or agencies

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)

77.    The performance of the MINEP was satisfactory, since all outcomes of
component one for which the ministry was responsible for implementing, have all been
achieved. The MINEP also performed well in implementing milestones and meeting the
second tranche release conditions related to environmental regulation and information
management and ensured the implementation of the FEDPG Environmental Impact
Mitigation Plan.

78.     Conversely, the performance of the MINFOF was unsatisfactory. The MINFOF,
responsible for implementing components 2–5, can be praised for its efforts to deliver on
protection from illegal logging and for notable results in the management of wildlife and
protected areas. But the inefficient processing of some of the concession dossiers by the
MINFOF (including losing key documents, such as environmental assessments and even
originals of the gazetting decrees ―decrets de classement‖) contributed to the UFA trigger
deadlock. Furthermore, the MINFOF did not perform so well in terms of improving
community forest management, supporting the wood-processing industry, and promoting
nonwood forest products, thus affecting the social dimension of the FEDPG. The
MINFOF developed a good dialogue with the NGO community during FESP preparation,
but it was unable to develop the mechanisms to fund NGO involvement in FESP
implementation. Similarly, the MINFOF had a continued dialogue with the private sector
but had a hard time converting that dialogue into productive support to the forest industry.
Overall, the MINFOF had leadership problems throughout the implementation of the
FEDPG program.

(c) Justification of rating for overall borrower performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)

79.    On balance, based on the performance rating of Government (MU) and the
implementing agencies (MU) overall borrower performance is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

80.      Financing instrument. The most important lesson from this DPO is the need to
avoid mixing DPO and SIL content in a single operation. The principal objective of
DPOs is to rapidly disburse large sums of foreign exchange against agreed policy and
institutional reforms which are under control of the executive branch of the government
(that is, establishing a condition that is bound to require revision of laws that need to pass


                                              31
through the legislature, for example, should normally be avoided). In addition many of
the actual activities to be supported by this operation were more appropriate for a SIL.
More specifically, the fiduciary arrangements (such as the request for traceability audits)
were not adapted to a DPO, given the ―fungibility‖ of the funds. The very high risk
related to ownership at the highest level and governance seems to have proved to be the
main reasons for the project’s unsatisfactory performance. There appears to have been a
―leap of faith‖ that taking a DPO approach would provide sufficient incentive to the
Government to overcome these risks, but, in practice, this did not work and the project
failed both as a DPO (that is, the majority of the funds were not disbursed) and as a SIL
(many of the targets were not or only partially achieved).

81.     Twinning a DPO with a technical assistance (TA) support project funded by other
donors. Innovations, such as the multidonor basket-fund instrument used to support DPO
implementation, should be well coordinated. Though potentially relevant for improving
aid coordination and country ownership, and in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness, the instrument was, however, overambitious in terms of being able to
achieve results in the expected time frame, given the time needed to build political
commitment and technical capacity among stakeholders. The ―TA Basket Fund‖
instrument, twinned to the DPO and funded by other donors, was expected to facilitate
the implementation of the FEDPG. Although creative, the system failed to respond to the
capacity-building needs during the first years of implementation due to coordination
issues, TA needs being partially reported to the Basket Fund committee, and overall some
governance issues internal to Basket Fund management. As a result, activities funded by
the Basket Fund ended up being disarticulated from those of the sector budget support.

82.     Combining a policy-based operation with a parallel technical assistance credit,
both supported by the Bank. Given that the Basket Fund did not yield the expected results
as indicated above, in the future, the LAC, Ghana, and Mozambique models should be
considered—that is, DPOs should be developed in tandem with a TA operation, with both
being financed by the Bank to give the Bank more leverage in the use of both instruments.
As a matter of fact, this was the initial proposal of the task team, which, unfortunately
was not pursued because of IDA resource constraints at the time of preparation. Had it
been approved, the operation might have worked differently.

83.     GEF contribution to the DPO. For the first time, OP 9.01 was waived to enable
GEF funds to be fully blended with IDA financing to support a DPO based on the same
modalities and matrix of conditions and triggers. On one hand, this pilot was partially
successful in the sense that all GEF-related indicators were achieved. On the other hand,
due to the impasse related to the UFA trigger, the GEF grant resources could not be
disbursed and ended up being returned to the Trust Fund general pool, which represents a
loss for Cameroon. If the GEF funds had been used differently, through a parallel SIL for
example, they could have been used to continue to support biodiversity-related activities
in the country.

84.      Monitoring and evaluation. Overall project objectives (PDOs/GEOs) have to be
realistic, specific, and monitorable through clearly defined performance indicators, and


                                            32
achievable. This was not the case in this project, for which PDOs/GEOs were general and
ambitious with no clearly associated indicators, and this issue should have been
anticipated from the very start, either during appraisal or during the first stages of
supervision. Furthermore, the M&E system for the FEDPG (with a large number of
detailed output indicators that are normally required in SILs) should have been limited to
conditions for tranche release and outcomes specific to a DPO. It should also have been
clearly incorporated in the overall FESP ―CIDA‖ M&E system under a FEDPG-specific
section.

85.    Institutional. The evolving institutional environment of the FEDPG (split of the
Ministry of Environment and Forests into the MINFOF and MINEP; weak
interministerial cooperation overall) was likely to result in either conflicts or inertia.
Strong leadership for the overall coordination of policy and institutional commitments
associated with DPOs that involve several line ministries is of critical importance. The
chairmanship of the Facilitation Committee was not at the appropriate level of authority,
and the FEDPG consequently encountered decision-making problems. The Facilitation
Committee would have been more efficient and effective if chaired at the Prime
Minister’s level to address issues beyond the control of sectoral ministries. Furthermore,
coordination between the budget-support activities and those of the ―TA Basket Fund‖
would have benefited from an overarching governance authority.

86.     System to cope with Government staff turnover. Several key personnel involved in
the preparation of the DPO were reassigned during implementation. A system ensuring
swift training as well as motivation of incoming staff should be embedded in project
design to avoid institutional memory loss and to facilitate ownership and continuity of
skills.

87.     Continuity of Bank staff. High turnover of TTLs is detrimental to the success of
any program or project. It was especially so for a DPO that was being tested for the first
time in Africa. Frequent TTL changes increases the chances that recommendations will
not be followed from one aide-memoire to the other, leading to institutional memory
losses.

88.     Bank internal communication. Bank management and task teams should ensure
that actions and recommendations in aide-memoires do not contradict with policy
dialogue conducted by management and senior management. Coherence of message is
key to maintaining the Bank’s credibility with the client and maximizing the chance that
the policy dialogue will produce a positive outcome. This has important implications for
Bank participation in joint donor supervision missions of sectorwide programs, where the
Bank does not have sole control over the content of aide-memoires.

89.     Management of relationship with partners in line with the Paris Declaration. The
Bank’s role as the chef de file for partners in the forestry sector led to tension between a
―unified partner approach‖ and the Bank’s own requirements. This could have been
avoided through better management of relationships and communications with donor
partners and the client to build mutual trust and ensure adherence to joint agreements—in


                                             33
this case, the code of conduct. The Bank should have made clear to the Government
during preparation the Government’s obligation to meet the requirements of legal
agreements with the Bank, even if these did not bind other donors providing support to
the same program, as in this case the Basket Fund. That understanding should perhaps
have been included in the code of conduct to avoid tension among partners and with the
Government.

90.     Strong partnership between the World Bank and bilateral donors. An important
lesson from the project is the importance of partnerships, especially when working in a
difficult sector such as forestry. The Basket Fund, despite its challenges, actually ensured
that, for the most part, actors spoke with one voice and acted in a coordinated manner.
The strong relationship with DFID was an added bonus. When DFID closed its office in
Yaoundé, it committed resources to a Trust Fund executed by the World Bank to second
a staff member to the World Bank country office to jointly supervise investments made
by DFID and the World Bank in the FESP, thereby enabling the two institutions to
leverage resources from one another.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

91.     The borrower and other donors involved in the FESP (that is, Canada, France,
Germany, and the United Kingdom) agree that the Bank deserves credit for the relevance
and efficiency of the reforms in the forestry sector, which were launched under SAC III
and which the FEDPG was intended to consolidate and scale up. They acknowledge the
clear linkages between Bank support to the forestry sector and other Bank operations in
Cameroon, as well as the coherence of the Forest and Environment Development Policy
Grant (FEDPG) with the FY04–06 CAS, the poverty objectives of the PRSP, and the
sectoral objectives of the HIPC process. They are also appreciative and grateful for the
Bank’s clear leadership in supporting the FESP and mobilizing significant co-funding
from other donors. But the Bank’s withdrawal, as a leader of the FESP donors, has
created substantial disappointment in Cameroon that could weaken future collaboration
with partners involved in the forestry sector.

Annex 2. Beneficiary/Stakeholders Survey Results

Consultations were conducted the following program beneficiaries/stakeholders: (i) civil
society organizations (13 NGOs/Consultation Group partners of the Ministry of Forests
and Wildlife (MINFOF) and of the Ministry of Environment and Nature Protection
(MINEF) : (i) Cercle de Concertation de la Société Civile Partenaire du MINFOF et du
MINEP (CCSPM) ; (ii) community forest representatives; (iii) private sector
representatives/Cameroon Timber Industry Group (GFBC); and (iv) private sector
representatives/Growers Industrial Transformers and Special Products Exporters Union
(SETIEPS).

Below are the outcomes of these consultations:

According to civil society organizations (CSOs):
       National CSOs participated in the FESP planning and development process
        between 2002 and 2004. But they were very little or not involved in the FESP
        monitoring and evaluation. Indeed, they have never been involved in the
        development of annual work plans of FESP in its operational phase from 2006 to
        2011.
       The involvement of some national CSOs in the implementation of FESP came
        down to mere participation in meetings of general information with no influence
        on the decision making, and to small and very few contracts for individual
        consultants to act just as moderators (no organizers) of workshops or small ad hoc
        studies;
       The activities of national CSOs, even when not benefitting from the program
        funding mechanisms, have converged to the objectives of FESP, to the extent that
        FESP reflects and reinforces the Cameroonian vision of sectoral development and
        the political, strategic and operational planning of the interventions of all the
        stakeholders in the forestry and environment sector;
       The need to identify ways to remove all obstacles to the participation of national
        CSOs in every decision-making step in the process of implementing future
        programs (planning, setting up annual work plans, implementation, monitoring
        and evaluation) led by the Government.
With regard to communities owning communal forests, it appears that the community
and collaborative management of forest resources benefited from two important tools,
that is:
       The February 2009 manual of management and procurement procedures of
        community forests, which greatly improved access to the timber resources, thanks
        to the signing of an interim management agreement allowing the opening, under
        authorization of the forestry administration, of access tracks and track service
        roads for the removal of lumber by agricultural tractors or any other low-power
        device.




                                            36
      The adoption by the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization
       (MINATD), Ministry of Economy and Finance (MINFI), and MINFOF of a new
       joint order (n° 0520 MINATD / MINFI / MINFOF of 3 June 2010) laying down
       detailed rules for the use and the monitoring of management of revenues from the
       exploitation of forest and wildlife resources for municipalities and adjacent
       village communities.
      The communities experienced some difficulties in obtaining the documents
       required for forest exploitation, due to the centralization of decisions on forest
       exploitation at the ministry responsible for forests. The presence of NGO support
       is often important to find effective solutions to community problems.
According to the Cameroon Timber Industry Group (GFBC)
      Significant progress has been made in terms of forest management, forest
       certification, forest monitoring (National Monitoring Brigade and Independent
       Observer), and SIGIF management of exploitation of data. The GFBC believes
       that the requirements of the international timber market provide the most
       important boost to forest certification in Cameroon, but it is also important to
       recognize that the institutional, legal, and normative framework supervised by the
       FESP has been an efficient environment for obtaining forest certification by
       companies.
Growers Industrial Transformers and Special Products Exporters Union (SETIEPS)
      For the SETIEPS, the greatest advance has been the consideration of special
       products particularities by tax authorities, but more efforts are needed, including
       access to resources through the acquisition of a license that is difficult to obtain.

Annex 3. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

This summary was prepared by the Government on the basis of its ICR.

Relevance
The Government recognized the relevance of the program objective, which addressed the
challenges of the forest and environment sector. Those challenges stem from disconnects
between the political, legislative, and regulatory frameworks necessary to ensure
sustainable management of natural resources and control of the ongoing degradation of
those resources.

The task was to deal with the institutional, technical, and programmatic deficiencies
identified during the diagnostic assessment of the forest sector carried out in 2002.
Because the program was not able to harmonize the various civil society interventions
(by NGOs, in this case), there were frequent duplications in the implementation of certain
activities on the ground, even though one of the goals of the program had been to
coordinate actions in the forest and environment sector.

Results

Borrower asserts having achieved a large number of results. Borrower describes all of the
results achieved in each of the [program] components, emphasizing the activities that did
not yield clear positive results. Borrower claims credit for having implemented the entire
program independently of the World Bank financing tranches tied to the triggers for the
second and third tranches.

Assessment of World Bank performance

In terms of monitoring and evaluation, Borrower criticized the role of the World Bank,
notably the organization of several specific missions organized unilaterally by the World
Bank and certain partners, whereas the principle agreed on at the outset was one of joint,
multipartner missions. Borrower also believes that the inflexible stance of the World
Bank with regard to the achievement or nonachievement of certain triggers was contrary
to the principles of the program approach.

Lessons learned

1. Institutional organization and management
    • Triggers. Financing triggers are necessary to guarantee the achievement of results,
         but assessments of those triggers must be flexible so that financing for an entire
         project is not blocked because a single trigger is not reached.
    • Budget-support mechanism. The implementation of a new financing mechanism
         requires a substantial program of capacity building to strengthen the capacity of
         all ministries involved (finance, economy, planning, as well as relevant sectoral
         ministries).
         Until the new financing mechanism is completely operational, it is important to


                                            38
       provide a back-up financing system to permit access to funds and avoid long
       delays in the initiation of project activities.
   •   Program approach: The change from programming based on institutional
       structures to results-based planning and budgeting constitutes a major
       reorientation of the culture of public agencies. That reorientation requires long-
       term training and assistance for responsible officials from advisers possessing the
       necessary expertise.
   •   Program coordination: A sectoral program such as the FESP requires strong
       leadership to coordinate and advance action through Government involvement in
       carrying out reforms and ensuring that managers are committed to their activities.
   •   Interministerial programs: To implement a program involving several ministries,
       it is important that the responsibilities of each ministry and the management rules
       common to all be clearly defined from the outset. Particular attention to such
       management problems by monitoring missions should make it possible to identify
       and resolve the difficulties encountered (achievement of triggers; collaboration
       between forestry, environment, and finance ministries).

2. Program ownership

There is a need to design and put in place a mechanism to promote ownership of the
program among all stakeholders (beneficiary agencies and partners, civil society
organizations, members of parliament, and private entities), particularly at the outset
(launch workshop) and on the occasion of staff changes.

Annex 4. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

According to the Basket Fund Cofinanciers:

      The mission of the Basket Fund was not well understood at the start of the
       program. The Basket Fund was managed as if it were a project rather than a tool
       to support the implementation of the FESP.
      Budget support was very difficult for the Government of Cameroon because the
       institutional environment was not prepared to handle the program budget.
      The performance of FESP’s management units did not meet expectations.
      The drafting of joint Aide-Mémoires sometimes caused conflict between the
       World Bank and the other partners.
      Most of the joint missions were based on monitoring the attainment of triggers. In
       2010 the focus of monitoring shifted to the program as a whole.

The FESP’s financial and technical partners invited the World Bank to continue to
support the program approach by reviewing the level of flexibility pertaining to triggers.

The program’s other financiers recognized that the Canadian aid agency strongly
supported the processes of operational planning and monitoring and evaluation. Because
budget support was intended essentially for investments, the Basket Fund mechanism
played an important role in financing training, technical assistance, and certain planning
studies.
