performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            several key personnel involved in the preparation of the\n            Development Program Operation (DPO) were reassigned during\n            implementation. A system ensuring swift training as well as\n            motivation of incoming staff should be embedded in project\n            design to avoid institutional memory loss and to facilitate\n            ownership and continuity of skills. Bank management and task\n            teams should ensure that actions and recommendations in\n            aide-memoires do not contradict with policy dialogue\n            conducted by management and senior management. The message\n            is a key to maintain the Bank's credibility with the\n            client and maximizing the chance that the policy dialogue\n            will produce positive outcome. This has important\n            implications for Bank participation in joint donor\n            supervision missions of sector wide programs, where the Bank\n            does not have sole control over the content of aide-memoires."}, "docdt": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
