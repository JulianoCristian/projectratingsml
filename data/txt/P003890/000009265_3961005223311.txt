MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO rHE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR
THE SEMARANG - SURAKARTA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of
Indonesia for US$174.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for
20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help finance
the Semarang - Surakarta Urban Development Project (SSUDP). Part of the proceeds (US$66.5 million
equivalent) would be onlent by the Government of Indonesia (GOI) to the municipalities of Semarang
and Surakarta and the water enterprises (PDAMs) in the two cities, for a period of 20 years at an annual
interest rates of 11.5% which reflects the 6 month average of the 3-month Sertifikat Bank of Indonesia
rate at the time of project appraisal. The government will bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.     Background. Indonesia's urban population exceeds 55 million and is growing at over 5 % per
year, more than twice the overall national rate. About 80 million Indonesians (about 40% of the
population) will be city dwellers by the year 2000. Due to a centralized and fragmented decision-making
system, coordination of urban sector development has been poor. To address this problem, all key
agencies with responsibilities in the urban sector are represented in GOI's Interagency Coordinating
Team for Urban Development (TKPP) chaired by BAPPENAS, the National Development Planning
Agency. BAPPENAS is responsible for overall planning and the allocation of resources, based on
Five-Year Development Plans (Repelita) and Annual National Development Budgets (APBN). The
Ministries of Home Affairs and Public Works are respectively responsible for overseeing regional
governments and most infrastructure investments through provincial offices, which also execute
centrally-financed infrastructure projects.
3.    Infrastructure services lag behind. Only about 20-25 % of the urban population have direct
access to piped water supply with the balance relying on standpipes, shallow wells, vendors and surface
water. Less than 60% of the urban households have proper toilet facilities (39% with septic tanks), the
balance share toilets or use waterways for sanitation. In the larger cities, inadequate residential and
industrial water supply, and liquid and solid waste disposal cause serious environmental and health
problems. The urban poor, who constitute 17% of the urban population, are the more affected by the
deficiencies in basic services and degraded environmental conditions. To meet GOI's equity objectives,
more investnent is aieeded in low-cost systems for poorly served urban areas. Despite past progress in
the provision of urban roads, some 60% of urban households still rely on access roads less than three
meters wide, and in 1990 some 25 % of municipal roads were in poor condition. Vehicle emissions are
increasingly being recognized as the dominant source of localized air pollution and health problems in
cities. Moreover, there is limited traffic management in central areas, and public transport is insufficient
in many cities in Indonesia.
4.     The central government has a dominant role in financing local services through its grants.
Grants help resolve the disparity between local needs and local resource mobilization, which is
constrained by the limited ability to levy and collect taxes. Over the medium to longer term, GOI also
inends to increase resource mobilization at the local level; this will include more local borrowing at



-2 -
market rates. GOI's strategy is to decentralize decision-making on urban sector matters. In this cotitext,
it relies on Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Programming (IUIDP) for improving local
government management, infrastructure investment, revenue mobilization and consultation between
various levels of government. Repelita VI, for the period 1994-98, builds on the IUIDP for achieving
urban infrastructure and services improvements.
5.     Seriarang, the capital of the Central Java province and the fifth largest city in Indonesia, is
located on the north coast of Java, about 500 km east of Jakarta. Semarang's population has been
growing at about 2% per annum and is expected to reach 1.5 million by the year 2,000. Less than 40%
of the population has access to piped water supply, with the rest relying on wells and other sources.
There is no sanitary sewer system and existing open storm water drains are also used to collect santary
flows. Over 45 % of the population does not even have septic tanks. Frequent flooding occurs in the
northern and eastern iow-lying parts of the city. The existing solid waste collection system does not
cover all areas and over 40% of the solid waste is disposed of by dumping in vacant plots, canals and
rivers. With the closure of three dump sites, currently only one solid waste disposal site is operational.
Semarang's road system suffers from lack of capacity for east-west throuigh traffic, inadequate
arterial/primary collector roads, and the lack of a proper road network in the east and southeast of the
city where much of the urban development is expected to take place. Poor traffic conditions affect bus
and minibus routes, and facilities for public transport parking and pedestrians are lacking in the central
busir;ess district.
6.     Surakarta (also called Solo) located in the interior less than 100 km southeast of Semarang, is the
second largest city in central Java, with a current population of about 500,000. It was the original center
of Javanese culture and remains a major national center for performing arts and batik manufacture. With
piped water supplies being limited, over 60% of the population relies entirely on shallow wells, surface
water courses and vendors for water supply. While two separate sewerage systems are in existence, the
larger one is only partially operational due to lack of maintenance and the smaller one serves only
18,000 people. Although 80% of the population has private toilets, only 65% has septic tanks. Solid
wastes are collected from over 80% of the population; however, waste treatment facilities are inadequate
and water courses are contaminated. The transport system in Surakarta is characterized by conflicts
between motorized and non-motorized traffic, delays due to level railway crossings and a low railway
bridge on the main east-west route, and lack of parking in the central business district.
7.     Lessons from Previous Bank Experience. The Bank's experience with 11 completed and 7
ongoing urban and water supply projects has elicited the following lessons in particular: (a) limited
planning and implementation capacity at the central level and the nature of local services reduces the
efficiency of mass delivery programs; (b) capacity building at the local level is a long-term process that
needs to be accompanied by an increase in local responsibility and accountability; (c) central-local
financial relations need to provide more local government autonomy; and (d) private sector involvement
needs to be enhanced. The project design incorporates these lessons.
8.     Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Indonesia, which
was discuFsed by the Board of Directors on April 12, 1994, highlights the need for improving public
services delivery, especially to the poor, greater decentralization of responsibilities, and improved
environmental management. The project is fully consistent with this Country Assistance Strategy,
because it supports increasing decentralization of responsibilities for urban management and



-3-
implementation to the municipal govermnents of Semarang and Surakarta; it integrates environmental
improvement actions into urban infrastructure development; it strengthens local government institutions
and human resources for more efficient urban management, and it provides services to lower income
groups and underserved areas.
9.    Pro,ect Description. To achieve these objectives, the project would finance:
(a) Urban roads - arterial, collector and local roads, bridge and footpath construction, improved
traffic management, and technical assistance (30% of base cost);
(b) Water supply - source supply enhancements, improvements to transmission, storag- and
distribution systems, reduction in unaccounted for water, new house connections and stand
pipes, and tecblical assistance (32%);
(c) Drainage - channel rehabilitation, widening and deepening, removal of bottlenecks (such as
undersized culverts and bridges) and some new construction in areas which are subject to
f'requent flooding (17%);
(d) Sanitation and Sewerage - off-site sanitation programs, including rehabilitation of the existing
sewerage systems in Surakarta, construction of trunk and interceptor sewers, waste water
treatment plants and pumping stations, construction of communal toilets, credit schemes for
the construction of private toilets and septic tanks, and procurement of equipment (11 %);
(e) Solid waste - procurement of collection equipmernt and upgrading disposal sites (4%);
(f) Kampung Improvement and Market Infrastructure Improvement Program (KIP and MIP) -
improvement of kampungs (urban neighborhoods), benefting about 200,000 people in
Semarang and about 34,000 people in Surakarta, as well as rehabilitation and improvement
of high priority markets (3%);
(g) Basic housing rehabilitation program for low income communities in one pilot area in each
city (2.5%);
(h) Conservation of historical dstricts and buildings through pilot physical improvement projects
(0.5%); and
(h) Technical assistance for implementation support and capacity building (about 8.5% of total
project costs). This covers contract engineering services, program
management/implementation (in support of greater local responsibility and autonomy), sector
development and implementation related studies.
10.   Project costs and financing plan. Schedule A provides details on project cost and financing.
Retroactive fmancing of US$5 million has been proposed for eligible project expenditures incurred after
November 1, 1993 for consultants' services, goods and civil works in order to make an early start on the
implementation of the program. Schedule B sets out the amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement. Schedule C summarizes key project processing events, and the status of Bank Group



- 4 -
operations in Indonesia is given in Schedule D. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
12656-IND, dated May 9, 1994, is being distributed separately.
11.   Project Implementation. The principal implemr-ting agencies are the Cities of Semarang and
Surakarta atid their water enterprises. A Project Management Unit and a Project Monitoring Office in
each city will coordinate all project activities city-wide; the Directorate General of Human Settlements,
Ministry of Public Works, will be responsible for central technical supervision and overall management
of SSUDP. Policy and general program coordination will be provided by GOI's Urban Development
Coordination Team (TKPI).
12.   Project Sustainabilitv.  'he project design and implementation arrangements draw upon the
lessons of experience: greater delegation of responsibilities to the local governments; ownership through
financial contributions from the municipalities and the water enterprises; and more participation by the
project beneficiaries. These actions are expected to contribute to project sustainability.
13.   Environmental and Social Impact. Most project activities would have a positive environmental
impact. Water qualty and quatty and sanitation would improve. Pollution would be reduced in the
rivers in both cities. Consultation with affected people will ensure that the compensation and
resettlement arrangements will provide displaced families with living standards comparable at least to
those in their previous locations. The relocation arrangements for about 800 affected households would
be monitored through project technical assistance. The project is an "A" category project from the
environmental assessment point of view and an Executive Summary of the EA was distribited to the
Executive Directors on October 14, 1993.
14.   Impact on Poverty. The project is expected to improve significantly the qualiy of life and
environment in the poorer Kampung areas of the city. In particular, the water supply, drainage and
flood control, sewerage, solid waste, KIP and MDP, and low cost housing components have significant
elements that will directly benefit the urban poor.
15.   Agreed Actions. At negotiations GOI agreed to the following:
(a) central govermnent grant fumds would be disbursed at the provincial treasury office and
can be used for implementation support managed at the local level;
(b)  Semarang and Surakarta would increase roads and drains O&M funding provision to 100%
of the required levels by FY1997/98;
(c) cost recovery for water supply, sanitation and solid waste management services would be
realized through appropriate tariffs and charges which would be reviewed at two year
intervals;
(d) the central government would make the neczssary fiancing available for the completion of
the Kudu conveyance channel;
(e)  PDAM would submit audits within six months, will insdtute water loss control programs,
and introduce insllment programs for house connection for low income fmilies;



-5 -
(f) GOI will implement the environmental management and monitoring plans, and the
Semarang resettlement plan as agreed with the Bank; and
(g) GOI will carry out annual technical audits and furnish the audit recommendations to the
Bank.
16.   The following will be conditions for effectiveness:
(a) execution of the subsidiary loan agreements between the central government and the
municipalities of Semarang and Surakarta and their water enterprises respectively; and
(b) final approval of Project Implementation Agreement by the three levels of government.
17.   Project Benefits and Risks. The project would benefit the ink.abitants of Semarang and Surakarta
by improving the quality, reliability and accessibility of urban infrastructure services. Water supply,
drainage, and waste disposal investments would greatly improve the living environment by providing
safe water, reducing property damage, and decreasing pollution and the incidence of diseases. The local
economies would benefit from lower transport costs and travel times. Kampung and market
improvements would help lower income households in particular by betering living conditions and local
commercial facilities. The main project risks are limited planning and management capabilities at the
local level which -may cause implementation delays, poor quality, cost overruns and non-achievement of
financial targets. Possible delays in the availability of GOI funds and late approvals by the central
government are also risks to efficient project execution. Steps taken prior to Negotiations and during
implementation, as well as close monitoring by supervision missions, are expectl to minimize these
risks.
18.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

The report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission which visited Indonesia during
October/November 1993. The mission was led by Mr. H. Unger (EA3IN) and comprised
Messrs./Mmes. E. Dotson, R. Iyer, A. Kim (EA3IN), W. Luscombe (ASTTP), D. Martin, J.
Richardson, and I. Wetherill (consultants); substantial support was provided P. Midgley, M. Nuch
and G. Soraya (EA3RS) from Jakarta. The peer reviewers were Messrs. J. Kozel (EA1IN), J. Hicks
(TWURD), G. Read (EA2EU) and K.S. Lee (TWURD). Mr. A. Khanna (EA3IN), Infrastructure
Division Chief, and Mrs. M. Haug (EA3DR), Country Department Director, have endorsed the
project.
La     Preparation and appraisal of the project were delayed because of uncertainties about the
source of bulk water for the Semarang water supply component, an integral part of the
infrastructure investment program in Semarang supported by dhe project.
