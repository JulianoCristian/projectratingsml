operation and maintenance.  Impacts have been presented in\n            the Preliminary Environmental Assessment (PIL) reports in\n            the form of matrices of impact on the physical, biological\n            and sociological environment against project activities.\n            The SSUDP project is expected to have a positive overall\n            impact on the environment.  It will provide a clean water\n            supply to many families, reduce the non-sanitary disposal of\n            human and solid wastes, decrease flooding and improve the\n            living environment especially in the low income residential\n            areas.  Negative impacts of the project such as noise, dust\n            emission, socio-economic problems and traffic disruption\n            during the construction phase are minor and relatively short\n            term.  No land use changes of significance will result from\n            project implementation.  Land acquisition requirements of\n            the project are relatively small and will not create undue\n            social hardship except for the drainage and the urban roands project."}, "docdt": "1993-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
