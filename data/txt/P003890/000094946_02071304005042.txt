J. Assessment of Development O'bjecive and Design, and of Quailty at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Introduction. The concept of Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Programming (UIDP) was
introduced by the Govemment of Indonesia (GOI) in the mid 1980s to integrate the development of urban
infrastructure investments in urban transport, water supply, sewerage and sanitation, flood control,
drainage. solid waste management and kampung (neighborhood) improvements (known as KIP) under one
package. In the early 1990s, following the RIUIP concept, GOI planned a series of projects designed to
implement urban infrastructure investments in five large cities: Malang (East Java)- Semarang; and
Surakarta (Central Java), Bogor (West Java) and Palembang (South Sumatra). However, due to the large
size and complexity of these cities. a decision was made to snlit investments for them into several lending
packages. The cities of Semarang and Surakarta were thus combined under the Semarang Surakarta Urban
Develonment Proiect (SSUDP)
When the nrmiect was d-eve1oned the citipr of Remarrngn and .nrnk-nrtn CPrntral T2v.a'g tuwn largPet citispc

flonodng oc rcured in the north.er and eat.ern rmoJyin.g parts of the city. Deficien.ciesir "-"-
were also apparent.
In Surakarta, the PDAM supplies of piped water were very limited, causing 61% of the population to rely

through better access to essential services and an improved urban environment.
Assessment of Objectives. The project objectives were clear and realistic especially given Indonesia's
stability at the time of appraisal and Board. Tne projectts objectives were fully consistent with and
important to the Bank Group's 1994 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Indonesia, which highlighted
the need to focus on interregional equity, delivering higher quality services and enhancing competitiveness
in a climate of macroeconomic stability.
The project was rather complex. On one hand, the project was limited to only two medium-sized cities,
located in a single province spatially close to Jakarta. Thus, the geographic scope of the project was
manageable. It was also less complex institutionally, as the decision-making locus was fully decentralized
to the two municipalities. On the other hand, the project was complex in that it covered seven subsectors
and included several large infrastructure components. Nonetheless, the riskiness of the operation was
acceptable.
The project was reasonably demanding for the two municipal governnents given their limited institutional

capacity and the size and level of complexity of certain components, which required strong leadership at
the municipal level. This level of responsibility was appropriate and responded well to GOI's development
priority of promoting stronger and more independent municipal governments.
3.2 Revised Objective:
In 1998, the Loan Agreement was amended to include the execution of small infrastructure works in
addition to the sub-projects already in the program. Tnese small infrastructure works were labor-intensive
works (known as padat karya in Indonesian) and were designed to address the growing unemployment
problem resulting from the economic crisis that began in September 1997 and continued into the late
1990s.
3.3 Original Components:

Assessment of Components. Several large project components (water supply, urban road and drainage)
were reasonably well designed to address objective (a), improving the provision of urban infrastructure
services and the efficiency of urban investments. However, successfluly implementing these large
components placed prime importance on the municipalities' ability to plan and implement them. Concerns
regarding the limited capacity of the implementing agencies, including their administrative and financial
capacity, were reflected under objective (b), and were adequately addressed by the project through the
institutional capacity building component. Capacity building at the local level was recognized as a
long-term process. With regard to objective (c), the project supported KIP and urban renewal activities to
address poverty alleviation.
In the very early 1990s, it was recognized that central government was not able to meet the infrastructure
service requirements of rapidly growing urban populations, and that municipal governments would have to
increase their management capacity. The project's design took into account the Bank experiences that
confirmed that: (a) limited nlanning and imnlementation canacitv at the central level reduced the
efficiency of mass delivery programs; (b) capacity building at the local level was a long-term process that
needed to he accompanied hy an increase in local resnonsihility and autonomy; (c) financial relationships
between the central and local levels needed to promote more autonomy; and (d) private sector participation

3.4 Revised Components:
Over the life of the project, the Semarang sewerage component was modified and the labor-intensive
works and on-roof pennit system were added.
Semarang Sewerage. As the mid-term review approached in September 1997, it was obvious that the
Semarang sewerage component could not be implemented and that led to cancellation of the component.
Instead, during the mid-term review, agreement was reached to prepare a "Sanitation Strategic
Development Plan", emphasizing a demand-driven approach. This approach involved extensive
community consultations to select a technology that the community was comfortable with and that was
affordable. The menu of options would take into account the feasibility of various options, investment
costs, operations and maintenance, and a breakdown of responsibilitv between the communitv and the
local government. In parallel, a more traditional analysis of the "backbone" of the sewerage system would
be undertaken. This study would look at the location of any future wastewater treatment plant(s), the
availability of sites of sufficient size, and the hydrography of the site. Towards the project end, the Bank
accented GCTI's reauest to imnlement a nilot sewerage system in limited areas. (See nara 4.2 for resultsi)

considering the huge infrastructure deficiencies in both municipalities. The project was consistent with
CAR nhiptriveq nf foruisingr on the need for interregional enuitvy delivering higher oualitv services and

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The achievement of objectives for the Semarang Surakarta Urban Development Project is considered
marginally satisfactory.
Objective 1: Improve the provision of urban infrastructure services and the efficiency of urban
investments
Achievement of this objective is rated marginally satisfactory. The majority of the project components
were satisfactorily completed and have achieved the majority of their objectives with a significant
development impact. These include: urban roads investments including improvement in traffic management
(both cities); improvements to river embankments and alignments in Seringin (Semarang), solid waste
management. urban renewal and kamvung improvement (both cities) and water supply in Surakarta.
Better quality roads have significantly improved both cities' economies. Similarly, the completed drainage
works in Semarang, although they have not fully resolved the city's severe flooding problems, have at least
shortened the inundation periods in the project area. Improved solid waste management in both cities has
contributed to a healthier urban environment.
Two large, complex components experienced significant delays and were not fully completed at Loan

In addition, prolonged delays occurred in the implementation of the Semarang water supply and Surakarta

and in operation to treat wastewater from hne expanded sewer system in the northern area ThLis has reduced
the pollution rate to the ground and surface water considerably, in particular, to the Bengawan Solo river.
With this mixed performance, the achievement of the primary objective of improving the provision of urban
infrastructure services and the efficiency of urban investments is rated marginally satisfactory.
Object ve 2: Promnote strunger, more autonomo-us and financally more independent muncilpal
govermments
Municipal planning and implementation. This objective was satisfactorily met, despite the economic crisis
starting 1997 and countrys s-ubseqsuent political ins ability. u iL thie decisiois rel ied Uo piaiming anu
implementation were taken at the municipal level. In planning the mid-term investment program and the
annual plans, a systematic planning process was consistently followed. In uhe context of project
implementation management, the role of the project management unit was significant, as it was able to
coordinate severai agencies with different roles and tasks. However, imnplementation could have been
smoother had the original mayors displayed higher quality leadership (see para 5.3). The leadership
situation improved towards the end of project period when tne new mayors began tneir terms, but the
earlier implementation delays could not be overcome.
PDAMs. Important steps towards improving the autonomy of the municipal water enterprises (PDAM)
were tak-en by UOUI citUs. I iu uuciipUsitli Ulo ui0i LuperUvis[ry boaids UU Wl wLiigedu ill da[cuoudacc Wiui

start-up, the PDr vi BoardUs were crUaireu oy uie mrayor andu copn-lpHseu iv-C loca govexnmen1 of1ficias. By
contrast, there are now three Board members, with one local government official. The other members are a
consumer representative and any qualified individuai.
Despite these changes in Board membership, both PDAMs were still unable to refuse their local
governments requests to remit advance dividend payments, even when there was no profit for the year.
Under the leadership of the new mayor of Semarang, these advance payments were returned to the PDAM
after the intent of the loan covenant disallowing these payments was clarified. In Surakarta, the local
government fimded water supply-reiated investments for the PDAM in return for the advance dividend
payments.
Another noteworthy institutional change took place in Surakarta, where responsibility for the operation and
management of the sewerage system constructed under the project has been transferred to the PDAM; its
organizational structure has been modified accordingly.

Municipal Finance. The growth of local revenues (pendapatan asli daerah or PAD) of both cities fell
below appraisal estirates. Up to FY1997/98, local revenues of both cities were exceeding SAR
projections. But after that, the economic crisis and political unrest resulted in an economic slowdown, and
depreciation of the Rupiah (from Rp2,105:US$1 at project appraisal in 1994 to Rp 2,909 in 1996, to Rp
10,014 in 1997). Then, Tax Reform Law No. 18/1997 was issued, abolishing some local taxes and
charges, in exchange for some new ones. While there was immediate implementation of the abolition of
the old taxes and charges, there was a delay in the implementation of the new ones. The drop in the value of
the local revenues collected can be seen if they are converted to constant prices (see Table 2 below). At the
end of the project, the growth rate of the local revenues of Kota Semarang was only 10%, as compared to
19% projected at appraisal. For Kota Surakarta. the attained growth rate of 10% is not so far from the
13% projected at appraisal, in spite of the fact that a major market and many business establishments were
burned down during the 1998 riots.

Utility Finance. The financial situation of the PDAMs of Semarang and Surakarta had not improved at
closing. Delavs in the comnletion of the water treatment nlant in Semarane and the nmvicion of raw water

and urban renewal efforts in both cities were all successful. The urban renewal efforts in Bandarhaijo
-7-



(Semarang) have significantly improved the living conditions of the poor, and have generated economic
activity in the community. In Bandarhario, site improvements have generated new activity in retail and
furniture-making. The people in the area also have access to improved drainage. Similarly, KIP and urban
renewal in Moiosongo (Surakarta) were successful in improving living conditions and the local economy.
The people in urban renewal areas have access to the new sewer system.
b) Although not targeted to the poor, the sewerage investments in Surakarta have significantly improved the
city enviromnent generally.
c) In Semarang, a pilot sanitation scheme at neighborhood level was developed in two locations, and serves
a limited number of people. This pilot scheme was designed to be replicated throughout the city.
d) The social impact on the famnilies affected by the project's flood control works in Kali Banger, was
mitigated by the preparation of new sites in Karangroto, following a detailed resettlement action plan
prepared by the municipal govemment during project preparation.
e) The alleviation of urban poverty, addressed through provision of clean water via public hydrants was not
sianificant. Provision of sanitation facilities (MCKs) was also less effective.
f) Added in 1998, the labor-intensive work lpadat karva) component temporarily relieved the
unemployment problem brought about by the economic crisis. This activity covered the province of Central
Java, with works being carried out in Semarang and Surakarta. The works consisted mostly of constructing
footpaths and side drains in densely populated poor areas. In Semarang the padat karya works
supplemented the works under the KIP and urban renewal components, and improved some of the areas
prone to flooding in the northem part of the city.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Urban Road and Traffic Management - Semarang ($31.1 million SAR, $36.9 million actual). The
urban road and traffic management component was by far the most successful component. Actual
implementation far exceeds SAR targets as shown below. In the recalculated ERRs, the lowest ERR was
-3.1% for the Lingkar Utara road, which underwent a substantial redesign to include widening and a
fly-over, where an at-grade crossing was originally proposed. The highest ERR was 247% for the
Majapahit Road. The overall average ERR for the roads component in Semarang was a very satisfactory
75%. (See also Annex 3.)

The Northem Ring Road (NRR) extension has relieved traffic congestion considerably and has facilitated
access to other economic infrastructure such as the harbor and airport. The road also connects to the
toll-road, and will complement a future toll road. This NRR supplements another road program being

implemented under the ongoing Strategic Urban Roads Intrastructure Project, SUKIP (Ln. 4WA4-IN U).
Road construction, as well as overall implementation progress are currently rated highly satisfactory, so the
likelihood of finishing these road projects is strong.
Urban Roads and Traffic Management - Surakarta ($20.4 million SAR, $11 million actual).
Although less successful than in Semarang, the Surakarta road component is also rated satisfactory with an
average ERR of 46%. Actual expenditures on this component are lower than foreseen because five out of
38 contract packages for local roads were cancelled due to misprocurement. Nevertheless, the extension of
the NRR and construction of 11 bridges have facilitated traffic flow around the city, and connect the city to
other roads, thereby reducing travel times. The Urban Transport Study recommended improvements to the
transport system in and around the city. Some proposed projects rnight have been incorporated into this
project, if funds for land acquisition had been available. Past and current municipal governments have not
been able to pursue those recommendations because land acquisition costs were considered prohibitive.

program was cancelled, as there was no agreement on the proposed concept, and the fimds were utilized to
expand the distribution network. Delays of more than two years occurred on the construction of two 5,000 m
reservoirs, the Kelambu-Kudu raw water canal (42 km long), and the Kudu WTP (1,250 l/s). Some of the
delays were due to procurement issues (one case of misprocurement was declared). The raw water canal
was supposed to be 100% financed by GOI, but due to a shortage of funds, it was only partially completed.
In 1999, the Bank agreed to completing the canal using loan funds and a labor-intensive construction
methods. Problems with completing the canal, mainly due to incompetent contractors and weak management
capacity at the proiect implementing agency level, contributed to delays in fully onerating the WTP. At Loan
closing, the Kudu WTP was completed and was undergoing testing, but it had not been commissioned. As a
result. the service level achieved was 45% instead of the nlanned 64%.

Serious implementation delays occurred because the former mayor of Surakarta took more than three years
to decide on a water source for the project. Finally, tme option endorsed in the SAR-- that of i0 deep weiis
- was chosen. The project financed the construction of the 10 deep wells at design capacity, along with a
much larger distrbDution networK of 216 Km Of pipes, enaDlimg a net positve increase of /,418 house
connections over the SAR estimate. The new public taps were abandoned as demand for public taps
diminished. Construction quality was good and the well yields have exceeded design capacity.
Drainage and Flood Control - Semarang ($23.7 million SAK, $23.5 million actual). This component is
rated satisfactory, as the works carried out have spared Semarang from frequent flooding. For many years,
the city's northem area was prone to flooding due to land subsidence and seawater intrusion, combined with
the upstream flow. The works included construction of 20 km of primary drains, 53 km of secondary and
tertiary drains, construction of two retention basins (polder) in two areas, one of which is the old-city
conservation area, rehabilitation of canals and rivers, and construction of a diversion channel. The retension
basin systems were equipped with two pumping stations. The reduced inundation period has resulted in
increased land values, and has stimulated the local economy. These drainage works were to be part of a
larger flood control scheme, whose master plan and feasibility study were prepared during project
implementation. The studies were financed through the Bank's Technical Assistance Project for the Private
and Public Provision of Infrastructure (TAP4I-2, Ln. 3913-IND, now closed). The Govemment of Japan
was to have financed the works identified in the feasibility study, but in the end, they did not. Parts of
Semarang still flood during heavy rains, and a follow-on flood control project would be beneficial.
Drainage - Surakarta ($5 million SAR, $11.5 milion actual) This component satisfactorily achieved its
objectives. The drainage works in Surakarta are about twice the scope of the program described in the
SAR. A considerable number of new local drainage works were added to overcome local drainage problems
and bottlenecks. The project laid some 4.6 km of primary drains (from 3 km planned), and about 31 km of
secondary and tertiary drains (against 17 km planned). It also included the construction of water gates in
Demangan to protect the city from flooding. About 200 ha of the formerly flooded areas now remain dry as
a result of these facilities.
Sewerage and Sanitation - Semarang ($12.2 million SAR, $0.88 million actual) This component is
considered unsatisfactory. A summary of activities follows.

Sewerage and Sanitation - Surakarta (S7.3 miiiion SAR, $4.5 million actual). This component is rated
unsatisfactory.

In Surakarta, the sewerage scheme included (a) rehabilitation and expansion of the old Dutch sewer system
m the southern part of the city; and (b) rehabilitation of the existing sewerage system in Mojonsongo area,
which included the rehabilitation and expansion of the existing sewer network serving low-income housing,
and construction of a new wastewater treatment plant in Kedung Tungkuil. The central treatment plant
(planned to be located in Demangan) to serve the southem scheme was cancelled because (a) cost increases
rendered the plant infeasible, and (b) the present quality of the effluent can still be dissolved naturally by the
receiving water body (Bengawan Solo river). However, the preliminary sedimentation tanks were
constructed to treat the effluent before it is discharged to the river. The new interceptors, secondary sewers

and additional sewer connections have been added to ensure cost recovery. Overall, the scheme (both north
and south) was designed to serve about 10,600 connections, but due to a lack of counterpart funds, only
60% of the connections could be made by closing. Plans to complete the system with an additional 4,170
sewer connections have been prepared and funds secured by the city government, for completion by the end
of 2003, with central government assistance. Bank funding to supervise these activities would be beneficial.
Solid Waste - Semarang ($5.6 miliion SAR, MI miliion actuai). T nis component is rated satisfactory.
Service levels improved from 60% to 76% compared to the SAR target of 80%. The old disposal site was
closed and the new site was improved. These changes have led to an improved urban environment. Tne city
has, however, neglected to apply sanitary landfill procedures in recent years, and the leachete treatment was
not functioning. The city expects to improve its cost recovery for solid waste management by revising its tax
code, and the cost recovery ratios for the last FYs (2000 and 2001) have been very promising.
Solid Waste - Surakarta ($1.6 million SAR, $3.1 million actual). This component is rated unsatisfactory.
In terms of money spent, the actual expenditures are nearly double the SAR plan. This component has also
improved the city environment, but the operation of solid waste final disposal is unsatisfactory. Service
levels stagnated at 80%. The city also has shown a deterioration in cost recovery for solid waste, and
although the budget for FY2001 increased, it did not make up for a bigger increase in O&M expenditures.
As continually advised, closer coordination between the revenue collecting unit (Dispenda) and the
operational unit (city cleaning agency) must be pursued.
KIUP/MIP - Semarang ($3.1 million SAR, $3.6 million actual). Implementation of the KIP and MIP
components are both rated satisfactory. These two programs have significantly improved the selected slum
areas in the city. At appraisal an estimated 197,000 poor were to benefit; at project close an estimated
287,965 had been assisted. However, most KIP work has focused on road/footpath construction.
Improvement of sanitation was not prioritized, and micro credit facility and assistance to small businesses as
emphasized by TRIBINA (activities to promote physical, social and local economy generation) policy was
not fully developed. Following a Bank recommendation, in the last two years, the implementation of KIP has
been modified to include the social and economic dimensions, including a micro-credit facility, in addition to
nhvcirin npgmrading. (A fuller discussion of KIP evolution is found in the ICR for the Third Jabotabek
Urban Development Project.)
KIP/MIP - Surakarta ($2.8 and 2.2 million SAR, $2.3 and 0.32 million actual). Similar to experiences
in Semarang, the KTP and MTP rnmpnnents hbth are rated satisfactorvy The KTP component targeted 313700

Social interaction has improved, and the people are more motivatea, have improved seaf esteem and capacity
to further develop their settlements. The Action Plan for Urban Renewal in Bandarhaijo, provided under the
TA, was able to support the establishment of local regulations for spatial planning in the renewal area.
However, the low-ost housing program in the same area was fully implemented. The project could not
demonstrate the revolving fund mechanism in the housing component, because the model for low-cost
housing was cancelled. This initiative was continued under other program (COBUILD/UNDP/Dutch
Government).
Urban Renewal Surakarta ($2.2 million SAR, $0.32 million actual). Similarly, despite the absence of
housing activities, the urban renewal component in Mojosongo, along the Anyar River, has considerably
changed the physical and social appearance of the area. Improvements to the existing housing along the
river, using the National Saving Bank (BTN) have proven very successful, with the assistance of local
NGOs. On one side of the river, the slum area was completely renewed by re-arranging and reorganizing it,
and bestowing formal land titles to residents. On the other side further north, the kampung improvement
process employed introduced a new framework for interaction between local govemrnment agencies and the
community in improving the settlement. This involves an interactive forum created in this area. Facilitators
from various NGOs were very helpful in establishing the new process. Mojosongo is a good example of a
strong, community-based development project.
Historic Areas Conservation - Semarang. For a long time the old historic area of Semarang was
neglected. The area frequently flooded, the infrastructure deteriorated, and many businesses left the area.
With project support, the Heritage Society inventoried the existing historic assets, and prepared a policy
and strategy to revitalize the historic area. The people established a community organization that takes an
active role in shaping the framework for future development. Through a long participatory process, an
overall spatial plan was prepared including building guidelines and mechanisms to manage future
development. At closing, the draft spatial plan and the proposed institutional structure were ready to be
submitted to the City Council. With the improved infrastructure such as roads and the main drainage
system, many businesses have returned and are generating new economic activity in the old area. The routine
flooding has disappeared, thanks to the construction of the polder system and its pump station near the
railway station.
One-Roof Permit System. This component was added in 2000 and has been considered successful in
demonstrating the improvement of good governance by simplifying the permit system and centralizing the
permit issuance under one unit developed under the project. Nine types of pernits from five local agencies
(i.e., tourism and culture, city planning and development, surface communication, park, industry and trade)
are included in the system.On-line computer system was developed connecting the Unit office, the office of
city planning and development and several kecamatans (subdistrict). Commitments from the mayor and the
participating agencies are the mayor factor in making the system successful.
Snrakarta As the caital of the old Mataram Kingdon in the l8th centirvy Suralkarta has a ninqie urann
structure and many historic buildings. The Heritage Society in Surakarta is active in promoting urban
he-ritage cnnservatinn Most of the  ncrie still fniqus mainly on imprnving physical infiatcttre. Thprp is

Small traditional activities in Laweyan, a famous batik craft production center, were supported to revitalize
- 14-



the old areas, which suffered a downturn due to increased competition. Tne community wanied :to revitalize
the traditional batik craft focusing on specific products. They strengthened their organizations and local
economic activities, and improved the roads and footpaths, preserved the old buiidings, and tried to promote
community-based tourism. These activities are still at an early phase and will need more time to come to
fruition.
Many Javanese cities have strong historical and traditional flavors. Strengthening and revitaiizing the
cultural centers will significantly help sustain economic and tourism development, and more importantly
provide a strong basis for commitment and self-esteem building. SSUDP tried to introduce the appropriate
frameworks, but difficulties persist. It would be useful if the Bank could provide further technical
assistance to strengthen the movement, as conservation and revitalization of urban heritage will spur
tourism, promote job creation, and strengthen socially and culturally important cities.
Overall the project components were appropriate for achieving the objectives. Ample perfornance
indicators were developed to judge progress toward the achievement of objectives.

lower than the appraisal estimates for reasons of lower-than-expected traffic volume and higher investmnent
costs due to changes in design (e.g., cor uuc io1 of a fly-over instead of an at-grade crossing because of a
new GOI regulation). The bypass (arterial ring) road subprojects in both Semarang and Surakarta have not
achieved the expected ERR set a ppraisal. Aultough uotu ruads were con-,p:eted, uiey are not yet fully
functional because the road links being financed by GOI and the SURIP are not yet completed. Once these
links are completed, the bypass su'oprojects built under this project are expected to achieve satisfactory
ERRs.
Water Supply. The financial rates of return for the two subprojects in Semarang and Surakarta were
re-estimated (see Section 4.4). No economic analysis was done, as in the SARK
Sewerage and Sanitation. No economic evaluation was made in the SAK for this component, for either
Semarang or Surakarta. In Semarang, the cancellation of the original plan for an expanded sewer system in
the city in favor of a small-scale pilot sanitation scheme (for replication purposes) in two neighborhoods
does not necessitate an EIRR calculation. Based on actual accomplishments, however, the pilot subproject
was able to install 125 house connections. The on-site sanitation component was able to provide 131 MCKs
(more than the 80 MCKs targeted in the revised plan). The environmental and health impact of this pilot
scheme could be significant to those who have directly benefitted.
Drainage and Flood Control. At project appraisal, the economic feasibility of the drainage subprojects
was not measured in terms of an EIRR but on the basis of the minimum land value increase that would
recover both capital investments and O&M costs. In the re-evaluation, EIRR was computed for each
subproject using actual land value increases as the sole economic benefit considered. From the re-evaluation,
five of the seven subprojects have EIRRs exceeding 50%. These subprojects have effectively reduced
flooding and inundation in areas where the drainage canals have been constructed. Kali Tengang and Kali
Bangger in Semarang are. the only subprojects that did not achieve an EIRR greater than 50%. Kali
Tenggang's EIRR is 11%. Because of land acquisition problems and lack of GOI counterpart funds, the
subproject scope was changed from the original plan of constructing a primary drainage canal to improving
- 15 -



secondary canals. As such, the impact of this particular subproject was not as significant as originally
intended.
Solid Waste. For the solid waste management subprojects, a financial cost-recovery analysis was prepared
instead of an EIRR or FIRR calculation. (See discussion in Section 4.4).
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Water Supply.
Semarang. At Loan closing, PDAM Kota Semarang was having difficulty servicing the project loan. Debt
service arrears have reached Rp 67 billion. The Kudu WTP cannot yet operate at its full capacity of 1,250
I/s due to an insufficient flow of raw water from the Kelambu-Kudu Canal. Consumption per connection
was lower than estimated at appraisal because of the water shortage resulting from the late completion of the
treatment plant. Installation of new connections slowed down between 1998 - 2001 because of low water
supply. The PDAM even had to suspend accepting applications for some time, because monthly
consumption of existing consumers was already declining. This was made worse by a high Ufw rate of 37%
at the end of the project. The PDAM was not spared from the effects of the economic crisis that started in
mid 1997. Prices of chemicals rose 234% in 1998. Power costs climbed between 23% to 45% between
1997 - 2001. Tariff increases could not be implemented as required. The PDAM became unable to pay debt
service requirements on time starting in 2001. Its debt service coverage ratio dipped to 0.77. Gross
revenues could not cover operating expenses and depreciation, as required under the financial covenants. On
top of these, the PDAM could not refuse the local government when asked to remit advance payment of
dividends. It was only towards the end of the project, when there was a change in the mayor, that this
practice stopped.
For the PDAM to be financially stable, it needs to have its repayments of the project loan rescheduled. The
PDAM has to implement its commnitment to increase tariffs 70% in April 2000, followed by a 60% increase
in January 2004, and a 20% increase every other year thereafter. (Recent information showed that tariff
increase of 272% will be materialized in June 2002). It must also catch up with installing 80,000 new
connections by 2005 to make use of the water supplied by the new WTP. With these commitments,
projections indicate that the PDAM's operations should be sustainable. The resulting FIRR of 15% would
be an improvement over he 13% at appraisal. Please see tables in Annex 3 for a comparison of key
financial indicators estimated at appraisal vs. actual figures for the years 1994 to 2002, and a comparison
of appraisal vs. projections for years 2003 to 2010.
Surakarta. At closing, PDAM Surakarta was also having difficulties servicing its project loan. Debt
service nrrears amounted to Rn 14 hillion= The delay in the completion of the producrtion wells neg'ativelv
affected the growth of new connections as well as the average monthly consumption by consumers. Tariff
increases were n^t implemented as . renuiri-ed. UfW was higher than estimatedatnapprisal. Grss re-venues

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project's second objective was to promote stronger, more autonomous, and financially more independent
municipal govenmments. In addressing this objective in terms of institutional development, each municipal
government established project management units (PMUs) and project implementation units (PIUs) in both
cities with a provincial project management unit (PPMU) and a provincial project management office
(PPMO) for coordination purposes. Although the latter management tools were not as effective as those at
the city level, they provided excellent support early in implementation, but receded towards completion. The
establishment of these management units provided significant contributions in making effective use of human
and financial resources which could be used to optimize the resources in managing similar projects in the
future.
With regard to post project implementation, the project has also provided guidance and assistance in
improving the capacity of local agencies to manage and operate the completed facilities. The most prominent
example is the establishment of a unit within PDAM Surakarta to be responsible for managing and operating
the sewerage system.
When the Loan was closed, the partial completion of the raw water canal for the city of Semarang (Kelambu
Kudu canal) was not properly followed up with the establishment of a more permanent agency in charge of
maintaining the canal. Only three months after (in December 2001); a transitional unit was formed and fimlds
secured by the Govemor of Central Java Province, to operate and maintain the canal. This is the most
reGnni7nhle qhortcominr nf the initimtionnl fievelonment nrnres in the nrmiect that will qffect the
- 17 -



sustainability of raw water supply to the city. The government's longer-term plan to establish an
independent commercially based government-owned enterprise for water resources management in the area,
and to include the management of the canal, could ensure long-term sustainaibility of the system.
5. Major Factors Affecting implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control ofgovernment or implementing agency:
Three factors outside the control of government or the implementing agencies occurred: (a) the economic
crisis of 1997/98, (b) the political riots in Surakarta in 1998, and (c) the poor performance of a number of
contractors.
Economic Crisis. The economic crisis of 1997/98 and the political turmoil in 1998 greatly affected the
project's pace of imnplementation. The significant depreciation of the Rupiah as a result of the crisis not only
increased the total cost of the project (in Rupiah terms) but also severely constrained the ability of both the
central government and the two city governments to provide counterpart funding. The economic downturn
also severely affected local economic activity, leading to declines in tax revenues and making the two city
govermnents unable to achieve their fiscal revenue targets after the crisis hit
The crisis also had a negative impact on the PDAMs. Operating costs rose sharply: (a) chemical costs rose
as much as four-fold; (b) power rates went up sharply; and (c) maintenance material costs, as well as other
operating costs (including staff salaries) went up sharply due to hyper-inflation (78% in 1998). At the same
time, the PDAMs were unable to increase water tariffs for nolitical reasons. They were unable to tackle
leakages, replace faulty meters or undertake minor capital expenditures to distribute water to customers
seeking new connections. Therefore; it is small wonder that the two PDAMs had difficulty complving with
financial covenants and did not make great strides in reducing UfW.
Civil Disturbances. In 1998, political riots broke out in Surakarta. As a result, the main building of city

Passing of Key Legislation. The new Laws No. 22 and 25/1999 on decentralization and local autonomy
tnat were promulgated during the crisis in conjuncton with several changes in the cent-al guvem-neni
structure caused confusion among local governments, and negatively affected the project. The enactment of
Law No i8ii997 on tax reform considerably reduced the taxes and fees that cities could collect, iuere'oy
making it extremely difficult for the cities to improve revenues. Reduced revenues adversely affected cities'
capacity to generate counterpart funcing for the project

intervention, delayed implementation of the Semarang water component for over two years. Misprocurement
in the urban roads componeni for Surakarka also caused delays. The separation of larger o-k packages in.to
smaller ones may have resulted in lower quality tenders, and may have contributed to the poor quality of
work in some of the subprojects.
Management Effectiveness of the PDAMis. Failure of the two PDAMts to implement agreed covenants on
tariff rate increases seriously jeopardized the financial condition of both enterprises, even if the reason for
Semarang's failure is grounded in its inability to deliver tne expected treated water from the Kudu piant. 1-ne
cancellation of the latter's UfW program also contributed to its poor revenue performance.
Beneficiary Participation. Lack of beneficiary participation in the spring source development for
Surakart, and in prepauaion of Semaurag sewerage cor.ponen s delayed prUject completion. OLn th.e other
hand, active community participation in KIP in both cities, and in the conservation of the old city section of
Semarang, resulted in 'mbeter project im-plementation.

6. Sustainabifity
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Except for roads, project sustainability for most of the project components is unlikely. Some components
may have difficulty in ensuring sustainability, as discussed below. One of the key components for a
project's sustainability is the commitment of the concerned local government to ensure allocation of
sufficient O&M costs under its annual budget. Tnis applies to water supply and drainage components. in
this respect, sufficiently experienced and competent staff exist to maintain project-assisted facilities.
However, witn low priority given by local govemnment, only limited budgets will likely be secured for
O&M.
For water supply, the financial situation of the PDAM will be a condition for ensuring sufficient budget for
running the system efficiently and sustainably.
The sustainabiiity of the community-based components such as KIP, urban renewal and the pilot sanitation
scheme is likely, as demonstrated by the active participation of the beneficiaries since preparation. From a
larger perspective, the decentralization process that is now underway, coupled with the decreasing role of
central government and lack of future grant funding for urban infrastructure, including water supply, will
be factors conducive to sustainability. The other conducive factors for sustainability are greater democracy
at the local level, with the city council (DPRD) and mayor being elected and accountable, and greater
transparency and openness.
Semarang Water Supply. Ensuring a continuous and sufficient supply of bulk raw water for water supply
in Semarang will require serious attention with regard to sustainability. With the absence of a formal
agreement between the PDAM and the bulk raw water supplier (Jratunseluna Project), the sustainability of
supplying raw water is questionable, and it places the Semarang water system at high risk. (Jratunseluna
Project is responsible for the construction of water resources facilities, under the Provincial Public Works
Department. The project area covers the following river basins: Jragung, Tuntang, Serang, Lusi and
Juana). A study for regional water supply operation in Semarang and surrounding areas, with possible
private financing, was conducted for Semarang. The study was financed by TAP4I-2, but after it was
completed, no satisfactory follow up was taken by the provincial as well as city govenmment.
Surakarta Sewerage. The agreement reached during appraisal was that PDAM Surakarta will be
responsible for operating the sewerage scheme. With the limited number of sewer connections at present,
there is a financial risk that the PDAM has to bear, which will affect its financial condition. This matter of
the necessity of subsidies provided by the central govermment for annual O&M costs is a Bank concem for
at least the furst two years of operations.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
- 20 -



All project components were implemented by the agency ultimately responsible for operation and
managment. The transition arrangement to regular operations is not an issue.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank's performance in project identification was satisfactory. The project was prepared at a time

Assistance Strategy. Unfortunately, however, economic and sector work for the water supply and
sanitation subsectors was not available. This nmeant the project did not ha-ve a solid sector policy
framework agreed with GOI for reference during implementation.
The Bank's performance in preparation was also satisfactory. The project was prepared over a period of
six years with the active involvement of the two municipai governments concerned. Of tne eight
preparation missions on record, four of them had five or more mission members, and were well rounded
with expertise in engineering, financial analysis, environmental expertise, economics, community
development, and urban planning. The environmental and community development experts ensured
compliance with Bank safeguard policies concerning the environrnent and involuntary resettlenent
respectively.
The project preparation process included extensive consultations and reviews, particularly during the final
stages of preparation. The entire process was guided by !MG and endorsed by Bappenas, the National
Development Planning Agency. The quality of preparation was sufficient to allow for immediate
implementation of most components.
The Bank's performance in appraisal was satisfactory. The mission was well staffed with eight experts in
sanitary and municipal engineering, urban transport, institutional expertise, economics, land management,
environment, and financial analysis. During appraisal, particular attention was given to the readiness of
the project for implementation. Considering project design and complexity, the risks were identified and
mitigated. Safeguard policies addressed. The environmental assessment was made public and distributed to
the EDs before appraisal. A detailed resettlement plan involving NGOs, public meetings and consultations
with affected people, as well as a socio-economc survey of the population, were prepared as part of the
environmental assessment process.
Assurances for completing the Kelambu-Kudu canal under GOI financing were given by GOI during
appraisal. However, with the canal now completed unsatisfactorily, the appraisal mission should have
required a strong covenant about finishing the canal on time with secured funding, or made it a condition of
disbursement for associated Bank-funded works.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank performance during supervision was satisfactory. The supervision missions were carried out at least
t-ice a yesU -UUU-gILU-UL UIVLLrIVI.IIaIL4onII pJIiLUU. LU pIrlVUUIII, UI4aL adVi  Wui idnifiedLI  adIIU
addressed, and loan covenants were repeatedly enforced. This was particularly true when Bank guidelines
- 21 -



on procurement were violated which ultimately led to declarations of misprocurement on some contract
packages. The skiil mix and adequacy of tne mission members' skiils were maintained, and independent
consultants to provide advice when needed. Reporting was regular and sufficiently detailed. Ratings were
reasonabie; however, more realism in the ratings of the water and sanitation components would have been
desirable.
In the last two years of the project, supervision was handed over to a national staff with a long history of
involvement in the project. This move allowed for on-the-spot, vigilant supervision of the project, and
particularly in supervising the completion of Kudu water treatment plant, Kelambu-Kudu canal and
sewerage works in Surakarta. The staff member, a sanitary engineer, was effective in speeding up project
progress, but even so, these works remained incomplete due to factors beyond the Bank's control. The
Bank provided high quality advice and demonstrated ample flexibility in addressing the problems that arose
due to numerous changes to the project scope. Several examples of this are: (a) accepting a pilot scheme
when the Semarang sanitation component was cancelled, (b) introducing padat karya works to assist the
unemployed; (c) increasing Bank disbursement levels to accommodate the lack of counterpart funds during
the height of the economic crisis; (d) introducing the KIP micro-credit scheme; and (e) implementing the
one-roof perrnit system in Semarang.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The Bank's overall performance is rating satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
During preparation, the borrower's performance was satisfactory. SSUDP was the second generation of
integrated approach for urban development, where it dealt with metropolitan and large cities. The
Government indicated that preparing large project components in large cities required a different approach
as compared to preparing projects for smaller cities such as in the East Java Bali Urban Development
Project (EJB; Ln. 3304-IND) or the Sulawesi Irian Jaya Urban Development Project (Suliria,
Ln.3340-IND) both of which had a much greater number (more than 40 in the case of EJB) of small cities.
The nronosals nut forward by GOI for appraisal were well-founded. coherent and consistent, and Dresent a
balanced investment program, together with the necessary institutional and financial support actions. With
the exception of lack of commni ty particination in some nroject comnonents (Surakarta sewerage and
water supply), all project components were thoroughly prepared, and the government's project management
stnrctulre was cle:irlv outlined
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Borrower's performance m implementation was also satisfactory. Borrower's commitment to project
implementation was high, as expressed in regular participation on the supervision mission and candid
follow up. However, the borrower's performance would have significantly improved if (a) strong
commitment from the mayors of both cities could be demostrated to implement the project; (b) selection of
consultants could be made properly; and (c) timely provision of counterpart funds could be made available.
The newly promulgated Laws on decentralization and tax reform, coupled with changes in the government
structure, have negatively affected the government performance. Another shortcoming is the failure of GOI
to provide sufficient budget to complete the raw water canal to Semarang.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
- 22 -



The project had one executing agency, the Ministry of Setutement and Regional lnfastructure (MSRI), and
three implementing agencies: Central Java provincial government, Semarang and Surakarta municipal
governments and their PDAMs.
MSRI's performance was satisfactory. Being the executing agency, MSRI was not involved in
implementation, but provided general policy and guidance. However, the Ministry was responsible for
technical assistance (TA) and several studies, which were implemented for the benefit of both cities. The
studies carried out under MSRI were well completed but there has been no significant follow-up on
recommendations. The central ministries continually participated in the Bank's supervision mission and
were actively involved in the discussions.
Central Java province's performance was satisfactory. It provided coordination and support, and also
implemented project components under its responsibility (national roads, sewerage, drainage). The
Provincial Project Management Office (PPMO) was heavily involved during the early years of project
implementation and gradually receded toward the project end, when the PMU/PMO offices were taking
higher role.
Municipal Governments. The Project Management Office (PMO) and PMU in each municipality were
responsible for project coordination, whereas the Project Implementation Units were responsible for the
quality of project implementation of its subprojects, where PDAM under the ostensibly autonomous water
company (PDAM) is one of the PIU.
The performance of these implementing agencies varied over implementation period. During start-up,
delays occurred in the design and mobilization of the TAs, but these delays were overcome over time.
During the implementation period, the performance of city governments would have been better if the
mayors of both cities had avoided being involved in the day-to-day operation of the proiect, including the
procurement process (in Semarang) and decision on the water source (in Surakarta). Both cases
tremendously delayed project implementation. It is important to say, however, that project management.
particularly in Semarang, worked effectively and efficiently. Towards the end of project period (with two
years extension). after the new mayors took office, the situation greatly improved. The new players have
shown strong commnitment to rectify the situation, and to complete the project satisfactorily. With this
varied performance, the rating of implementing agencies is satisfactory.
PDAMs. Similarly, the performance of its PDAM. as one of the PIUs, varied over inplemnentation period.
Both the PDAMs, if financially healthy, have the obligation to pay dividends to the municipalities. There
were incidents that PDAMs paid dividends, and were asked not to do so. as it violated the loan covenants
PDAM Surakarta has had problems with the mayor's indecision on its water source, but was performning
satisfactorily towards the end of the nroiect. PDAM Semarang has performed ponrly mnce the project
commenced. The PDAM's one-sided decision to involve the private sector in the investment of WTP during

8. Lessons Learn.ed
Tne project's integrated approach to urban infrastructure development for iarge cities offers a numDer of
noteworthy lessons for the sector and country.
Lesson One: The integrated approach is not always appropriate for large cities, and the absence of a
firm sector policy framework can inhibit success.
Water and sanitation components were traditionaily included in IUIJPs. However, the lUliJPs designed
before SSUDP included relatively simple subprojects (usually rehabilitation with small-scale expansion),
where the lack of policy direction in the sector did not seriously inhibit imnplementation. SSUDP covered
water and sanitation/sewerage subprojects that required significant policy direction, especially with regard
to securing raw water supply, tariff-setting, UfW reduction, and community consultation. In June 2001,
the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) carried out a performance audit covering three water
supply and sanitation projects included in SSUDP, the Second Jabotabek Urban Development Project (Ln.
3219-IND) and the Water Supply and Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project (Ln. 3629-IND).
As the audit focused exclusively on the water supply, sanitation and health education aspects of the three
projects, its recommendations cover those components exclusively. The Bank endorses OED's
recommendation that large water and sanitation components be linked to policy reform. The Bank also
endorses OED's recommendation that sustainable water supply and sanitation wastewater services require
sound water resources management at the project level.
In June 2001 the ICR (Report no. 22214-IND) for the Surabaya Urban Development Project (Ln.
3726-IND) was completed. (Surabaya is Indonesia's second largest city with more than one million
inhabitants.) The project was rated highly unsatisfactory, mainly because of very substantial but
incomplete project components including water supply. Experiences from the Surabaya Project and the
Semarang Surakarta project both support the importance of having policy direction for major infrastructure
components in large cities.
In support of OED recommendations, and from the experience with the Surabaya and Semarang
Surakarta Urban Development Projects, the first lesson learned is that when considering using the
integrated urban approach, it is necessary to take into account the size of the city (especially one million
inhabitants or more), especially in addressing sectors that do not have a clear policy framework.
Lesson Two: Quality of Leadership of the Mayor
The new paradigm of democracy under the new govemment, along with decentralized and autonomous
local government and decreased role of central government, coupled with the unforeseen 1997/98 crisis led
to tremendous delays, some of which can be attributed to the quality of leadership of the mayor/head of
local/municipal government. Careful consideration of the quality of leadership of the mayor should be a
prerequisite in preparing a new project.
Delays due to procurement problems in Semarang and indecision regarding a water source for Surakarta
-24 -



both indicate that high caliber leadership at the head of a municipal government is of prime importance for
successful implementation. Good quality leadership is not so much indicated by intelligence or knowledge;
rather quality leadership is linked to an individual's proper use of authority and commitment to project
objectives. The support provided by the project management staff may be excellent, but it cannot make up
for poor quality leadership at the top. Project progress significantly improved when the new mayors,
committed to the success of the project, were in place.
The second lesson learned is thatfor decentralized projects, it is important to have a local government
head who is committed to the project and who uses his/her authority for the greatest benefit of the
people. Further, the same principle applies to the head of the coordinating and implementing units and
the chairperson of important positions in project implementation (project managers, procurement
committees).

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
Tne economic analysis of the urban road and drainage/fiood conirol subprojects considered omy dir-ctiy
quantifiable costs and benefits. Like in the SAR, VOC savings and travel time savings constitute the only
economic benefits used in tne ERR caicuiation for urban road subprojects. For the drainageiflood control
subprojects, the sole economic benefit considered was the increase in land value in areas directly affected
by the drainage/fiood control facility construction.
All costs and benefits were valued at 2001 prices.
The following table (Table 1) shows comparative FIRR and EIRR (SAR Targets vs. Actuals). Table 2 and
3 are PI-JAM Financial indicators, Appraisal vs. Actual (1994 - 2002) and Appraisal vs. Projections (2003
- 2005), for both Semarang and Surakarta.
