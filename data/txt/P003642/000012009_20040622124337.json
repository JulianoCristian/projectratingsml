The lessons drawn from this specific project\n            suggest, and reinforce that reforms in the industry\n            structure, and market organization require strong commitment\n            by the central government, whereas commitment by provincial\n            governments, and public participation are key to successful\n            environmental management, and population resettlement,\n            contributors to the project success. Nonetheless,\n            participation of lawyers in the preparation of bidding\n            documents, contract negotiation and implementation is\n            crucial, specifically, as legal support for claims against\n            steam turbine suppliers arose, requiring precious time and\n            resources due to lack of legal advice in drafting\n            procurement terms and conditions. And unfortunately,\n            technology transfer may become risky: despite excellent\n            references, the manufacturer of boilers fostered costly\n            delays, by improvising design options that proved\n            unsatisfactory. Pre-qualification specifications should\n            require proven references for equipment supply, not just a\n            general experience. In addition, inexperience of the\n            supplier for the coal conveying/feeding system caused\n            suspension of contract execution and major delays. It is\n            thus suggested that prompt government clearances be\n            introduced, while similarly, effective design management\n            could ensure a timely delivery of engineering designs."}, "docdt": "2004-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
