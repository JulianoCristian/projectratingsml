Partial credit guarantees were\n            used for both projects. The partial credit guarantee covers\n            a portion of a financing against all risks. This contrasts\n            with the partial risk guarantee, which can cover up to the\n            entire amount of a financing against specific risks. The\n            guarantees were structured to extend the maturity of\n            commercial loans and provide China with greater flexibility\n            in accessing world financial markets, e.g., interest rate\n            (fixed or floating) and currency (to match procurement\n            contracts). At the same time, the Government and Bank wished\n            to minimize their exposure under the guarantee. This report\n            discusses the borrowing terms and guarantee structure for\n            each project and their respective costs and benefits."}, "docdt": "1995-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
