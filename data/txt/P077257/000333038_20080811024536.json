The\n            key factors leading to the Government of Ecuador's\n            (GOE's) decision not to sign the loan were political\n            instability and conflict and, in particular, conflicts\n            between national indigenous organizations over the direction\n            of the Council for the Development of Nationalities and\n            Peoples of Ecuador (CODENPE). Afro-Ecuadorian organizations\n            supported the project but were unable to influence the\n            government decesion that led to its cancellation. Political\n            instability and conflicts surrounding CODENPE created\n            repeated delays in fulfilling Ecuador's internal\n            requirements for signing the loan. Only the first of seven\n            steps required signing the loan, the Ministry of Economy and\n            Finances' (MEF's) project validation, had been\n            completed by GOE in January 2005. By February 2005, MEF had\n            decided that the original declaration of priority issued by\n            the planning secretariat had expired, and returned the\n            project to the starting point of the internal approval\n            process. CODENPE and the Afro-Ecuadorian Development\n            Corporation (CODAE) continued to make attempts to advance\n            the process but these were unfruitful. The Bank's Task\n            Team, together with both Sector Management Unit (SMU) and\n            Country Management Unit (CMU) management, remained engaged\n            throughout the period, through missions and visits and via\n            the permanent engagement of the country office. Updating the\n            agreed action plans and reminding authorities of the steps\n            required, but the agreed activities were not completed."}, "docdt": "2006-12-06T00:00:00Z"}
