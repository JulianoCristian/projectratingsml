Universities Project is to assist provincial universities\n            and the State Education Commission (SEdC) to expand\n            enrollment as well as improve the quality and management of\n            higher education programs. The project will have two\n            components: (a) Assistance to Provincial Universities; and\n            (b) Assistance to Higher Education Development. The first\n            component will assist 60 universities by providing for civil\n            works, equipment for teaching and research, curricula\n            reorganization and staff development opportunities. Emphasis\n            will be given to teacher education programs. The second\n            component will assist SEdC and the Provincial Higher\n            Education Bureaux to strengthen their planning and\n            management capacities mainly through provision of technical\n            assistance. Two planning activities which include the higher\n            education masterplan and the teacher demand and supply plans\n            will be supported."}, "docdt": "1986-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
