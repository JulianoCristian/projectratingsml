WHEREAS (A) the Bank has received a letter, dated June 13, 1997 from the 
Argentine Republic’s Province of San Juan (the Province) describing a program of 
actions, objectives and policies designed to achieve adjustment of the public finances 
and public education and public health sectors of the Province (hereinafter called the 
Program), declaring the Province's commitment to the execution of the Program, and 
requesting assistance from the Bank in support of the Program during the execution 
thereof;
(B)
the Borrower has indicated to the Bank that the actions and conditions 
set forth in the Program and in Schedule 3 to this Agreement, described therein as 
agreed between the Province and the Bank, are consistent with the Borrower’s national 
policy framework regarding provincial reforms, which policy (without mandating 
specific numerical targets) encourages provinces of the Borrower to, inter alia:  (i) 
achieve and maintain balanced provincial public sector budgets; (ii) decrease the 
ratio of provincial public sector personnel expenditures to provincial public sector 
net current revenues; (iii) maintain or decrease the ratio of provincial public sector 
debt stock to provincial public sector current revenues; (iv) not incur debt to 
finance provincial public sector current expenditures except under certain limited 
circumstances; (v) in general improve their provincial public sector fiscal, 
financial, accounting and budgetary discipline in a manner consistent with their 
constitutions; (vi) participate in the National Public Investment System (Sistema 
Nacional de Inversión Pública); and (vii) in a manner consistent with national 
policies, achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness with regard to provincial 
public expenditures, particularly in the health and education sectors, all in an 
effort to widen the scope and increase the quality of provincial participation in said 
sectors for the benefit of underprivileged segments of the population;

Actions Referred to in Section 2.02 (d) (ii) (C) of this Agreement
Public Finances
1.
The Province has attained, for the period covered by any three continuous months 
among the seven months immediately preceding the Second Tranche Release Date, a 
provincial public sector current account surplus of at least $2.5 million equivalent.  
For purposes of this Schedule:

allocated as part of the annual consolidated provincial budgets approved by the 
Province’s legislature; and
(b)
"current account surplus" means the amount by which provincial public 
sector current revenues (i.e., (i) revenues from taxes; (ii) non-tax revenues from the

revenue-sharing transfers (fondos de coparticipación; excluding those from Fondo 
Nacional de la Vivienda, from Fondo Especial de Desarrollo Eléctrico del Interior and 
for the financing of public works expenditures)) exceeds the amount of provincial 
public sector current expenditures (i.e., expenditures incurred for payment of 
personnel, expenditures incurred for the production of public sector goods and 
services, expenditures incurred for interest on public sector debts and transfers for 
which there is no consideration, but excluding severance payments made to personnel 
departing from the provincial public sector).
2.
The Province has attained and maintained a level of provincial public sector 
staff positions that is at least 1140 positions lower than the total number of such 
positions budgeted for fiscal year 1997.  For purposes of this paragraph, "provincial 
public sector" has the same meaning as set forth in paragraph 1 (a) of this Schedule, 
except it also includes personnel from components of the provincial (non-municipal) 
public sector for which funding is allocated as part of the annual non-consolidated 
budgets approved by the Province’s legislature.
3.
The Province has put into effect a provincial tax structure simplification, with

5.
The Province has: (a) had the execution of its provincial public sector 
consolidated budget, for the latest fiscal year to conclude no less than six months 
prior to the Second Tranche Release Date, audited by its Tribunal de Cuentas or by 
external, independent and qualified auditors; and (b) made the reports of its Tribunal 
de Cuentas or of such auditors on said audits, as well as any such reports for 
subsequent completed fiscal years, publicly available.
Public Education Sector
6.
The Province has attained, for the period covered by the first twelve of the 
thirteen months immediately preceding the Second Tranche Release Date, a level of 
provincial public education sector personnel salary and benefits expenditures equal to 
no more than 96.5% of provincial public education sector expenditures.  For purposes 
of this Schedule, "provincial public education sector expenditures" means those of the 
Province’s Ministry of Education, as well as those incurred for public school works 
and maintenance.
7.
The Province’s executive branch has presented to the Province’s legislature for 
approval, for each fiscal year beginning after the Effective Date (up to and including

Page  10
(a)
make available for use in the provincial public education sector an 
annual amount equivalent, in real terms, to at least the annual amount budgeted for 
said sector for fiscal year 1996 (or equivalent to at least $146 million, whichever is 
higher);
(b)
allow savings, of amounts originally budgeted by the legislature for 
provincial public education sector personnel salary and benefits expenditures, to be 
used to cover investment costs in said sector; and
(c)
during the fiscal years covered by said budgets, maintain availability 
for use in the provincial public education sector of all funds budgeted for said 
sector, without permitting that such funds be transferred for use in other sectors,

current expenditure line items and without in any other manner permitting that such 
funds be unavailable whenever the time comes to make actual payment for budgeted 
items.
8.
The Province has put into effect and is implementing a new formula for awarding 
provincial public subsidies to private schools in the Province.
9.
The Province has permanently reduced to no more than seven the number of teacher 
training institutes (Institutos de Formación Docente) it administers and to no more 
than six the number of technical institutes (Institutos de Tecnicatura) it 
administers, so that there are generated a reduction of at least 50 institute faculty 
position in aggregate, or at least 700 institute faculty man hours per year, as a 
result.
10.
The Province has attained and thereafter maintained a student to teacher 
(including teachers holding permanent and temporary staff positions) ratio of no less 
than 17:1 for public primary schools (grades 1-6).
11.
The Province has established an incentives fund to provide financing, awarded on 
a competitive basis, to support innovative public school reform pilot subprojects that 
are proposed by provincial public secondary and polymodal schools (escuelas de 
educación general básica/tercer ciclo y polimodales).
12.
The Province has hired a firm to monitor and control public school teacher sick 
leave, and thus begun implementation of more stringent public school teacher sick 
leave rules.
