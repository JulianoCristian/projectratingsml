   Project aims at furthering the capacity of the Government to\n            prepare and implement the second phase of its reform program\n            started under the Economic Recovery Credit. It will support\n            the divestiture of public enterprises, introduce a\n            competitive environment in the utility and petroleum sectors\n            and facilitate private sector development. More\n            specifically, the project will: help the Government prepare\n            regulatory frameworks for the five major public enterprises\n            in control of petroleum distribution, transportation,\n            telecummunications, power and water distribution and open\n            the sectors up to competition progressively; conduct the\n            privatization of these major public enterprises; liquidate\n            other non-viable public enterprises; and support regulation\n            and competition in the financial sector and reforms in\n            banking institutions. To achieve this objective the project\n            comprises the following four components: 1) a regulation and\n            privatization component whereby consulting services will be\n            provided to prepare pro-competition regulatory frameworks\n            and build a minimal level of public sector capacity to\n            regulate the major utilities, as well as to advise the\n            Government on privatization of the five concerned public\n            enterprises; 2) a public enterprise sector liquidation in\n            which assistance will be provided to liquidate all\n            non-viable enterprises; 3) reform of financial institutions\n            and the public sector which will finance the development of\n            proposals for restructuring the financial sector; and 4) a\n            communications campaign which will finance a public\n            information campaign to inform stakeholders and the public\n            of the benefits and implications of the reform program."}, "docdt": "1995-07-25T00:00:00Z"}
