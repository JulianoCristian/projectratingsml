However, sustainability is likely over time,\n            due to the continuing Government's efforts to complete\n            transactions, and pursue formal, and informal international\n            assistance. The key lessons suggest that, while project\n            objectives were ambitious, given the political instability,\n            the Bank could have adopted monitoring indicators on project\n            activities to access a more explicit exit strategy, instead\n            of the implicit suspension, and cancellation threats, which\n            were in fact used. Therefore, an independent analysis of the\n            political environment, in a country where instability risks\n            the success of an operation, would be worth considering\n            prior to negotiations. The report questions the\n            implementation of significant reforms, where hostilities\n            hinder not only reform sustainability, but the process of\n            privatization itself. It also reveals the risk factor of\n            multiple project components, whose main objectives -\n            regulatory framework, privatization, and liquidation - did\n            not require financial institutions/public sector components\n            to support reform, (despite its complementing attributes to\n            a macro program); instead, the number of public enterprises\n            should have been minimal. However, the participatory process\n            demonstrated the local capacity to promote competition, and privatization."}, "docdt": "2000-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
