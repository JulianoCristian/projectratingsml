                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's objective is to assist the Government in improving living conditions by strengthening the socio-economic situation in key urban centers and in two
                         isolated areas - i.e.: (i) improving delivery of basic services in provincial capitals and key medium urban centers; and (ii) restoring key transport links to
                         reconnect tow isolated regions.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite the very difficult implementation environment of the project, its impact is visible on the ground. Thanks to the activities carried out, 20,875 pupils have seen their learning
                         conditions improved compared to an objective of 20,000 pupils. Under the health sector, 720,000 inhabitants have better access to the health centers rehabilitated by the project,

                         compared to an objective of 580,000 inhabitants. 60,000 inhabitants in urban areas are provided with access to 'Improved Water Sources' under the Project compared to an objective
                         of 70,000 inhabitants, while 95,000 inhabitants have access to improved latrines constructed under the project. Despite the fact that the road component was closed following the
                         project restructuring due mainly to the poor performance of contractors, the reopening of roads in the Equateur Province contributed to facilitating the transportation of goods and
                         passengers. 1,890,000 people who were secluded for several years now have better access to the rest of the country and the average travel time in the targeted areas has been
