and (ii) restoring key\n            transport links to reconnect two isolated regions. The main\n            reason for the restructuring is to modify the scope and\n            design of the project by closing component C, with a current\n            disbursement rate of 92 percent, and component D, which\n            remains undisbursed as most of the activities were financed\n            by the Government and the provinces and the remaining will\n            be financed by the donors.  The unused funds will be\n            reallocated for use under components A and B to ensure that\n            the Project Development Objective (PDO) can be achieved by\n            the new completion date of September 30, 2011. The changes\n            will not have a major effect on the original economic and\n            social aspects of the project."}, "docdt": "2010-07-27T00:00:00Z"}
