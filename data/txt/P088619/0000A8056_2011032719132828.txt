                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's objective is to assist the Government in improving living conditions by strengthening the socio-economic situation in key urban centers and in two
                         isolated areas - i.e.: (i) improving delivery of basic services in provincial capitals and key medium urban centers; and (ii) restoring key transport links to
                         reconnect two isolated regions.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
