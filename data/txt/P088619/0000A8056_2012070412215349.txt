                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's objective is to assist the Government in improving living conditions by strengthening the socio-economic situation in key urban centers and in two isolated
                         areas - i.e.: (i) improving delivery of basic services in provincial capitals and key medium urban centers; and (ii) restoring key transport links to reconnect tow isolated
                         regions.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was implemented in a relatively difficult environment characterized by: (i) huge logistical problems encountered in moving heavy equipment, and acquiring goods and
                         construction materials; (ii) the remote location of project sites (some accessible only by air), size of the country, geographic spread of subprojects and lack of passable roads; (iii)

                         weak supervisory capacity from executing agencies in managing big contracts; (iv) cost overruns due to the lack of detailed technical studies as a result of the poor security
                         conditions prevailing in the country during project preparation; (v) weak capacity in civil engineering activities; (vi) Insecurity that persisted in the reunified provinces until January,
                         2009. Despite this context, the project achieved its objectives as stated in the financing agreement. All six PDO indicators have been largely met.

                         PDO Indicators 1: Pupils with access to improved school facilities: The number of pupils that benefited from increased school facilities is 20,875 compared to an objective of 20,000
                         pupils.
                         PDO Indicators 2: People with access to a basic package of health, nutrition, or population services: 720,000 inhabitants have better access to the health centers rehabilitated by the
                         project, compared to an objective of 740,000 inhabitants.
                         PDO Indicators 3: 67,000 inhabitants in urban areas are provided with access to 'Improved Water Sources' under the Project compared to an objective of 70,000 inhabitants. The
                         objective will be surpassed if we take into account water activities transferred from PUSPRES to PUAACV which will enable 45,000 people to have access to clean water in Bukavu,
                         Goma and Kindu.
                         PDO Indicators 4: Reduced travel time in two isolated areas: despite the fact that the road component was closed following the project restructuring due mainly to the poor
                         performance of contractors, the reopening of roads in the Equateur Province contributed to facilitating the transportation of goods and passengers. Before the works, the roads were
                         closed to traffic and it took 60 hours to cover 110 km, currently it only takes 3 hours.
                         PDO Indicators 5: 1,891,932 people (representing 22% of the rural population in the targeted areas) who were secluded for several years now have better access to the rest of the
                         country and the average travel time in the targeted areas has been drastically reduced.
                         PDO Indicators 6: direct Project Beneficiaries: 2,983,365 people have benefited from the project compared to a target of 2,980,000.
