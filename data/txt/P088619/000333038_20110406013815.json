assist the\n            Government in improving living conditions by strengthening\n            the socio economic situation in key urban centers and in two\n            isolated areas i.e.: (i) improving delivery of basic\n            services in provincial capitals and key medium urban\n            centers; and (ii) restoring key transport links to reconnect\n            two isolated regions. The project was restructured in 2010\n            and extended for one (1) year to modify the scope and design\n            and allow the completion of the activities. The main reason\n            for the restructuring is to respond to the changing client\n            needs, whereby certain activities are no longer a priority\n            for the Government of DRC, which requested the Bank to focus\n            on a set of key activities under PUSPRES (Projet\n            d'urgence du Soutien au Processus de Reunification\n            Economique et Sociale - Emergency Economic and Social\n            Reunification Project)) that face a financing gap. A\n            recommendation was made during the April 2010 supervision\n            mission to prepare an additional financing to fill the\n            financing gap. The additional financing option could not be\n            pursued because of lack of International Development\n            Association (IDA) funding. Subsequently, other options were\n            explored, and the option of using the ongoing PUAACV (Projet\n            d'urgence d'appui a l'amelioration des\n            conditions de vie - Emergency Living Conditions Improvement\n            Support Project) to finance the remaining activities was retained."}, "docdt": "2011-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
