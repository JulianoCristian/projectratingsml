"Ratings for the Emergency Living\n            Conditions Improvement Support Project for the Congo,\n            Democratic Republic of were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            high, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: design of an emergency\n            project needs to balance many competing and sometimes\n            opposed objectives in an unpredictable environment with\n            shortage of information, and hence flexibility underpins\n            success. Capacity constraints should be addressed up-front\n            and from many angles. Sustainability should be built in from\n            the design phase, but addressed on an ongoing basis.\n            Restructuring should be pro-actively used to mitigate design\n            shortcomings that are likely to surface during\n            implementation given appraisal difficulties, and to adapt to\n            changing circumstances."}, "docdt": "2012-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
