                         The Mongolian Global Partnership for Education Early Childhood Education Project is financed by the international donor community and administered by the World Bank. Mongolia
                         was approved by the GPE Board of Directors to receive a Catalytic Fund Grant of US$10 million to cover the period from 2012 to 2014. The project became effective on March 6,
                         2012. Overall implementation focuses on the construction of fixed kindergartens and the provision of mobile ger-kindergartens for nomadic families. To date, there has been
                         significant physical progress at all construction sites since the construction season began in March 2014. All kindergartens are expected to be finished this construction season.
