Early Childhood Education Project for\n            Mongolia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Grantee\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: project designs should be simple when they\n            have short implementation periods. The ECE project\n            implementation period was shorter than the normal three year\n            period for most GPE-supported projects. The preparation team\n            designed a project that was simple and fit into the two year\n            time constraints. Although the project design was simple and\n            the approval process for the new wood framed construction\n            had begun prior to effectiveness, the 15 month delay in\n            approving the kindergarten designs was a key contributor to\n            the implementation delays. A strong project implementation\n            team must remain in place throughout project implementation.\n            Key positions were replaced shortly after implementation due\n            to changes in the government which also contributed to\n            project implementation delays. These delays along with the\n            short implementation period, contributed to the project\n            implementation challenges. Surveys included in project\n            designs are valuable tools for assessing impact of project\n            interventions. The parent satisfaction survey was important\n            for understanding the significant role that mobile\n            kindergartens play in preparing children ages 2-5 for\n            primary school."}, "docdt": "2015-12-09T22:40:02Z"}
