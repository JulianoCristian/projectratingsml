                         kindergartens is expected to be completed by June 1, 2014. However, the construction of two fixed kindergartens has been delayed and although work has begun, they will not be
                         completed by the current project closing date, undermining the project’s ability to fully meet its objective. As per the recent request of the Ministry of Finance, a project extension of 12
