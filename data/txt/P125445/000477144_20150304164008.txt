A. Summary of Proposed Changes
The purpose of this Restructuring Paper is to: (i) reallocate the Grant Proceeds; (ii) amend the
project description in the Financing Agreement; and (iii) adjust the results framework indicators
and targets to facilitate measuring progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective
(PDO).

The first change is made in response to a request to reallocate grant proceeds received from the
Mongolian Ministry of Finance in a letter dated January 10, 2015. The recent depreciation of the
local currency, the Tugrik, has resulted in significant project savings. This has enhanced the
project’s ability to support more activities to help improve the quality of early childhood
education in Mongolia. Reallocations of the savings in Category 1 (Civil Works) will be made to
Category 2 (Goods), Category 3 (Consultants’ Services) and Category 4 (Operating Costs) to
realize these positive spillovers and to facilitate additional project management expenses required
due to the one-year extension of the closing date that was approved June 9, 2014. The proposed
changes to the reallocations across expenditure categories have been discussed and agreed with
the responsible implementing agency during the course of project supervision.

The second and third changes listed above are made in response to a request received from the
Ministry of Finance dated November 20, 2012. These changes were previously approved by the
Bank through the first Country Director-approved restructuring of this project, and an amendment
letter dated January 23, 2013 was sent to the Recipient. However, the 2013 amendment letter has
not been countersigned by the Recipient and, therefore, has not become effective. The need for
the changes in project scope and the results framework remain applicable and are, therefore,
reflected in this restructuring.

No changes are proposed to the PDO, safeguards classification, institutional arrangements,
financing, financial management, or procurement arrangements.

B. Project Status
The Mongolian Global Partnership for Education (GPE) Early Childhood Education Project is
financed by the international donor community and administered by the World Bank. The
objective of the GPE is to provide financial assistance to help low- and middle-income countries
around the world achieve the Millennium Development Goal on education. Mongolia was
approved by the GPE Board of Directors to receive a Catalytic Fund Grant of US$10.0 million to
cover the period from 2012 to 2015, and the project became effective on March 6, 2012.

The PDO is to assist the recipient to cope with the surge in total fertility rates by providing access
to early childhood education for children in disadvantaged communities. The project components
support: (i) increasing kindergarten capacity in urban and peri-urban areas; (ii) creating
alternative pre-school classes in rural areas; and (iii) grant management and monitoring and
evaluation. The project was first restructured on January 23, 2013 to scale back its intended
activities in response to cost escalation of raw construction materials. However, the amendment
letter accompanying the 2013 restructuring has not been countersigned by the Recipient. The
project was restructured for a second time on June 9, 2014 to reallocate grant proceeds and to
extend the closing date to allow sufficient time for completing kindergarten construction that had
been delayed due to severe winter weather conditions. The current restructuring is therefore the
third restructuring for this project.

To date, actual disbursement reached approximately US$8.86 million, equivalent to about 88
percent of total grant funds. Environmental safeguards compliance has been satisfactory. There
are no financial management issues at the project level, nor any outstanding audit reports. There
has been significant physical progress at all kindergarten construction sites since the construction
season began in March 2014. Most recently, the project made significant savings of about US$1.6
million under Category 1 (Civil Works) and Category 2 (Goods) due to the depreciation of local
currency Tugrik.

rates by providing access to early childhood education for children in disadvantaged communities.
Change in Project's Development Objectives
Change in Results Framework
Explanation:
The changes to the results framework were originally approved in the first restructuring and have
been systematically tracked and monitored throughout project supervision. However, the changes
are included again in this restructuring as the first restructuring amendment was not countersigned
by the Recipient. The indicators were adjusted to reflect the change in project scope and facilitate
measuring progress toward achieving the PDO, including, to specify that attendance rates and
parental satisfaction rates will be tracked for the mobile ger kindergartens. Based on the changes
to the results framework, the PDO indicators in the legal agreement have been amended as
follows: (i) the gross enrollment rate of children aged 2 to 5 in the urban districts in Ulaanbaatar
where new kindergartens are provided (disaggregated by gender) will be tracked and the sub-
indicators tracking Aimag center gross enrollment rates are removed; (ii) the indicator tracking
the average daily attendance rates is modified to specify that attendance rates are tracked for the
mobile ger kindergartens; and (iii) the indicator tracking parental satisfaction of the early
childhood education services is modified to specify that parental satisfaction will be tracked for
the mobile ger kindergartens.

                                               Financing
Reallocations
Explanation:
The project has made significant savings of about US$1.6 million under Category 1 (Civil Works)
and Category 2 (Goods) due to the recent depreciation of Tugrik. This offers an opportunity for
the project to support more activities to assist the early childhood education subsector in
Mongolia as stated in the PDO. Moreover, the project extension realized under the second
restructuring necessitates some additional project management expenses, including the
appointment of a third party monitor and an additional project engineer. It is therefore proposed
that the excess funds under Category 1 (Civil Works) be moved to Category 2 (Goods), Category
3 (Consultants’ Services) and Category 4 (Operating Costs) to: supply additional learning
materials and equipment to kindergartens throughout the country; conduct some preliminary
policy research on teaching and learning practices in the early childhood education subsector; and
facilitate additional management costs and audit expenses. This reallocation does not affect the
expected results of the project or its timeline as outlined in the communication to the GPE Board.

Change to Components and Cost
Explanation:
This records the 2013 restructuring that proposed changes to Component 1 to reduce the number
of kindergartens to be built and supplied, and modify the component’s geographical focus. At the
time of project preparation, 37 kindergartens were planned to be built, 21 in Aimag centers and 16
in Ulaanbaatar. The costing of each kindergarten was done by using 2010-2011 Ministry and
CCU costing estimations. During 2012, prices for raw materials rapidly increased and distribution
costs increased due to the rising price of gasoline. Furthermore, the government’s benchmark
standard pricing for machinery increased three-fold, as a new material pricing directory became
effective under the order of the Ministry of Construction. As a result, the budget of the project
was no longer able to finance all 37 kindergartens. Instead, 17 kindergartens will be financed in
Ulaanbaatar using the GPE funds. The Project Description in the Financing Agreement has been
amended accordingly in line with the request received from the Ministry of Finance dated
November 20, 2012 and the understandings reached during the supervision mission on September
16 - 22, 2012 as recorded in the related management letter and aide memoire.
