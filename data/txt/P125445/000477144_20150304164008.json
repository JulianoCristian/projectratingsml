The first change is made in response to a\n            request to reallocate grant proceeds received from the\n            Mongolian Ministry of Finance. The recent depreciation of\n            the local currency, the Tugrik, has resulted in significant\n            project savings. This has enhanced the project\u0092s ability to\n            support more activities to help improve the quality of early\n            childhood education in Mongolia. Reallocations of the\n            savings in Category 1 (Civil Works) will be made to Category\n            2 (Goods), Category 3 (Consultants\u0092 Services) and Category 4\n            (Operating Costs) to realize these positive spillovers and\n            to facilitate additional project management expenses\n            required due to the one-year extension of the closing date.\n            The proposed changes to the reallocations across expenditure\n            categories have been discussed and agreed with the\n            responsible implementing agency during the course of project\n            supervision. The second and third changes listed above are\n            made in response to a request received from the Ministry of\n            Finance.
