Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Mongolian Global Partnership for Education Early Childhood Education Project is financed by the international donor community and administered
 by the World Bank. Mongolia was approved by the GPE Board of Directors to receive a Catalytic Fund Grant of US$10 million to cover the period from
 2012 to 2014. The project became effective on March 6, 2012. Overall implementation focuses on the construction of fixed kindergartens and the
 provision of mobile ger-kindergartens for nomadic families. To date, there has been significant physical progress at all construction sites since the
 construction season began in March 2014 and many kindergartens are now operating. All kindergartens are expected to be finished this construction
 season. The project closing date was extended for 12 months to allow for the completion of the two kindergartens in Baganuur and support the project
 in fully meeting its development objective. A third party monitor has been retained to assist the Ministry of Education and Science with construction
 supervision.
