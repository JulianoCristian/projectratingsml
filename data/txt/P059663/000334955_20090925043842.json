This resettlement action\n            plan (RAP) provides the policy framework for compensation,\n            resettlement and rehabilitation of displaced persons, as a\n            result of project implementation, in compliance with the\n            country's legal and regulatory policies, and the\n            Bank's guidelines on resettlement. It is presented in 4\n            volumes: the Umbrella Report (V. 1) which provides the\n            general guidelines; RAP National Highway NH 37 (V. 2); RAP\n            National Highway NH 47 (V. 3); and, RAP National Highway NH\n            48 outlining the policy framework for each specific road\n            segment. Compensation payments will be awarded at\n            replacement costs, while land for land arrangements will be\n            made, unless replacement land is unavailable, or, at the\n            informed request of the displaced person (DP), cash\n            compensation may be provided. Different subsidy allowances\n            and other forms of assistance are also available to\n            different categories of DP. Severely affected DP will be\n            entitled to food aid, and/or training and income restoration\n            programs, available through the District Agricultural\n            Extension Office, and other relevant offices. Public\n            consultation should enhance an active participation in the\n            planning, and implementation of the RAP, being the\n            responsibility of the project management unit to implement a\n            public information campaign. Grievance mechanisms should be\n            addressed beginning with the Commune People's Committee\n            (PC), to be followed if needed, subsequently at the district\n            PC, the provincial PC, and finally at the district peoples\n            court. External monitoring and evaluation will also verify\n            that complaints have been resolved appropriately in\n            accordance with the RAP policy framework. Additionally, the\n            project includes both internal, and external monitoring and\n            evaluation measures, focusing on social impacts of the\n            project, and whether the DP have improved, or at least\n            maintained their living standards, income earning capacity,\n            and production levels."}, "docdt": "2006-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
