                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is meeting most of its development objectives. Nearly 850km of maintenance under Network Preservation Program will be completed through three annual work plans,
                         including 302km of on-going maintenance through a pilot program for performance-based contracting (PBC). About 285 km of rehabilitation and widening work planned under the
                         Network Improvement Program is largely complete. These investments have reduced average road roughness on project roads to nearly meet targeted levels, and reduced travel

                         times on project roads by an aggregate 10 percent. Furthermore, non-state sector involvement in execution of maintenance regimes has increased, with more than 90 percent of the
                         contracts tendered under this project being awarded to private firms.

                         The Advisory Group for Road Maintenance and Management (AGRMM) was established in 2009 to support development of the legal framework for a Road Maintenance Fund. In
                         2010, the mechanism for establishing a Road Fund was successfully included in the revised Road Code. Lastly, a key piece of technical assistance on institutional frameworks for
                         Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) in the road sector has been completed, providing a foundation for on-going preparation of PPP pilots in expressways. Five of six technical audits
                         have been conducted to evaluate project impacts and quality of construction.The Credit has also supported future project preparation (Vietnam Road Safety Project), and a second
                         technical assistance for detailed engineering designs of the Danang-Quang Ngai Expressway is on-going.

                         The Bank and the Borrower will be preparing Implementation Completion and Results Reports.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project was restructured in August 2011 to: (i) include Project Management Unit 85 (PMU 85), PMU 6, and the Vietnam Expressway Corporation (VEC) as Project Implementing
                         Agencies (PIAs); (ii) reallocate Credit proceeds to meet commitments; and (iii) formally revise key performance indicators and targets. The Credit is scheduled to close on March 31,
                         2012. The Borrower has indicated that they will propose to cancel approximately US$25 million equivalent that will not be disbursed.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
                         There are no related projects.
