                                    Executive Summary
A.     THE ROAD NETWORK IMPROVEMENT PROJECT

The overall development objective of the Road Network Improvement Project (RNIP) is to
improve the national road network through increased preventative maintenance and selective
upgrading and an increase in the level of resources available for road maintenance and
capacity for planning, budgeting and monitoring of road assets.

The Network Improvement Project (NIP) includes the rehabilitation and strategic upgrading
of approximately 550 kilometres of national roads over a three-year period.

In accordance with the requirements of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) the
adverse impacts on project-affected people and ethnic minorities associated with
implementation of NIP must be addressed within the Policy Framework for Compensation,
Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Displaced Persons and Policy Framework and Guidelines
for Ethnic Minorities Development Plan as approved by the MoT and Prime Minister.

B.      THE NIP SUB-PROJECTS

The second year annual works program (AWP2) of the NIP covers sections of six national
highways with a total length of about 243 km. These sub-projects are as follows:
                                                                                     Length

        culverts and construction of pipe side drains with side entry pits,

     o Installation of road fixtures such as guardrails, line marking, guideposts, signs and
       kilometre posts.

C.     SUB-PROJECT IMPACTS

The Feasibility Studies evidenced each sub-project to be economically, socially and
environmentally feasible. Any adverse environmental or social impacts identified at the
Feasibility Stage were determined to be able to be adequately managed within the scope of
the RAP (this document) and the Environmental Management Plan (EMP).

The critical impact of the sub-projects identified during the Feasibility Studies was the
temporary and permanent resettlement caused by construction of the civil works.

D.     SCOPE OF RAP

The RAP addresses households adversely impacted by NIP implementation and is in keeping
with the project Policy Framework reflecting both existing Vietnamese laws and Work Bank
policy, particularly the Operational Policy (OP) 4.12.

This RAP aims to ensure that all Displaced Persons (DPs) receive a fair market price for land,
structures and private assets needed for, or otherwise damaged by, project activities.
Furthermore, cases where asset loss is deemed severe, measures are prescribed to provide
relocation services and economic rehabilitation assistance for adversely affected households.

Determination of DP-level compensation and entitlements is based on the Policy Framework.
The RAP provides some clarification on the concepts of Eligibility, Legal Framework, and
Compensation and Entitlement Policy, central to resettlement policy associated with this sub-
project.

E.     ELIGIBILITY

As defined in the Policy Framework, any person, persons, household, firm or private or public
institution who experiences direct economic or social impacts caused by the implementation
of the NIP sub-projects, resulting in the involuntary taking of land or involuntary restriction
of access either temporarily or permanently, will be eligible for compensation or other
rehabilitation measures outlined in the RAP.

The cut off date for eligibility is the last day of the Detailed Measurement Survey (DMS) for
each sub-project.

F.     LEGAL FRAMEWORK

The legal framework for NIP is defined by the Policy Framework. The World Bank
Operational Policy OP4.12 is the primary legal document for resettlement, compensation and
rehabilitation.

To comply with OP4.12, GOV has agreed to waive:

     o Decree No. 172/1999/CP for DPs without legal or legalizable rights over affected
       assets;

     o Articles 7, 8, 16, 17, 18 and 25 of Decree No. 22/1998/ND-CP on land compensation
       and resettlement. (Note that Decree No. 197/2004/ND-CP has superseded Decree No.
       22/1998/ND-CP, however Article 1 of Decree No. 197/2004/ND-CP indicates that
       International Treaty associated with Official Development Aid (ODA) shall have
       precedence, hence the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) and Policy Framework
       remain the binding legal document for NIP AWP2 and AWP3 sub-projects); and

     o Decree No. 87/1994/CP for maximum and minimum prices for compensation of
       different categories of land.

The Policy Framework for Land Acquisition, Compensation and Resettlement for NIP has
been approved by the Ministry of Transport (MoT) under Decision No. 3208/QD.BGTVT
dated 30 October 2003 to be applied by all participating provinces under the project.

The Land Clearance Limits are defined for NIP roads in accordance with MOT Decisions
592/1999/QD-GTVT and 3037/QD-GTVT. The Road Safety Corridor for AWP2 and AWP3
roads is defined by Government Decree 186/2004/ND-CP, Articles 13 to 22.

The Provincial People's Committee (PPC) of Hai Duong and Hung Yen provinces have
released Decision No. 56/2005/QD-UB and Decision No. 5789/2004/QD-UB to give
appropriate prices of compensation and resettlement assistance.

G.     COMPENSATION AND ENTITLEMENT POLICY

Based on the principle objectives of the Policy Framework, all DP's will be compensated for
their losses at replacement cost and provided with other assistance and rehabilitation measures
to assist them to improve, or at least maintain, their pre-project living standards and income
earning capacity.

To meet the Bank's strategy of restoring their social and economic base DPs will require at
least the following:

     o compensation for lost assets and incomes;

     o transfer and relocation assistance, and

     o help to rehabilitate and restore their livelihoods.

Compensation at market rates will only be adequate when neither livelihood nor housing is
affected.

The Entitlement Policy will follow the requirements of Section (E) of the Policy Framework
for Compensation, Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Displaced Persons.

H.     INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS

In accordance with the Policy Framework, Project Management Unit 18 (PMU18) under MoT
is responsible for the enforcement of the Policy Framework and implementation of
Resettlement Plans (RPs). Compensation Committees will be established at provincial and
district level to assist PMU18 in all activities related to the RAPs.

I.     PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND CONSULTATION

According to World Bank guidelines, DPs are to be informed and consulted to enable their
active participation in the planning and implementation of this RAP. DPs have participated
throughout the various stages of the planning and implementation of the inventory and
resettlement plan.

During resettlement planning and RAP preparation activities, land demarcation and a detailed
measurement survey (DMS) of affected assets was undertaken. In the course of the DMS,
each DP household was fully informed by the PMU18 through District People's Committees
and Communes People's Committees of their compensation entitlements and rehabilitation
choices.

During the implementation of resettlement and rehabilitation activities further information
dissemination and consultation will be undertaken with the DPs regarding resettlement
policies and procedures, calculation and payment of compensation, clearance from the project
area, and civil works.

PMU18, in collaboration with PCCs of Hung Yen and Hai Duong provinces, DCC of Phu Cu,
Hung Yen and Tien Lu Districts, and Communes PCs have completed the initial DMS and
will be responsible for the implementation of the remainder of this programme.

J.     COMPLAINTS AND GRIEVANCES

The Policy Framework provides timeframes and procedures for addressing complaints and
grievances as follows:

     o DPs may address grievances and complaints at any time, beginning with the
       Commune People's Committee (PC).

     o If the DP is unsatisfied with the decision or the Commune PC is unable to resolve the
       issue, then the DP may refer to the District PC, then Provincial PC, and finally the
       District People's Court.

External monitoring and evaluation will verify that complaints by DPs have been resolved
appropriately and in accordance with the RAP and Policy Framework.

K.     MONITORING AND EVALUATION

The NIP will include both internal and external monitoring and evaluation.

PMU18 is responsible for the internal monitoring and supervision of the RPs for each sub-
project through the District and Provincial Compensation Committees. The findings of the
internal supervision and monitoring will be recorded in a quarterly report to be submitted to
GoV.

Internal monitoring and supervision will include: verification of baseline information;
overseeing that RP's are implemented; verification that funds are dispersed; and record
grievances and their resolution.

An independent agency has been retained to carry out external monitoring and evaluation of

the implementation of the RPs. External monitoring and evaluation involves verification of
the internal supervision and monitoring quarterly reports and 10% sampling of relevant DPs
every six (6) months.

L.    ROAD IMPROVEMENT FOR NATIONAL HIGHWAY 38B

The NIP section of NH38B is situated in Hai Duong and Hung Yen Provinces, located in
Northern Vietnam. The sub-project road section traverses a flat area of coastal plain
characteristically of irrigated rice fields and some urban areas. The road alignment is
generally flat and straight on a low embankment that ranges between 1 and 3 metres in height.
The existing width of the road is from 5 to 8 metres with rough pavement and uneven edges.
Proposed improvement measures for the sub-project include widening of the road formation
and paving with asphalt concrete materials. All resettlement issues associated with
improvement works will follow the guidelines laid out in the Policy Framework and the
Umbrella Report of the RAP of the NIP.

M.    SUB-PROJECT IMPACTS AND ENTITLEMENTS

A total of 3,344 households will be affected by the Sub-project. Of these households, 953
households have agricultural holdings that will be impacted by the project of which 64 will be
severely impacted. 2,385 households have residential holdings that will be impacted by the
project of which 248 households will be severely impacted.

Nearly 100% of partially affected DP households have requested the opportunity to reorganise
their structures on the same site if the remaining land is sufficient for rearrangement. Where
this is not possible a nearby location will be negotiated with District and Commune People's
Committee.

N.   RESETTLEMENT COSTS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Resettlement costs cover both compensation for damages and/or losses to physical assets,
entitlement payments for households with specific circumstances and additional costs for
administration, monitoring and evaluation. Compensation costs were estimated at the district
level, based on the official rates provided to the project by the PPC Hai Duong and Hung Yen.

The total estimated resettlement cost for NH38B is VND 367,296,496,406 (equal to USD
23,173,281)

Implementation of the RAP will occur over a period of 6 (six) months. Implementation of
income rehabilitation assistance will continue for some time afterwards, depending on the
scale and nature of these programmes as identified by the eligible households. Based on the
information available in September 2006, it is expected that civil works will start in the first
quarter 2007, which would require resettlement to begin immediately.

1     INTRODUCTION

1.1   The Project

The Government of Vietnam has received a credit from World Bank to assist with the
implementation of a Network Improvement Program (NIP) which includes the rehabilitation
and upgrading of about 550 km of national roads over a five year period. The road works
have been packaged into three annual work programs (AWP's) as shown in Table 1-1.

                           Table 1-1 - NIP Annual Works Programs

       Work Plan      No of Roads     Approx. Length          Construction Period

        AWP 1              5              124 km                 2005 - 2006

        AWP 2              8              243 km                 2006 - 2007

        AWP 3              6              187 km                 2007 - 2008



This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) provides the social-economic information and analysis
required to meet the requirements of the Government of Vietnam (GoV) and World Bank
(WB) within the Policy Framework for Compensation, Resettlement and Rehabilitation of
Displaced Persons.

1.2   Project Area

As depicted in Figure 1-1 and outlined in Table 1-2, the project area for improvement works
falls in the Northern provinces of Vietnam; primarily in the Red River Delta and in the
Northern Highlands.

Table 1-2 shows the current list of project roads. The stages of development of the various
project roads are as follows:

·      The AWP1 roads have been completed to the stage of Detailed Design by the previous
       Consultant (5 roads).

·      The shaded roads in AWP2 and AWP3 have undergone screening and feasibility study
       to determine their feasibility based on full engineering, economic, social, and
       environmental analysis (7 roads).

·      The AWP2 and AWP3 roads all require Detailed Design, Environmental Management
       Plans (EMP) and Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) (14 roads).

1.3   Responsibility

The Ministry of Transportation (MOT) has responsibility for the execution and coordination
of the RNIP. Project Management Unit 18 (PMU18) is responsible for all procurement and
civil works activities related to NIP. The responsibility for implementing the Policy
Framework and planning and implementing the RP's rests with PMU18.

1.5   Scope of Works

The Works involve the upgrading and rehabilitation of NH38B between Hai Duong
(KM1+000) and Hung Yen (KM49+679), Vuong (KM 28+907) to Trieu Duong Bridge (KM
34+837) to Class III standard. The total length of the project is 54.33 km. Within this length,
there are three (3) long bridges (> 25m long) to be constructed under separate construction
packages. The total length of these bridges and their approach roads is 5.01km. The total
length of road to be constructed under this project is 49.32 km.

The Policy Framework also applies to contemporaneously planned projects, which includes
the long bridges contracts, NH38 and NH39 upgrading projects in Hung Yen town and Hung
Yen urban development works, all financed by domestic funds. The total DPs resulting from
these projects in Hung Yen town is 1300, of which this NH38B project severely impacts 106.

Only one policy (the World Bank Policy Framework) will be applied along the NIP roads and
the clearance and compensation adjacent to the long bridges will be carried out at the same
time and using the same policy as the rest of the road. The clearance and compensation
adjacent to the contemporaneously planned projects identified above are already under
process in Hung Yen.

1.6   Documentation of Resettlement Issues

in Hai Duong and Hung Yen provinces are adequately compensated for any project-related
acquisition of assets and that sufficient measures are taken to assist the DP's. This RAP is
based on:

   o Policy Framework for Compensation, Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Displaced
     Persons (August, 2003)

   o Umbrella RAP for NIP (August, 2003)

   o Terms of Reference for Consultancy Services, Clauses 6.9, 6.10 and 6.11

As a minimum, each sub-project in AWP2 and AWP3 has an Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) (this document) prepared to mitigate
negative socio-environmental impacts resulting from the civil works.

One Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was prepared to supplement the Programmatic
Environmental Impact Assessment (PEIA) and covers the regions and roads included in
AWP2 and AWP3 not previously covered in the PEIA. Ethnic Minority Development Plans
(EMDPs) have been developed where necessary.

2.2       Resettlement Issues

With few exceptions, population distribution is characteristically ribbon development along
both sides of project roads. Many houses are built behind smaller structures fronting the
existing road which are used for commercial purposes. These include filling stations and
garages, retail outlets, garden centres, brick makers, timber yards and many other small
industrial and commercial interests.

The Policy Framework lays down the principles and objectives, eligibility criteria of DPs,
entitlements, legal and institutional framework, modes of compensation and rehabilitation,
peoples' participation features and grievance procedure that will guide the compensation,
resettlement, and rehabilitation of DPs. The Policy Framework and its provisions also applies
to other recently completed, ongoing, or contemporaneously planned projects or development
activities, regardless of source of funding, which are directly and significantly related to the
NIP subcomponents and are necessary to achieve its stated objectives.

A fundamental principle of World Bank policy is to minimize resettlement. Hence, the
Consultant, based on dialogue with all stakeholders, has examined all available design options
for the final design of sub-projects to avoid or, where that is not possible, to minimize land
acquisition, displacement and other adverse social impacts.

Typically the measures taken to minimise land acquisition during the design of the sub-
projects has included:

      ·    Road alignment design which avoids all structures to the greatest extent possible.

      ·    Reduction in design standards at critical sections to avoid unnecessary land acquisition.

      ·    Realignments and bypasses of densely populated areas where the cost of
           compensation for land and structures was greater than the cost of the bypass
           construction.

      ·    Reduction of Site Clearance width in urban areas.

MOT decision 3385/QD-BGTVT dated 14 September 2005 approved the alignment of
NH38B based on consideration of the above issues and the requirements of PPC Hai Duong,
PPC Hung Yen and TCQM.

2.3      Sub-Project Impacts

The Feasibility Studies evidenced each sub-project to be economically, socially and
environmentally feasible. Any adverse environmental or social impacts identified at the
Feasibility Stage were determined to be able to be adequately managed within the scope of
the RAP (this document) and the Environmental Management Plan (EMP).

The critical impact of the sub-projects identified during the Feasibility Studies was the
temporary and permanent resettlement caused by construction of the civil works.

2.4      Scope of Resettlement Action Planning

The RAP addresses households adversely impacted by NIP implementation and is in keeping
with the project Policy Framework reflecting both existing Vietnamese laws and Work Bank
policy, particularly the Operational Policy (OP) 4.12.         Determination of DP-level
compensation and entitlements is based on the Policy Framework.

This RAP aims to ensure that all Displaced Persons (DPs) receive a fair market price for land,
structures and private assets needed for, or otherwise damaged by, project activities.
Furthermore, cases where asset loss is deemed severe, measures are prescribed to provide
relocation services and economic rehabilitation assistance for adversely affected households.

The Land Clearance Limits are defined for NIP roads in accordance with MOT Decisions
592/1999/QD-GTVT and 3037/QD-GTVT. The Road Safety Corridor for AWP2 and AWP3
roads is defined by Government Decree 186/2004/ND-CP, Articles 13 to 22.

The required offsets from the road formation1 for Land Clearance and for the Road Safety
Corridor are shown in Table 2-2. The Land Clearance Limits are depicted in Figure 2-1.

3     ELIGIBILITY & DEFINITIONS

The Policy Framework provides the Eligibility and Definitions relevant to the preparation and
implementation of Resettlement Action Plans for the Road Network Improvement Project.

3.1   Definitions

Displaced Persons (DPs) are people who at the date of the initial detailed measurement/census
survey (DMS) are located within the project area of NH 38B and who due to a change in land
tenure or water use, with or without the physical displacement of the DP, will have their:

(a)    (a) standard of living adversely affected; or

(b)    (b) right, title or interest on all or part of any house, land (including premises,
       agricultural and grazing land, annual or perennial crops and trees) or any other fixed or
       movable asset acquired or possessed temporarily or permanently; or

(c)    (c) business, occupation, place of work or residence or habitat adversely affected
       temporarily or permanently.

DP refers to an affected household and all members of that household and not to individuals.

3.2   Eligibility

Lack of legal rights to lost assets will not bar DPs from entitlement to compensation and
rehabilitation measures. Under Vietnamese law, people who use land or build structures
without permission to do so are not entitled to the same compensation as those who do have
such permissions. However, to ensure RAP objectives of restoring or improving living
standards, income earning capacity and production levels of DPs, the project will provide
them with assistance and rehabilitation entitlements and benefits.

An important aspect in this definition is that the term `resettlement' is not limited to the
physical relocation of people or households, but refers also to the displacement of their
economic circumstances and life survival strategies.

The RAP for NH 38B therefore includes developing procedures for establishing eligibility for
resettlement assistance, conducting socio-economic surveys and legal analyses, carrying out
public consultation, evaluating options for income restoration.

4   LEGAL FRAMEWORK

The Policy Framework specifies the Legal Framework for the preparation and implementation
of Resettlement Action Plans for the Road Network Improvement Project. The resettlement
and rehabilitation plan described in this RAP has been designed in accordance with the laws
of the Government of Viet Nam and the provisions of the World Bank's Operational Policy
4.12 (LBI, August 2003).

The Policy Framework for Land Acquisition, Compensation and Resettlement for NIP has
been approved by the Ministry of Transport (MoT) under Decision No. 3208/QD.BGTVT
dated 30 October 2003 to be applied by all participating provinces under the project.

Other key regulations and documents in relation to land acquisition and compensation, issued
by the Central Government and Provincial Government, include the following documents:

    o Decree 197/2004 ND-CP. Note that Decree No. 197/2004/ND-CP has superseded
      Decree No. 22/1998/ND-CP (referenced in the Policy Framework), however Article 1
      of Decree No. 197/2004/ND-CP indicates that International Treaty associated with
      Official Development Aid (ODA) shall have precedence, hence the Development
      Credit Agreement (DCA) and Policy Framework remain the binding legal document
      for NIP AWP2 and AWP3 sub-projects;

    o Circular 116/2004 TT-BTC by the Ministry of Finance regarding the guidelines for
      implementing Decree 197;

    o The Land Clearance Limits are defined for NIP roads in accordance with MOT
      Decisions 592/1999/QD-GTVT and 3037/QD-GTVT. The Road Safety Corridor for
      AWP2 and AWP3 roads is defined by Government Decree 186/2004/ND-CP, Articles
      13 to 22.

    o Decision No. 56/2005 QD-UB and No.5789/2004/QD-UB on compensation prices
      issued by People's Committee of Hung Yen and Hai Duong provinces, respectively.

5     COMPENSATION AND ENTITLEMENT POLICY

The Policy Framework (LBI, August 2003) specifies the Compensation and Entitlement
Policy for the preparation and implementation of Resettlement Action Plans for the Road
Network Improvement Project.

The general policy and its components make provision for anticipated situations and to
possible situations that might arise due to land acquisition requirements for the project.

5.1       Principles and entitlements

The current legislation governing compensation, assistance, and resettlement on land
acquisition is Decision No.197/2004/ND-CP dated 3 December 2004. This Decision replaces
Decision No.22/1998/ND-CP enacted 24 April 1998 referenced in the Policy Framework.

Under Decision 197/2004/ND-CP those who lose in excess of 30% of their agricultural land,
requiring them to engage in some other income-earning activities, would be entitled to
economic rehabilitation assistance in the form of special skills training or other development
support to compensate for the loss of productive assets and/or their source of income.

However, to achieve the World Bank's objectives, the specific principles of the resettlement
policy will be applied:

      ·    DPs that: (a) lose more than 20% of their agricultural and commercial land; or (b) are
           left with remaining land which is not viable for continued use: will be considered as
           severely affected DPs and compensated for their lost assets, incomes, jobs and
           businesses at replacement cost. DPs will also be provided with appropriate
           development assistance in order to improve or at least restore their incomes and living
           standards to pre-project levels.

      ·    DPs affected by partial impact on their assets (i.e. partial loss of land or structures
           where the remaining assets are viable for continued use) will be entitled to
           compensation for the affected assets at full replacement cost.

7     PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND CONSULTATION

The Policy Framework outlines the mechanisms for Public Participation and Consultation
associated with the preparation and implementation of Resettlement Action Plans for the
Road Network Improvement Project.

There are two phases to the public information campaign and DP consultation:

Phase I: During resettlement planning and RAP preparation activities. This phase consisted of
         land demarcation and detailed measurement survey (DMS) of affected assets.

Phase II: During the implementation of resettlement and rehabilitation activities. This phase
         will consist of information dissemination and consultation regarding: resettlement
         policies and procedures, calculation and payment of compensation, clearance from
         the project area, and civil works.

PMU-18, in collaboration with PCC of Hai Duong and Hung Yen provinces, DCC of Phu Cu,
Tien Lu, Gia Loc, Thanh Mien Districts, Hung Yen town, and Communes PCs have
completed Phase I and will be responsible for the implementation of Phase II of this
programme.

7.1     Phase I: Consultation on Resettlement Planning and Preparation


7.1.1    Activity 1: Information dissemination by PMU18 to PDoT

PMU18 disseminated information and consulted with PDOT during May 2005. They were
given Project Pamphlets for distribution to the DPs. The information included the following:

      o Project description;

      o Resettlement policy framework;

      o The compensation policy for the project;

      o Entitlements under the resettlement policy framework;

      o DMS Survey requirements

7.1.2    Activity 2: Information dissemination by PDoT and consultation with district and
         local authorities.

Between May and September 2005, PDoT disseminated public information and consulted
with the Chairmen of District and Commune People's Committees.

7.1.3    Activity 3: Information dissemination and consultation with DPs.

In collaboration with district and commune officials, PDoT conducted the DMS on 100% of
DPs. The following items were explained to DPs:

      o Project description with reference to information manual,

      o Objectives and contents of DMS,

      o Documents required showing the legal status of land and house/or structure.

      o Requirement for cooperation and assistance from DPs and local authorities.

As provided for in the DMS, each DP was informed about their resettlement options (i.e.,
reorganization on remaining land, relocation to a resettlement site, or self-relocation). They
were also asked whether they preferred cash compensation, land-for-land exchange and/or
relocation.

7.2     Phase II: Information Campaign and Consultation during Resettlement
        Implementation

The following activities shall be undertaken after approval of the RAP (adapted from NIP
Umbrella RAP, LBI, 2003).

7.2.1    Activity 1: Information dissemination and training

PMU18, in collaboration with PCCs, will meet with DCCs and Commune PCs to inform them
about consultation meetings and workshops to be held in their respective areas, as well as
train them on basic policies and procedures for implementation of the RAP. DPs will be
invited to the consultation meetings and training workshops. The PCCs shall require the DP,
or a representative, to attend the meetings and workshops, where they will discuss NIP
policies and implementation procedures on compensation and resettlement.

7.2.2    Activity 2: Public Meetings

PMU18 and PCCs will coordinate with the DCC and Commune PCs to inform and convene
discussions with DPs on basic policies and procedures for compensation, rehabilitation and
other aspects concerning implementation of the RAP.

Commune PCs will send invitation letters or make public announcements after the PCCs have
adjusted the data in the DMS due to changes in the final design of the road improvements.
The invitation letters or announcements should include the following information:

      o Time and location of meeting;

      o Persons to attend the meeting (i.e., both male and female DP heads of household who
        declared a preference to be relocated to a resettlement site);

      o Objectives and contents of meeting (i.e., the meeting will introduce the sub-project

        and describe DP rights and entitlements, including opportunities for DPs to ask
        questions and clarification).

The Public Meeting

   o PMU-18 and the PCCs will hold public dialogues with DPs to inform and consult with
     them on the sub-projects. The meetings will include the following:

   o Distribution of printed information on criteria for rehabilitation, proposed
     rehabilitation measures, and DP preferences on best suitable measure(s).

   o With the use of visual aids, PMU-18 and PCCs will discuss and explain the design of
     sub-projects;

   o Open forum where DPs may ask questions and give comments, especially on matters
     related to rehabilitation;

   o Minutes that record questions, comments, options raised and the decisions agreed
     upon during public consultation, recorded by the respective DCCs to submit to the
     PCC and PMU-18.

7.2.3   Activity 3: Compensation Agreement

PMU18 and the PCC will distribute information letters and Assets Compensation Forms
(ACF) that define each compensation item (e.g., acquired land, houses, fixed assets), unit
price, final compensation price and other entitlements for each DP, based on DMS data
collected for the DP Inventory. The PCC will co-sign the ACF with the DP head of

8     GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES

The Policy Framework outlines the Grievance Procedures to be followed during the
implementation of Resettlement Action Plans for the Road Network Improvement Project.

Grievances lodged by an affected person can relate to any aspect of the land acquisition and
resettlement program including the compensation rates being offered for their losses. The
complaints can be submitted verbally or in written form. If verbally, the first authority
hearing the complaint is responsible for writing down the complaint and co-signing it with the
DP.

8.1   Timeframes and Procedures

The Policy Framework defines the following timeframes and procedure for handling
complaints and grievances:

DPs will present their complaints and grievances to the Commune Resettlement Committees,
which will have to provide a written response to the DP within fifteen calendar days of
receiving the complaint. If the DP is not satisfied with the decision of the CRC, the DP may
present the case to the District Compensation Committee within fifteen calendar days of
receiving the written response from the CRC authorities. The decision of the DCC should be
rendered within thirty calendar days of receipt of the DPs appeal, and can at the request of the
DP within fifty days be reviewed and revised by the Provincial Compensation Committee.
The decision of the PCC will be provided to the DP in writing within thirty calendar days of
the request.

If the DP is not satisfied with the decision of the PCC the case may be submitted for
consideration by the District Court.

DPs will be exempt from all administrative and legal fees. The cost of the fees will be paid
from the contingency fee in the budget.

All records of conflicts, grievances and complaints will be maintained with the PMU-18 and
PCC of Hai Duong and Hung Yen. PMU-18 and the PCC of Hai Duong and Hung Yen will
ensure the times and procedures to explain clearly for each level of the People's Committees.

9   MONITORING

The Policy Framework outlines the requirements for Monitoring during the implementation of
Resettlement Action Plans for the Road Network Improvement Project.

The NIP will include both internal and external monitoring and evaluation.

The main purpose of monitoring and evaluation is to ensure that resettlement and acquisition
of land and properties have been implemented in accordance with the policies and procedures
of the RAP and the Policy Framework.

Internal monitoring and supervision will include: verification of baseline information;
overseeing that RP's are implemented; verification that funds are dispersed; and record
grievances and their resolution.

PMU18 is responsible for the internal monitoring and supervision of the RPs for each sub-
project through the District and Provincial Compensation Committees. The findings of the
internal supervision and monitoring will be recorded in a quarterly report to be submitted to
GoV.

An independent agency has been retained to carry out external monitoring and evaluation of
the implementation of the RAP. External monitoring and evaluation focuses on social impacts
on DPs and whether or not DPs have been able to restore pre-project living standards, income
earning capacity and production levels. External monitoring and evaluation involves
verification of the internal supervision and monitoring quarterly reports and 10% sampling of
relevant DPs 6 months after RAP implementation.

10 IMPACTS ON AFFECTED PEOPLE

The DMS survey undertaken in May 2005 aimed to achieve a general understanding of DPs'
living conditions. It is from the DMS survey that the compensation and resettlement budget
has been prepared. The following information was taken from the DMS survey that was
conducted with 100% of households which will be affected by the sub-project NH38B.

10.1 Socio-Economic characteristics of DPs

The survey was conducted with all of DPs affected by the NH38B sub-project.
The number of households and individuals affected by the project are shown in Table 10-1.

10.1.4 Income

The main source of income among DPs surveyed in the project area was from agriculture
(51.5%) followed by sale of produce/goods (19.1%). About 9.3 percent of DPs depend on
government pension and 6.17 percent on either livestock or fishing. The rest of the
population (14%) depends on other sources of income. It seems that agriculture has played an
important role in DPs' life. This needs to be considered carefully when agriculture land will
be acquired by the project.

Average monthly household incomes vary considerably over the project area. The minimum
reported monthly income is VND 75,000 while the maximum is VND 1,000,000

Figure 10-5 shows that over half of the DPs have monthly income of between VND 200,000
and VND 500,000; while about 12 percent of DPs earn less than VND 100,000 per month.

According to the Decision No.170/2005/QD-TTg issued on 08 July 2005, the poverty line for
rural areas was set at VND 200,000 per person per month. Based on this figure it can be seen
that at present 30% of the DPs are earning an income below the poverty line.

10.1.5 Water supply

Similar to other rural areas in Vietnam, the people in communes mostly use untreated water
sources such as systems with a filter and rainwater for washing, bathing and cooking. Around
47 percent of DP households use rainwater for their daily needs. Only 6 percent of DP
households have access to treated water supply (Figure 10-6).

10.1.6 Electricity connection

Power lines supply electricity to 99% of the DP households in the project area. All of these
HH use electricity from the government.

10.2 Project Impacts

A summary of impacts is provided in Table 10-2. The total count of DPs in Table 10-2 will
be larger than the total number of DPs in Table 10-1 because a single DP may be reported
more than once for different compensation.

10.2.1 Loss of land

Table 10-3 shows the land impacts associated with the sub-project.

The residential land category includes land with remaining legal residential and/or
commercial land beyond the project area sufficient to reorganize (at least 40m2 in urban areas
and 100m2 in rural areas). 2,137 HH are included in this category of partial impact. The
project will have a severe impact on 248 HH, all of who have elected to receive land for land
compensation, with any disparity in value of the old and new land reconciled through
additional cash compensation. These 248 HH will be relocated to developed resettlement
sites as detailed in Section 11.

Many HH will lose agricultural land due to implementation of the sub-project but in the
majority of cases the areas are generally small in terms of percentage of total landholding and
will not significantly affect their household incomes. The RAP survey (Table 10-3) indicated
that 959 DPs would lose agricultural land to the project of which 70 DPs would be severely
affected, i.e. reduce total agricultural land holding by more than 20%.

10.2.2 Loss of structures

As shown in Table 10-4, all 1,096 affected DPs have legal or legalizable rights to build their
houses and/or other structures. A total of 241 DPs have been identified as having structures
that will be severely affected and all have elected to receive cash compensation for the entire
affected structures. The remaining DPs who have partial damage to their structures have
elected to receive cash compensation for the partially affected structure and will choose to
reorganize on their remaining land.

10.2.3 Loss of fixed assets

A range of fixed assets will be demolished or rendered useless as a result of sub-project
implementation. Included in this category are household facilities such as ponds, yards,
fences and wells. These assets will be compensated whether or not their owners have legal
land use rights. Compensation rates will be determined by the type of asset and compensation
will be paid directly to respective households.

A list of such assets, identified during the socio-economic survey is presented in Table 10-5.

10.2.4 Loss of standing crops and trees

The owner of the tree will be entitled to compensation for the tree and, where appropriate, for
one year's associated loss of income from tree produce. Compensation rates will be
determined by the tree type, diameter and productivity. Compensation will be paid in respect
of 2,565 trees (Hung Yen 682; Hai Duong 1,883).

Standing crop compensation will be paid to the farmers at the full market value of the affected
crops.

include the total costs of initial investment and care until the time of land recovery.

Compensation will be in cash. The farmer will be given notice of clearance 3 months prior to
the date by which the land should be handed over to the contractor.
The results from the questionnaire survey indicate that compensation will be paid in respect of
35,691m² of agricultural land, variously planted to rice or legumes (Hung Yen 6166m²; Hai
Duong 29,525m²).

10.2.5 Loss of community infrastructure

73 Public Institutions will have infrastructure that will be affected by the NH38B sub-project.
The appropriate government authorities will be advised of this requirement. The cost of
compensation or relocation will be paid for out of project funds on a pro rata basis.

10.2.6 Adverse effect due to temporary land impact

The proposed civil works including widening of the road and constructing the bridges will
have temporary impacts, in short run, on the households who are running business along the
road. However, the business can be reopened after the clearance of the road corridor. The
impacts, therefore, may be negligible in the long term.

DPs will be entitled to compensation for their loss of structure and assets due to temporary
land possession. 180 DPs will be affected in this way and will receive payments.
Payments are also made to DPs having land occupied temporarily for the construction and
occupation of camps for people employed on road works, for sleeping quarters and offices.
Similarly, other sites will be required for example for project vehicle storage, material dumps,
asphalt plants and stone crushers.
DPs losing land temporarily for these purposes will have these sites returned to their pre-
project condition, in particular, to prior fertility levels.

An estimated seven sites will be developed; two larger camps of 2,500m² each and five
smaller sites, together totalling an additional 4,500m².
An estimated 60 DPs will temporarily lose land for these purposes.

10.2.7 Business allowance

Business allowance will be paid to DPs suffering permanent or temporary loss of income by
the project. Each DP will be entitled to compensation for demonstrable inconvenience caused
by the project in the form of an allowance paid in cash up to 400,000VND per month during
the period of inconvenience. It is unlikely that for affected households this period will exceed
more than two to three months. However, in exceptional cases this allowance might be paid
up to a maximum of one year. DPs eligible for payment in lieu of loss of income will not be
eligible for inconvenience allowance, except where claims are made with reference to
different addresses.

Approximately 500 DPs might be eligible for this allowance.

10.2.8 Transitional allowance

Transitional allowances will be paid to DPs moving their homes, businesses or other
structures to a new site. An estimated 248 DPs will have to move their residence and/or
business to a new site.

10.3 Economic Rehabilitation

The total number of households in this road corridor potentially affected by the sub-project
implementation and hence subject to the questionnaire survey is 3,265.

Where levels of compensation are deemed insufficient to restore or improve pre-project
incomes, living standards and productive capacity additional rehabilitation measures will be
implemented.

Affected DP households will be given priority for employment in jobs created by the project.

11 DEVELOPMENT OF RESETTLEMENT AREAS

Due to the high number of displaced households on NH38B specific resettlement sites have
been developed. All DPs left with remaining landholding insufficient to reorganise on their
existing site, or other affected DPs who elect to relocate, will be relocated to these sites.

The location of the resettlement sites have been selected to provide a similar quality of land
and business opportunity as their previous landholding. If there is a difference between old
and new land quality and value this is being reconciled through additional cash compensation.

The sites have been or will be provided with all public utilities, including paved roads,
electricity, running water, stormwater drainage and sewage.

Hai Duong

There is no plan to develop a specific resettlement site in Hai Duong Province as the 30 DPs
who will be severely affected have elected to receive cash compensation and/or relocate by
themselves. If the entire land is acquired or the remaining land is not sufficient to reorganise
on the existing site, the commune will provide new land for these DPs within the residential
quarter.

Hung Yen

According to the Hung Yen Land Acquisition Unit, the Province is developing resettlement
sites to be used by DPs from the NH38B sub-project. The proposed development for each
District includes:

   ·   Phu Cu District: There is no plan to develop a resettlement site in Phu Cu District, and
       the resettlement plan for DPs will follow that of Hai Duong Province.

   ·   Tien Lu District: There will be 3 resettlement sites developed of which 2 will be
       located in Vuong Town, a large site with a capacity of 109 plots and the second with
       the capacity of 36 plots. The remaining resettlement site to be developed will be
       located in Hai Trieu Commune and will have a capacity of 30 plots.

   ·   Hung Yen Town: There will be a resettlement site developed in Trung Nghia
       Commune for the affected DPs from that commune; this site will have a capacity of 60
       plots. The remaining affected DPs from Hung Yen Town will be relocated to 2
       existing resettlement sites. A large 4.5 ha site has already been developed at D32-D35
       and there will be 133 plots available for resettlement. The second existing site is at
       Nam Dinh Dien with a capacity of 130 plots.

If the above planned sites are not sufficient to relocate any additional DPs identified during
implementation of the RAP, the province will develop an additional resettlement site in An
Tao with a capacity of 50 plots.

The locations of the identified resettlement sites for Hung Yen Province are shown in Figure
11-1.

13 COSTS AND BUDGET

Funds for RAP implementation will be made directly to the DPs from the Government budget.
Hai Duong and Hung Yen Provincial People's Committee will specify a schedule in each
district for compensation payments. Representatives of DPC, CPC, and PDOT will be
responsible for transferring money directly to each DP.

Costs are based on Decision No. 56/2005/QD-UB issued by Hung Yen Provincial People's
Committee on 25 July 2005 and Decision No.5789/2004/QD-UB of Hai Duong People's
Committee for compensation rates and resettlement assistances.            However, during
implementation these rates may need to be up-dated in line with changing market values.

13.1 Procedures for Flow of Funds

The Provincial Department of Transport will disburse land acquisition and resettlement funds
directly to the DPs for compensation via the PRC and DRC.

13.2 Inflation Adjustment

The rates of compensation and cash entitlements for rehabilitation and allowances payable to
the affected persons will be adjusted annually on April 1, based on the actual annual inflation
rate. The Provincial Department of Transport together with various agencies will determine
the annual inflation rate and ensure the necessary annual adjustments are made to
compensation rates and to all cash entitlements.

13.3 Implementation, Administration and Contingency Costs

Implementation costs include costs already made for land demarcation and surveys, costs of
payment (salaries, per diem) for compensation committees and for monitoring costs.

Administration costs represent 1% of the total project costs.

The cost estimates for RAP implementation also include provision for contingencies at 10%
of total project costs. The contingency cost is to cover any unexpected costs. It acts as a
backstop to ensure that DPs improve or at least maintain their income and living standard.

13.4 Unit Prices for Cost Estimation


13.4.1 Land

Hai Duong and Hung Yen PPCs establishes their own price levels for land in accordance with
the price ranges stipulated in Decree 87/CP. This should reflect the market value for land.
This figure will provide the basis for estimating replacement cost, and hence the level of
compensation paid to DPs losing land.

The unit prices (VND/m²) for residential, agricultural land are as follows:

   ·   Residential land

          Centre (e.g. Hung Yen town) -                                       3,000,000/m2

          Land on National or Provincial Roads -                              1,500,000/m2

          Land on District roads -                                             700,000/m2

   ·   Agricultural land (plus `raise up' adjustment) -                         41,000/m2

13.4.2 Structures

Compensation for loss of property will be at replacement cost, and will be in the form of: (a)
replacement materials plus labour of a sufficient amount to rebuild the same structure; or (b) a
replacement structure provided by the developer; or (c) cash; at the option of the project
affected person. There will be no deduction for depreciation and salvageable materials.

The standard new housing construction cost as determined by the local government according
to Ministry of Construction methods is to be adjusted by applying a coefficient that relates to
the quality of the present property (as determined by the local Compensation Committee
established under Article 58).

Based on the above framework and regulations, the following unit prices will be used as
guides for cost estimates for compensation for affected structures. These rates include costs
of materials plus labour construction costs and will need to be adjusted to the level of
replacement cost.

Temporary                                                                420,000VND/m²

House class III                                                        1,100,000VND/m²

13.4.3 Other costs

The allowances and other rehabilitation measures to be provided include:

   ·   Fixed assets: The compensation rates for fixed assets vary from VND 13,000 to VND
       700,000 per unit, depending on the type of fixed asset. These rates are estimated by
       applying the replacement rates provided by Hai Duong and Hung Yen provinces.
   ·   Crops and trees: The rates for crops and trees are based on the average replacement
       prices provided by Hai Duong and Hung Yen PPC and are adjusted by applying the
       market price for specific types of crops or trees (VND 1,200 ­ VND 300,000 per unit).
   ·   Rental allowance: VND 100,000 × person × 6 months for DPs renting houses

            Transportation allowance: VND 1,000,000 × DP household
            Transition allowance:       30 kg rice × person × 6 months

   o Economic rehabilitation assistance: VND 1,100,000 × DP household (affected with
     more than 20% of agricultural land.).

   o Business allowance: VND 400,000 × DP household × 3 months

In practice, the compensations can vary from area to area even in the same city. The
compensation particularly for residential area is very low, and higher prices (replacement
rates) are used in all areas, as shown above.

14 IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE

This Section specifies the activities and schedule of activities for implementation of this RAP.
The Implementation Schedule is shown in Table 14-1 at the end of this Section.

14.1 Approval of the RAP

The RAP is presented to the Government of Vietnam and the World Bank for approval. Once
approved, the RAP will become legally enforceable. After the approval of the RAP by the
Government and the World Bank, instructions will be issued from the Central Government
office to the Hai Duong and Hung Yen Provincial People's Committee and the Hai Duong
and Hung Yen Provincial Department of Transport to implement the negotiated RAP.

14.2 Establishment of the Compensation Committee

After receiving instructions from the Central Government to begin implementing the sub-
project, the PPC will establish the Compensation Committee and confirm the roles and
responsibilities of the committee and its members.

14.3 Training of the Compensation Committee

After the Compensation Committee is established, its members will be briefed by respective
PDOT regarding RAP policies and trained in implementation procedures. Compensation
Committee members presently implement resettlement and compensation programmes
according to current Vietnamese legislation. Implementation according to OP4.12 should,
therefore, present no new obstacle. Any necessary training will be undertaken by Project
specialists. Project specialists will be charged with responsibility for ensuring that
resettlement and compensation complies with the World Bank Policies.

14.4 Potential Readjustment of DMS

The DMS which provided the data for the current document was based on the draft final road
designs. However the final approved road designs for NIP which will be depicted in the
bidding documents and constructed may vary from the draft final design due to review
comments received from the relevant authorities during the during the design approval
process. The changes are unlikely to change the Corridor of Impact, however in some
specific cases, the Compensation Committees may be required to re-measure affected lands
and property for these segments and make the necessary adjustments in the DP inventories
from the original DMS.

14.5 Establishment of Detailed Compensation Rates

The PPC will determine the rates of compensation payable for land, structures and other
assets. Rates established will be at replacement cost without depreciation and without
deduction for salvageable materials. Rates for structures will be calculated for affected area.

Compensation rates will be adjusted for inflation at the time of compensation. Rates must be
established before compensation entitlements can be calculated.

14.6 Conduct Public Information Campaign

The Compensation Committee will develop a campaign to disseminate frequent information
about the Project to the DPs and the general public in the Project area. This campaign will
begin as soon as the RAP is approved.

14.7 Planning for Resettlement and Income Rehabilitation Assistance

At the present stage, group relocation is not foreseen on this sub-project. However,
consultations and resettlement planning activities initiated during preparation of the RAP will
continue upon reconfirmation of options selected by DPs.

If group relocation were to become necessary, the PCC and DCCs would further consult with
DPs to identify a preferred resettlement site and plan for its development. Development of
the resettlement site would ensure land of equal productive value and acceptable to the DPs,
and similar or improved access to safe water, electricity, roads, markets, government services
and other basic necessities.

DPs eligible for income rehabilitation assistance will also be consulted on their preferences
for type of assistance. The exact nature of the assistance will vary depending on the needs,
interests and capacities of the specific DPs, as well as on conditions of the local context, such
as land situation, market opportunities, technological level, and so on. They could include
such activities as occupational training, provision of new seed varieties and other suitable
measures. The duration of these programs will also depend on the nature of the activity, but
normally they should not exceed 6 months.

14.8 Preparation and Approval of Compensation Plan

PMU 18 will be responsible for finalization of the Compensation Plan, in collaboration with
the PCC. PMU 18 will submit the finalized Compensation Plan to the Quality Management
Control Bureau of the MOT for approval. Once approved, PMU 18 will make a request to the
State Treasury for a release of funds and make necessary arrangements for bank transfers.

14.9 Payment of Compensation and other Entitlements to DPs

After unit prices have been established, the Compensation Committee will apply the prices to
each DP's losses, calculate compensation entitlement and complete the Assets Compensation
Form for each affected household.

DPs will be informed of their compensation entitlement by posting this information at the
local office. In addition, the affected persons will receive a written document informing them
of: a) the compensation rates; b) their compensation amount; c) the schedule for
compensation; and d) the kind of compensation they will receive. The option to appeal the
compensation will also be explained clearly. Preference will be given to DPs needing to
relocate and to determining with them the most appropriate rehabilitation package.
