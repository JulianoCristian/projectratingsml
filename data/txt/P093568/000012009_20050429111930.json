Intermediation\n            Project development objective is to provide medium and\n            long-term working capital, and investment finance to private\n            exporters, and contribute to further facilitating export\n            growth in Turkey. Furthermore, the project will improve the\n            quality, and safety of, and access to, finance through the\n            development of financial intermediation within the Turkish\n            private financial sector. The project consists of a single\n            component - financing of sub-loans and leases under the\n            project, in two tranches of US$200 million and \u008080 million.\n            The Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi (TSKB), a privately owned\n            investment and development bank, will act both as the\n            Borrower and Implementing Agency, with the Government\n            issuing a guarantee to the Bank. TSKB will act in the\n            capacity of a wholesale institution, and will on-lend loan\n            funds through a group of 4-8 private banks, and 2-4 leasing\n            companies, selected pursuant to the criteria agreed between\n            the Borrower and the Bank. TSKB will take the credit risk on\n            the banks and leasing companies selected for participation.\n            The participating financial intermediaries in turn, will\n            make sub-loans and leases to private exporting enterprises\n            for procurement of goods and works, in order to expand their\n            current export volumes, or, in exceptional circumstances, to\n            enable them to retain, and maintain their current level of\n            exports. The on-lending banks and leasing companies will\n            take the credit risks on the borrowing enterprises. The\n            subsidiary loans made by TSKB to the participating banks,\n            and leasing companies will be denominated, and repayable in\n            US Dollars and Euros. The participating banks and leasing\n            companies are expected to price their sub-loans and leases,\n            which may be denominated, and repayable in any foreign\n            currency on a commercial basis."}, "docdt": "2005-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
