1.        Recent Macroeconomic Developments. Turkey i s steadily recovering from the
economic and financial crises o f 2001, but tight macroeconomic management and structural
reforms remain key for future stability and growth. After significantly shrinking in 2001, the
Turkish economy has grown at a rapid pace in the last three years, and inflation, supported by a
stable Turkish Lira, has gone down to historically low levels in2004 - first single-digit inflation
in34 years (see Table 1 for details). With the help o f a recordprimary budget surplus in2003-
2004, public debt as a percentage o f GNP has also trended downwards. Over the last three years,
real interest rates, though still high, are down to around 10% from 30-35% pre-crisis levels.
Besides, after 41 years o f associated partnership - the EU, in December 2004, has extended a
formal invitation to Turkey to start membership negotiations. Thus both the external and internal
macroeconomic and political environment for Turkey has improved substantially. However, in
spite of these positive developments, some macroeconomic uncertainties remain. The current
account has worsened and reached 5.1 percent o f GNP in2004, posting an all-time highUS$15.4
billion deficit. Turkey's public debt burden remains high. Structural reforms, including fiscal
policy changes and state bank privatization, have not been completed. Long term productivity in
the real sector and efficiency in the financial sector need to improve significantly to sustain
future stability and growth and to catch up with the rest o f EUcountries inthe coming years.

2.      Strong exports growth has been one of the key contributingfactors in the continued
GDP growth. Export growth continued steadily throughout 2002-04, despite the ongoing
appreciation o f the real effective exchange rate (Figure 1).During2001, many exporters suffered
from shortages o f working capital and lack o f internally generated resources as a result o f the
shrinking economy and uncertain macroeconomic and political environment. However, the TL
depreciation in 2001 created a boost for surviving exporters, and those with a somewhat price-
elastic intemational demand, increased their export performance substantially. This was true for
some o f the first EFIL beneficiaries. As the TL gained strength, exporters expressed fears
regarding their capacity to compete in intemational markets, but exports have actually increased
inthe last two years (Figure2). Increasinglabor productivity inthe short term, partly stemming
from the post-crisis layoffs, and first reducing, then keeping real wages steady helpedtrim down
unit labor costs and facilitated export competitiveness despite a strengtheningcurrency.

3.      Though exports have grown rapidly in Turkey during the last few years, from
US$36 billionin 2002 to estimatedUS$63.1billionin 2004, their continuedrapid growth in
future years is critical as an engine of economic growth and competitiveness(Table 2). The
external trade continues to have a negative balance o f about US$34 billion. In comparison to
several large economies, Turkish merchandise exports, at almost 20% o f GNP in 2002-2003,
have considerable room for further growth. Sectoral breakdown o f exports in 2003 shows that
manufactured goods account for nearly 84% o f the total exports, with machinery and transport
equipment contributing over a quarter o f total exports. The latter export segment also grew faster
(42% in2003) than other manufacturing exports (30.5%). Half o f the exports in2003 went to the
EU, while exports to the Middle East, although only one tentho f the total exports, grew fastest -


                                                      4

almost by 60%. Thus there i s ample scope for both geographical and product diversification o f
exports.

4.      Even though economic performance continued to improve, the pick up in market
sentiment had not led to any significant increasein the overall level of bank credits to the
productivesectorsinthe immediateyears after the 2001-02 financialcrises. However, lately,
as inflation reversed course, interest rates began to fall, and the dominance o f bond returns over
equity returns and credit spreads started to wither away, allowing for more funds to be
withdrawn by the banks from the treasury paper investments and channeled into client lending.
Loan book expansion i s now a general phenomenon, but it stems mainly from consumer credits.
Banks have recently been adjusting their long-term strategies though, and corporate credit
enhancement, especially targeting SMEs, i s now inthe agenda.

performing loans to total loans decreased from 13% to 6.3%, while the coverage o f the NPLs
with loan loss provisions remainedunchanged at 89%.

6.      Lending from private banks however remains weak due to their lack of access to
mediumand long-termfundingsources and lack of institutionalcapacity to properlyassess
lendingrisks of longer-termlending. The real sector is still faced with the financial system's
inability to adequately offer longer-term credit resources. The 2004 year-end figures show that
while the total loans in 2004 increased by US$26 billion, about two thirds o f the increase was in
short term (less than one year) loans. Even among the medium term-long term loans category,
experience has shown that most o f the loans are o f less than 3 years maturity, with a handful o f
loans only to the best customers approaching 5 years maturity. The primary reason i s o f course a
shortage o f medium to long term liabilities, both inthe form o f deposits as well as intemational
lines o f credit or syndicated loans, leading to a gap betweenthe maturity o f assets and liabilities.
For example, nearly 49% o f total assets (including investment/securities holdings) were o f 1 year
o fmaturity or longer, but 81% o f total liabilities was o f maturities less than 1 year. Besides, over
the first nine months o f 2004, even though lending to the government by the banking sector has
decreased from US$50 billion or 31.2% in 2003 to US$44 billion or 22.5% o f the total banking
system assets in 2004, by virtue o f its magnitude, it still constitutes a major crowding out effect
for the private sector enterprises.

7.      Lease finance - which often is an important source of longer-term investment
finance for exporters in other countries also has remained underdeveloped in Turkey,
                                                -
with the growth in lease receivables highly volatile and dependent on macroeconomic
performance. Both the banking and leasing sectors still lack access to medium and long term
funds- a circumstance which provides the principal rationale for the Bank's involvement and the
EFILI11(see Annex 1for a more detailed discussion).

                            B. RATIONALE BANKINVOLVEMENT
                                             FOR

8.      The main rationale for the Bank's involvementis to address the development need
for mediumto long term funds for investment and mediumterm working capital needs of
exporting enterprises, to deepen and broaden financial intermediation capacity, and
contribute to strengthening Turkey's external accounts. With nominal and real interest rate
levels on Turkish Lira loans remaining prohibitively high, and loan maturities very short,
demand for affordable longer-term foreign currency funds from the real and financial sectors in
Turkey remains strong. To address the shortage o f longer-term credit for the real sector in the
post-crisis environment, the Turkish authorities had requested the Bank for an export credit line,
which would be provided through the financial system and would support private sector
exporters. The Bank's support materialized through the US$300 million EFIL I1 credit line in
2004. In order to deepen financial intermediation in Turkey and expand the outreach o f EFIL I1
funds to SME exporters also, leasing companies were included for the first time along with banks
as participating financial intermediaries (PFIs). To date, EFIL I1 has achieved a welcome
coverage o f enterprises o f all sizes, as well as in diverse economic sectors and geographical
regions.

9.      The utilization success on the EFIL I1 in 2004 has created an urgent demand and
rationale for a repeater EFIL I11operation in 2005 in order to maintain the momentumof
assistance to exporters. The proposed new operation, EFIL I11will continue and build on the

                                                   6

performance record o f EFIL 11. In view o f the continuing surge o f commitments (US$220
million inMarch2005 - 73% o f the total available funds) and disbursements (US$189 million        -
63% o f the total) duringthe first year o f EFIL 11, TSKB and the PFIs are expecting that the funds
are likely to be fully committed by September 2005 and completely disbursed by end-December
2005. Based on the indications given to the Bank team by the PFIs, and assuming economic
growth remains on track and macroeconomic and political stability continues, the overall
demand for mediudlong term investment funds provided by the proposed new EFIL I11credit
line to exporters i s likely to remain high. Even though there i s increased supply o f long term
funding from other multilateral institutions like EIB, FMO, DEG, KFW, the amounts are still
small compared to the overall demand for long term funding. Similarly, even in the event o f
imminent commencement o f EU accession negotiations in the near future, significant flows o f
pre-accession funding which would benefit exporting enterprises were unlikely to materialize
duringthe lifetime o fthe proposed EFILI11operation. Thus the timing o f EFILoperation is very
consistent with the current demand and insufficient supply o f long term funds.

10.      The proposed project is consistent with the FY04-06 CAS for the Republic of
Turkey. As stated in the CAS, an important objective is the revitalization o f the real sector by
providing access to long term credit. The CAS'Skey priorities for the medium term include
completing the banking and financial sector reforms and filling the current gap in accessing
credit facilities, which will be also supported by this proposedproject.

           c. HIGHER     LEVEL   OBJECTIVESTO WHICH THE PROJECTCONTRIBUTES

 11.     One o f the main benefits o f the proposed project will be faster private sector growth and
job creation, supported by a healthier and more developed financial system. Ingeneral, enterprise
and financial sector performance i s expected to continue to improve in the short and medium
term. In the longer run, export growth supported by the proposed operation i s expected to have
an overall positive impact on poverty alleviation and private sector growth inTurkey.


                              11. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

                                    A. LENDING    INSTRUMENT

 12.     The lending instrument proposed for the EFIL I11 project is the Bank's Fixed
Spread Loan (FSL) in two currencies (US Dollar and Euro) with a 16-year maturity,
including a 6-year grace period. The instrument will have a fixed spread over the
benchmark (6-month U S Dollar Libor and Euribor), and is planned as a loan with a long
maturity both for the Bank loan to the Borrower (TSKB), and for the subsidiary loans
from the Borrower to participatingfinancial intermediaries. The long maturity o f the credit
line i s justified by the fact that, with a revival o f demand, lower inflation and GDP growth
picking up, the operational and investment planning horizon o f private exporters i s lengthening,
and banks and other financial intermediaries are willing to provide increasingly longer term
foreign currency funds (of which there i s a clear shortage in the market) to their well-performing
clients.




                                                  7

               B. PROJECTDEVELOPMENT          OBJECTIVE AND KEY INDICATORS

13.     The proposed project's main objective i s to follow through on the achievement o f the
predecessor EFIL I1project and continue to serve as a catalyst to support export and real sector
growth in Turkey during the EFIL I11implementation period (2005-2010), and beyond using the
EFIL I1 and EFIL 111 reflows. To this end, the project will provide medium and long-term
working capital and investment finance to Turkishprivate exporting enterprises, at the time when
the economy i s showing strong signs o f growth, and export performance i s on the rise-thus
increasing the demand for longer term credit, while the financial sector i s still unable to support
these trendswith very much neededlonger term funds at a reasonable cost.

14.     The secondaryobjectiveo f the loan is further improvement inthe ability o f the Turkish
financial sector to provide financial resources to the enterprise sector, through further
development o f intermediation by private financial institutions, including banks and leasing
companies. The project, through inclusion o f leasing companies inaddition to banks as PFIs,will
enable the Bank to continue a dialogue with the leasing sector in Turkey, provide an opportunity
to gain more insight into the sector, and enable the Bank to further support its development.
Also, the EFIL 111 will seek more diversity o f the financial intermediaries, by including new
banks and leasing companies as the PFIs, compared to the EFIL11.

15.     The EFIL Iproject financed mostly medium and large exporters, with the average sub-
loan being close to US$2.5 million. The inclusion o f leasing companies as a new class o f
financial intermediaries in the EFIL I1 facility has insured that more small and medium-sized
exporters are reached than if intermediation was done through the banks only. In fact, as o f
March 1, 2005 the average lease finance application from the leasing companies under the EFIL
I1facility was US$423,000, as opposed to an average loan application size o f US$2.73 million
from banks. Overall the average loadlease finance application size under the EFIL I1facility i s
US$1.24 million. It i s expected that the EFIL 111, similar to the EFIL 11, will be able to reach a
significant amount o f smaller exporters, Le., those with annual revenues typically not exceeding
US$3 million, and provide financial sub-leases in the US$250,00~1,000,000 range for
acquisition o f productive assets (equipment and machinery for manufacturing and/or service
companies) .

                                 C. PROJECT      COMPONENTS

16.     The proposed EFIL I11 project will substantially maintain the design of its
predecessor EFIL I1projectwhich is beingsuccessfully implemented.The credit line will be
provided to TSKB, with a government guarantee, while TSKB will onlend it (on a wholesale
basis) in the form o f subsidiary finance to participating financial intermediaries for further on-
lendingto eligible private exporters. The principal design o fEFIL111will be as follows:

    -   TSKB, a privately owned Turkish investment and development bank, will act as the
        borrower and implementing agency. TSKB i s well suited at this time as the Borrower o f

    -   the Bank loan and for wholesaling it to financial intermediaries;
        leasing companies, inaddition to banks, will again be included as financial intermediaries
        under the project. This will continue to support development o f the leasing industry and

         will allow World Bank funds to reach non-bank customers, primarily smaller exporting
         companies; and
    -    The loan funds will be provided to the Borrower on standard Bank terms with 16 year
         maturity (including a 6 year grace period). This would extend the maturity available to
         the financial intermediaries and borrowing companies and appropriately respond to the
         increasing stability o f the Turkish economy and lengthening o f the investment planning
         horizons inthe enterprise sector.

17.      The EFIL I11will have a single component a credit line for exporters, and will provide
the medium and long-term funds to exporters through two distinct channels, or sub-components:
(i)US$165 million and 65 million through commercial banks in the form o f investment or
working capital loans, and (ii)    US$35 million and 15 million through leasing companies in the
form o f lease finance for acquisition o f productive assets (vehicles, machinery and/or
equipment).No co-financing arrangements with other international agencies are envisaged.

                D. LESSONS     LEARNED REFLECTEDINTHEPROJECTDESIGN
                                         AND

18.      The main lesson leamed during the last few years from Bank credit line operations inthe
ECA Region and elsewhere i s that the project design should be kept as flexible as possible, with
a minimum number o f statutory requirements; e.g. avoiding constraints like minimum sub-loan
size, maturity, currency denomination, sub-borrower co-financing requirements, sectoral lending
focus, etc., but using sensible financial indicators for the selection of both the PFIs and the sub-
borrowedsub-projects in line with established market practices. Restrictive procurement
requirements unsuitable for private sector borrowers, and the World Bank's previous currency
pool loan features have also proven to be a hindrance to expeditious project implementation, and
wherever commercial practices and SCLs were used, these factors ceased to be a bottleneck.
Another important lesson learned has been that the most successful formula for high quality and
expeditious project implementation i s to combine the Borrower and Implementing Agency
functions in one and the same entity ifpossible. Finally, pre-committing financial intermediaries
to borrowing a certain part o f a credit line (which involves paying a commitment fee on the pre-
committed amount) provides a strong incentive to the intermediaries to be quick and effective in
finding and financing eligible sub-projects, and leads to quicker disbursement o fthe Bank loan.

19.      Lessons Learned from Previous Credit Line Operations in Turkey: The Implementation
Completion Reports (ICRs) for the previous World Bank credit line operations in Turkey
indicate that some o f these operations had to be restructured in mid-stream because the initial
project design turned out to be too inflexible (e.g., too many requirements interms o f minimum
sub-loan size, sub-loan maturity, sub-borrower cofinancing requirements, etc.). The ICRs
indicate that, after restructuring, project implementation generally proceeded well.

20.      The proposed project design incorporates all o f these lessons leamed, by using TSKB as
the borrower and implementing agency for the loan, by the use o f a clear, market-based set o f
eligibility criteria for PFIs, sub-borrowers and sub-projects, by the use o f flexible loan terms and
suitable private sector procurement practices, and also by use o f formal expressions o f interest
from a minimum number o f the PFIs prior to Board Presentation to a specific portion o f the
credit line.

                E. ALTERNATIVES     CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION

21.    A search for alternative approaches to the project was not necessary in this case, as the
EFIL I11is being undertaken as a repeater project, building on the success and structure of the
EFIL Iand particularly EFIL I1projects. The borrower in the EFIL I11will again be TSKB
(Turkish Industrial Development Bank), same as in EFIL 11. The same set o f development
objectives and implementation arrangements as inthe EFIL I1facility will be maintained. Given
the absence o f any material changes from the EFIL 11, the EFIL I11qualifies as a repeater project,
which will continue to serve the needs o f exporters and PFIs for medium and long-term
investment and working capital funds.

                              A. PARTNERSHIP     ARRANGEMENTS

22.    As part o fbothproject preparation and implementation, the Bank team has built, and will
continue to cultivate, close relationships with both national and regional exporters'
organizations, the Turkish Eximbank, the Turkish Bankers' Association, and the Turkish
Association o f Leasing Companies, with a view to opening and maintaining a dialogue with the
project beneficiaries, and to identify, where relevant, policy issues and constraints to further
development o f exports as well as o f the leasing industry. In the case o f exporters associations,
this dialogue will build on the relationships already developed in the context o f the first two
EFILprojects. Relevant policy issues will feed into the Bank's overall sectoral dialogue with the
Turkishauthorities.

                 B. INSTITUTIONALAND IMPLEMENTATIONARRANGEMENTS

23.     TSKB, a non-deposit taking private investment & development bank owned largely by
local commercial banks, will be the borrower and the implementingagency for the project. A
separate project implementation unit (PKJ) has been established by TSKB under the supervision
o f one o f its executive vice presidents to oversee the implementation o f EFIL 11. The PIU i s
staffed with experienced management and staff, and, as the primary project counterpart for the
Bank team, will provide the overall administration o f all aspects o f the credit line and required
reporting to the Bank. The same PIUwill oversee the implementation o f EFIL111.

24.    For the purposes o f EFIL I1 implementation, the PIU has developed a very efficient
online interface between itself and the PFIs. The PFIs can apply for sub-project funding online,
while the intemal TSKB decision approval process as well as project accounting and information
processes are well integrated into the EFIL I1 project management system and are working
smoothly. The same tested project management systemwill be used for EFIL I11implementation.

                                    AND

25.    Inpursuing its major developmental objectives, the project will target an increase inthe
access to finance to exporters as measured through an increase in the amount o f aggregate
exports o f the financed exporting enterprises, and number o f exporting enterprises benefiting
from such improved access. An increase in the development o f financial intermediation in
Turkey is an important second development objective, as measured through (i) increase inthe
                                                                                the
breadth and depth o f participating financial intermediaries, and (ii)
                                                                    improvement o f the quality o f
credit portfolio management. Increase in the volume of transactions o f the participating leasing
companies will also be an important target, as it would signal a growing strength o f financial
intermediation through leasing which has the potential to reach small exporting enterprises at
times overlookedby larger banks.

26.    Progress inachieving the development objectives will be measured on the basis o f

           -   Increase in access to finance for exporters measured by the number o f enterprises

           -   and volume of exports supported;
               Increased depth and breadth o f financial intermediation as measured by the
               number of additional PFIs (banks and leasing companies) that participate inEFIL
               I11different from those in EFIL11; and
           -   Improvement o f quality o f credit portfolio management by measuring the level o f
               debt service and amortization performance o f sub-loans under EFIL I11 of the
               participating banks and leasing firms.

27.     Progress will be monitored through regular reporting by the Borrower/Implementing
Agency, and through statutory project supervision missions. It i s envisaged that reporting under
the EFIL I11 will be done through quarterly progress reports, with the reports specifically
distinguishing project transactions o f the two classes o f financial intermediaries - commercial
banks and leasing companies. The Operations Manual describes the details o f the Project
reporting.

                                       D. SUSTAINABILITY

28.     Turkey's past export growth record, as well as the World Bank's own past experience
with credit line operations inTurkey, EFIL I1being the most recent one, indicate that the private
enterprise sector has the technical and managerial ability to successfully tap export opportunities,
provided they have access to appropriate financing (e.g., interms o f pricing and maturity). Thus,
expansion o f existing and new export operations that will be financed by the funding to be
provided by the proposed EFILI11have a very highlikelihood o f self-sustainability.

29.     Additionally, continued use by participating banks o f high-quality loan and sub-borrower
analysis requirementsunder EFIL 111, as well as the further development o f the leasing industry
as an important source o f longer-term investment finance for smaller exporters, will contribute to
strengthening the overall intermediation capacity o f the financial system, which i s likely to be
sustained beyond the closing date o f the EFIL 111.



                                                  11

30.     Finally, by using TSKB - an established investment and development bank - as the
Borrower and ImplementingAgency for the project, TSKB's wholesale lending function in the
Bank's projects, already well established under the EFIL I1 facility, is likely to become more
sophisticated, and therefore more effective in future in intermediating international bilateral and
multilateral funding from a multitude o f sources, to the benefit o f the overall Turkish private
sector.

                E. CRITICAL RISKSAND POSSIBLECONTROVERSIALASPECTS

31.     EFIL 111potential risks are somewhat lower than those in EFIL 11. With respect to the
generic risks e.g., macroeconomic and structural reform risks, as well as potential political
instability, these have become less significant since the time o f the EFIL I1preparation in 2003.
In December 2004, the EU has formally invited Turkey to start membership negotiations in
October 2005    - a widely awaited and highly positive development, which i s bound to further
stabilize the markets and make Turkey an increasingly attractive destination for foreign
investors. Turkish exports have historically demonstrated their resilience to macroeconomic
shocks, and continued to grow in 2004. On the other hand, the public debt i s still large in
absolute terms, though it has come down as a percentage o f GNP. The structural reforms,
including privatization o f the remaining state banks, have not yet been completed. Even the
positive impact o f the invitation for the EU membership negotiations may dissipate if the
negotiations present too many roadblocks. Uncertainties on these issues may impact the overall
risk environment.

32.     With respect to project-specific risks, there are no significant risks observed. TSKB has
largely proven itself as very capable in on-lending the EFIL I1 credit line funds and
administering the project processes. Leasing companies have become full-fledged participating
intermediaries o f the Bank's credit line funds. The Bank has to remain careful incases where the
credit line funds are lent to environmentally-risky sub-borrowers, e.g., steel producers. This risk
would be mitigated by Bank team visits, to an extent possible, to such potential sub-borrowers
before the funds are committed, and by further improvement in the capacity o f TSKB staff to
assess the environmental risks o fproposed sub-projects.

Risk                            RiskMinimizationMeasure
Generic Risks      M            The Turkish economy has achieved significant stabilization
                                since the 2001 crisis. The Government has demonstrated its
macroeconomic                   commitment to sustained economic and political stability and
andstructural                   reforms, with the invitation to EU membership negotiations
reform risks,                   serving as an overarching driving factor. Furthermore, the
political                       economy has become much more resilient to negative shocks
instability, etc.)              since 2001. Turkey's private sector exporters' track record o f
                                resilience to macro-economic instability i s also a strong risk-
                                mitigating factor.

                                However, some macroeconomic and structural reform risks
                                remain that can derail the economic stability and the project
                                environment in future. These are: (i)   Large government debt
                                overhang. The net public debt to GNP ratio, although going
                                down, was 63.5% at the end o f 2004 and could be a significant
                                source o f macroeconomic risk in case the external or internal
                                economic environment becomes uncertain-therefore       needs to
                                be carefully monitored; (ii)high current account deficit
                                increases the risk o f exchange rate downward adjustment; (iii)
                                tight primary fiscal surpluses still need to be maintained to
                                avoid any future risk o f worsening inflation and government
                                debt scenarios.

                                Delay inthe privatization o f the state-owned banks, because of
                                their balance sheet structure, may cause liquidity risk in times
                                o f externalhntemal uncertainties and need to be constantly
                                monitored. Timely implementation o f the privatization agenda
                                also needs to be pursued to mitigate these risks.

                                          C. FIDUCIARY

38.     TSKB has worked with the World Bank before and i s very familiar with the Bank's
fiduciary  requirements related to procurement, disbursements, and applicable safeguards (see
Environment in D.5). The Bank team has full confidence in TSKB's ability to diligently follow
these requirements.

39.     During the last few years, the Turkish authorities have demonstrated a strong
commitment to strengthening the financial system by establishing an independent and
professional banking regulatory/supervisory institution (BDDK). This commitment and related
efforts were encouraged and supported by the Bank through its policy advice and adjustment
loans. As a result, the BDDK has established itself as a solid independent regulator, capable o f
issuing and enforcing prudential regulations for the banking sector. There is, therefore, no need
for detailed prudential guidelines and eligibility criteria for EFIL 111; instead, a single
certification by a bank's extemal auditors that a bank i s in general compliance with the Turkish
prudential standards for banking operations, as established and promulgated by the BDDK, will
be used. Therefore, monitoring o f participating bank eligibility will be simplified and done
through: (a) a prudential regulation compliance certificate; and (b) annual audit reports.

40.      Leasing companies have not been financial intermediaries in World Bank projects in
Turkeyinthe past up to the EFILI1project where USD 85 million o fthe facility was allocated to
leasing companies. Leasing companies were an entirely new financial intermediary class with a
separate set o f eligibility requirements. Their inclusion in the EFIL I1 proved to be highly
beneficial to the outreach o f the EFIL I1 funds to smaller-scale exporters. The following
eligibility indicators which were usedinthe EFIL I1facility are proposed to be used inthe EFIL
I11facility:

                a lessor will be duly registered and licensed by the leasing regulator and
                supervisor;
                minimum equity capital o f a lessor will be no less than TRY3 million,
                (approximately US$2.24 million);
                the total sum o f lease exposures will not exceed 30 times a lessor's equity capital,
                while the total sum o f exposures to related parties will not exceed 15 times its
                equity capital;
                a lessor will have been profitable for at least two out of the last three years o f
                operations; and



                                                 15

             -    the participating leasing company shall, at the time o f selection and for the
                  duration o f its subsidiary loan agreement with TSKB, for each year-end beginning
                  with year-end 2004, presentan audit report which:

                           Covers two full years o f operations;
                           I s prepared by an intemationally recognized extemal audit firm in
                           accordance with Intemational Auditing Standards and Intemational
                           Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); and
                           Contains an unqualified audit opinion.

41.      Initial and ongoing compliance with the eligibility criteria for the leasing intermediaries
will be assessed based on reporting by TSKB to the Bank, including quarterly project
implementation reports prepared by TSKB and semi-annual extemal auditor compliance
certificates* and annual extemal audit reports o fthe participating leasing companies.

                                                   D. SOCIAL

42.      Private sector exporters are one o f the key stakeholders in this project. The project,
through its support o f the manufacturing-for-export sector is, indirectly, supporting employment
inTurkey.

                                    E. ENVIRONMENT            - CATEGORY       FI

43.      TSKB will be responsible for ensuring that sub-projects financed under the EFIL I11
undergo environmental screening to ensure their conformity with Turkish environmental
legislation and regulations and the World Bank's policies and procedures, as set forth in OP/BP
4.01 and other relevant World Bank safeguards. The credit officers already appointed by TSKB
to staff the P I U will perform this function. The PIU Operations Manual detailing, inter alia, the
World Bank's requirements in respect o f environmental assessment, will be prepared prior to
loan negotiations.

44.       The PFIs, according to the procedures outlined in the Operations Manual, will undertake
the environmental screening o f the sub-loan applications to determine the appropriate
environmental risk category for the sub-borrowers/sub-projects. The sub-borrowers will be
responsible for carrying out any environmental analysis and for confirming that the proposed
sub-projects comply with national environmental guidelines, and for obtaining the necessary
clearance from the appropriate licensing authorities. Requirementsin respect o f environmental
analysis will also be written into the sub-loan agreements. The World Bank will perform ex-ante
review and clearance o f all sub-projects falling in Category 111.




 Currently, leasing companies inTurkey are licensed and regulated by the Undersecretariat o f the Treasury. With
the anticipated enactment o f the new law on financial institutions inthe next couple o f months, the regulatory and
supervisory functions vis-a-vis the leasing sector are likely to be transferred to BDDK, the banking regulator.
Following suchtransfer, incase BDDK updates the applicable prudential regulations for leasing companies in
future, compliance with the updated regulations will be required for eligibility o f leasing companies participating in
EFIL 111.

 45.      Environmental Assessment policies (OP/BP 4.01) will apply to EFIL 111, including sub-
 projects. The possibility that other World Bank safeguard policies might apply to sub-projects,
 along with other relevant environmental issues o f sub-borrowers and their sub-projects will be
 addressed through the sub-loan environmental eligibility assessment. World Bank staff will
 continue to supervise adherence to Bank and Turkish requirements, learning from the
 experiences o f EFIL-11. Annex 10 provides further details. It i s not anticipated that the sub-
 projects under EFIL I11 will trigger OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) and OP 7.50
 (International Waterways).

Country and Sector Issues

1.      Macroeconomic indicators for Turkey have been improving. Following the 2000-
2001 enterprise and financial sector crises and subsequent economic slump, the Turkish
economy has registered a marked improvement in its performance. By the end o f 2004, interest
rates on Government securities have fallen to the 18-20 percent range, compared with peaks
during the post-crisis period o fwell over 100 percent. The economic recovery has been stronger
than expected, with GNP growth for 2004 o f 9.9 percent, well above the initial target o f 5
percent. Inparallel, inflation has fallen substantially. End-2004 CPI inflation was just under 10
percent, below the 12 percent target, and the first single-digit inflation rate inover 30 years. The
floating exchange rate regime has been successfully maintained, and an important degree o f
exchange rate stability achieved. The current account, however, registered a sizable deficit o f 5.1
percent o f GNP. The positive macroeconomic outcomes have improved the public debt
dynamics, with the stock o f net public debt falling by about 7.4 percent o f GNP in2004, to 63.5
percent o f GNP. Fiscal policy i s extremely important in the context o f implicit inflation
targeting, and developments are encouraging on this front also. With the primary surplus o f the
consolidated public sector reaching 6.5 percent o f GNP at end-2004, there seems to be no more
"fiscal dominance" on monetary policy, which helps the Central Bank to turn its overnight
lending and borrowing rates into effective monetary policy instruments. In 2005, economic
growth i s expected to reach 5%, in part due to the continued strong export performance, while
CPI inflation i s expected to decelerate to about 7% by end-year. Based on current trends, the
Government's target o f 6.5% primary surplus o f the public sector i s likely to be achieved once
again.

2.      Turkish exports have been a major contributor to the positive macroeconomic
performance. Export growth (Table 4) has been an important economic success story in the
recent years. The share o f exports in GNP reached 21.1 percent in 2004. However, in the pre-
crisis period exports were particularly hard hit by the combined impact of: (i) slowdown in
                                                                                    the
growth inTurkey's export markets from an average o f 8.9 percent in 1997 to 5.3 percent in 1998;
(ii)disruption inthe previously rapidly growing Russian and CIS markets; (iii) sharp increase
                                                                                   the
indomestic real interest rates which undermined the competitiveness of Turkish export products
in foreign markets; and (iv) the severe credit and liquidity squeeze in Turkey due to non-
availability o f reliable short and medium term finance. Consequently, export growth dropped
from 13.1 percent in 1997 to 2.7 percent in 1998. The effect o f the major earthquake in 1999
contributed to a further 1.4percent decline in exports that year.

3.      Starting in 2000, export growth got back on a positive track, reaching 4.5 percent
despite the December financial market crisis. In the aftermath o f the crisis, led by increased
competitiveness o f Turkish exports after the Lira devaluation in early 2001 and by increasing
market confidence in sustainability o f the crisis resolution measures undertaken by the
authorities, export growth jumped to 12.8 percent in 2001 and 15.1 percent in 2002. Post-crisis
economic recovery has clearly been export-led. Exports further grew 31 percent in 2003, and

                                                 18

have reached $63.1 billion in 2004, posting a growth rate o f 33.5 percent over the 2003 level.
Figures demonstrate growth inboth volume and absolute value o f exports (for more statistics on
export growth, export loan availability, etc. see Annex 9).

4.        In case of EFIL I sub-borrowers, export performance data over the loan
disbursementperiod between 1999-2002 have been very positive.Export figures for the years
1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 were, respectively, US$ 2, 2.8, 3.1, and 4 billion, much more than
the projected figures o f U S $ 0.1, 1.2, 1.7 and 1.9 billion for the same period. This corresponded
to annual growth rates o f 40 percent, 11 percent, and 29 percent in the years 2000, 2001, and
2002, respectively. The main reason for this better-than-expected performance was the fact that
the majority o f these companies were exporters with established markets. High export volume,
increased profit margins and a strong equity base allowed them to sustain and improve profitable
business activities, while maintaining a sound financial structure during both the pre- and post-
crisis periods. In a few cases o f unsatisfactory performance, the main culprits were: (a) above-
optimal financial leverage, (b) a relatively high percentage o f domestic sales within total sales,
which were negatively affected by contraction in domestic demand throughout the economic
crisis;(c) decreasing profit margins due to domestic competition, and/or decreasing capacity
utilization as a result o f problems faced in obtaining working capital financing. Overall, the
financial performance o f the majority o f beneficiary EFIL Ienterprises during the EFIL I
implementation period can be regarded as satisfactory. The EFIL Ifacility, which was small
compared to the size o f the Turkish economy and export oriented enterprises, has nevertheless
been very successful in helping exporting companies in a country suffering from a severe crisis
to continue and develop their export activities.

5.        Medium- and long-term finance to Turkish exporters is, however, still scarce. The
banking sector has been restructured to a significant extent after 2001. Inthe banking sector, the
emphasis o f the Government's reform efforts during the 1990s was on the development o f a
basic legal and regulatory infrastructure to facilitate ease o f entry, and to increase competition
and growth. This triggered a rapid expansion o f banking system assets in Turkey during the
1990s, and in spite o f the 1994-95 and 2000-01 banking crises, total system assets in absolute
dollar terms has grown 250 per cent from US$51.9 billion in 1994 to US$228 billion as o f end
2004, and also increased substantially as a percentage o f GNP from 39.2% in 1994 to an
estimated 76.3% in 2004. The rapid growth in the size o f the banking sector, however, also had
some negative consequences. Prudential regulations and enforcement capacity lagged behind,
and there was a proliferation o f connected lending and concentration o f exposure and default
risks. Lenient loan loss provisioning rules and enforcement allowed banks to understate their
credit risks. Large FX open positions and asset/liability mismatches also created foreign currency
and interest rate/liquidity risks in addition to credit risks. Additionally, growing public sector
borrowing requirements during the years 1994-2001 encouraged banks to shift resources into


                                                   19

Government securities that were generating a relatively high-risk free real return. As a result,
banks' lending activity declined in real terms. The situation reversed in the latter half o f 2002
and during2003, and lending activity picked up markedly in2004.

Banking Sector Development

6.      As mentioned above, a combination o f structural weaknesses in the Turkish banking
sector, and macroeconomic and political uncertainties caused severe foreign exchange and
interest rate shocks causing banking crises in December 2000 and February 2001. Several banks
became insolvent and were liquidated as a result o f their large stock o f failed loans and
insufficient capital. The total asset size o f the Turkish banking system i s nearly US$229bn, but
dollar-denominated values are liable to abrupt changes as the nominal exchange rate realigns.
The share o f the top 6 banks intotal assets i s 65%, which indicates an inadequate economic scale
and operational volume for the remaining 42 banks. Furthermore, despite the liberal bank entry
policy o f the last 25 years, the government i s still a major player in the banking sector with two
state-owned banks - Halkbank and Ziraat Bankasi (which are in the process o f privatization) -
among the top 6 banks interms o f size.

7.      Untilloan demand from real sector companies reaches satisfactory levels, bondportfolio
management will continue to shape the asset structure o f the banking sector. As o f end-2004, the
volume o f the loan portfolio i s US$72.5 billion with Tier 1 banks owning around 65% o f this
figure. On the other hand, in spite o f declining interest rate margins, bond portfolio reached
US$92.2 billion in2004; accounting for 40.4% o f total assets. Inshort, T-bills have continued to
be a source o f profitability in 2004, although their contribution to the bottom line will be lower
with mark-to-market and trading gains forecast to fall further in2005.

8.      Thus, there is a need for banks to build an increasing portfolio of loan assets, and a
search for competitive sources of longer term funding. This requires a focus on (i)          building
retail corporate marketing units, specifically targeting SMEs; (ii) credit management and
                                                                       better
risk management skills; and (iii)development o f a broad range o f loan products. With lower
NpLs, cleaner balance sheets, disposal o f non core assets in a buoyant economy, the banks have
sufficient risk capital to focus on building a portfolio o f higher return loan assets. Besides, lower
return on government securities going forward, fee income is not expected to contribute to the
bottom line in a significant way in the foreseeable future. Hence, profitability based on loan
assets will be the main focus going forward. Corporate loans are expected to pick up at an
increasing speed inthe next couple of years, and competitive sources o f longer term fundingwill
be a key element in achieving success in doing so.

Leasing Sector Developments

9.      Similar to the predecessor EFIL I1project, leasing companies will again be accepted as
financial intermediaries in the EFIL I11 project. The Bank will continue its dialog with the
leasing industry- an important non-bank segment o f the financial market with financing options
particularly appealing to smaller companies.

10.      According to the Turkish Treasury, there are 93 registered players in the leasing market,
o f which 11 were non-deposit taking investment & development banks, 5 special finance
institutions and 77 self-standing leasing companies. According to the information obtained from
the Turkish Association o f Leasing Companies (FIDER), by the end o f 2004, only 5 o f the non-
deposit taking investment & development banks and around 35 o f the self-standing leasing
companies are active in the sector in addition to the 5 special finance institutions. Of the 35
currently active leasing companies, 3 are state-owned, 6 are owned by foreigners and 3 are
partially foreignjoint ventures.

11.      In2003 net leasing receivables of the leasing sector inTurkey increased by 51%inUS$
terms to US$2.2 billion (Figure 3). In T L terms, increase in net leasing receivables was 29%
given that Turkish lira appreciated and the US$/TL exchange rate decreased by 15%. In 2004,
growth inleasing transactions inthe sector pushed up the consolidated net leasing receivables by
35% to reach almost US$3 billion. In T L terms net leasing receivables increased by 32% in this
period.

12.      Based on the data from member leasing companies o f FIDER, by the end o f 2004, the
total assets o f the sector were US$3.58 billion, indicating a 40% increase from the US$2.57
billion level in 20033. In 2003, 10 largest companies in terms o f asset size held approximately
75% o f the total assets o f the sector. These are at the same time 10 top ranking companies in
terms o f new leasing volume and they also realized 75% o f the total new leasingvolume in 2003.

13.      According to the Turkish Treasury, total consolidated equity o f the sector was around
US$800 million by the end o f 2003. Solvency ratio (equitykotal assets) of the sector increased
from its 22% level in 2002 to 27% in 2003. According to the FIDER data concerning the 9

 FIDERmember companies' total asset size accounted for 95% o f the total assets o fthe whole sector according to
TurkishTreasury data in2002 and 2003.

million in 2003, representing a 52% growth inUS$ terms when compared to 2002. Growth rate
inthe TL basednetprofit was 50% in2003. The number ofnew leasingtransactions and leasing

14.    New leasing volume in 2003 grew to US$2.2 billion, indicating a 63% growth relative to
2002 in US$ terms. In 2004, the sector continued to grow where new leasing volume rose by
35% inUS$ terms and reached US$2.9 billion for the whole year. According to FIDER, in2004
share o f manufacturing and service related transactions as a percentage o f total lease volume
were 5 1% and 42% respectively. Textiles, food, paper, metal and machinery industries were the
five main sectors in the manufacturing area. In the service sector, construction, logistics,
telecom, financial services, health services, tourism and transportation vehicles services were the
areas with highest lease volume in2004.

15.    The Turkish leasing sector is growing steadily, with straightforward financial leasing
being the primary instrument offered. In fact, the existing 1985 Law on Leasing pretty much
discourages the other type - operational leasing - by setting a minimumlease term o f 4 years. A
new leasing law is being considered by the authorities, which should eliminate this and other
constraints, such as ambiguity regarding sale-and-leaseback, sub-leasing and dispute resolution,
to allow faster development o f leasing in Turkey by introducing new instruments. According to
the changes made in the tax regulations in July 2003, leasing companies record their leasing
transactions starting from that date in accordance with the International Accounting Standard 17
(leasing transactions are represented in net leasing receivables instead o f tangible assets and
leasing income i s recorded as leasinginterest income inthe income statement).

16.       Both banking and leasing sectors lack access to term funds. Access by the banking
system to medium and long-term funding sources has typically been limited during the past
several years due to unfavorable macro-economic circumstances, and became virtually non-
existent in the aftermath o f the 2000-01 crises. While market confidence has increased since,
there i s certainly no abundance yet o f medium or long term money on the market. All o f the top
leasing companies are owned by banks, and suffer from the same funding maturity limitations as
their parents. For instance, despite the legally prescribed minimum lease term o f 4 years, the
market practice i s to frontload lease payments into the first two years, and keeps the formal lease
contract idle for the remainder o f the term. Constant rollover o f short term fundingby the banks
i s still the most popular way o f providing term finance to the enterprise sector, which provides
the principal rationale for the Bank's involvement by providing medium and long-term funds to
exporters via the participating financial intermediaries under the proposed EFIL 111.

1.       The proposed EFIL I11 is a repeater project o f the predecessors EFIL Iand EFIL I1
projects. The first EFIL was implemented during 1999-2003 and was very successful in
disbursingnearly the full amount ofthe Loan (US$252.5 million), reaching out to many different
exporting industries all across Turkey by financing close to 100 exporting sub-projects, and
strengthening the financial sector by having the project PFIs undergo a comprehensive risk
management assessment and implement resulting recommendations,                 even before risk
management became an integral part o f the prudential requirementsfor the banks. The EFIL I1i s
under implementation and has a highutilization rate. InMarch 2005, US$220 million out o f the
total o f US$300 million were committed, andUS$190 million disbursed.

2.       Both the first EFIL, EFIL 11, and the proposed EFIL I11are part o f the Bank's multi-year
financial sector reform program for Turkey, which seeks to stabilize and support the further
development o f the Turkish financial system for the benefit o f the private sector and economic
growth. This program combines a series o f programmatic financial sector adjustment loans
(some o f which also encompass public sector reform measures) supporting top-down policy
reform with investment loans like EFIL I,EFIL 11, and EFIL 111, which facilitate bottom-up
interactionwith key players inthe financial sector. The program i s underpinned by several pieces
o f Economic and Sector Work, the most recent o f which (Report on Capital Markets and Non-
Bank Financial Institutions) has pointed out the importance o f diversifying and deepening the
financial system beyond banking. The inclusion o f leasing companies in the proposed EFIL I11
seeks to meet this objective.

                                 Annex 4: Project Description

1.      The Third Export Finance Intermediation Loan (EFIL 111) consists o f a single component
- financing o f sub-loans and leases under the project intwo tranches o f US$200 million and 80
million. Details are givenbelow.

2.      Under the project, the EFIL I11will provide medium and long-term financing for the
procurement o f goods and works by private exporters. The inputs could be procured locally or
externally on commercially competitive terms and will, therefore, benefit both direct and indirect
exporters.

3.      Borrower and ImplementingAgency: The Borrower and Implementing Agency for the
EFIL I11 will be TSKB, a privately owned investment & development bank, with the
Government issuing a guarantee to the World Bank. Turkish laws allow the Government to issue
guarantees to private non-deposit taking investment & development          banks, although not to
regular commercial banks. TSKB will act in the capacity o f a wholesale institution and will
onlend the loan funds through a group o f 4-8 private banks and 2-4 leasing companies which will
be selected pursuant to criteria agreed between the Borrower and the World Bank (see Annex 6).
TSKB will take the credit risk on the banks and leasing companies selected for participation. The
participating financial intermediaries in tum will make sub-loans and leases to private exporting
enterprises for procurement o f goods and works in order to expand their current export volumes,
or in exceptional circumstances to enable them to retain and maintain their current level o f
exports. The onlending banks and leasing companies will take the credit risks on the borrowing
enterprises.

4.      Due Diligence o f TSKB: TSKB was one o f the PFIs in the EFIL Iproject and i s the
borrower and the implementingagency for the EFIL I1project. Therefore, it i s well known to the
World Bank team through a regular exchange o f views on the implementation o f the EFIL I1and
through the reviews o f TSKB's audited reports and other financial reporting required under the
EFIL Iand EFIL 11. A review of TSKB's IFRS annual and audit reports for the years [2000-
20041 indicates that TSKB exceeds the minimumBIS risk weighted capital adequacy ratio o f 8
percent and maintains an overall sound financial and operational structure, and i s fit to undertake
the financial liability o f the Loan and operational commitments to act as a PIU for the project.

5.      Loan Terms: TSKB, based on its own funding mix and anticipated demand o f exporters,
has indicated a preference for a dual currency U S Dollar and Euro Fixed Spread Loan (FSL),
which it will then on-lend to participating banks and leasing companies for a period o f up to 7
years which will include a grace period o f up to 5 years. Inorder to offset its administrative and
implementation costs as well as the credit risks involved, TSKB will charge an on-lending
margin to the participating banks and leasing companies o f up to 300 basis points over its cost o f
funds under the World Bank loan, depending on the risk profile o f the borrowing intermediary.
The subsidiary loans made by TSKB to the participating banks and leasing companies will be
denominated and repayable in U S Dollars and Euro. The participating banks and leasing
companies are expected to price their sub-loans and leases which may be denominated and
repayable inany foreign currency on a commercial basis.




                                                  27

6.       Selection o f Participating Financial Intermediaries: A preliminary list o f 14 banks and 12
leasing companies has been compiled from the universe o f around 20 private commercial
Turkish banks and around 100 private leasing companies using the following pre-screening
criteria:


         1  For the banks - (i) assets during the last two years to exceed a minimum o f
                                   total
            US$500 million equivalent on average; and (ii)export loans-to-total loans ratios
            duringeach o fthe last two years (for which data is available) to exceed aminimumo f
             10 percent on average.


         1  For the leasing companies - (i) lease receivables during the last two years (for
                                               total
            which data are available) to exceed a minimum o f US$50 million equivalent on
             average; and (ii)  new lease volume during the last two years (for which data are
             available) to exceed a minimumo fUS$30 million equivalent on average.

7.       These criteria ensure that only financial intermediaries with an operational history, a
viable asset base and an export sector lending focus are selected for further screening. From this
group o f banks and leasing companies, a smaller group o f 4-8 banks and 2-4 leasing companies
will be selected as final participating financial intermediaries for the EFIL I11by TSKB based
on: (i) acceptance by TSKB o f their credit risk, (ii) expression o f interest in participation in
                                                      their
the project, and (iii) following eligibility criteria:
                       the


         1   For the banks - (i)general compliance with legal and regulatory requirements
             applicable to the banking industry, including but not limited to such prudential
             regulations as minimum BIS risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio, maximum foreign
             currency exposure limits, maximum large exposure to single and connected clients
             and maximum insider lending limits, etc., duly certified by the banks' auditors every
             six months, and (ii)IFRS financial statements audited in accordance with
             Intemational Standards o f Auditing (ISA) (see Appendix 4.3        -    Likely Profile o f
             PFIs, Pre-Qualification andFinalEligibility Criteria).


         1   For the leasing companies - (i)general compliance with legal and regulatory4
             requirements applicable to the leasing industry, including but not limited to such
             regulations as minimum equity capital o f a lessor o f no less than TRY3 million
             (US$2.24 million at end-2004 exchange rate), the total sum o f lease exposures not
             exceeding 30 times a lessor's equity capital, and the total sum o f exposures to related
             parties not exceeding 15 times the equity capital, duly certified by the leasing
             companies' external auditors every six months, (ii)  IFRS financial statements audited
             in accordance with Intemational Standards of Auditing (ISA) (see Appendix 4.3         -
             Likely Profile o f PFIs, Pre-Qualification and Final Eligibility Criteria), and (iii) the
             leasing company should have been profitable for at least two out o f the last three
             years o f operations.

8.       Eligible sub-borrowers: All private (private ownership more than 50 percent) exporters
with foreign exchange earnings, irrespective of their sector, will be eligible for participation as
sub-borrowers on a commercial basis. The prospective sub-borrowers will have to prepare and
present a complete sub-loan package consisting of TSKB credit application form and such other
information which TSKB and the Bank could reasonably request, as well as satisfy the
procurement and environmental rules stated as part o f the World Bank loan conditions. The
creditworthiness o f the sub-borrowers will be assessed by the PFIs, subject to the minimum
requirement that the sub-borrowers maintain a maximum debt equity ratio o f 80:20 and
minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.2:1 (both after receipt of the sub-loan andor lease).
The World Bank, in coordination with TSKB, will carry out a prior review o f the first two sub-
loan applications o f each o f the participating banks and leasing companies to satisfy itself about
the credit analysis process carried out by these financial intermediaries5.




 For the first two sub-loans with existing PFIs of EFIL 11, the prior review requirements will be waived. However
they will apply for newPFIs and for the $5.OM sub-project threshold.

          *While it is expected that both participating PFIs and sub-borrowers themselves will contribute to the
          financing of individual sub-projects, the precise amount of such financing to be provided cannot be
          determined ex ante, as the loan design does not envisage the use of predetermined cofinancing

  reporting related to preparation o f Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) according to
  the formats agreed with the World Bank. In order to record, monitor and report on
  the transactions related to the project activities, specific balance sheet and income
  statement accounts for these transactions will be opened within TSKB's chart o f
  accounts. The main accounting system will be supplemented by a Management

           reconciliation o f these accounts between TSKB, the PFIs and the World Bank will
           also be carried out by the PIU. The PIU will furthermore ensure that audits o f the

1.      TSKB (Turkish IndustrialDevelopmentBank), the proposedborrower and location
of the Project ImplementationUnit (PlU) under the EFlL 111Loan, was one of the PFls in
the EFIL, Iproject and currently is the Borrower of the EFlL I1 Loan. As such, it is well
known to the World Bank team through regular exchange o f vie\\ s on the implementation o f the
EFIL Iand EFIL 11, and through reviews o fTSKE3's audited reports and other financial reporting
required under the projects. A review o f TSKB's lFRS annual and audit reports for the years
2000-2004 indicates that TSKB exceeds the minimum BIS risk weighted capital adequacy ratio
of 8 percent and maintains an overall sound financial and operational structure, and i s fit to
undertake the financial liability o f the Loan and operational commitments to act as the PIU for
the project.

3       Since its foundation in 1950, TSKB has played an active role in every stage of Turkey's
economic development, facilitating a number o f "firsts" in the manufacturing industry and the
financial sector. TSKB - through its support and extension o f medium-term loans for more than
4000 investment projects - has significantly contributed to the progress and development o f the
private sector. Over the past 35 years, the bank also provided financing b y way of participating
inthe share capital ofmore than 100 companies.

things, allow-s the banks to rcccive Government guarantees on their borrowings, and to provide
lease finance from their own sources. TSKB is a majority privately owned bank. A s an
investment &: development bank, 'I'SKB does not accept retail deposits. 'Ihe activities o f TSKB

6.      Lending. TSKB, as an investment & development bank, maintains the objective to
provide the market with medium and long term loans, mostly for the purpose o f investment.
In fact, foreign currency-denominated long-term loans dominate the asset side of TSKB's
balance sheet. Such long term credit relations require a comprehensive analysis o f the
borrowing companies besides a close cooperation with the clients. While providing medium
and long term loans to entrepreneurs for their domestic and foreign investments, TSKB also
extends short-term working capital loans to meet their financing requirement inthe operating
period. Furthermore, the bank provides to its clients all banking services in relation with
foreign trade financing. Finally, TSKB also offers financial lease facilities.

7.      Over the past several years, TSKB has been consistently providing significant
amounts o f medium and long-term lending (Figure 5 - the large increase in 2001 i s partially
due to retroactive restatement of TSKB's financials to include SYB which merged with
TSKB inMarch 2002).

9.      Funding. TSKB's main sources o f funding are foreign development and commercial
bank loans, loans from international financial institutions (IFIS),
                                                                 and small-scale borrowing
in international capital markets. As of end-2004, the funds borrowed include borrowings
from the European Investment Bank, the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation,
Akbank, the World Bank, KfW, Dresdner Bank and other intemational and local banks and
IFIs. In2004, TSKB signed a US$50 million subordinated loan agreement with IFC. Funding
composition in2004 was as follows:

10.     FWmaturity exposure. TSKB has been in constant compliance with the BDDK
regulations regarding foreign exchange exposure, and generally maintains a prudently

balanced asset/liability mix Interms o f maturity structure. As for maturity structure, TSKB's
medium and long-term lending i s funded primarily by medium and long-term borrowings
from the intemational commercial and development banks and IFIs, providing for a proper
maturity match. In addition, TSKB has strong overall risk management procedures inplace
andholds a portfolioofliquid assetsas part o fits liquidityrisk management strategy.

                          F. Asset CompositionandCreditPolicies

11.    During the last few years, TSKB increased its share of loans in total assets from 50
percent to close to 60 percent, which i s much higher than the banking system's average 30
per cent in 2004. Medium and long-term loans make up the bulk o f TSKB's lending. The
asset composition o f TSKB i s provided below:

12.     Credit Policies. TSKB extends long, medium and short-term loans within the
framework o f principles and limits determined by the Board o f Directors. The Board o f
Directors approve the credit line and project-financing packages recommended by the Credit
Committee. The Credit Committee, formed by the President and the Executive Vice
Presidents and attended by the Department Heads o f Loans, Financial Analysis, Economics
and Research, Engineeringand Operations discusses the loan application on the basis o f the
credit report prepared by TSKB's research team generally formed by an engineer, an
economist and a financial analyst from the TSKB staff. The credit report aims at estimating
the cost and benefit o f the investment project under evaluation with respect to profitability,
economic benefit and undertaker risk. Basically the investment project i s evaluated under
economic, technical and financial sub-topics, within a time perspective o f roughly five years.
Technical and economic analysis i s carried out by the specialized staff within these fields.
The credit report is therefore composed o f these three different analysis integrated and
interpreted in a single text by the financial analyst. All decisions regarding lending and
collateral are given on the basis o f the credit report.

                                                  44

13.     TSKB extends loans against collateral. The basic policy conceming collateral is to
obtain a mortgage o f first degree on the plant to be set up or to obtain a bank letter o f
guarantee. When deemed necessary TSKB resorts to other types o f collateral such as
mortgage on property outside the plant, bank letter o f guarantee and personal guarantee. In
case o fjoint financing with other financial institutions, a mortgage may be established jointly
infavour ofthe institutions concernedor apool sharing agreement providing for proportional
claim on the proceeds o f the existingmortgage may be concluded. Sometimes Treasury Bills
or Government Bonds issued by the Turkish Republic may also be deposited as collateral.
Because of being regarded as the most liquid type o f collateral these Bonds have a positive
effect on the capital adequacy ratio requirement just like the bank letter o f guarantee and the
mortgage o f first degree.

14.     One o f the main objectives o f TSKB i s to ensure the proper use o f its loans. With this
objective inview: in the case o f loans to be used for the importation o f goods, disbursements
are made exclusively by TSKB; in export and import financing, transactions have been
concluded in a manner acceptable to TSKB and in the case o f local currency loans,
disbursement will depend on the realization o f conditions laid down previously. Within this
framework, the Loans, Operations, Treasury and Technical Services Departments o f TSKB
co-operate to observe the proper implementation o f disbursement and collection. The
companies financed by TSKB and the sectors they belong to are also followed up
periodically. The purpose o f the follow-up is to ensure that the investments are completed in
time and conditions set forth are satisfied as well as to identify the problems arising during
the implementation and operation stage so as to be able to render assistanceto the companies
insolving their problems.

15.     It has been a common practice in TSKB to evaluate periodically (once inthree or six
months) the financial statements o f the companies in which there's TSKB involvement.
Within this framework the credit limitsonce approvedhave beenrevised, raised or cancelled
by the Credit Committee especially when the original approval date is earlier than two years.
As an independent evaluation, in the credit contracts it is stated that the annual financial
statements and accounting records o f the company should be audited by an auditing firm
acceptable to TSKB in accordance with the International Auditing Procedures and Principles
and results should be deliveredto TSKB during the lifetime o fthe loan.

                   G. CapitalAdequacy,Asset Quality and CapitalBase

16.     TSKB maintains a policy o f requiring bank guarantees for part o f its loans to non-
bank borrowers. Having bank risk versus company risk on its loan book reduces the capital
requirement for TSKB, as exposure to OECD-zone banks is risk-weighted at only 20%,
compared to 100% for non-bank borrowers, in calculating its capital adequacy ratio (CAR).
At six-monthly intervals starting at end-2002, TSKB has kept its CAR inthe range o f 22.11-
44.14 percent. The CAR as o f December 31, 2004 i s 44 percent. A t the end o f 2004, the
TSKB loan book is $1 billion with asset base o f US$1.7 billion. Besides, there is US$174
million utilization from EFIL I1 line o f IBRD. The NPL ratio has significantly decreased
from 7.5 percent in 2003 to 4 percent in 2004. This i s mainly due to success in cash
collections from rescheduled loans. After application o f BASEL I1regulations for calculation
of CAR, TSKB's CAR i s projected to decrease from the current 44 percent to approximately
16 percent still comfortably above the minimumrequirement o f 8 percent.

17.     TSKB has beenprofitable for the last few years with the exception o f 2001. In2001,
the bank incurred significant losses as a result o f the TL devaluation inthat year resulting in
negative net operating income and a net loss for the year. The results have improved
considerably beginningthe year 2002.

18.     The impact o f the crises i s also visible in the bank's retum-on-assets and return on
equity ratios, which both tumed negative in 2001, but recovered in 2002. This experience is
inlinewith the experience of other Turkishbanks,which also incurred losses during2001 as
a result o f the crisis in that year and the associated extraordinary exchange rate and interest
rate volatility, which imposed sizeable losses on almost all banks, bothdirectly and indirectly
through the concomitant deterioration inthe banks' loan books. After the 2001 crises and the
mergerwith SYB the Bank has regained its profitability and reputation invery short term. As

                Likely Profileof ParticipatingBanksandLeasingCompanies
                        Pre-qualificationand FinalEligibilityCriteria

                             A. TypicalParticipatingBankProfile

1.      There were 48 banks in the Turkish banking system at end-December, 2004. These
include private commercial banks, state owned banks, foreign banks, and non-deposit taking
investment & development banks. Out o f this universe, TSKB has active banking
relationship with 36 Turkish banks.         In order to determine the level of prudent credit
exposure on any one of these banks, TSKB carries out on a semi-annual basis a risk
assessment o f these banks by analyzing their financial information including capital
adequacy, profitability, and liquidity ratios. However, in the interest o f efficient
implementation o f EFIL 111, and following the successful approach used in the first two
EFILs, it was agreed that the number o f participating banks are likely to be 4-8. This would
enable an amount o f approximately $30-50 million equivalent to be intermediated by each
bank and allow the World Bank and TSKB to create the right incentives for the selected
banks to focus their management time and effort on timely and efficient implementation o f
the EFIL 111.

2.      Secondary objective of EFIL I11i s to continue a dialogue with the leading private
sector commercial banks and encourage them to improve their financial intermediation skills
and volume, by maintaining prudent and rigorous credit appraisal standards and expanding
their operations towards increasing the share of credit to the private sector in their balance
sheets.

3.      Inorder to achieve these objectives, the selected banks shouldhave (i)proven track
                                                                                 a
record o f lending to exporters, and (ii)a certain `critical mass' in terms o f their balance
sheets and, a reasonable level of branch networks. Finally, the participating banks have to
demonstrate full and continuous compliance with the technical and prudential standards
applicable to their activities, and a clear drive towards increasing lendingto the private sector
as a share o f their total assets.

4.      The selection o f the participating banks i s therefore being undertaken in two stages:
(i) pre-qualification, and (ii) eligibility and selection. The pre-qualification criteria are
                                 final
listedbelow:
    0   The banks should be privately owned, domestically incorporatedcommercial banks;
    0   Minimumtotal asset size shouldbe at least US$500 million equivalent, and the banks
        should have maintained this minimum asset size for each o f the last two years. This
        would establish that the pre-qualified      banks have at least a minimum size o f
        operations on a consistent basis for two years running; and
    0   The pre-qualified banks (as determined by information compiled by TSKJ3) should
        have a minimum export loans/total loans ratio o f 10percent for the last two years on
        average for which data i s available. This would establish that the pre-qualified banks
        have a proven export orientation in their lending operations and maintained this
        orientation consistently for the last two years.

6.      Final selection of participating banks. The banks to be selected for parti ipation
will have to meet the final eligibility criteria mentioned below, be an acceptable credit risk to
TSKB, and have expressed interest in participation in the credit line. All the capital based
criteria would have to be certified by the banks' external auditors as o f the latest available
half-year period.
                                       C. General Criteria

7.      The participating bank shall remain in general compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements applicable to its operations, including but not limited to BDDK-promulgated
prudential regulations regarding capital adequacy, large exposures, related lending, and
foreign currency exposures, as (re)confinned by the bank's auditors in writing on a semi-
annual basis.

                                        D. Audit Criteria

8.      The participating bank shall, at the time o f selection and for the duration o f its
subsidiary loan agreement with TSKB, for each year-end beginning with year-end 2004,
present an audit report which:
                                                 48

    0   Covers two full years o f operations;
    0   Is prepared by an intemationally recognized external audit firm in accordance with
        International Standards o f Auditing and International Financial Reporting Standards
        (IFRS); and
    0   Unless otherwise agreed by the Bank, contains an unqualified audit opinion.

                      E. Typical Participating Leasing Company Profile

9.      There are 93 registered leasing companies in Turkey, o f which 11 were non-deposit
taking investment & development banks, 5 special finance institutions and 77 self-standing
leasing companies. According to the information obtained from the Turkish Association o f
Leasing Companies (FIDER), by the end o f 2004, only 5 o f the non-deposit taking
investment & development banks and around 35 o f the self-standing leasing companies are
active in the sector in addition to the 5 special finance institutions. The total asset size o f the
leasing industry was US$2.8 billion as o f end 2003, and increased to US$3.6 billion by the
end o f 2004, o f which lease receivables constituted 84 percent. At the end o f 2004, business
volume (new leases) o f the industry reached US$2.9 billion, compared to US$2.2 billion for
the entire year 2003, suggesting a 35% increase. Total shareholders' equity on September 30,
2004 was US$900 million indicating a 28% solvency ratio. The total assets o f the 10 largest
companies together accounted for 75 percent o f the overall industry's assets by the end-2003
and 75 percent o f new business volume in2003, suggestingthe presence o f a large number o f
marginal players.

10.     It was agreed between the Bank and TSKB that the number o f participating leasing
companies i s likely to be 2-4 to enable the EFIL I11 funds to be intermediated most
effectively by the strongest industryplayers. This would allow an amount of approximately
US$lO-20 million equivalent to be intermediated by each leasing company and enable the
World Bank and TSKB to create the right incentives inthe selected companies to focus their
management time and effort on timely and efficient implementation o f the EFIL 111.

11.     A secondary objective of EFILI11is to continue the dialogue with the leading private
leasing companies and build a consensus with them on the best way to improve the leasing
environment and the prospects for further development o fthe leasing industryinTurkey.

 12.    Inorder to achieve these objectives, the selected pre-qualified companies should have
(i)acertain `critical mass' interms oftheir leasereceivables, and(ii)provenabilityto
                                                                              a
generate new leasing volume. Finally, the leasing companies selected to participate have to
demonstrate full and continuous compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to their
activities.

 13.    The selection o f the participating leasing companies has therefore been planned in
two stages: (i) pre-qualification, and (ii) eligibility and selection. The pre-qualification
                                           final
criteria used are listedbelow:


    0   The leasingcompanies should be privately owned;
    0   Minimum lease receivables should be at least US$50 million equivalent, and the
        leasing companies should have maintained this size on average for the last two years
        inorder to establish a minimumsize criteria; and


                                               49

     0    The pre-qualified leasing companies should have a minimum new leasing volume o f
          US$30 million on average for the last two years. This would establish that the pre-
          qualified leasing companies have a proven track record o f active operations.

                                             F. Pre-qualified Short List

14.       The pre-qualification process has ledto apreliminary list o f 12 leasingcompanies.

Country Issues

3.      A Country Financial Accountability Assessment for Turkey was carried out in2001.
The CFAA report identified some weaknesses inthe Turkishfinancial accountability, inboth
the public and the private sector. Main findings in the public sector accountability covered
issues like failure to define and control the entirety o f public funds, incomplete audit
coverage, weak forces o f public accountability, narrow accounting model and procurement
risks. Main findings in the private sector accounting and auditing are the existence o f a
regulatory approach where specialized agencies each devise and enforce their and different
obligations without adequate coordination and where there i s no common general platform.

4.      U S 1 6 5 million and 35 million o f EFIL I11are envisaged to be disbursed through
banks. The 1999 Banks Law established the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency,
and among its powers i s the power to determine the accounting and auditing requirements
applicable to the banks under its supervision. Banks must submit non-audited monthly
prudential returns to the BDDK, and publish audited annual financial statements. Only
auditors approved by the BDDK may carry out such audits. All changes in auditor must also
be approved, and a change can be imposed where there is dissatisfaction with the
performance o f the auditor. The external auditor i s required to report to the BDDKon banks'
intemal control and risk management systems, as well as being obliged to report direct to the
BDDKwith respect to certain issues which may threaten the going concern nature o fabank.

5.      Until the 1999 banking law reforms, the Council of Ministers rather than banking
supervisors, were responsible for promulgating requirements in areas such as loan loss

                                             51

provisioning, and these rules were relaxed twice in response to the Asian and Russian
financial crises (in February 1998 and August 1999). Requirements with respect to the
calculation o f capital adequacy on a consolidated basis, and to disclosures in the areas o f
large exposures, connected lending, foreign exchange exposures, interest rate risk exposures,
and maturity risk exposures also fell short o f the relevant EU, Base1 Committee and IFRS
norms. This served to undermine the quality and relevance o f information provided to
regulators and to the market, and has led to weakening the early-warning signals provided by
financial statements and to understating the extent o f problems which exist. Since December
1999, efforts were made to strengthen significantly the regulatory and institutional
infrastructure for banking regulation (including the creation o f the BDDK), including
upgrading o f the relevant financial reporting obligations. In June 2000, the Treasury issued
an instruction which brought disclosure rules for banks closer to International Accounting
Standards, and in June 2001, the BDDK issued a new Regulation on Chartering and
Operations o f Banks, which further enhances public disclosure requirements.

6.       The Bank in 1999 has extended the Export Finance Intermediation Loan (EFIL I)                                     to
Eximbank where Treasury acted as the guarantor. Eximbank acted as an APEX bank and
extended credit lines to Participating Financial Institutions (PFI) for on lending to beneficiary
enterprises. At the inception o f EFIL Ithe PFIs were obliged under the terms o f SLAs to
remain in compliance with "prudential" ratios which were stricter than those imposed on the
banking system by the Turkish bank regulatory authorities (at the time the Turkish Treasury
and the Central Bank). As conditionality for FSAL and later PFPSAL the prudential
regulations for the Turkish banking system were tightened and inM a y 2001, the SLAs were
amended to replace the original "prudential" ratios with those set forth in the (new) banking
law and regulations issuedby BDDK. The latter patternwas followed inthe EFIL I1SLAs.

7.       The BDDK issued a new comprehensive regulation on accounting standards for
banks in July 2002, which brings these standards in line with IFRS. However, the BDDK
regulation does not require hll application o f IFRS 27 (consolidation o f subsidiaries), as
banks only have to consolidate their financial subsidiaries, while for non-financial
subsidiaries separate financial statement disclosure i s mandated. The statements o f such non-
financial subsidiaries are not IFRS-based', however, and thus their disclosure will not allow
the user to consolidate these with the IFRS-based consolidated statements o f the parent bank
and its financial subsidiaries. Also, as the IFRS are subject to change, any such change will
necessitate an adjustment o fthe BDDK regulation.

8.       The BDDK also issues rules goveming the external audit o f bank financial
statements, and only auditors approved by the BDDK may carry out such audits. The
"Regulation on Principles for Independent Auditing'' and the "Regulation on Authorization
o f the Auditing Institutions and Permanent or Temporary Withdrawal o f their Authorities",
both published in the Official Gazette Nr. 24657 on January 31, 2002; these regulations are
broadly inline with ISA.

9.       TSKB has been assessed for compliance with BDDK prudential regulations by the
project team and found to be in compliance. The participating banks are not yet determined
however their compliance with BDDK prudential regulations is conditionality for initial and
continued eligibility.

6        Only if all non-financial subsidiaries of a bank are listed or publicly held, and only if the CMB requires the use of
full IFRS for all listed or publicly held entities, will the financial statements for such non-financial subsidiaries be IFRS-
based and allow full consolidation with the IFRS-basedfinancial statements of the parent bank and its financial subsidiaries.
                                                               52

10.      US$35 million and 15 million o f EFIL I11are envisaged to be disbursed through
financial leasing companies inTurkey. Leasing companies inTurkey are subject to Financial
Leasing Law enacted in 1985 and the Regulations Dealing with the Establishment and
Activities o f Financial Leasing Companies were last amended in 1992. Leasing companies
were initially regulated and supervised by the Banking and Foreign Exchange Department o f
the Treasury. According to the leasing law, the leasing companies should be joint stock
companies with a minimum paid in capital of around US$2.24 million. Total lease
transactions o f the companies could not exceed 30 times a leasing companies net worth (15
times for transactions with connected parties). There is not a limit on single party exposure
and there is no active supervisionby the Treasury.

11.     Quoted leasing companies are subject to the accounting principles published by
Capital Markets Board. The changed regulations requiring the application o f IFRS 17,
became applicable after July 1, 2003. Therefore due to different accounting policies applied
the financial statements o f leasing companies are far from reflecting the real financial
positions o f these entities. However due to these inconsistent application o f accounting
principles, it i s common practice for leasing companies to have financial statements prepared
in accordance with IFRS and audited in accordance with ISA. Eighty percent o f the
transaction volume in the leasing industry i s handled by 10 large leasing companies in the
sector, and we have been informed that they would all have IFRS financial statements
available for the last three years. Therefore our criteria o f initial and continued eligibility will
be based on calculations derived from IFRS financial statements.

Risk Mitigation Strategy

13.     Country financial management risk - the CFAA has identified major weaknesses in
the Turkish financial accountability, inboth the public, private and the banking sector. These
risks together with the developments in the sector after the preparation o f CFAA have been
explained in detail in the "Country Issues" section. The project team's assessment o f the
banks` compliance with the BDDK prudential regulations showed that the bank i s in
compliance with the BDDKprudential regulations.

14.     The accounting standards applicable to the banks differ with respect to consolidation
from International Financial reporting Standards (IFRS). The financial intermediaries which
will manage the credit lines to export companies will submit their IFRS based audited
financial statements to the Bank in addition to their audited financial statements prepared in
accordance with the BDDK accounting standards. TSKB will bear the credit risk for the
loans it extends to the PFIs and the PFIswill bear the credit risk on the credits made available
to export companies.

Strengths and Weaknesses

15.     The significant strengths that provide the basis o f reliance on the project financial
management system include: (a) TSKB has been successfully implementing EFIL 11; (b)
Disbursementsto the export companies will be made upon submission o f the invoices for the
expenditures and TSKB will be responsible for the control o f these invoices inaddition to the
PFIs; and (c) Funds will be disbursed through PFIs which will be selected for their financial
strength and capacity to appraise and supervise credit lines.

16.     There are no significant weaknesses inthe project financial management system.

Implementing Entity

17.     The loan i s a credit line and the borrower and the implementing entity o f the loan will
be TSKB. TSKB will then on-lend to PFIs for lending to exporters. Treasury will be the
guarantor o f the loan. EFIL I11is a follow up project and TSKB i s currently implementing
EFIL11.

 18.    TSKB was established in 1950 with the support o f the World Bank and the
cooperation o f the Government o f the Republic o f Turkey, Central Bank o f Turkey and
leading commercial banks o f Turkey. TSKB has been founded for the purpose o f (i)
providing assistance to private sector enterprises in all sectors o f the economy primarily in
the industrial sector (ii) encourage and assist the participation o fprivate and foreign capital
                         to
incorporations established and to be established in Turkey (iii) assist the development o f
                                                                   to
the capital market inTurkey.

 19.    TSKB's largest shareholder is the I s Bank Group by 53.3 percent. Consolidated
financial statements are prepared for I s Bankasi and therefore there i s no consolidation
requirement for TSKB. TSKB has internal regulations and manuals for internal control and
risk management in compliance with the banking law.



                                                54

20.      A project coordination team (PCT) is designated at TSKB under the supervision o f
one o f its executive vice presidents to oversee the implementation o f EFIL I1and they will
also be responsible for the coordination o f EFIL 111. The staffs currently working on EFILI1
are very experienced and highly qualified. The same staffs will be the primary project
counterpart for the Bank team and will provide the overall administration o f all aspects o f the
credit line and required reporting to the Bank.

21.      The core o f the EFIL I11PFIs will most likely be all or some o f the EFIL I1PFIs, as
well as a few other banks and leasing companies. Signing subsidiary loan agreements with
two PFIs, which have undergone the qualification process i s an effectiveness condition for
the loan. Compliance with the prudential regulations set out by BDDK i s required for
continuing eligibility o f TSKB and the PFIs. This will be monitored through (a) prudential
regulation compliance certificate and (b) annual audit reports. This certification will be
issued by the banks' external auditors. Leasing companies have been financial intermediaries
in World Bank projects in Turkey for the first time under the EFIL I1facility. Eligibility
indicators have been identified and agreed with TSKB for the leasing companies and TSKB
will be responsible for monitoring the continuous compliance o f the leasing companies with
the eligibility criteria.

22.      The risk associated with the implementing entityis negligible.

Funds Flow

23.      There will be two special accounts in the name o f TSKB inUSD and in Euro for the
project. The Authorized Allocated amount o f the two special accounts will be 10% o f the
USD Loan Tranche amount (USD 20,000,000) and 10% o f the Euro Tranche Amount (Euro
8,000,000). The initial amount for USD Tranche Special Account would beU S D 10,000,000
and for Euro Tranche Euro 4,000,000.        The full Authorized Allocated amount would be
provided once disbursements for USD Tranche reaches USD 40,000,000 and for Euro when
the disbursements reach Euro 16,000,000. Funds from the loan will be made available to
PFIs following submission o f payment documents (invoices for the goods and works
purchased by the export companies) to TSKB. This information will be given to TSKB in
electronic form as is done under EFIL I1and TSKB will be responsible for controlling these
invoices.

24.      In addition to Special Accounts, the Bank may require withdrawals from the Loan
Account to be made on the basis o f statements o f expenditure for expenditures for: (a)
contracts for goods costing less than $5,000,000 equivalent each; and (b) contracts for works
costing less than $5,000,000 equivalent each under such terms and conditions as the Bank
shall specify by notice to the Borrower

25.      Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing in an aggregate amount not exceeding
$40,000,000, for the USD Tranche and EUR 16,000,000 for the EUR Tranche, may be made
in respect o f Sub-loans or the Lease Financing made in accordance with criteria and
procedures set forth inthe LoanAgreement and Operational Manualbefore that date but after
August 31,2004.

26.      The risk associated with funds flow is assessedas negligible.



                                               55

Staffing

27.     TSKB has staffs assigned to work on the project. These staffs are highly qualified and
have gained experience in EFIL 11. The qualifications and experience o f these staffs are
satisfactory to the Bank.

28.     The risk associated with staffing i s negligible.

Accounting Policies and Procedures

29.     The financial management capacity at TSKB i s satisfactory. The Bank has qualified
personnel, adequate manuals and guidelines to conduct efficient financial management. The
accounting and reporting systems at the bank are geared toward producing statements and
information as required by Turkish law and regulations as well as International Accounting
Standards.

30.     TSKB has developed a web based application, approval and monitoring system for
the loans where it acts as an APEX bank. The system i s accessible by the PFIs from the web.
The PFIs make their initial application as well as their withdrawal applications from EFIL I1
byusingthe system and are able to monitor the status o f each application on a realtime basis
form the web. The system has adequate security levels and i s fully integrated into the
management information system o f the bank. The quarterly FMRs for EFIL I1are generated
automatically by the system. The system is very efficient and has contributed to the rapid
implementation o f EFIL 11.The same systemwill also be used for EFIL111.

31.     TSKB has a manual that explains the work flow for EFIL I1and the same manual will
be used for EFIL111.The bank provided training to EFIL I1PFIs on the use o f the web based
system and has distributed copies o f the manual. The same procedures will be followed for
new PFIs inEFIL 111.

32.     The risk associated with accountingpolicies and procedures is assessedas negligible.

Internal Audit

33.     TSKB has internal audit and internal control departments staffed with qualified audit
professionals who are capable o f producing audit tasks. The internal auditors have audited
transactions in EFIL I1 and they do not have any recommendations relating to the loan.
Transactions under EFIL I11will also be subject to internal audit as a part o f banks' credit
portfolio audits.

34.     The risk associated with internal audit is negligible.

Reporting and Monitoring

35.     TSKB currently maintains records and ensures appropriate accounting for the funds
provided under EFIL I1and same systems will be relied upon for EFIL 111. The formats and
contents o f the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR) will be the same as EFIL 11. The FMR
will be prepared quarterly and will be submitted to the Bank no later than 45 days after the
endo fthe quarterly period.

36.     The risk associated with reporting andmonitoring is negligible.

Information Systems

37.     TSKB has developed a web based application, approval and monitoring system for
the loans where it acts as an APEX bank. The systemi s accessible by the PFIs fi-om the web.
The PFIs make their initial application as well as their withdrawal applications from EFIL I1
byusing the system and are able to monitor the status o f each application on areal time basis
form the web. The system has adequate security levels and i s fully integrated into the
management information system o f the bank. The quarterly FMRs for EFIL I1are generated
automatically by the system. The system is very efficient and has contributed to the rapid
implementation o f EFIL 11.The same system will also be used for EFIL111.

38.     The risk associated with information systems is negligible.

Supervision Plan

39.     During project implementation, the Bank will supervise the project's financial
management arrangements in two main ways: (i)        review the project's quarterly financial
management reports as well as the banks' and project's annual audited financial statements
and auditor's management letter; and (ii)  duringthe Bank's supervision missions, review the
project's financial management and disbursement arrangements (including a review o f a
sample o f SOEs and movements on the Special Account) to ensure compliance with the
Bank's minimum requirements. As required, a Bank-accredited Financial Management
Specialist will assist inthe supervision process.

                                           B. Audit

40.     Annual and six-monthly (limited review) audits o f TSKB are undertaken on an
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) basis in accordance with International
Auditing Standards by a reputed international auditing firm. The current auditors o f TSKB
are Deloitte and Touche`s member firm in Turkey. The last three years` audit reports (in
 accordance with IFRS) are reviewedand all were unqualified. Audit o f the EFIL I1financial
 statements (project balance sheet, sources and uses o f funds and special account statement)
 are also included in the auditors TOR and audit o f EFIL I11will also be integrated into the
 auditors TOR. TSKB has been engaging the services o f international auditors for several
years and the current auditing arrangements under EFIL I1are satisfactory to the Bank.

 41.    The PFIs will also submit annual audited accounts to TSKB. It is common practice
 for the expected PFIs to have their accounts prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and audited in accordance with ISA. As the additional
 PFIs under EFIL I11are not known at this stage the engagement o f auditors for the new ones
 will not be a specific board condition. There are satisfactory audit arrangements inplace for
 the PFIs under EFIL 11.

 42.    The risk associated with EFIL I11is assessedas negligible.

                        Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements

                                            A. General

1.     The procurement for the proposed project would be carried out inaccordance with the
World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y
2004, and provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement. The procurement arrangements are
described below.

2.     Procurement of Goods: Procurement o f goods and related services (installation and
maintenance) financed under the proposed project will be according to the World Bank
Procurement Guidelines. For contracts below US$5.0 million equivalent, established local
private sector commercial practices will be followed in accordance with paragraph 3.12 o f
the Procurement Guidelines. Care has to be taken of other relevant factors such as time o f
delivery, efficiency and reliability o f the goods and availability o f maintenance facilities and
spare parts thereof, and in case o f non-consultant services, o f the quality and competence o f
the parties rendering them. Advertising in the local and intemational press will not be
mandatory. However, International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would be required for
individual contracts o f US$5.O million equivalent and above for goods and related services.
All procurement o f goods and related services under contracts equal to or above US$5.0
million equivalent will be subject to the World Bank's prior review. Contracts placed by sub-
borrowers on their subsidiary or affiliated companies will not be eligible for financing out o f
the Loan. The procurement o f the second hand goods is not eligible for financing out o f the
Loan.

3.     Procurementof Works. Procurement o f works financed under the proposed project
will be according to the World Bank Procurement Guidelines. For civil works estimated to
cost less than US$5.O million equivalent per contract, established local private sector
commercial practices will be followed in accordance with paragraph 3.12 o f the Procurement
Guidelines. For contracts US$5.O million equivalent and above, International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) would be required for individual contracts. All ICB contracts for works shall
be subject to prior review by the World Bank. Contracts placed by sub-borrowers on their
subsidiary or affiliated companies will not be eligible for financing out o f the Loan.


B. Assessment of the Agency's Capacity to Implement Procurementand Private Sector
ProcurementPracticein Turkey

4.     Procurement Capacity Assessment: In case o f procurement under sub-loans and
leases, the Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs) will be responsible for ensuring that
the procurement rules for sub-loans and leases specified below are followed by the sub-
borrowers. TSKB will be responsible for reviewing and monitoring the compliance with the
procurement rules by the intermediary banks and leasing companies, and their sub-borrowers
(beneficiary enterprises). A specialist assigned for the procurement arrangements within the
TSKB PIU will be responsible for all procurement oversight for the management o f the
project. The PIU will keep the records and copies o f the documents o f the procurements
handled through the intermediary banks and leasing companies. The World Bank will
conduct regular post reviews o f the sub-projects not requiringa prior review, The PIUwill be


                                                58

responsible for assembling the documentation related to specific procurement transactions
from the PFIs and sub-borrowers inorder to facilitate the Bank's reviews.

5.     TSKB i s responsible for the implementation o f EFIL I1project, and no procurement
problem has been encountered in this project so far. An assessment o f the capacity o f the
TSKB to implement procurement actions for the project has been carried out by Salih Kemal
Kalyoncu on March 22, 2005. The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for
implementing the project and the interaction between the project's staff responsible from the
procurement activities. The overall project risk for procurement i s average.

6.     Private Sector Procurement Practice in Turkey: In the Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) dated June 2001, it was determined that there are well
established commercial practices for the procurement o f goods, works and services by the
private sector enterprises, autonomous commercial enterprises and individuals. In case o f
goods, the local practice i s to prepare the technical specifications and solicit quotations from
the local and/or international market. In case o f medium and large works, the technical
specifications are usually prepared by consultant companies and bids are collected from
qualified contractors. Minor works are generally tendered on a lump sum basis by collecting
bids from a number o f local contractors. When equipment and machinery is needed for
expansion o f existing facilities, the purchasers usually prefer proprietary goods from a single
source for the sake o f standardization and minimization o f the operation and maintenance
cost. Therefore, the local private sector or commercial practices can be considered to be
consistent with the World Bank's criteria with respect to economy and efficiency. The
general rule in the sector is to procure the least cost goods, works and services consistent
with minimumquality requirements.


                  C.Procurement Plan and General Procurement Notice

7.    A t the appraisal stage or during the implementation o f the Project, it i s not possible to
estimate neither the sub-borrowers nor their procurement requirements. Therefore, it is not
possible for the Borrower to develop a Procurement Plan which provides the basis for the
procurement methods. Similarly, since the contract sizes and the methods can not be
estimated it i s not possible to prepare and publish a General Procurement Notice. It is
expected that each sub-borrower will provide a list o f procurements planned under the sub-
loan. In case any sub-project includes ICB, special procurement notice will be published in
accordance with the Procurement Guidelines.


            D.Frequency of Procurement Supervision andReview Procedures

8.    The Bank will review the procurement arrangements proposed/performed by TSKB in
every year, including contract packaging, applicable procedures, and the scheduling o f the
procurement processes, for its conformity with Bank Procurement Guidelines, the proposed
implementation program and disbursement schedule.

(a) Prior Review: The following procurement action and documentation would be subject
to Prior Review by the Bank in accordance with the procedures set forth inparagraphs 2 and
3 o f Appendix 1to the Procurement Guidelines.


                                                59

        For Contracts awarded through ICB; prior review o f all Bidding Documents, Bid
        Evaluation Reports, Recommendations o f Contract Award and draft Contract will be
        conducted.

        For Contracts awarded through Commercial Practices; prior review o f the first
        contract will be conducted for each PFI.

(b) Post Review: The procurement documents for all other contracts shall be subject to the
Bank's post review inaccordance with the procedures set forth inparagraph 5 o f Appendix 1
to the Procurement Guidelines on a random basis, one in five contracts. Post review o f the
procurement documents will normally be undertaken during the Bank supervision mission or
as the Bank may request to review any particular contracts at any time. In such cases, the
TSKB shall provide the Bank for its review the relevant documentation. The post review
shall be.conductedby the Bank's Procurement Specialist.

                                      Availability Analysis

1.      GDP Growth. GDP (in constant 1987 prices) has fluctuated widely, due to the global
crisis o f 1997/1998, and the crises Turkey experienced during the 2000/2001 period. But things
seem to have changed since then, and Turkey has grown over 5% annually three years in a row.
Current account worries have obviously led the authorities to circumvent domestic demand in
2005, which suggests Turkey is set onto an export-led growth path.

3.      Export Growth. Turkish exports grew from the US$26-28 billion range inthe pre-crisis
period to US$36 billion in2002, and continued to grow at a fast pace in 2003 and 2004. Exports
summed up to US$63.1 billion in2004. Such a spurt was initially caused by a sharp depreciation
of the Turkish Lira, increasing the competitiveness o f Turkey's exports ininternational markets.
Also, meager domestic demand led many businesses to reorient their target client segments and
rely on exports more than before. For many observers, the appreciation o f the Lira, coupled with
an economic slowdown in Turkey's main export destination, Germany, and other trading
partners should have brought about a slowdown o f the rate o f export growth. Nothing o f that sort
has happened so far, but further Lira appreciations are likely to impede export growth.

4.      Export Credit Costs. The cost o f Turk EXIM's Bank's short-term benchmark credits to
exporters has gone down from the highs o f the crisis period. The cost o f locally obtainable
medium and long-term credit to exporters, if available at all, i s not as prohibitive as it was inthe
recent past. For medium and small enterprises the current rate i s for 6 months LIBOR + 0.75 as
regards companies that have a short term export credit insurance scheme and LIBOR+1.25 for
uninsured firms. For non-SME loans, the median level i s around LIBOR +1.50.

5.      Export and total lending. Banking system loans have grown over the last three years,
both in real terms - Le., inflation-adjusted TL and US$ terms. But export & export-guaranteed
investment loans' share in total loans has actually diminished. This is basically due to the fact
that the TL loan book has grown at a rapidpace, mostly due to consumer credit expansion.

6.      During the last three years, the banking system has reduced its direct lending
exposure to the public sector. Treasury securities owned by the banks have increased
continuously from 2000, almost doubling in US$ terms by 2002, and proving to be the favorite
destination for the banks' fi-ee funds. The situation has begun to change in 2003, and the shift
towards increasing the loan book gained strength in 2004. All in all, however, the securities
portfolio o f the total banking sector still amounts to 54% o f total assets. Loans still have a long
way to go in terms o f growth, but the loan book will dominate the securities portfolio as time
goes by, making the banking sector's balance sheet composition similar to that found in high-
income EUcountries.

                            Annex 10: Safeguard Policy Issues

1.      Environmental Assessment policies o f the Bank will apply to EFIL 111. Environmental
issues o f sub-borrowers and their sub-projects will be addressed through the sub-loan
environmental eligibility assessment. TSKB will be responsible for ensuring that sub-borrowers
and sub-projects financed under the EFIL I11undergo environmental screening to ensure their
conformance with Turkish environmental legislation and regulations and the World Bank's
policies and procedures, as set forth in OP/BP 4.01 and other relevant World Bank safeguards.
The credit officers already appointed by TSKB to staff the PIU will perform this function. The
PIU Operations Manual detailing, inter alia, the World Bank's requirements in respect o f
environmental assessment, will bepreparedprior to loannegotiations.

2.      All sub-loans to be financed under the EFIL I11 should be subjected by PFIs to an
environmental review process incorporating the procedures described in section VI o f the
project's Operations Manual. The PFIs should use these procedures inreviewing and appraising
sub-borrowers/sub-projects, and      to   inform Beneficiary      Enterprises     o f environmental
requirements for sub-loan appraisal, so that sub-projects can be implemented in an
environmentally sound manner.

3.      The procedures essentially consist o f Environmental Screening, Environmental Impact
Assessment, and Environmental Mitigation where necessary. The Environmental Screening will
be carried out by the PFIs at an early stage intheir sub-loan review procedures to determine the
appropriate environmental risk category for the sub-borrowers/sub-projects, and may require the
contracting o f external expertise. Following screening, an Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) in line with the environmental classification of the sub-borrower/sub-project will be
recommended. The sub-borrowers will be responsible for carrying out any environmental
analysis and for confirming that the proposed sub-projects comply with national environmental
guidelines, and for obtaining the necessary clearance from the appropriate licensing authorities.
Once the analysis i s performed and recommendations incorporated into the sub-project, the PFI
will appraise the proposed sub-loan package which would include, where appropriate, an
environmental mitigation plan. The implementation o f the mitigationplan will be monitored by
the PFI. The overall review process will be monitoredby the Project Implementation Unit (PIU).

4.      All sub-borrowers/sub-projects will follow the environmental review process presented
schematically below.

STEP 1: The sub-borrower prepares an initial sub-project concept.               Following informal
discussion with the PFI, in which the PFI alerts the sub-borrower o f its environmental
assessment requirements, the sub-borrower prepares Part A o f the environmental screening form
and includes this with the initial sub-project concept. At this time, it i s the responsibility o f the
sub-borrower to initiate discussions with the local environmental authorities (LEA) in order to
fulfill any local and national environmental review requirements (such as investment incentive
certificate andor other official approval/permits).     It will be the responsibility o f the
sub-borrower to obtain the appropriate permits and licenses as required by national law in order
to facilitate the clearance process with the local LEA. These requirements are considered
separate, but parallel, to those presented here and satisfying them i s the responsibility o f the
sub-borrower.
STEP 2: The PFI screens the sub-project and informs the sub-borrower o f the EIA category prior
to appraisal and subsequent follow-up requirements for sub-loan processing.



                                                64

STEP 3: The sub-borrower, or its consultants, submits the environmental analysis (if applicable).
The sub-borrower will obtain a positive EIA report, given by the relevant LEA, in conformity
with applicable EnvironmentalRegulations for the activities listed inCategories I1and 111.
STEP 4: The PFI reviews the environmental analysis that has been submitted and reports its
findings to the sub-borrower. The PFI provides its clearance once the analysis i s judged to be
satisfactory.
STEP 5: The sub-borrower incorporates the recommendations provided in the analysis into the
sub-project design and implementation plan, including associated estimated costs.
STEP 6: The sub-borrower finalizes the sub-loan application package, including the relevant
environmental documentation, and submits it to the PFI for its appraisal.
STEP 7: The sub-loan becomes effective upon verification o f the LEA approval and clearance,
which can be obtained at any step inthe sub-project preparationcycle.
STEP 8: The sub-borrower submits the clearance letter o f the LEA to the PFI.
STEP 9: The PFImonitors the implementation o fthe EIA mitigationplan and informs the PlU.

5.       Prior and Post-Review-IBRD/PIU. Environmental evaluations and review procedures
will be subject to ad-hoc review by the PIU and IBRD supervision missions. The World Bank
will perform ex-ante review and clearance o f all sub-projects falling in Category 111. The review
of evaluations will ensure that: the work was o f satisfactory quality, community participation
took place when appropriate, the appropriate recommendations were made, all documentation
was properly filed and recorded, and that the conditions o f approval by the local LEA were met,
DuringEFILI11implementation, IBRDmissions will supervise the overall screening process and
implementation of environmental recommendations for selected sub-borrowers/sub-projects.
The IBRD supervision team will also review, ad-hoc, environmental documentation. Therefore,
all this documentation should be kept on file with the PFIs and forwarded to the PIU as needed.
