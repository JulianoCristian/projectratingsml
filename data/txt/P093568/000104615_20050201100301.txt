I. Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement 
 
1.
 
Turkey is steadily recovering from the economic and financial crises of 2001, but 
tight macroeconomic management and structural reforms remain key for future stability 
and growth.
 After significantly shrinking in 2001, the Turkish economy has grown at a rapid 
pace in the last three years, and inflation, supported by a stable Turkish Lira, has gone down to 
historically low levels in 2004 
–
first single-digit inflation in 34 years (see Table 1 for details). 
With the help of  a record primary budget surplus in 2003-2004, public debt as a percentage of 
GDP has also trended downwards, although more slowly. Over the last three years, real interest 
rates, though still high, are down to 15% from 30-35% pre-crisis levels. Besides, after 41 years 
of associated partnership - the EU, in December 2004, has extended a formal invitation to 
Turkey to start membership negotiations. Thus both the external and internal macroeconomic 
and political environment for Turkey have improved substantially. However, in spite of these 
positive developments, some macroeconomic uncertainties remain. Turkey’s public debt burden 
remains high, and its structure remains risky. Structural reforms, including fiscal policy changes 
and state bank privatization, have not been completed. Productivity in the real sector and 
efficiency in the financial sector need to improve significantly to sustain future stability and 
growth and to catch up with the rest of EU countries in the coming years.

Though exports have grown rapidly in Turkey during the last few years, from 
US$36 billion in 2002 to estimated US$64 billion in 2004
,
their continued rapid growth in 
coming years is critical as an engine of economic growth and competitiveness
.
The external  
trade continues to have a negative balance of nearly $30 billion, with the current account deficit 
projected at nearly 3.0% of GNP in 2004.  In comparison to several large economies, Turkish 
merchandise exports, at almost 20% of GNP in 2002-2003, have considerable room for further 
growth. Sectoral breakdown of exports in 2003 shows that manufactured goods account for 
nearly 84% of the total exports, with machinery and transport equipment contributing over a 
quarter of total exports. The latter export segment also grew faster (42% in 2003) than other 
manufacturing exports (30.5%). Half of the exports in 2003 went to the EU, while exports to the 
Middle East, although only one tenth of the total exports, grew fastest 
–
almost by 60%. Thus 
there is ample scope for both geographical and product diversification of exports.

3. 
Financial intermediation in the banking sector is improving, especially for the 
consumer sector, but still lags behind in medium to long term investment lending for the 
real sector. 
The Turkish banking sector grew by more than 20% in the first three quarters of 
2004, compared to the same period in 2003, maintaining the trend of healthy recovery (see Table 
2). Loans increased as a share of banks’ assets from 27% to 33%. Deposits as a share of total 
liabilities decreased slightly to 64%, while funds borrowed, especially from foreign banks, 
institutions and funds grew by 40-50%. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans 
decreased from 14.8% to 6.2%, while the coverage of the NPLs with loan loss provisions 
improved from 77.5% to 88.6%. Lending from private banks however remains weak due to their 
lack of access to medium and long-term funding sources and lack of institutional capacity to 
properly assess lending risks of longer-term lending. The real sector is still faced with the 
financial system’s inability to adequately offer longer-term credit resources.
 
The 2004 year end 
figures are not yet available, but comparison, over the first nine months with 2003 figures, shows 
that while the total loans in 2004 increased by nearly $20.0 billion, 66% or $13.0 billion of the 
increase was in short term (less than one year) loans. Even among the medium term-long term 
loans category, experience has shown that most of the loans are of less than 3 years maturity, 
with a handful of loans only to the best customers approaching 5 years maturity. The primary 
reason is of course a shortage of medium to long term liabilities, both in the form of deposits as 
well as international lines of credit or syndicated loans, leading to a gap between the maturity of 
assets and liabilities. For example, nearly 49% of total assets (including investment/securities 
holdings) were of 1 year of maturity or longer, but 81% of total liabilities were of maturities less 
than 1 year. Besides, over the first nine months, even though lending to the government by the 
banking sector has decreased  from $50.0 billion or 31.2% in 2003 to $44.0 billion or 22.5% of 
the total banking system assets in 2004, by virtue of its magnitude, it still constitutes a major 
crowding out effect for the private sector enterprises

The main Rationale for the Bank’s involvement is, therefore, to address the 
development need for medium to long term funds for investment and medium term 
working capital needs of exporting enterprises, to deepen and broaden financial 
intermediation capacity, and contribute to strengthening Turkey’s external accounts
.
With 
nominal and real interest rate levels on Turkish Lira loans remaining prohibitively high, and loan 
maturities very short, demand for affordable longer-term foreign currency funds from the real 
and financial sectors in Turkey remains strong. To address the shortage of longer-term credit for 
the real sector in the post-crisis environment, the Turkish authorities had requested the Bank for 
an export credit line, which would be provided through the financial system and would support 
private sector exporters. The Bank’s support materialized through the $300 million EFIL II credit 
line in 2004. In order to deepen financial intermediation in Turkey and expand the outreach of 
EFIL II funds to SME exporters also, leasing companies were included for the first time along 
with banks as participating financial intermediaries (PFIs).   To date, EFIL II has achieved a 
welcome coverage of enterprises of all sizes, as well as in diverse economic sectors and 
geographical regions. Some two thirds of the sub-loans were for an amount of less than US$1 
million.  Nearly two thirds of the sub-loans were made to companies in the textile and metals 
sectors, though nearly 10 separate sub-sectors have benefited from EFIL II. Most loans (over 
70%) were made to companies located in the Marmara region where Istanbul is located, but 
companies in a number of other regions also benefited from EFIL II credit line. The sub-loans 
approved so far are expected to preserve or create around 5,180 jobs. The proposed new 
operation, EFIL III will continue and build on the performance record of EFIL II.  
 
5. 
The Bank’s earlier operation EFIL II’s extraordinary utilization success in 2004 has 
created an urgent demand and rationale for a repeater EFIL III operation in 2005 in order 
to maintain the momentum of assistance to exporters.

commitments (over US$200 million at the end of 2004 
–
some 68% of the total available funds) 
and disbursements (US$176 million – nearly 58% of the total) in the nine months since EFIL II 
effectiveness, TSKB (the Borrower), and the PFIs are expecting that the funds are likely to be 
fully committed by June 2005 and completely disbursed at the latest by end-December 2005. 
Based on the indications given to the Bank team by the PFIs, and assuming economic growth 
remains on track and macroeconomic and political stability continues, the overall demand for 
medium/long term investment funds provided by the EFIL credit line to exporters is likely to 
remain high. The TSKB management has officially informed the Bank’s EFIL II team of their 
interest in borrowing additional funds under a new EFIL III Loan. They have also expressed an 
interest in an approximate amount of US$300 million. The Bank team during its meetings with 
the Undersecretariat of Treasury also received preliminary confirmation of their support in favor 
of providing the sovereign guarantee for a similar EFIL III loan to be prepared in the next year. 
Based on the feedback received from all the counterparts, exporters, participating financial 
intermediaries, TSKB and the Government, the request for a successor EFIL III credit line for 
exporters is thus well justified and timely. The proposed EFIL III project, as a repeater project, 
will be of the same amount of $300 million, and will substantially maintain the design of its 
predecessor EFIL II. The project will support the current upward momentum in export 
performance and, by extension, in general economic improvement.  
 
II. Proposed objective(s) 
 
6. 
The proposed repeater project’s main objective would be to continue to serve as a 
catalyst to support export and real sector growth in Turkey
 during the EFIL III 
implementation period (2005-2009) and beyond using the EFIL III reflows. To this end, the 
project would provide medium and long-term working capital and investment finance to Turkish 
private exporting enterprises, at the time when the economy is showing strong signs of 
rebounding from a recent slump and export performance is on the rise
—thus increasing the 
demand for longer term credit, while the financial sector is still unable to support these trends 
with very much needed longer term funds at a reasonable cost.  
 
7. 
The secondary objective of the loan would be further improvement in the ability of 
the Turkish financial sector to provide financial resources to the enterprise sector, through 
further development of intermediation by private financial institutions, including banks 
and leasing companies
.
The project, through inclusion of leasing companies in addition to 
banks as PFIs, would enable the Bank to maintain a dialogue with the leasing sector in Turkey, 
provide an opportunity to gain more insight into the sector, and enable the Bank to support its 
development. The EFIL II experience, among other things, suggests that the dialogue between 
the Bank and the PFIs has a strong impact on establishing important concepts by the PFIs of (i) 
environmentally sustainable lending, and (ii) long-term credit risk valuation of the borrowing 
companies. The EFIL III would continue to strengthen these concepts.

III.  Preliminary description 
8.
 
The project will provide a Bank Fixed Spread Loan (FSL) of 16-year maturity, 
including a 6-year grace period, to TSKB, a private Turkish investment and development 
bank, 
for further on-lending to eligible private financial intermediaries
—banks and leasing 
companies. The financial intermediaries will further on-lend the credit line funds to eligible 
private Turkish exporters of goods and services. The Bank loan will be guaranteed by the 
Turkish Government on behalf of the Republic of Turkey, for which the Government will charge 
TSKB a guarantee fee. EFIL III will replicate the same basic project concept as EFIL II.
