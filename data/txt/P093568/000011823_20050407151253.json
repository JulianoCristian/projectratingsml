Subloans\n            agreements will be entered into by TSKB with participating\n            financial intermediaries (PFIs). Before approval by TSKB all\n            subloans will be subject to an environmental review process\n            consisting of an environmental screening, environmental\n            impact assessment and environmental mitigation plan. The\n            purpose of this operational manual is to introduce the PFIs\n            to the decision-making process during the implementation. In\n            addition to this process the PFIs have specific duties and\n            responsibilities to ensure the successful implementation of\n            the project"}, "docdt": "2005-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
