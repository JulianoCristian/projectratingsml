I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
1. 
The primary objective
 of the “Third Export Finance Intermediation Loan” (EFIL 
III), which is extended to TSKB by the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (IBRD), is to provide medium and long-term working capital and investment 
finance to private exporting enterprises (Beneficiary Enterprises). TSKB, as the Borrower of 
the IBRD Loan, will wholesale the EFIL III to a group of private banks and leasing 
companies (LCs) selected according to a set of pre-qualification and final eligibility criteria.  
The on-lending will be carried out by means of subsidiary loan agreements entered into by 
TSKB with selected banks and LCs (Participating Financial Intermediaries--PFIs). The final 
eligibility criteria and subsidiary loan terms and conditions are detailed in Section III of this 
manual.  The PFIs in turn will make sub-loans
1
to Beneficiary Enterprises satisfying a set of 
eligibility criteria, according to agreed sub-loan terms and conditions (Section IV) and 
environmental (Section V) and procurement (Section VI) guidelines.  It is important to note 
that, if a PFI receives funding from TSKB under a sub-loan, later determined by TSKB or 
IBRD to be in violation of the sub-loan terms and conditions, environmental or procurement 
guidelines applicable to the EFIL III, the PFI would need to reimburse the funding received 
to TSKB/IBRD. 
 
2.
 The 
"Operations 
Manual"
 presented here is specifically for the use of the PFIs.  
The purpose of this manual is to introduce the PFIs to the decision-making process during the 
implementation of the EFIL III.  In addition to this process (further detailed in Section II of 
this manual), the PFIs have specific duties and responsibilities to ensure the successful 
implementation of the project.  These responsibilities relate to sub-project/sub-loan 
evaluation procedures, environmental review procedures, applicable procurement procedures 
and progress reporting requirements. 
 
3.
 
Evaluation of Sub-loan Applications/Sub-projects.
 
Evaluation of the sub-loan 
applications and sub-projects submitted by the sub-borrowers for financing under the EFIL 
III is a critical functional responsibility for the PFIs.  
 
4.
 
Sub-Project Environmental Review.
 
The PFIs will also be responsible for 
environmental classification of sub-borrowers/sub-projects, and for ensuring that each 
sub-loan/sub-project proposal includes an evaluation of its environmental impact and 
clearance documentation from the local  authorities.  The PFIs will also have to monitor that 
environmental remedies, agreed under a sub-loan agreement, are indeed carried out.  Section 
V
of this manual contains a summary of the applicable environmental review procedures. 
 
5.
 
Verification of the Procurement Process.
 
The Beneficiary Enterprises have to 
conduct the actual procurement of goods and civil works to be financed under EFIL III sub-
loans according to the IBRD's Procurement Guidelines.  A summary of the procurement 
process is presented in Section VI of this manual.  It is the responsibility of the PFIs to ensure 
that the procurement process followed by the Beneficiary Enterprises conforms to these 
guidelines. 
 
1
For the purposes of this Manual, the term “sub-loans” will include both sub-loans from the participating banks to 
their borrowers, and sub-leases from the participating LCs to their lessees. Similarly, the term “sub-borrower” will 
include both bank borrowers and lessees.

Coordination of the EFIL III and Reporting of Information to the Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU).
 
The overall administrative coordination of the EFIL III, and 
general information management, is the responsibility of the Project Implementation Unit 
(PIU) which has been established within TSKB; more details about the role of the PIU are 
given in Section VIII of this manual.  Quarterly progress reports and semi-annual and annual 
external audit reports should be sent by each PFI to the PIU. The PIU, which is responsible 
for the collection of these returns and reports, will forward them to the IBRD.  
 
7. 
In addition to the above, the PFIs must send to the PIU, for each sub-loan, a quarterly 
sub-loan progress report in the form of a sub-loan summary; the report, which should be in 
both hard copy and electronic form, should be submitted to the PIU within 14 days following 
the end of the quarter. The PFIs must regularly contact with the PIU on behalf of the 
Beneficiary Enterprises, in terms of transmitting procurement packages, no-objections and 
copies of actual transaction documents, like shipping documents, letters of credit etc.  
Proforma regular reports, which include the minimum information to be provided by the 
PFIs, can be found in Section VIII, Appendix VIII.A to this manual and an electronic version 
(Excel spreadsheet) is included on the diskette attached to this Operations Manual.

IV.3  Sub-Loan Review 
 
·
For the first two sub-loans made by each PFI and sub-loans above the free limit 
(US$5 million equivalent), IBRD will carry out a prior review of each sub-loan 
package to determine its compliance with all applicable sub-loan, sub-borrower and 
sub-project requirements, and inform the PFI, through TSKB, in writing of its 
acceptance of the package or of any remedial action required, as the case may be.  
·
For all sub-loans not requiring prior review, TSKB will confirm satisfactory receipt 
of the sub-loan documentation package referred to above, and inform the PFI 
accordingly.  Such sub-loans will, however, be subject to ex-post review of all Sub-
loan documentation by TSKB and IBRD for verification of compliance with all 
sub-borrower, sub-project and sub-loan terms and conditions. All underlying 
documentation pertaining to sub-loans should be maintained by the PFI for a period 
of  3 years from the date on which the sub-loan was disbursed and should be made 
available to TSKB and/or IBRD upon request. 
·
Following the receipt of all necessary documents and subject to the satisfactory 
review of the sub-loan application, TSKB will issue a sub-loan number to the PFI. 
·
Each Sub-loan shall be approved on the basis of a positive evaluation of the Sub-
project and the Sub-Borrower by TSKB.  
·
The PFI has the full responsibility vis-
à-vis TSKB and IBRD to ensure that the 
terms of the Sub-project and all expenditures financed with the proceeds of the sub-
loan are in compliance with the requirements imposed by this Operations Manual.

V.  ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCEDURES 
 
V.1 Background 
 
All sub-loans to be financed under the EFIL III should be subjected by PFIs to an environmental 
review process incorporating the procedures described in this section. The PFIs should use these 
procedures in reviewing and appraising sub-borrowers/sub-projects, and to inform Beneficiary 
Enterprises of environmental requirements for sub-loan appraisal, so that sub-projects can be 
implemented in an environmentally sound manner. These procedures and requirements 
incorporate the Republic of Turkey's regulatory requirements for Environmental Review 
(Regulation on Assessment of Environmental Impact (ER) published in Official Gazette 
No:24777 and dated June 6, 2002, as supplemented by Article 10 of Environmental Act 
No:2872 dated August 9th, 1983).  
 
The procedures essentially consist of Environmental Screening, Environmental Impact 
Assessment, and Environmental Mitigation where necessary.  The Environmental Screening will 
be carried out by the PFIs at an early stage in their sub-loan review procedures to determine the 
appropriate environmental risk category for the sub-borrowers/sub-projects, and may require the 
contracting of external expertise.  Following screening, an Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA) in line with the environmental classification of the sub-borrower/sub-project will be 
recommended. The sub-borrowers will be responsible for carrying out any environmental 
analysis and for confirming that the proposed sub-projects comply with national environmental 
guidelines, and for obtaining the necessary clearance from the appropriate licensing authorities.  
Once the analysis is performed and recommendations incorporated into the sub-project, the PFI 
will appraise the proposed sub-loan package which would include, where appropriate, an 
environmental mitigation plan. The implementation of the mitigation plan will be monitored by 
the PFI.  The overall review process will be monitored by the Project Implementation Unit 
(PIU).  The environmental screening process and responsibilities of key parties are described in 
detail below. 
 
V.2 Environmental Screening Categories 
 
Environmental Screening is the first step in the environmental due diligence process of 
reviewing the sub-loan application to determine the environment risk category of the sub-
borrower/sub-project and  identifying the type of EIA that will be required.  Each sub-loan 
application package submitted by the PFIs to the PIU should include an environmental screening 
form (Appendix VI.C), of which there are two parts, the first half to be completed by the 
sub-borrower and the second to be completed by the PFI.  The environmental screening form 
will summarize the nature of the sub-borrower/sub-project and the screening category.  If an 
EIA is required, a description of the relevant aspects addressed by the assessment including an 
indicative timetable for the preparation of the assessment (integrated into the preparation of the 
sub-project) should be provided.  The form will also provide a section to indicate an estimated 
cost of the environment analysis.   
 
Sub-borrower/sub-project environment screening categories (I, II ,III & IV) are defined as 
follows, with examples of sub-borrowers/sub-projects likely to be included under each category 
listed in Appendix VI.B.  
 
Category I (low risk):
 These would include sub-borrowers/sub-projects whose environmental 
impacts are expected to be negligible, for which no EIA would be required.  These can 
generally be described as sub-borrowers/sub-projects which do not belong to categories II, 
III and IV. 
Page  22
18 
 
Category II (intermediate risk):
 These would include sub-borrowers/sub-projects whose 
environmental impact is certified as negligible by report given by the LEA. This category 
also includes sub-borrowers/sub-projects which may have intermediate levels of regular and 
accidental emissions. A pre-EIA (simpler form EIA) would be recommended in these cases, 
which may simply require specifying well-defined mitigating measures and adopting 
accepted operating practices.  
 
Category III (high risk):
 These would include sub-borrowers/sub-projects which may have 
highly significant, negative and/or long-term environmental impacts, the magnitude of which 
are difficult to determine at the sub-project identification stage.  A full EIA (in-depth EIA) 
would be prepared by the sub-borrower in parallel with the techno-economic feasibility 
study of the sub-project.  The costs of the mitigation measures would be included in the EIA 
and incorporated in the feasibility study. 
 
Category IV:
 Comprises sub-borrowers/sub-projects which would include the production and/or 
use of materials (listed in the related section of Appendix VI.B) which will not be financed 
by the IBRD. 
 
V.3 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
 
An EIA is a process conducted by the sub-borrower to identify, predict, evaluate, and mitigate 
the environmental impacts and risks which may arise from the proposed sub-project. The 
purpose of the EIA is to recognize environmental impacts/consequences early in the sub-project 
preparation process, so that they can be incorporated into the sub-project design.  EIAs identify 
ways of improving sub-projects environmentally by minimizing, mitigating or compensating for 
adverse impacts.  An EIA would also describe the steps that were taken for public consultation. 
 
A
pre-EIA would be required for Category II type sub-borrowers/sub-projects where the 
potential for negative impacts are localized, easily identified and the required mitigating actions 
are well-known and easily prescribed. 
 
A
full EIA would be required for Category III type sub-borrowers/sub-projects in which there is 
potentially long term or irreversible impacts of unknown extent. They would include regular 
emissions as well as the potential risk of accidental releases. Each EIA will have to be publicly 
disclosed on the World Bank’s external Turkey country office website at 
www.worldbank.org.tr
once a sub-project is approved by TSKB and the Bank. In addition, the in-country disclosure 
within Turkey will also be done through the internet site of TSKB and local newspaper 
advertisements. 
 
The scope of the EIA will vary widely depending on the nature and location of a sub-
borrower/sub-project; thus, it is difficult to give clear guidance on the length of time required for 
an EIA or the associated costs.  The preparation and financing of the EIA, including the role of 
public participation, is the responsibility of the sub-borrower and normally closely linked to the 
feasibility study of the proposed activities. 
 
V.4  Environmental Review Process (Role of PIU, PFIs and IBRD)  
 
All sub-borrowers/sub-projects will follow the environmental review process presented 
schematically below.  
 
Page  23
19 
STEP 1
:
The sub-borrower prepares an initial sub-project concept.  Following informal 
discussion with the PFI, in which the PFI alerts the sub-borrower of its environmental 
assessment requirements, the sub-borrower prepares Part A of the environmental screening 
form (Annex B) and includes this with the initial sub-project concept.  At this time, it is the 
responsibility of the sub-borrower to initiate discussions with the LEA in order to fulfill any 
local and national environmental review requirements (such as investment incentive 
certificate and/or other official approval/permits). It will be the responsibility of the 
sub-borrower to obtain the appropriate permits and licenses as required by national law in 
order to facilitate the clearance process with the local LEA.  These requirements are 
considered separate, but parallel, to those presented here and satisfying them is the 
responsibility of the sub-borrower. 
 
STEP 2
:
The PFI screens the sub-project and informs the sub-borrower of the EIA category prior 
to appraisal and subsequent follow-up requirements for sub-loan processing. 
 
STEP 3
:
The sub-borrower, or its consultants, submits the environmental analysis (if applicable). 
The sub-borrower will obtain a positive EIA report, given by the relevant LEA, in 
conformity with applicable Environmental Regulations for the activities listed in Category II 
and III of Appendix VI.B. 
 
STEP 4
:
The PFI reviews the environmental analysis that has been submitted and reports its 
findings to the sub-borrower.  The PFI provides its clearance once the analysis is judged to 
be satisfactory. 
 
STEP 5
:
The sub-borrower incorporates the recommendations provided in the analysis into the 
sub-project design and implementation plan, including associated estimated costs. 
 
STEP 6
:
The sub-borrower finalizes the sub-loan application package, including the relevant 
environmental documentation, and submits it to the PFI for its appraisal. 
 
STEP 7
:
The sub-loan becomes effective upon verification of the LEA approval and clearance, 
which can be obtained at any step in the sub-project preparation cycle. 
 
STEP 8
:
The sub-borrower submits the clearance letter of the LEA to the PFI. 
 
STEP 9
:
The PFI monitors the implementation of the EIA mitigation plan and informs the PIU. 
 
Prior and Post-Review 
–
IBRD/PIU. 
Environmental evaluations and review procedures will be 
subject to ad-hoc review by the PIU and IBRD supervision missions. IBRD World Bank will 
perform prior review and clearance of  all sub-projects falling in Category III and post review. 
The review of evaluations will ensure that: the work was of satisfactory quality, community 
participation took place when appropriate, the appropriate recommendations were made, all 
documentation was properly filed and recorded, and that the conditions of approval by the local 
LEA were met. During EFIL III implementation, IBRD missions will supervise the overall 
screening process and implementation of environmental recommendations for selected sub-
borrowers/sub-projects.  The IBRD supervision team will also review, ad-hoc, environmental 
documentation. Therefore, all this documentation should be kept on file with the PFIs and 
forwarded to the PIU as needed.

Environmental Documentation
.
The PFIs need to include the following environmental 
documentation in sub-loan application packages they submit to the PIU:

Appendix V.B: Examples of  Sub-borrower/sub-project Categories
3
The following examples of sub-borrowers/sub-projects and their suggested categorization are 
indicative only and will need to be reviewed throughout EFIL III implementation to assess their 
appropriateness concerning the types of sub-projects which are actually submitted to the PFIs. 
As it would be impossible for this list to be exhaustive, sub-borrowers/sub-projects which can 
not be identified as belonging to one of the categories below should be brought to the attention 
of the PIU to transmit to the IBRD for further guidance.

VI. PROCUREMENT 
PROCESS
4
VI.1 General 
 
1. 
The procurement of goods and civil works should be carried out in accordance with the 
World Bank’s “Guidelines: 
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” dated May 2004.
 
The procurement arrangements under sub-loans to private sub-borrowers through PFIs for goods 
(including related non-consulting services) and civil works are described in this Section. The 
IBRD's review process is presented in Table VII.1. 
 
2. 
PFIs will be responsible for ensuring that the procurement rules for sub-loans are 
complied with the sub-borrowers.  TSKB will be responsible for reviewing and monitoring the 
compliance with the procurement rules by the PFIs and their sub-borrowers. It is expected that 
each sub-borrower will submit a procurement plan for the planned contracts in the format 
attached to this section or similar. TSKB will also keep the records of the completed 
procurements which are subject to World Bank’s post review in the table form attached to this 
section.   
 
3. PFIs will be responsible to send the copy of all the relevant documents of the procurement 
performed by the sub-borrowers to TSKB to facilitate the World Bank’s reviews. For the 
procurement under commercial practices, the procurement related documents include, as 
applicable, advertisements, short lists, number of quotations, number of bids, copy of offers 
(invoices), specifications, evaluation reports, evidence which proves the contractor or supplier 
is not a subsidiary or affiliated company of the sub borrower, invoices, and other documents 
indicating that private sector commercial practices are applied transparently and competitively.  
 
4. The contracts between sub-borrowers and their subsidiary or affiliated companies will not be 
eligible for financing out of the Loan. 
 
5. The procurement of the second hand goods is not eligible for financing out of the Loan. 
 
VI.2 Procurement through Commercial Practices and Thresholds 
 
6. 
Goods
.
For contracts below US$5 million equivalent, established 
Local Private Sector 
Commercial Practices
 should be followed in accordance with paragraph 3.12 of the 
Procurement Guidelines. Sub-borrowers (Beneficiary Enterprises) should generally seek bids 
from a list of potential suppliers broad enough to ensure competitive prices.  Care has to be 
taken of other relevant factors such as time of delivery, efficiency and reliability of the goods 
and availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts thereof, and in case of non-consultant 
services, of the quality and competence of the parties rendering them.  Advertising in the local 
and international press will not be required. All procurement of goods and related services 
(installation and maintenance) under contracts equal to or above US$5 million equivalent will 
be subject to prior review.  
 
4
For the purposes of this Manual, the term “sub-loans” will include both sub-loans from the participating banks to 
their borrowers, and sub-leases from the participating LCs to their lessees. Similarly, the term “sub-borrower” will 
include both bank borrowers and lessees.
 
Page  30
26
7. 
Civil works
.
For civil works up to a threshold of US$5.0 million per contract, established 
local private sector commercial practices will be followed in accordance with paragraph 3.12 of 
the Procurement Guidelines. Sub-borrowers should generally seek bids from a list of potential 
contractors broad enough to ensure competitive prices. Care has to be taken for the capacity of 
the contractor and the quality of the works. For contracts US$5.0 million equivalent and above, 
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would be required for individual contracts. All ICB 
contracts shall be subject to prior review by the World Bank. 
 
8. For a detailed explanation of the procedures acceptable to the IBRD and for copies of standard 
bidding documents refer to the IBRD publications, "Procurement of
 Goods” and "Procurement 
of Works" (standard bidding documents for ICB contracts), copies of which may be obtained 
from TSKB. The World Bank standard bidding documents can also be downloaded from the 
web site www.worldbank.org

VI.3 ICB (International Competitive Bidding) --For Goods and Works contracts above 
US$5.0 million equivalent 
 
9. 
The objective of International Competitive Bidding (ICB), as described in the 
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", is to provide all eligible 
prospective bidders with timely and adequate notification of a sub-borrower's requirements and 
an equal opportunity to bid for the required goods and works. 
 
10. 
All procurement of goods and works under contracts equal to or above US$5.0 million 
equivalent will be subject to IBRD prior review and must be procured under ICB.  A highly 
summarised version of the steps to be followed by sub-borrowers in the case of ICB is given 
below: 
 
·
Preparation of Bid Documents
.
Send bid documents to IBRD for review and approval 
via PFI and TSKB/PIU. Any further amendments to the bid documents will also need 
IBRD clearance. 
Page  31
27
·
Specific Procurement Notice (SPN)
-
Sub-borrower advertises the SPN in national newspaper.  
 
-
Sends, via PFI and PIU, a copy of the notice to IBRD for publication in the 
Development Business (an IBRD publication) and dgMarket (online) minimum 
five (5) days before its publication in the local media. The sub-borrower may also 
directly send the SPN to the suppliers, prospective bidders and other interested 
parties; this is optional but is recommended for greater publicity. 
 
·
Invite Bids from Public
.
Allow at least 6 weeks to the prospective bidders to prepare 
their bids. 
 
·
Open Bids
at the specified time in public and announce the name and amount of each 
bidder.  All other information contained in the bid document remains confidential. 
Record the minutes of bid opening and send it to the IBRD immediately. 
 
·
Evaluation and Comparison of Bids
.
Send the bid award recommendation with an 
evaluation report to IBRD via PFI and PIU for review and approval (Use sample 
evaluation report format of IBRD). 
 
·
Award the contract
.
After award, send two copies of the signed contract to IBRD via 
PFI and TSKB/PIU before any disbursement is requested. 
 
11. 
For a detailed explanation of the procedures acceptable to the IBRD and for copies of 
standard bidding documents refer to the IBRD publications "Procurement of Goods or Works",  
"Procurement of Goods" (standard bidding documents) and "Procurement of Works" (standard 
bidding documents for larger works), copies of which may be obtained from TSKB or from the 
World Bank’s web-site (www.worldbank.org).

VII. DISBURSEMENT PROCESS 
 
VII.1 Disbursement 
Process 
For 
Sub-Loans 
 
1. 
This section describes the disbursement rules applicable to EFIL III sub-loans.  
Disbursements shall be made for 100% of Sub-loans and Lease Financing. However, no local 
taxes will be financed out of the proceeds of the loan. 
 
2. 
Expenditures for goods and civil works on the IBRD's negative list and expenditures 
made earlier than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date on which TSKB shall have 
received the sub-loan applic1ation package from a PFI will not be eligible for financing, with 
the proviso that expenditures incurred between February 1,2005 and the date of Loan signing 
will be eligible for financing up to an amount of US$40 million and Euro 16.0million. 
 
3. 
To facilitate the disbursement of funds, the PFI shall nominate one branch or unit, and 
inform TSKB accordingly,  to be responsible for transmitting the applications and monitoring 
disbursements. 
 
4. 
Once a PFI has been notified by TSKB that a sub-loan package has been approved for 
disbursement,  in order to realize a disbursement,  
 
(a) the PFI shall furnish to TSKB a Disbursement Request, a sample of which is provided 
in Appendix VII.A to this section.  Since the disbursements will be made for specific 
contractual expenditures under each sub-loan, multiple Disbursement Requests may 
be submitted under a sub-loan. The Disbursement Request shall be signed by two 
authorized representatives of the PFI. Moreover, the name and number of the 
respective sub-loan agreement and the Subsidiary Loan Agreement signed by TSKB 
and the PFI shall be stated in the Disbursement Request. 
 
(b) Disbursements can be made in any one of the following ways, and the preferred option 
should be stated in the Disbursement Request:  
 
(i) 
Reimbursement by TSKB (or IBRD in case of large contracts) to the PFI of 
eligible payments already made by the PFI to the Beneficiary Enterprise; 
 
(ii) 
Direct payment by TSKB (or IBRD in case of large contracts) to the supplier of 
goods and  civil works for eligible contracts under the sub-loan, upon such a

VIII. ROLE OF THE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION UNIT 
 
On the part of TSKB, the EFIL III will be implemented under the overall management of Mr. 
Orhan Be kök, Executive Vice President, and EFIL 
III Program Manager.  The day-to-day 
responsibility for EFIL III administration lies with the EFIL III Project Implementation Unit (PIU) 
within TSKB, consisting of the staff of 6 from various TSKB functional departments.   
 
The general responsibilities of the PIU will include:  
 
·
Coordination And Information Management 
-
the administration of subsidiary loan agreements; 
-
submission to the IBRD of those sub-loan proposals requiring its prior approval; 
-
assists PFIs in promotion and marketing of the EFIL III to Beneficiary Enterprises, as required; 
 
·
Advising PFIs And Beneficiary Enterprises 
-
providing assistance, and proactive advice to PFI and sub-borrowers on all aspects of the EFIL 
III, including terms and conditions, procurement, disbursement, and environment procedures. 
 
·
Monitoring And Reporting 
-
maintaining sub-loan files; 
-
monitoring, on an ex-post basis, the eligibility of sub-loans below the free limit; 
-
carrying out periodic analyses of the subsidiary loans and associated sub-loan portfolios; 
-
reporting
6
to the IBRD quarterly on the performance of the credit line, including: 
·
sub-loan commitments and disbursements; 
·
subsidiary loan and sub-loan portfolio performance for the period;  
·
a
report on sample sub-loans reviewed indicating compliance with sub-loan eligibility 
criteria; and 
 
·
Accounting And Auditing 
-
The PIU is responsible for maintaining the EFIL III accounting system and providing 
confirmation of the proper receipt and use of EFIL III funds in accordance with the EFIL III 
Loan Agreement between TSKB and the IBRD. This system should ensure timely and accurate 
accounting of all transactions under the EFIL III and clear presentation of financial information; 
-
Ensuring that audits of the EFIL III financial statements or reports are submitted to the  
IBRD; 
-
Submitting semi-annual, and annual audit reports for each PFI to the IBRD no later than 
five months after the close of each six-month period. The PFI audit reports should be 
accompanied by certification letters from the PFIs’ external auditors that they are in 
compliance with the eligibility criteria specified in the Subsidiary Loan Agreements. 
6
The PFIs will be required to report to the PIU, providing the information needed for the PIU to comply with its 
reporting requirements to the IBRD.  Sub-loan files, to the extent not already delivered to the PIU as part of the 
standard sub-loan documentation package, will be available on demand for PIU and IBRD inspection.
