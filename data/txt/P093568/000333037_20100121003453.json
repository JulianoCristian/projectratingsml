"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Third Export Financial\n            Intermediation Loan (EFIL III) Project for Turkey were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: eligibility\n            constraints and reporting requirements that go beyond what\n            Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs) normally\n            require increases transaction cost of the project, slows\n            implementation, and may have a tendency to shift funds to\n            firms with relatively better access to finance. The\n            application process for sub-loans and leases reportedly\n            required increased efforts compared to normal lending\n            practices but it did contribute to capacity building. It may\n            be better to improve PFIs' existing credit appraisal\n            practices, simplify requirements for smaller sub-loans and\n            borrowers, and require audited sub-borrower data on an\n            annual basis (not quarterly). Offering longer maturities to\n            PFIs could help further deepen financial intermediation by\n            enabling more rollover of funds at PFI level. During the\n            project, loan funds for one bank in the project became\n            unworkable and will not have continued to disburse. Prompt\n            reallocation by Turkish Industrial Development Bank (TSKB)\n            to other PFIs ensured that the overall project was not\n            delayed as a result."}, "docdt": "2009-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
