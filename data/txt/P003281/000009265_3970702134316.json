health and family planning\n            services. It comprises several components. They include: (i)\n            management strengthening (for the Ministry of Health at the\n            national, provincial and district levels); (ii) training of\n            health workers; (iii) urban family planning services (at 22\n            hospitals); and (iv) information, education and\n            communications (for family planning demand generation and\n            health education activities). The project also provides\n            funds for (v) strengthening of district level referral\n            services; (vi) strengthening of peripheral services; and\n            (vii) project management."}, "docdt": "1986-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
