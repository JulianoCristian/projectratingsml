Vocational\n            Education Project for Mozambique were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            establishment and design of a robust M&E system with\n            indicators for which baseline data are readily available is\n            critical in ensuring that the outputs and outcomes of an\n            operation are properly documented and appropriate targets\n            are set in light of the project timeline. Strategic\n            sequencing of activities and realism in terms of the\n            implementation timeline should be factored into the design\n            of a project which aims to undertake far reaching reforms\n            within a given sector. The establishment, staffing and\n            resourcing of entities capable of undertaking new activities\n            associated with sector reforms are important steps in\n            strengthening the perceived legitimacy of these reforms and\n            promoting their sustainability in the medium to long term.\n            Close collaboration with the Government beginning in the\n            preparation phase can pay high dividends in project\n            achievements, especially in the context of introducing and\n            implementing large scale reforms."}, "docdt": "2016-03-31T23:11:00Z"}
