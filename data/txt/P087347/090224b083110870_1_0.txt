Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 In accordance with the established OPCS guidelines, this final ISR evaluates the Project’s performance during the pre- and post-restructuring periods
 across the three harmonized criteria of: (i) relevance of objectives/design and implementation; (ii) efficacy; and (iii) efficiency. The Project’s performance
 is assessed in relation to each of these three criteria with an overall outcome rating calculated based on the proportion of the net credit disbursed during
 the pre- and post-restructuring periods. A more thorough and comprehensive analysis based on most up-to-date data will be presented in the ICR.

 Project Context

 The Mozambique Vocational and Technical Education (TVET) project (US$30 million) was approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors
 on March 21, 2006 and became effective on June 29, 2006. In addition to a US$30 million IDA credit, this Project received a grant in the amount of
 US$7.5 million from the Government of the Netherlands. An Additional Financing (AF) in the amount of US$37 million was approved on July 12, 2011.
 In addition to fill a financing gap resulting from high inflation and an underestimation of initial construction and equipment cost under the Project, this AF
 also introduced a number of modifications, including among others, an extension of the project closing date, simplification of the project development
 objective (PDO) to better reflect the intended outcome of the project, and adjustments to performance indicators and associated end-of-project targets.
 The Project was again restructured in March of 2014. This level 2 restructuring extended the project closing date, reallocated funds across activities and
 categories, and introduced minor modifications to the Project’s Results Framework (RF).

 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

 Original and Revised Objectives. The original objectives were substantially relevant as they responded to key issues and challenges facing the technical
 and vocational education and training (TVET) sector in Mozambique at the time of appraisal including: limited relevance of skills to labor market needs;
 low quality of training provided; limited access to training; and fragmentation and limited coordination in the management of the TVET system. The
 Project’s objectives were also strongly aligned with the Government’s strategic agenda for the sub-sector as outlined in a number of key documents
 including the MINTRAB Employment and Vocational Training Strategy (2004-2010), the Education Sector Strategic Program (2005-2009) and the Letter
 of Sector Policy (2005). The PDO was firmly anchored in the Government’s Action Plan for Reduction of Poverty which emphasized the importance of
 quality and relevance of training of TVET graduates as a means to increase national growth and productivity while reducing poverty. The original
 objectives of the Project were also consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mozambique which underscored the importance of
 reforming and expanding the TVET sub-sector in order to equip a larger number of graduates with market-relevant skills. While the original objectives
 were substantially relevant to address the country’s needs within the sub-sector, these aims were overly ambitious in light of the five-year
 implementation period. The revised objectives were strategically narrowed in order to be more reflective of the Project-supported activities on the
 ground while also continuing to strongly focus on meeting prevailing needs within the TVET sub-sector. The revised objectives were, and remain, highly
 relevant today. In light of the above, the relevance of the original objectives is rated Substantial, while the relevance of the revised objectives is rated
 High.

 Original and Revised Design. The original design was informed by lessons learned from other operations in the sector and had strong analytical
 underpinnings. Some of these lessons included the importance of: strong demand-side involvement from employers, industry representatives and civil
 society in planning, design and governance of the TVET sector; developing a standards based training paradigm; and providing increased autonomy to
 TVET institutions in decision-making. The Project’s results chain was clear insofar as the activities and objectives supported across each of the
 Project’s components were logically linked to the overall objectives. However, the original design was overly ambitious in scope as it sought to support
 legislative reorganization of the TVET subsector as well as to support the development of an occupational standards system, improve the quality of
 training within a select number of institutes, and provide competitive grants to increase access to employment-oriented TVET programs. The original
 Project design did not fully take into consideration the time required to create the system, develop curricula, train appropriate numbers of trainers in the
 new curricula and upgrade institutions to accommodate the training requirements. Further, the estimated costs at appraisal were insufficient to
 effectively fund and support key project-supported activities and interventions. The revised design reflected the strategic narrowing of the PDO and
 benefitted from increased financial resources to effectively support the Government in its efforts to improve the quality and relevance of TVET within a
 select number of institutions and programs. In light of the above, the relevance of the original design is rated Modest, while the relevance of the revised
 design is rated Substantial.

 Original and Revised Implementation. The relevance of project implementation before restructuring was Modest. This can be attributed to a number of
 issues which appeared early in implementation and persisted through the first years of the project. Among these were: underestimation of costs of
 school rehabilitation and equipment at appraisal (not adequately taking into account inflation); delays in the launch of major activities especially school
 rehabilitation and procurement of teaching equipment; delays in the processing of contracts especially for TA necessary for the curriculum development
 process; and delays in the creation of the underlying regulatory and administrative framework necessary for the full reform of Mozambique’s TVET
 system. After restructuring of the project with its simplification of the PDO and adjustment in the performance indicators to better reflect the intended
 outcome of the project, project implementation of improved substantially. The Executive Secretariat of COREP played an active role in supporting the

        Technical and Vocational Education and Training (P087347)


 Government’s development of the TVET regulatory framework which was passed by the legislature in the fall of 2014. In addition, the development of
 the National Training Fund proceeded with government budgetary commitments and private sector involvement, the Ministry of Labor, Employment and
 Social Security moved forward with the establishment of the Labor Market Observatory.; and the Standard-based Assessment and Certification system
 was developed. By the close of the project, most Project targets had been achieved or exceeded. The relevance of project implementation post-
 restructuring is rated High.



 Efficacy (Achievement of Project Development Objectives)

 Efficacy during the pre-restructuring period. The initial project implementation period was characterized by significant delays as a result of the lengthy
 and complex process of adopting and enacting legislative reforms in the TVET sub-sector, including the establishment of a new institutional framework
 for TVET and the recruitment of Executive Secretariat staff. In addition, there had been difficulties in identifying firms with adequate technical capacity to
 support the development of occupational standards within the strategic sectors targeted by the Project. The underestimation of costs to support school
 construction and procurement of technical and teaching equipment, combined with high inflation rate and exchange rate losses, further challenged the
 timely implementation of project activities aimed at improving the overall quality and relevance of training institutions. Notwithstanding these initial
 implementation delays, a number of activities were successfully launched during the pre-restructuring period.

 The following progress was observed with regards to the development of an institutional framework: The Government, in close collaboration with
 industry representatives, had drafted the TVET regulatory framework for reforming the system; an institutional management capacity study had been
 undertaken which informed the creation of a capacity building plan used to develop a training program for managers and teachers at target institutions;
 a quality management system (QMS) strategy and related implementation manuals had been developed; a management information system (MIS) was
 established; country-wide consultations were carried out resulting in agreement on alternative models for government, management and financing of the
 TVET sectors; and strategic studies were undertaken to inform the process for creation of the National Training Authority.

 The following progress was observed with regards to the development of standards-based qualification and training system: a National Vocational
 Qualifications Framework (which was approved by COREP) was developed and new qualifications continued to be developed with representation from
 the private sector, civil society and the Government; the development and finalization and availability of policies, strategies, guides and manuals that
 support the qualification system; the development of new curricula in four areas (industrial maintenance; hospitality and tourism; agriculture and agro-
 business; and administration and management) and its piloting in five schools; the institutionalization of the framework; and capacity strengthening in
 curriculum development.

 In terms of quality improvements in training institutions, as a result of the underestimation of costs and inflation, support to quality improvements was
 provided to six of the originally 12 planned institutions. Given the Government’s strong focus on advancing the TVET agenda within the country, the
 Government had allocated funds for the rehabilitation of two of these institutions. In addition, as a result of the underestimated costs combined with
 higher inflation, limited funding was provided for in-service training of teachers and management training for school managers and administrative staff.
 Further, 3 year full-time courses in a number of areas (hospitality and tourism, accounting and management) and 4.5 year distance training courses in
 agriculture, industrial maintenance and administration and management were being held in collaboration with the Instituto Superior Dom Bosco with the
 first group of 25 students per sector expected to finish the full-time course by mid-2011.

 In terms of progress made with regards to the provision of small grants through the Skills Development Fund, the following was observed: provision of
 grants to 128 sub-projects benefitting approximately 30,000 individuals nationwide (40 percent of whom were women); completion of an in-depth
 independent evaluation of the Skills Development Plan and dissemination of results in January 2011. This evaluation provided evidence that this seed
 money contributed to the livelihood of individuals and communities; created the conditions for the development of new competencies; disseminated new
 technology and, in turn, created opportunities for income generation. The evaluation also provides a series of concrete recommendations to further
 strengthen this competitive and demand-driven funding mechanism.

 Despite the progress observed within each of the Project’s four components, given the above-mentioned delays in the initial phase, the first graduates
 benefitting from the reform were only finalizing their training by the end of 2011. As such, a number of outcome-level indicators measuring labor market
 insertion, improved economic opportunities and employer satisfaction with graduates’ skills could not be measured as the beneficiaries had not
 graduated by this point. Moreover, while the process of developing a robust institutional framework for the TVET sub-sector was underway, the
 enactment of the relevant legislation was pending final approval by the Government. On the basis of the above, efficacy during the pre-restructuring
 period is rated Modest.

 Efficacy during the post-restructuring period. Following the restructuring/AF, the pace of project implementation significantly improved and a large
 number of outputs were completed and the majority of outcomes were achieved, if not exceeded.

 During the post-restructuring period, the following had been achieved with regards to development of an institutional framework: a new regulatory
 framework for governance and financing of the TVET sub-sector was approved by the National Assembly in 2014 calling for the creation of a national
 regulatory body (ANEP), the creation of a national training fund (with contributions from the private sector through the introduction of a payroll levy
 system to be paid by employers and the framework for autonomy of TVET institutions and establishment of school governing bodies with representation
 of stakeholders). However, in light of the reorganization within the Government, minor adjustments to this legislation are currently being reviewed to
 ensure that these systems can become fully operational in short order. Further, during this period: the COREP-ES and COREP Board became fully

 functional; all pilot training institutions had strategic plans in place; 9 out of 11 (approximately 82 percent) of training institutions were retaining part of
 their generated income for school improvements; all pilot and 55 percent of non-pilot institutions were participating regularly in tracer studies; all 11
 training institutions were submitting enrolment and pass rates electronically through TVET MIS; and 1 annual report and two biannual bulletins from the
 labor market information system were produced annually (for each sector). Review of selected regulations is currently ongoing and expected to be
 approved by Government in short order.

 Notable progress was also made in the development of standards-based qualification and training system. A total of 67 programs had been developed
 and validated based on the established set of competency-based standards.

 In terms of quality improvements in training institutions progress, during the post-restructuring period: 50 percent of students were provided with
 internships; the pass rate of students enrolled in targeted courses was 84 percent; 2,027 teachers in target sectors received training under the new CBT
 system (of which 11.5 were female); 25 TVET institutions were aligned to the CBT system; 162 school managers (directors and deputies) had received
 training on quality school management; all competency-based training programs had been designed with private sector participation in qualification
 exams; 9 institutions were fully rehabilitated and equipped (with classrooms, laboratories and workshops) and the remaining 1 institution is in advanced
 stage of completion.

 In terms of progress made with regards to the provision of small grants through the Skills Development Fund, seven calls for proposals were launched
 and a total of 405 applications were received of which 188 (approximately 46%) were approved indicating a highly competitive and selective process.
 These sub-projects benefitted approximately 126 institutions across the country and 128 of the 188 received matching grants. In addition, 25
 partnerships had been formed between training providers or promoters and private sector institutions. This competitive funding mechanism supported
 innovative initiatives targeted at improving the relevance and quality of TVET training and increased access to employment-oriented TVET programs
 among underserved groups.

 On the basis of the above, efficacy during the post-restructuring period is rated Substantial.

 Efficiency

 Efficiency during the pre-restructuring period. Despite progress observed during the pre-restructuring period, the initial implementation delays in
 enacting institutional reforms, recruitment of a technical firm to assist in the development of operational standards, and delays in the procurement of civil
 works activities, resulted in a modest rate of implementation efficiency. Moreover, the delays which were observed during the pre-restructuring period
 also made it difficult to systematically and comprehensively assess efficiency gains related to labor market insertion of graduates, employer satisfaction
 with beneficiaries’ market-relevant skills, and improved labor market outcomes of beneficiaries who received support under this Project. The cost of civil
 work activities during the early years of the Project was also greater than the estimated costs at appraisal. In light of the above, efficiency during the pre-
 restructuring period was rated Modest.

 Efficiency during the post-restructuring period. The Project’s efficiency during the post-restructuring period improved significantly. Despite the exchange
 rate losses observed during the post-restructuring period, the vast majority of the project’s outputs and outcomes were achieved or exceeded by the
 Project closing date. Substantial gains were observed in the percent of program graduates that find a job or creates a job which is directly related to
 their field of study and in the percent of employers/private sector representatives reporting satisfaction with the quality of CBT programs were observed.
 The financial management mechanism used for the Competitive Funding Grants Program was also made more robust during the post-restructuring
 period and ensured that the approved funds were used for their intended purposes and in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Recent analytical work
 within the Mozambican context provides strong evidence of the positive relationship between educational attainment and earnings. The economic
 justification for investing in TVET remains strong.

 A detailed economic analysis will be included in the ICR and will draw on findings from the tracer study which will be available in full to the Bank in the
 coming weeks.

 Overall Outcome Rating and Net Disbursements (as of September 25, 2015)

 As of the AF approval on July 12, 2011, approximately US$23.27 million of the original IDA credit and US$6.18 million of the US$7.5 million grant had
 been disbursed. During the post-restructuring/AF period (as of the writing of this ISR), approximately US$6.2 million of the original credit was disbursed
 in addition to US$30.37 million of the AF. In addition, US$167,674 of the US$7.5 grant (of which almost US$1.1 million had been cancelled) and which
 had closed on October 31, 2011, was also disbursed. On March 27, 2014, a level 2 restructuring of the project was approved which extended the
 closing date by one year, reallocated funds across categories and introduced minor modifications to the RF. The modifications to the RF did not
 materially change the intent and overarching objectives of the Project (for this reason, the project is analyzed with respect to two phases rather than
 three). Given the significant fluctuations in the exchange rate observed over the life of the Project, the current estimates of the portion of the net funding
 disbursed during the pre-restructuring period will be recalculated and updated in the ICR. As of the writing of this ISR, the proportion disbursed in the
 pre-restructuring amounts to approximately 44 percent and during the post-restructuring period amounts to approximately 56 percent. Also, given that
 the financial accounts are still being reconciled the proportion of funding which was effectively disbursed during the post-restructuring period is likely to
 be greater than what is estimated in this ISR. These figures will be updated accordingly in the ICR. Based on the project’s performance during the pre-
 and post-restructuring periods, weighted by the portion of the net credit disbursed during each period, the Overall Outcome Rating for the Project is
 Moderately Satisfactory.

 Fiduciary and Safeguards Compliance

 Financial Management (FM). FM under the Project is rated Satisfactory. Annual audit reports were received on time, revealed no irregularities, and
 were of unqualified opinion. Interim unaudited financial reports were also submitted in a timely manner and in accordance with Bank procedures. In
 instances in which minor issues were identified, corrective actions were enacted by the Bank and the Government. The FM staff had relevant and
 adequate experience to carry out their fiduciary responsibilities. An internal auditor performed independent and objective internal audit activities
 including inspections and verification of the use of funds at the sub-project level.

 Procurement. Procurement under the Project was sound and is rated Satisfactory. Although some initial delays in provision of technical inputs related to
 the procurement of project-supported activities were observed in the early stages of the Project, these were fully rectified and addressed. Procurement
 performance remained strong until the end of the Project.

 The Overall Safeguards Rating is Satisfactory. A system glitch has prevented this from being entered into the operations portal. This will be fixed by
 OPCS.

 Sustainability. The recent approved AF for HEST will allow for consolidation of achievements made under this Project, in particular, in relation to
 curriculum reform with private sector involvement, development of partnerships with the private sector, and improvements in learning conditions.
 Approximately US$2.0 million of HEST funds will be allocated for these activities. Further, it will also support the implementation of decentralized
 institutional management, quality and accreditation which are key elements in the future TVET governance set up. Despite improvements over the life of
 the Project, continued efforts on the part of the Government need to be put forth in order to ensure that the supply of qualified teachers is adequate to
 meet demand within the TVET sub-sector as well as to ensure that an adequate level of resources is allocated to recruit and retain qualified teachers.
 The full enactment of the recently approved National TVET Law will also be an essential element of the Government’s continued support to the sub-
 sector.

 An Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) mission was undertaken in August/September 2015 and the report is currently being drafted.

 Overall Comments
 The initial project implementation period was characterized by significant delays as a result of the lengthy and complex process of adopting and
 enacting legislative reforms in the TVET sub-sector, including the establishment of a new institutional framework for TVET and the recruitment of
 Executive Secretariat staff. In addition, there had been difficulties in identifying firms with adequate technical capacity to support the development
 of occupational standards within the strategic sectors targeted by the Project as well as underestimation of costs at appraisal. Notwithstanding
 these initial implementation delays, a number of important activities were successfully launched during the pre-restructuring period. Some of the
 progress observed during this period included: the development of the TVET regulatory framework; the establishment of an M&E system for the
 Project; the development of new curriculum in four areas; and the provision of grants to support sub-projects aimed at increasing the relevance
 and quality of TVET programs. Despite progress observed during this period, the first graduates benefitting from the reform were only finalizing
 their training by the end of 2011. As such, a number of outcome-level indicators measuring labor market insertion, improved economic
 opportunities and employer satisfaction with graduates’ skills could not be measured as the beneficiaries had not graduated by this point.
 Following the restructuring/AF, the pace of project implementation significantly improved and a large number of outputs were completed and the
 majority of outcomes were achieved, if not exceeded. A major achievement of the Project observed during this period was the creation and
 approval of a regulatory institutional framework for governance and financing of the TVET sub-sector and the creation of a National Training
 Fund. In addition, another major achievement was the involvement of the private sector in the definition of occupational standards and validation
 of qualifications. Further, progress was made with regards to: an increase in the number of learners assessed through the new competency
 based training, the large number of project beneficiaries; an increase in the number of partnerships formed between training providers or
 promoters and private sector institutions, and a large number of training institutions submitting enrollment and pass rates electronically through
 TVET MIS. Substantial progress was also made in terms of the percentage of program graduates that found a job within their field of study within
 6 months of graduation reflecting a marked improvement in the external efficiency of the Project.
