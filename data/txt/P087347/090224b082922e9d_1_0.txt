Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 1. The overall progress of the project is in good standing. Implementation progress was accelerated in activities aimed to improve the quality of learning
 provision in selected institutions. The overall number of Project beneficiaries reached the Project end target of 52,500. Most of the Project Development
 Objectives (PDO) and intermediate target indicators have been achieved. However, the Project is rated Moderately Satisfactory for PDO because the
 indicator "Graduates of targeted programs that find a job or creates a job that is directly related to the field of study within 6 months from graduation” is
 unlikely to be achieved by the end of project. Based on the most recent graduate tracer study completed in 2014 only 52% of the graduates are
 employed or start their own business within six months of graduation.

 2. The Executive Secretariat for the Commission of Professional Education and Training Reform (ES-COREP), in collaboration with the National
 Directorate for Technical Education (DINET) and the National Institute for Employment and Professional Training (INEFP), continued to focus in
 improving learning conditions, through among others the provision of training to teachers and managers and improvement of learning conditions in the
 institutions. The ES-COREP continued to work closely with private sector representatives to review and develop new curricula and learning materials
 and with DINET and INEFP to promote in training institutions partnerships with private sector.
 3. The following are the main achievements by component:

  Component A - Development of an Institutional Framework: The approval of a new Regulatory Framework for TVET which is reflected in the Law
 approved in September 2014. The approved legislation includes (i) the creation of a national regulatory body, Autoridade Nacional de Educação
 Professional (ANEP), which will govern the TVET system in Mozambique with effective representation of stakeholders; (ii) the creation of a National
 Training Fund. Among others, an important feature of the new legislation is the provision for greater autonomy to TVET institutions (i.e., the possibility
 for establishment of school governing bodies with representation of stakeholders and private public partnerships).

 Component B - Development of Standards-Based Qualification and Training System: In addition to the review of ongoing qualifications the Executive
 Secretariat for the Commission for Professional Education and Training Reform (ES-COREP) is working with the sector technical committees for the
 areas of mining and gas and ICTs on the design of new qualifications for the mining and ICT sectors. The design of occupational standards and review
 and validation of the approved qualifications continues to be done with involvement of the relevant stakeholders, in particular the private sector. To
 strengthen the quality of teaching and learning and management of the institutions training of teachers and managers in professional areas is ongoing.
 In 2014, 384 teachers received short term technical training on areas of their specialization and a group of 50 teachers received specialized training in
 the use of software “Primavera". Training of trainers in Competency Based Training (CBT) continued to take place, 232 teachers benefited from CBT
 and 187 people were trained in evaluation and internal verification.

 Component C - Quality Improvement in Training Institutions: The main focus was on the completion and monitoring of outstanding works,
 implementation, delivery of goods and equipment to the schools and completion of tender documents for furniture and equipment and training of
 teachers in the use of newly installed equipment.

 Component D - Skills Development Fund (FUNDEC): The main activities were the follow-up of sub-projects financed under the 6th and 7th call for
 proposals. Most beneficiaries are carrying out the activities as planned. ES-COREP commissioned an independent evaluation of FUNDEC to be
 concluded by December 2014.

 Key decisions:
 The Project closing data was extended from September 2014 to September 30, 2015.

 Overall Comments
 Most of the target indicators have been achieved or surpassed except for the target related to employment rate of graduates within six months of
 graduation. The current rate is 52% which is below the expected 55% for 2014. The end of project target of 60% perhaps was too ambitious if
 compared with the baseline of 27% in 2006 and the fact the labor structure did not change significantly in recent years.

               Institutions manage to retain their income but most are reluctant to report on the level of income. Moving forward would be important to
               include public disclosure of income as part of the incentive system.

               The Financing Framework of TVET has been agreed among main stakeholders in 2012. The Government decided to integrate the
               framework within a comprehensive TVET Law, which was recently approved by the National Assembly, number 23/2014 (suplemento n0 5).
               The Law has been published in the Boletim da Republica and is expected to become effective by December 2014.
               The approved legislation includes: (i) the creation of a national regulatory body, Autoridade Nacional de Educação Professional (ANEP),
               which will govern the TVET system in Mozambique, with effective representation of stakeholders and (ii) the creation of a National Training
               Fund. Among others, the new legislation provides also for greater autonomy to TVET institutions.
