                         total signed amount of US$ 67 million, US$ 49, 17 million has been disbursed representing 73.4% (47.6% under the Additional Credit and 106% of the Original Credit due to the
                         exchange rate between the SDR and USD) of signed amount. The overall commitment of funds is 80%. The project has four components namely: Development of an Institutional

                         Following the recommendations of the Project Midterm, in October 2013, the implementing agency centered its action on (i) the establishment of the financing framework for the
                         TVET, (ii) the review of ongoing qualifications and the development of new qualifications for the sectors of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) and mining; (iii) the

                         process of knowledge transfer to relevant institutions, (iv) the implementation of overall project activities. Therefore, in the past six months the Executive Secretariat for the
                         Commission of Professional Education and Training Reform (ES-COREP), in collaboration with the National Directorate for Technical Education (DINET) and the National Institute for
                         Employment and Professional Training (INEFP), continued to focus in improving learning conditions, including through the provision of continuous teacher training and the
                         implementation of the new competency based training (CBT) curriculum. Progress was also registered in the delivery of activities aimed at (i) improving management at the schools;
                         and (ii) improving linkages with the private sector. But there are some short-falls requiring urgent attention (e.g. the recruitment of teachers albeit improvements is not yet at the
                         desirable level; the level of budget for school maintenance is very limited; and the autonomy of the school is yet to be accomplished). The pace of implementation have increased with
                         visible and important outputs to guide the elevation of quality of learning in the institutions (i.e., mapping of the current needs of professional competences of teachers, resulting in the
                         development of an action plan which is currently guiding the training of teachers and school managers in related professional competences, consoldiation of standard advisory
                         committees for the areas of gas and mining with relevant representation of industry, the definition of the system for the recognition of prior learning).

                         The overall progress of the project is in good standing. PDO indicators are on track to be achieved and most of the intermediate indicators have been achieved or on track to be
                         achieved. However, a recent assessment of professional competences of teachers and school managers indicated specific topics in which more training is needed to ensure the
                         quality of teaching and learning provision which led to the development of an action plan that is currently being implemented. The total number of students assessed through the new
                         competency based system in medium technical institutions is now 7,015, of which 2,345 registered in 2014. The overall number of Project beneficiaries is over 50,000 including the
                         beneficiaries of the Skills Development Fund (FUNDEC).

                         The following are the main achievements by component:

                         1. Development of an Institutional Framework: This component has a dual function: (i) to provide the institutional, funding and management framework for the reformed national TVET
                         system; and (ii) support the establishment of an Executing Secretariat (ES) of COREP, which main function is to coordinate the implementation of reform. The sustainability of the
                         ongoing reform, and in particular the establishment of a financing framework, has been at the center of dialo gue between the Government and main stakeholders and within the
                         Government. The Inter-ministerial Commission for Professional Education and Training Reform (CIREP) reviewed the legislation package which was subsequently endorsed by the
                         Minister Council in November 2013. The proposed legislation includes a financing framework and a proposal for a new governance system for TVET and has been submitted to
                         Parliament in March 2014 aiming for its appreciation and approval in the next session of the National Assembly by July 2014.

                         2. Development of Standards-Based Qualification and Training System: The activities under this component are progressing at satisfactory level. In addition to the qualifications
                         approved, the Executive Secretariat for the Commission for Professional Education and Training Reform (ES-COREP) is working with the sector technical committees for the areas of
                         mining and gas and ICTs on the design of new qualifications for the mining and ICT sectors. The development of curricula for short term training for the sector of ICTs and the review
                         of ongoing qualifications in the sector of administration and management is ongoing. The process for the design of occupational standards and review and validation of the approved
                         qualifications continues to be done with involvement of the relevant stakeholders, in particular the private sector. Aiming at further strengthening the quality of teaching and learning,
                         data collection on technical and managerial skills needs were gathered resulting in a plan of action currently being implemented in selected institutions to raise the technical

                         competences of teachers and managers.

                         3. Quality Improvement in Training Institutions: The main focus was on the completion and monitoring of outstanding works, implementation, delivery of goods and equipment to the
                         schools and completion of tender documents for furniture and equipment and training of teachers.

                         Regarding the improvement on the use of new facilities and installed equipment, ES-COREP in close collaboration with the National Directorate for Technical Education (DINET) and
                         the National Institute for Employment and Professional Training (INEFP) continued to focus on the provision of refreshment training to teachers and instructors in the use of new
                         equipment, has ensured that all school managers and teachers are well informed on the safety measures and make use of relevant equipment, and school managers have been
                         required to step up preventive maintenance measures that have been developed an delivered to the institutions.

                         4. Skills Development Fund (FUNDEC): The implementation of the sub-projects financed under the 5th call for proposals has been concluded. Project approved under the 6th call for

                         activities as planned. ES-COREP will soon commission an independent evaluation of FUNDEC.
