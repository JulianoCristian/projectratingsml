                         In past five months the Executive Secretariat for the Commission for Professional Education and Training Reform (ES-COREP) in collaboration with the National Directorate for
                         Technical Education (DINET) and the National Institute for Employment and Professional Training (INEFP) continued to focus in improving learning conditions, including through the

                         provision of continuous teacher training and the implementation of the new competency based training (CBT) curriculum. Progress was also registered in the delivery of activities
                         aimed to (i) improving management at the schools; (ii) improving linkages with the private sector. But there are some short-falls requiring urgent attention (the recruitment of teachers
                         is not yet at the desirable level, the level of budget for school maintenance is very limited, the autonomy of the school is yet to be accomplished).

                         The Mid-Term review of the Project confirmed the relevance of the Project Development Objectives. The overall progress of the project indicates that the Project is in good standing
                         but because there are delays in selected activities such as the recruitment of desirable levels of teachers and also data collection on selected indicators (including data on two of the
                         PDO indicators) prevented full measurement of results the project is rated moderately satisfactory on both implementation progress and development objectives.

                         The total number of students assessed through the new competency based system in medium technical institutions is now 4,670, with 1,775 students being assessed in 2013. The
                         overall number of Project beneficiaries is over 50.000 including FUNDEC beneficiaries.

                         The following are the main achievements by component:

                         Development of an Institutional Framework: This component has a dual function: (i) to provide the institutional, funding and management framework for the reformed national TVET
                         system; and (ii) provides for the establishment of an Executing Secretariat (ES) of COREP which main function is to coordinate the implementation of reform. The sustainability of the
                         ongoing reform, in particular, the importance of reaching agreement on the establishment of a financing framework has been at the center of dialog between the Government and
                         main stakeholders and within the Government. Even though with delays the Inter-ministerial Commission for Professional Education and Training Reform (CIREP) has met and have
                         discussed and reviewed the legislation package and has submitted it for appreciation of the Minister Council who endorsed the legislation and has agreed on its submission for
                         Parliamentary approval. The proposed legislation includes a financing framework and a proposal for a new governance system for TVET.

                         Regarding implementation of the reform at the training institutions, ES-COREP in close collaboration with the National Director for Technical Education (DINET) and the National
                         Institute for Employment and Professional Training (INEFP) focused on the provision of refreshment training to teachers and instructors in the use of new equipment.

                         Development of Standards-Based Qualification and Training System: The activities under this component are progressing at satisfactory level. In addition to the qualifications
                         approved, the Executive Secretariat for the Commission for Professional Education and Training Reform (ES-COREP) is working with the sector technical committees for the areas of
                         mining and gas on the designing of new qualifications for the mining sector. The development of curricula for short term training for the sector of ICTs and the review of ongoing
                         qualifications in the sector of administration and management is ongoing. The process for the design of occupational standards, review and validation of the approved qualifications
                         continues to be done with involvement of the relevant stakeholders in particular the private sector.

                         Quality Improvement in Training Institutions: The main focus was in the completion of outstanding works, implementation, delivery of goods and equipment to the schools and
                         completion of tender documents for furniture and equipment expected to be launched by November 2013. Two major rehabilitations are expected to start in December 2013.

                         Skills Development Fund (FUNDEC): The implementation of the sub-projects financed under the 5th and 6th call for proposals through the competitive fund for development of
                         competences (FUNDEC) is progressing. Most beneficiaries are carrying out the activities as planned. The ES-COREP has a good mapping of the difficulties faced by each
                         beneficiary institution and has step up the support to timely address issues in particular those related to fiduciary matters. The evaluation of the 7th call for proposals has been
                         completed in October and the training in project management, procurement and financial management has been organized and provided to all beneficiary institutions.
