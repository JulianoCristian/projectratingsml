*The baseline values for indicators included in the original project are dated February 21, 2006 (the date that
the PAD was issued). For all indicators introduced under the 2011 restructuring/AF which pertained to
activities which had been implemented since the beginning of the operation, baseline values are from 2007
as these are considered the “original baseline” values in the AF Project Paper. In this way, the RF provides
a more comprehensive account of the outputs and outcomes achieved throughout the life of the Project.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Country Context. Mozambique’s economy at the time of project preparation had
been steadily recovering and the political and social context were improving after a
prolonged period of war. Beginning in 1992, the country experienced rapid economic
growth and marked poverty reduction. Between 1997 and 2004, annual gross domestic
product (GDP) growth rate averaged 9.4 percent (one of the highest growth rates in Sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA)). From 1996 to 2003, the proportion of people living in poverty
declined from 69 percent to 54 percent and inequality across provinces and regions also
fell. Notwithstanding the gains in poverty reduction, more than half of the population was
still living in poverty at the time of project preparation. Although the country’s labor
market was still characterized by a small formal sector, data from the national household
surveys of 1996 and 2002 indicated that the formal employment sector was growing and
demanding more skilled labor. This shift in the labor market triggered a sharp increase in
the return to post-basic education, particularly among workers with little or no education
and skills. In recognition of this, in 2007 the Government launched the Programa
Integrado de Reforma da Educação Profissional/Integrated Program for Training Reform
(PIREP) which was an ambitious and comprehensive reform program to transform the
technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system and to improve the quality
and relevance of training in close cooperation with industry and social partners. The
reforms were introduced in order to increase access to post-primary education and, more
importantly, to respond effectively and efficiently to the needs of the labor market.

2.      Sector Context. Mozambique’s training system, which was responsible for
shaping the skills profile available to the labor market, had been slow to respond to
changing labor market demands of the formal sector. Employer surveys and labor market
studies in formal sector enterprises pointed to a mismatch between the skills sought by the
labor market and those skills offered by workers.1 At the time of project preparation, the
country’s workforce was poorly educated and lacked technical skills – half of the
population either had no education at all or possessed only basic literacy skills. Although
access to primary education had increased substantially in the previous decade, reaching
nearly universal levels, less than one-third of an age group reached Grade 7, fewer than 10
percent progressed to Grade 10, and fewer than 3 percent of an age group completed 12
years of education. Girls had a significantly lower completion rate than boys. In 2003,
approximately 12 percent of the Grade 7 leavers continued their education within the

 The Bank and the government jointly carried a series of rapid assessments and studies during the preparation
of the Mozambique TVET Project. These evaluations were subsequently used to inform the design of the
operation.

indicated that learning outcomes were poor and were further compromised by the
continued poor quality of services.

3. The key challenges facing the education sector at the time of project preparation were:

      i.   Limited relevance of education and skills training: One of the principal reasons for
           the poor relevance of the supply-driven training system was the lack of
           involvement from employers and industry representatives in defining occupational
           standards and the learning content of courses and programs offered in the public
           training system. Surveys of enterprises indicated general dissatisfaction in this area
           and highlighted a lack of relevant, especially practical, supervisory and foreign
           language skills among graduates. These limitations often translated into higher
           costs for employers to retrain workers adding to their operational costs and, more
           broadly, to the overall cost of doing business in Mozambique.

     ii.   Poor quality education and training: The quality of the general public training
           systems was very low, a situation caused by under-qualified and insufficiently
           skilled teachers/instructors, a shortage of teaching aids, partly dilapidated
           workshops for practical training and outdated curricula (overloaded with academic
           subjects and few linkages with industry to strengthen the quality of student
           practices). The poor quality of training often translated into low levels of internal
           efficiency, as reflected by the high repetition (as high as 45 percent for some
           levels) and dropout rates (estimated to be between 15-20 percent, annually).

    iii.   Limited access and equity to education and skills training: There was an acute
           shortage of places in secondary and technical schools for graduates from the
           expanding primary school system with many learners choosing to enter the
           technical schools as a second best option, even though the returns to TVET tended
           to be higher at the medium level compared to the same level in the general
           secondary academic stream at Grade 12. Access to TVET schools was further
           restricted by the limited availability of relevant training opportunities for school-
           leavers and other groups in need of training and social and cultural barriers often
           prevented some individuals from participating in TVET programs.

    iv.    Fragmented governance and institutional arrangements: The TVET system was
           characterized by a high level of fragmentation and it was managed and
           administered in an uncoordinated manner. The system lacked an institutional

  In this document the term Technical and Vocational Education (TVE) refers to formal education based on
curricula approved by the Direcção Nacional da Educação Técnico Profissional e Vocacional/National
Directorate for Vocational and Technical Education (DINET), Vocational Training (VT) refers to formal and
non-formal training on curricula approved by the Instituto Nacional do Emprego e Formação
Profissional/National Institute for Employment and Training (INEFP) or training courses provided by NGOs,
churches and other enterprises using their own curricula. Finally, Technical and Vocational Education and
Training (TVET) is used as an overarching term to describe the entire landscape of formal, non-formal and
informal training and technical education.


                                                   2
         framework to organize, articulate, integrate, regulate and ensure the quality of
         training interventions and programs. The governance and management of the
         public training system had not involved employers, industry representatives or
         civil society which prevented training programs and the curricula used from
         aligning with labor market needs.

    v.   Limited sustainability: The TVET system was seriously under-resourced
         compared to the country’s general education system and training systems in
         neighbouring countries. In 2003, the Government spent 0.2 percent of its GDP or
         2.3 percent of the national education budget on TVET institutions. Spending in
         formal and non-formal public schools was among the lowest in SSA, negatively
         affecting the quality of training and capacity utilization. 3 On average the
         government spent US$95 per student in the TVET system in 2002 and US$164
         per student in this system in 2003 compared to US$130 in 2002 and US$125 in
         2003 in the general secondary education system. With the exception of some large,
         well-resourced enterprises, industry’s preparedness to undertake and support
         employee training was also constrained by a lack of resources.

4.      Project Context. In the October 2005 Letter of Development Policy (LDP) for
Vocational Education 4 , the Minister of Planning in Mozambique outlined the
Government’s policy on TVET reform and requested Bank assistance in reforming the
current system by establishing a new paradigm that was labor-market oriented and demand-
driven. This system would use international quality standards and would be more
responsive to the country’s development needs. The policy set out by the Minister focused
on wide participation of key partners. It also applied labor market definitions of standards
of competencies and included: a national system of evaluation and certification of
professional competencies; a new model of institutional management with autonomy and
decentralization which was tied to locally identified needs; expansion of the training of
trainers approach; introduction of a modular training system; establishment of a
compensative fund to promote innovation; and a strengthened monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) system. The Government expressed its commitment to: (i) defining and
implementing the necessary policies; (ii) supporting the development of institutional and
financing strategy and the design of a framework to support this new system; and (iii)
assigning funds from the public budget to support the reform process beginning in 2006.

5.      The Vocational and Technical Education (TVET) project in the amount of US$37.5
million (US$30 million International Development Association (IDA) funding and US$7.5
from Kingdom of the Netherlands trust fund) was undertaken to provide support to the
Government-led reform of the TVET sub-sector. Bank support in this area was justified
given the important role that education policy plays in socioeconomic development and in
light of the Government’s expressed commitment to undertake reforms necessary to

achieving sector objectives. The Project’s support to the Government’s reform efforts in
the sector were firmly anchored in the Government’s Action Plan for Reduction of Poverty
(PARP II) (2003) which emphasized investment in skills development as a means to
reducing poverty. The investment was also in accordance with the FY04-FY07 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mozambique presented to the Bank’s Board of Executive
Directors in November 2003 which envisaged investment in the TVET sector reform as a
means to improving access to post-primary education, and to ‘increase graduation of
Mozambicans with the skills, practices, and attitudes needed to fill technical positions, and
create value-adding knowledge and innovation in production’ – allowing the country to
overcome the problem of ‘the missing middle in Mozambique’. The Bank’s support to the
TVET sub-sector in Mozambique was well-coordinated with the support being provided
by other development partners (DPs).

6.      Other Donor/Financiers supporting the overall government TVET program.
During project implementation several donors made grant disbursements supporting
different aspects of the Government program in parallel to the Bank-supported project. The
overall figures for each donor are:

    a.   DANIDA – Denmark – US$ 2.6 million
    b.   AECID – Spain – US$ 1.02 million
    c.   FICA – Netherlands- US$ 0.95 million
    d.   TVET-PRD – Norway – US$ 0.979 million

7.     Some donors such as Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit
(GIZ) provided substantial technical assistance to project implementation through
provision of technical assistance to the implementing agency, training of teachers and
provision of school based advisers which continue to be provided through the presence of
Technical Assistance (TA) in the school (see Annex 2 for further details).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.      The original project development objective (PDO) was “to facilitate the transition
of the existing TVET system to a demand-led training TVET system and provide the
beneficiaries with more market relevant skills and improved economic opportunities.” The
original key PDO-level indicators5 were:

        percentage of employers who indicate that their employees, who are recent
         graduates of targeted institutions, have market relevant skills;
        labor market earnings of graduates of targeted programs compared to control group;

 As was the practice at the time of project preparation for indicators to be included in the Development
Credit Agreement (DCA) and the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), performance indicators for this Project
were included in both the TVET Project DCA (dated March 30, 2006) and in the PAD (February 21, 2006)
were they were slightly different. By the time the project was restructured in 2011, this practice had been
abandoned. Therefore the analysis presented in this ICR is based on indicators initially in the PAD and then
as modified during the June 2011 AF/Restructuring exercise.


                                                     4
           average time (in days) to find a job or become self-employed after graduating from
            a targeted program compared to a control group graduating from institution not
            targeted by the Programa Integrado da Reforma da Educação Professional
            (PIERP) assistance; and
           percentage of graduates of targeted programs who find jobs or create jobs that are
            directly linked to their field of study.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

9.      Under the June 2011 Additional Financing (AF)/restructuring of the project, the
PDO was simplified to better reflect the intended outcome of the project. The revised PDO
was as follows: “to improve the quality and relevance of technical and vocational training
in Mozambique with a focus on selected key TVET institutions and programs.” The PDO-
level indicators and intermediate results indicators were revised to be more aligned with
the modified PDO and were more realistic given the then current stage of TVET reform
and project implementation. Table 1 provides an overview of original and revised PDO-
level indicators.

    Original PDO-level Indicators          Revised PDO-level Indicators

    Percentage of employers surveyed             This indicator was replaced by two indicators: (i) percentage of
    who indicate that their employees,           employer’s/private sector representatives reporting satisfaction
    who are recent graduates of targeted         with quality of new competency based training programs; and
    institutions, have marked relevant           (ii) competency standard endorsed by the Sector Training
    skills                                       Advisory Committees (STACs) and Comissão Executiva da
                                                 Reforma da Educação Profissional/Executive Commission for
                                                 Professional Education and Training Reform (COREP).
    Labor market earnings of graduates of        This indicator was dropped during the 2011 AF restructuring. It
    targeted programs                            was expected that this information would be measured through
                                                 tracer studies to be undertaken by the completion of the project.
    Average time (in days) to find a job or      Indicator replaced by new indicator: Learners assessed through

    study                                        indicator more accurately set the period of observation.
                                                 Indicator added: Direct Project Beneficiaries (number) of which

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.    The original target groups identified in PAD and captured in the PDO were the
teaching and managerial staff of the project-supported pilot institutions and their students.
At the time of the 2011 AF restructuring, there were additional target groups formally
added: (i) beneficiaries of the skills development fund; (ii) school managers; and (iii)
teachers and students enrolled in the targeted TVET programs. By project closing, the total
number of project beneficiaries was 78,780.

1.5 Original Components

11.     The original project had four components:

12.     Component A - Development of an Institutional Framework (US$12.0 million
including the costs of an Executive Secretariat – including both original and
additional financing totals; Actual Expenditure: US$17.5 million). The objective of
this component was to reform the governance and management structures for the training
system and develop options for the reform of a system of financing in collaboration with
the relevant industry representatives and social partners. A major thrust of the component
was to encourage the involvement and active participation of industry and enterprises in
the management of TVET institutions and to move towards the coordination and
articulation of the different skills development programs, offered by different providers.
Under this component, IDA support financed: (i) technical assistance (TA) (consultancy
inputs) for problem diagnosis and conceptual work; (ii) capacity-building of stakeholders
and administrator/managers; and (iii) institutional development support.

13.     Component B - Standards-based Qualification and Training System (US$7.0
million – including both original and additional financing totals; Actual Expenditure:
US$9.1 million) was the principal objective of this project and one of the fundamental
elements of the TVET reform process. The Government was committed to transforming its
prevailing curriculum-based TVET system into a system based on occupational standards.
A new assessment system that was transparent and legitimate would be established and
groups with different training and learning backgrounds would be able to access the TVET
learning system. The component included support for developing methods for standards-
setting, curriculum planning and development, and assessment/certification arrangements,
including the testing of the system that aimed to target a minimum of 20 occupational areas
spread across four (4) economic sectors, viz. tourism and hospitality, management and
administration, industrial maintenance, and agro-industry. Inputs included technical
assistance for the design of the occupational standards, curriculum and assessment design,
capacity building for officials directly involved in the process, and the development and
establishment of necessary systems to implement the reforms, as well as operational
support for implementation at the pilot schools. At the end of the project, training and


operations of IDA-eligible countries. These indicators were national in scope and were to be used to monitor
progress toward achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which the Bank team judged
to be also appropriate for monitoring PDO progress of the project.


                                                     6
assessment based on occupational standards were to be fully implemented in four pilot
sectors - industrial maintenance, agro-processing, tourism and hospitality, and
management and administration.

14.     Component C - Quality Improvement in Training Institutions (US$38.1
million, excluding contingencies – including both original and additional financing
totals; Actual Expenditure: US$41.7 million) was designed to address the quality
problems affecting the National Directorate for Vocational and Technical Education
(Direção Nacional da Educação Técnico Profissional e Vocacional – DINET) and the
National Institute for Employment and Training (Instituto Nacional do Emprego e
Formação Profissional – INEFP) institutions. For the four selected pilot sectors, the
project aimed to fund the development and piloting of new learning materials, teacher in-
service and pre-service training, improvement of management capacity, and relevant
upgrading of teaching facilities, e.g. classrooms and workshops to respond to the new
modularized training course programs based on occupational standards. Sixteen different
DINET and INEFP institutions had been chosen as pilot sites for testing of the new
Competency-Based Training (CBT) courses in the strategic areas mentioned above.

15.     Component D – Skills Development Fund or Fundo para o Desenvolvimento de
Competências Profissionais (FUNDEC) (US$11.4 million - both original and
additional financing totals; Actual Expenditure: US$5.2 million) was designed to
promote innovation and initiatives for the improvement of quality and relevance of training
and to increase access to employment-oriented TVET for underserved population groups.
The component was to finance small grants accessed on a competitive basis, through
FUNDEC, to promote innovation and initiatives for the improvement of quality and
relevance of training and to increase access to employment-oriented TVET courses for out-
of-school children and adults in rural areas. The project was to support: (i) capacity
building and training activities offered by public providers (formal or non-formal training)
who were not taking part in the pilot projects; (ii) capacity building and training activities
(formal and non-formal training) offered by non-public providers; and (iii) targeted training
courses to respond to the needs of underserved groups who were located primarily in rural
areas in order to improve livelihood opportunities in their immediate economic context.

1.6 Revised Components

16.      At the time of the 2011 AF/restructuring, the project was provided an additional
IDA credit in the amount of US$37 million equivalent and adjustments were made to the
components as follows: (i) Component A: Development of an Institutional Framework,
funding was increased from US$6.0 million to US$12.0 million to continue supporting
operating costs (including consulting costs for capacity strengthening) of the Executive
Secretariat for Executive Commission for Professional Education and Training Reform
(ES-COREP); (ii) Component B: Establishment of a Standards-based Qualification and
Assessment System increased support from US$2.0 million to US$7.0 million and added
development of two new standards-based qualifications in information and communication
technology (ICT) and mining; (iii) Component C: Quality Improvement in Training
Institutions, increased the support from US$19.1 million to US$38.1 million to cover the
increased costs of construction due to the high levels of inflation related to construction


                                              7
materials being experienced worldwide, which also necessitated a reduction in the number
of institutions to be rehabilitated from 12 to 9; and (iv) Component D: Skills Development
Fund increased support from US$6.4 million to US$11.4 million so that FUNDEC would
be able to operate three additional rounds of competitive grants for sub-projects which
aimed to improving the quality and relevance of TVET.

1.7 Other significant changes

17.     After the May 15, 2009 implementation support mission (ISM), the Bank and
Government teams agreed that there should be a fifth outcome indicator used to measure
“the number of TVET institutions that formed partnerships between training providers or
promoters and the private sector”. The team added this indicator to the June 2009
Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) and provided baseline data and targets.
However, this indicator was not added to the RF under a formal restructuring and it was no
longer tracked as a PDO-level indicator after the 2011 AF/restructuring as discussed below.
The indicator was, however, continued in 2011 as an intermediate indicator under
Component D.

18.     On September 21, 2010 the Kingdom of the Netherlands requested that its financial
support for the project be reduced from US$7.5 million to US$6.709 million (equivalent)
due to fiscal budget cuts associated with the 2010 economic crisis. On October 2010, an
amendment to the Administration Agreement with the Kingdom of the Netherlands was
approved. This amendment reduced the total amount of the trust fund support to
approximately US$6.7 million (equivalent) and modified the closing date to October 31,
2011.

19.      On June 6, 2011 the Bank Board of Executive Directors approved additional
financing for the TVET project which provided additional IDA financing in the amount of
US$37 million equivalent. At the same time the project was restructured to: (i) modify the
PDO; (ii) modify and align the RF with the new PDO; (iii) modify the project institutional
arrangements by eliminating support for the establishment of a national training authority
and the corresponding alignment of Direção Nacional da Educação Tecnico Profissional
e Vocacional/National Directorate for Vocational and Technical Education (DINET) and
Insitituto Nacional do Emprego e Formação Profissional/National Institute for
Employment and Training (INEFP)’s because they were to be supported with the
Government’s own resources; (iv) reduce the number of TVET institutions to be
rehabilitated from 12 to 9 due to the underestimation of construction cost which was
directly associated high inflation resulting from the purchase of goods from South Africa
during the preparation of the South Africa World Cup 7 ; (v) provide equipment for 10

 This figure was increased from 9 to 10 during the period following the approval of the 2011
AF/Restructuring.


                                             8
schools8 ; (vi) add the development of two new standard-based qualifications: ICT and
mining, as well as continue support for industrial maintenance, agriculture, tourism and
hospitality, and administration and management; (vii) provide additional operating costs
for ES-COREP; (viii) provide three (3) additional rounds of FUNDEC competitive grants
with a continued focus on youth and gender equity; and (ix) extend the project closing date
from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2014.

20.     On May 19, 2014, there was a second project restructuring to extend the closing
date from September 30, 2014 to September 30, 2015. The one (1) year extension allowed
for completion of a one (1) year training action plan developed to improve teacher
professional competencies. The extension would also provide additional time to improve
the quality of training provided within the project-supported institutions.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation and Quality at Entry

21.     Project Preparation. The October 2005 Letter of Development Policy, outlined
the Government’s policy on TVET reform and requested Bank assistance in reforming the
TVET system. The project would support the first five-year phase of the Government’s
integrated program for the reform of professional education (Programa Integrado da
Reforma da Educação Professional – PIREP).

22.     To support the Government’s efforts in the TVET sector, the Bank worked closely
with the Government and other relevant counterparts to prepare the Mozambique Technical
and Vocational Education project. Both project preparation and design were guided by
extensive Bank-supported policy research which had been conducted prior to preparation.
This analytical work provided the basis for the 2004 report on Skills Development in
Mozambique: Issues and Options9 which identified the key issues and challenges facing
the TVET sector in the country. These issues needed to be addressed to ensure that the
sector could be transformed into a system capable of responding flexibly and effectively to
changing economic needs and labor market demands.

23.    In order to improve the alignment of training provided and labor market needs, the
Government created a consultative institutional framework for TVET development which
was underpinned by the TVET strategies which the Government had defined. The TVET
reforms which had been outlined in key strategic documents would rely on three entities
for their effective implementation: (i) a political level known as the Comissão
Interministerial para a Reforma da Educação Professional (CIREP); (ii) an executive level


8
  The terms ‘schools’ and ‘institutions’ are sometimes used in Government documents to refer to the same
unit. Generally speaking, ‘schools’ were technical training schools which existed before the TVET reforms
and ‘institutions’ was the term used after the reform, with the introduction of CBT and appropriate teacher
training.

known as the Commissão Executiva de Reforma da Educação Profisssional (COREP); and
(iii) the Executive Secretariat (ES) of COREP.

24.     The project design was also firmly anchored in the Government’s PARPA II as well
as the 2005 LDP. Its design was also informed by the Bank’s Mozambique Expenditure
Review Phase 2: Sectoral Expenditures10 which highlighted the need for an emphasis on
skills development in the country’s workforce in order to accelerate economic development.
As indicated, the project was approved in the context of the FY04-FY07 CAS and the
subsequent Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) and the 2008-2011 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS), which was endorsed by the Bank’s Board of Executive
Directors in April 2007. These strategic documents reiterated the Government’s plans to
reduce poverty and to support skills development.

25.     The preparation team used the Specific Investment Loan (SIL) instrument given the
targeted nature of project-supported activities. Project activities were selected on the basis
of experience of and lessons learned from other Bank-supported TVET projects. Project
preparation also benefited from the fact that the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC),
which had supported the implementation of the Higher Education Project (HEP), had
extensive experience with implementation of investment projects as well as procurement,
financial management (FM), contract management and working with the Education Sector
Strategic Project (ESSP) (IDA Credit 32710). The strong analytical underpinnings,
steadfast Government commitment, and Bank’s experience in TVET sector reform,
allowed the team to prepare the project in 18 months.

26.     The Bank preparation and appraisal teams were comprised of experts with technical
know-how which was essential in guiding the design of the project. The preparation
process also was able to benefit from input of peer reviewers with extensive knowledge
and experience in the sector that provided sound guidance on the project design. A Quality
Enhancement Review (QER) was held during project preparation. The preparation team
identified project risks and proposed adequate mitigation measures. The project became
effective three (3) months after Board approval on June 29, 2006. From the beginning of
preparation to project effectiveness, the following was accomplished: (i) the full
development of the project with the government; (ii) the preparation and review and of
MEC studies on vocational education issues; (iii) the preparation and review of an LDP;
and (iv) a strong dialogue with other donors on project design. Project preparation also
benefitted from the use of a Government of Japan Population and Human Resources
Development (PHRD) grant in the amount of US$695,000, a Norwegian Education Trust
Fund (NETF) grant of approximately US$505,000 that provided technical advisory
services and consultants, as well as support from other partners (i.e., GTZ, DANIDA,
Spanish Cooperation, and Italian Cooperation).

27.    The project preparation process was thoughtful, collaborative, and technically
sound. For the purposes of designing the TVET project, the Government created an

Executive Secretariat (ES) in COREP in July 2004 bringing together the Ministries of
Education, Labor and Higher Education and the Confederação das Associações
Económicas de Moçambique 11 (CTA). The ES coordinated activities across ministries,
stakeholders and Cooperating Donors (CDs). The Secretariat also received financing from
the PHRD (Trust Fund 53734) and contributions from TVET CDs. All procurement and
FM activities for the PHRD funds were carried out by the Department of Administration
and Finance (DAF) in the MEC, which also handled the ESSP and the HEP (IDA Cr.
36090) in coordination with the Secretariat.

28.     Original Project Design and Quality at Entry. The TVET project design fit
squarely into the Government’s “Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty (2001-
2005) PARPA”. The Project activities were strongly aligned with the Government’s PIREP
(or reform program which was the first (pilot) phase of a long-term program designed to
overcome the challenges faced by the TVET sector, called the Reforma da Educação
Profissional/Vocational Education Reform (REP)). It was envisioned that the PIREP
would be implemented between May 2006 and September 2011. The results of this first
pilot phase would guide the subsequent phases. The second phase of the REP (2011-2015)
would focus on scaling up the reforms introduced in the first phase to include other
occupations and sectors of the economy and other private and public training institutions.
During the third phase of the REP (2016-2020), the reforms would be consolidated and
extended to all TVET institutions.

29.     The original project PDO was aligned with the Government’s priorities and guided
the selection of relevant activities to be supported under the operation. The overarching
objective of the REP was to improve the quality and responsiveness of the TVET system
to labor market needs by delivering training in a sustainable, integrated, effective, and
equitable manner. The indicators were aligned with the project objectives. The design
called for some indicator baselines to be established in the initial stages of implementation.
In retrospect, the original indicator targets were ambitious given that there were logistical
difficulties in collecting data and implementation delays did occur. The project design also
took into consideration comments from the peer reviewers during the concept and appraisal
review meetings, as well as the July 2005 QER, which included ensuring that there was:
(i) strong demand-side involvement from employers; (ii) involvement of industry
representatives and civil society in planning, design and governance of the TVET sector;
(iii) developing a standards-based training paradigm; and (iv) providing increased
autonomy to TVET institutions in decision-making. In addition, the design team drew
lessons from previous Bank-supported projects in Mozambique as well as its experience in
financing related investments including the ESSP, the HEP, and the Enterprise
Development Project (PODE Cr. 33170) in Mozambique, and similar programs in Chile,
Mexico, Zambia and Ethiopia.

30.    The project design included the development of: (i) an institutional framework and
financing mechanism; (ii) a standards-based qualifications and training system; (iii) quality
improvements in TVET institutions; and (iv) a skills development fund. The combined

     Confederation of Economic Associations of Mozambique.


                                                  11
investments were designed to: (i) establish the most important key elements of the new
demand-oriented TVET system (governance structure, outcome-based system of
occupational standards, modularized curricula and external assessment and certification);
(ii) start, in a targeted manner, the improvements in quality and relevance to TVET courses;
and (iii) address problems of access and equity. The project was implemented and managed
through a 3-level institutional structure which was responsible for implementing and
supporting Government reforms in the sector.

31.     While the project concentrated on addressing formal sector needs, it also included
the needs of the informal sector. The informal sector needs were addressed at the policy
level by CIREP and COREP. In addition, these needs were addressed through FUNDEC’s
third window and also through support provided to centers of professional education where
training was provided to many individual businesses or association owners in the informal
sector. In addition, representatives of the informal sector contributed to the definition of
the occupational/professional standards which were supported within the strategic sectors
targeted by the project.12

32.     Although the project objectives and activities were appropriately aligned with the
Government’s TVET programs and goals, the project design proved to be ambitious for a
five-year SIL. This was confirmed by a Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP-
2) review in August 2010 as well as the 2009 mid-term review (MTR). The QALP-2 and
MTR found several positive achievements and identified some project weaknesses such as:
(i) underestimation of the time needed for curriculum development; (ii) implementation
delays as a result of progress being slow due to planning issues that hampered correct
articulation and sequencing of activities; (iii) problems with the establishment of the
national TVET oversight body; (iv) procurement problems due to the need to import most
goods and services; and (v) underestimation of project costs exacerbated by inflation. The
reviews also indicated that achievement of the development objectives was more likely if
the project was restructured and the scope strategically narrowed.

33.     Restructuring Design. At the request of the Government, the 2011 AF provided
funds to continue the TVET sub-sector paradigm shift. At the same time, the restructuring
was used to mitigate some of the exogenous factors affecting implementation as well as
address some design issues through: (i) simplification of the PDO; (ii) realignment of the
indicators with the revised PDO; (iii) elimination of support for the establishment of a
national TVET oversight body national training authority and corresponding alignment of
DINET and INEFP, the Government’s agencies which had been providing technical and
vocational training up through the initial stages of the project); and (iv) modification of


12
  As an example there was an association of farmers (which is represented in the STAC of Agriculture) and
others contribute for the policy dialogue and it was because of their participation that selected qualifications
have been developed for a number of activities (independent modules approved and also registered). The
development of qualifications for TVET teachers have also included the certificate C for teachers that can
provide basic training through professional training institutions and others to youth and workers that require
basic training in selected occupations. In addition, ES-COREP develop the System of Recognition of Prior
Learning (RPL) that was piloted and now requires approval from Government before it can be introduced in
a phased manner to target areas of knowledge.


                                                      12
project components and activities as discussed previously. The restructuring is judged to
have been highly appropriate particularly in light of the QALP-2 and MTR reviews.

2.2 Implementation

34.     The initial project implementation period was characterized by incremental
advances toward achieving the project’s PDO. In September 2006, shortly after project
effectiveness, the Government had already established an inter-ministerial commission and
a TVET 12-member governance board with 50 percent representation from the private
sector and civil society. However, the project was experiencing some delays: (i) enacting
legislative reforms was proving to be a lengthy and complex process; (ii) recruiting ES-
COREP staff was slow; (iii) identifying firms with adequate technical capacity to support
the development of the occupational standards within the strategic sectors targeted by the
Project; and (iv) establishing baseline data for PDO level indicators due to the
underestimation of the time needed to survey employers and graduates to obtain proper
baseline data that ultimately required a comprehensive study to collect the baseline data.

35.     By 2007, project implementation had improved as a result of the following
important achievements: (i) completion of the appointment of all but one ES-COREP staff
member; (ii) undertaking of an institutional mapping assessment in 15 of the 16 originally
targeted pilot schools; (iii) evaluation of the technical proposals for the selection of the
consulting firm that would advise the ES on standards development, curriculum planning,
assessment and quality assurance processes as a well as a new TVET Qualification
Framework; and (iv) formation of the four (4) Sector Training Advisory Committees
(STACs). Although progress was made on these activities, implementation was behind
schedule, specifically on the following activities: (i) recruitment of the consultancy firm to
assist in the development of standards and curricula; (ii) rehabilitation of schools; (iii)
training of teachers; and (iv) overall preparedness of pilot institutions. This led to delays in
the experimentation on the development of TVET reforms which were at the core of the
project. The international consulting firm which initially won the bid to provide TA for the
development of standards and curriculum went bankrupt and another had to be found to
take over the contract, causing additional delays. Further, the collection of baseline data
proved to be more difficult than initially envisioned causing delays in the establishment of
the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system and calculation of those figures necessary to
measure progress against the established year-on-year targets. These delays were
evidenced in slow disbursement which was lagging two (2) years following project
effectiveness. To add to these issues, in late 2008, the Bank was concerned that the
Government budget contribution to the reform program was falling short posing a risk to
the success of the project and the overall sustainability of reforms.

36.     At the time of the original 2009 MTR, the team confirmed that the PDO and design
were still highly relevant and remained in line with the Government’s initial phase of its
reform program (PIREP). The MTR reported that: (i) the development of an institutional
framework to support the new paradigm of demand-driven TVET had moved forward with
the establishment of a National Vocational Qualification Body and the National Vocational
Certification Framework; (ii) major consultancies to provide TA for curriculum



                                              13
development and teacher training programs were in place; (iii) qualification standards for
17 professional profiles had been developed and four (4) had been approved; and (iv) the
rehabilitation of TVET institutions and organizations was moving forward albeit at a
slower rate than expected due to underestimates of costs during the design period and
higher than expected costs of construction materials due to inflation.

37.      However, challenges remained: (i) there was a 17-month disbursement lag; (ii)
private sector involvement in the policy making body, COREP, was limited; (iii) the Bank
remained concerned that the Government’s limited financial support for the TVET sector
threatened the sustainability of the project’s investments; (iv) there seemed to be a lack of
sufficient progress in Component A which was partly due to the fact that the project design
regarded the four (4) components as parallel components without giving due emphasis to
the centrality of Component A to achievement of the PDO; (v) procurement processes for
consultant services were slow due to the hiring of international consultants to provide TA;
(vi) the underestimation of construction costs at appraisal had led to delays in construction;
and (vii) the initial difficulties with measuring some of the PDO-level indicators continued
to pose challenges.

38.     In response to some of the implementation challenges, the MTR focused on
addressing the issues of: (i) cost overruns in rehabilitation and equipment; (ii) limited
private sector involvement; and (iii) limited financial support from government at that time.
The MTR team revised cost estimates for works and equipment which showed that
completion of original design would require an additional US$10 million on top of the cost
overruns in other expenditure categories such as operating costs and consultant services.
The MTR team also recommended that COREP add two additional positions to increase
private sector involvement. With regards to government financial support, the MTR
recommended starting in 2010 the Government should: (i) cover costs of maintenance of
all project pilot schools; (ii) increase its contribution to the operating costs for COREP and
PIREP; and (iii) recruit and provide continuous in-service training for PIREP teachers.

39.     The MTR also reviewed the M&E system as well as progress towards achievement
of the PDO. This review resulted in recognition that the PDO needed to be simplified and
that the PDO and intermediate indicators need to be revised to accommodate the changes
made to the PDO, and recommended that the project be restructured to reflect the needed
modifications. At the end of the MTR, the project’s PDO rating moved from Satisfactory
to Moderately Satisfactory, and the Overall Implementation Progress (IP) stayed at
Moderately Satisfactory.

40.      The period following the MTR and prior to the 2011 AF, the following progress
was observed: (i) PIREP continued to present an ambitious and comprehensive agenda for
the reform of the TVET sector which was considered by Bank management to be sound
given the needs in the sector; (ii) the ES-COREP had finalized its consultancy on
governance, management and mechanisms for TVET financing which provided the
foundation for the design of related legislation to be submitted for approval by the Cabinet;
(iii) the Government agreed to channel additional funds through the MEC to provide for
more teacher training while the CDs also agreed to increase their funding training activity;



                                             14
(iv) the reform of the TVET system was finally reaching the classroom. The Standards-
based Qualification and Training System was in place and the new curricula for
administration/management, agriculture, hospitality business, and industrial maintenance
were available to teachers and students; (v) the project’s M&E system was modified to
reflect the fact that the first graduates benefitting from the reform would only finalize their
training by the end of 2011 and, therefore, the indicators related to: employers satisfaction,
earning by new graduates, time needed to find a job, and alignment between area of study
and type of job could not be assessed by the project’s original closing date; (vi) FUNDEC
had made some positive contributions through the skills development fund; (vii) safeguard
issues of Overall Safeguard Compliance, Environmental Assessment and Involuntary
Resettlement all were rated Satisfactory; and (viii) audit reports were provided on time and
found to be of unqualified. However, there remained a 20-month disbursement lag and
there were limited resources to fully implement the original project. These factors led the
government to request AF to complete those project activities that had not been fully
executed. It was as this time that the Netherlands also informed the Bank that its trust fund
would be reduced from the original US$7.5 million to US$6.7 million and would be closing
on October 31, 2011. It should also be noted that at this time the Bank had concluded nine
(9) supervision missions and carried out the 2009 MTR.

41.      Implementation Post Additional Financing. Within three months of signing the
AF Agreement, the Bank team reported that overall project implementation was
Satisfactory. Component A had seen progress with considerable movement on the drafting
of legislation/regulations to create the Labor Market Observatory as well as closer
cooperation in TVET units in development of short-term training qualifications.
Component B saw progress in PIREP’s development of 34 qualifications surpassing the
target of 20. Component C saw continued progress with civil works and equipment delivery
with the completion of rehabilitation and expansion in eight (8) schools, and Component
D had completed four (4) application cycles and provided grants to 132 sub-projects. By
December of 2011, (i) 41 new qualifications were being implemented in 9 institutions of
which five (5) had been rehabilitated and equipped with project funds; (ii) four institutions
had benefited from project funds through FUNDEC as well as support from selected
development partners; (iii) teachers and school managers from all the project supported
institutions were trained in administration of the new competency base curriculum; (iv) the
first cohort of students that received training in the new competency-based qualification
had graduated; (v) there was a significant increase in the private sector participation within
the Government’s larger TVET reform program.

42.     In December 2012, (i) the second cohort of students trained in the new competency
based qualifications had graduated; (ii) some indicators had either met or exceeded the
targets; (iii) the number of professional qualification profiles had increased to 53, with 12
new ones sent to COREP for approval; and (iv) disbursements were running at a much
more accelerated rate with a mere two month disbursement lag. These were significant
improvements. Challenges remained with (i) slow recruitment of qualified teachers and
instructors in the project selected areas; (ii) establishment of strong management boards in
TVET institutions which created some obstacles to implementing and consolidation of the
reform process; and (iii) slow progress on the development of the institutional and financial



                                              15
framework which had been stalled by a Government reshuffle which brought changes in
the leadership to both CIREP and COREP, as the management of the project
implementation shifted from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Science and
Technology, Higher Technical and Professional Education.

43.     The second MTR, post AF, was held in September/October 2013. The MTR
confirmed the high relevance of the PDO and found that the overall progress of the project
was in good standing and on track to achieve the development objectives. The overall
project disbursements were 66 percent (98 percent of the original IDA financing and 34
percent of the additional IDA financing) and the Dutch trust fund had disbursed 100 percent
of the revised amount. By late 2014, the new governance framework and financing
mechanism for TVET had been approved with the creation of the new national authority
for TVET, Autoridade Nacional da Educação Professional (ANEP) which was a major
achievement of in the long process of TVET reform in Mozambique and one of the primary
aims of the project.

44.      By project closing, September 30, 2015, all project activities had been completed
with the expectation of one institution (out of 10 project institutions) that needed to be
completed. The final civil works at the Chimoio Agricultural Institute (Instituto Agrário de
Chimoio – IAC) were 96 percent completed by project closing and were subsequently fully
completed in March 2016 with government’s own resources. 13 Some of the major
achievements under the Project included: the creation of the NTA; development of 67
professional qualifications along with the associated increased capacity; training of
teachers and managers in the new competency-based approach; and improved facilities.
These activities together have contributed to the achievement of the envisioned paradigm
shift in the TVET sub-sector. Overall there were twelve (12) Bank ISMs from September
2006 to September 2015. The composition of Bank teams was sounds and included
relevant technical experts in key areas including: TVET, FM, procurement, construction,
M&E and environmental and social safeguards. The total project disbursements were
approximately US$73.358 million or over 100 percent of the total net credit and grant
amounts of US$73.254 million.14

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

45.    Original Design, Implementation and Utilization. Progress towards the
achievement of the PDO was to be monitored using a Monitoring and Evaluation Plan
(MEP). Given the importance of active learning while piloting the realignment to a demand
oriented training paradigm, the MEP was designed as a tool to manage, monitor, track and
document progress towards achievement of envisioned outputs and outcomes under the


13
   96 percent of the contract for the rehabilitation and expansion of the IAC had been executed by project
closing. The IAC is fully operational. The remaining works were related to the building of a new water
reservoir to cater for the expansion of the institute and this portion of the work was completed in March 2016.
14
   According to the World Bank’s Client Connection (March 2016), total project disbursements (including
TF-56866, IDA-41560, and IDA-49630), was US$ 73, 358,257.13. Annex 10 provides detailed information
on all sources of financing under the project, exchange rate gains/losses by project period, and total
disbursements by project period (pre- versus post AF/Restructuring).


                                                     16
project. As such, this MEP was broader in scope than a traditional M&E framework in at
least two ways. First, it emphasized not just performance M&E, but also management of
processes and outcomes. Second, the MEP took an operational approach to performance
management by providing a series of reference data sheets and tools to plan for and
implement a comprehensive system of performance management throughout project
implementation.

46.     The MEP consisted of the set of performance indicators to be used to manage
processes and track progress under the project. Detailed reference sheets created for each
indicator provided information on the indicator’s precise definition, the plan for data
collection and the plan for data submission to the ES.

47.     In addition, four larger scale performance evaluation studies were included in the
MEP. The first was a series of tracer studies aimed at assessing the impact of the project
over the medium- to long-term. The other three would evaluate: (i) the effectiveness of
FUNDEC; (ii) progress in terms of gender integration; and (iii) progress in terms of
incorporating the HIV/AIDS prevention policy and mainstreaming its content. Gender and
HIV/AIDS competences were part of the Skills for Life sections present in all qualifications.
Gender and HIV/AIDS experts were part of the standards panel that developed the Skills
for Life component which was incorporated in the curriculum. The MEP also described the
overall performance management process, the responsibilities of various players (ES M&E
specialists, project beneficiaries, etc.) in the process and provided a master schedule that
the ES M&E team could use to manage its activities. It also linked the data collection
schedule to key annual events.

48.    Initially, the ES used data gathered from preliminary reports provided by schools
in 2006 which did not have the level of accuracy or detailed level of disaggregation needed
to analyze gender, type of institutions and course programs. New baseline data were,
therefore, collected with the information necessary to undertaken an analysis of institutions
and graduates. A report on these findings was drafted in late 2007. These study findings
led COREP and the task team to strengthen the overall M&E data collection and reporting
system.

49.     By 2008, the baseline study had been completed, indicators revised appropriately
and appropriate targets (based on new data) set. However, during the MTR it was agreed
that additional revisions were necessary to the RF. By the end of 2009 the new PDO and
intermediate outcome indicators were in use though these had not been formally modified
through a project restructuring. These indicators were revised again and formally approved
during the 2011 AF/Restructuring. Progress towards the achievement of the PDO during
the post AF/Restructuring period is examined on the basis of the formally revised and
approved end-of-project targets agreed upon during the 2011 AF/Restructuring.

50.    The monitoring of project indicators was the responsibility of the ES-COREP’s
M&E specialists. In April 2007, it became clear that the Management Information System
(MIS) in the schools was not yet fully functional. In order to strengthen the M&E system,
ES-COREP hired an M&E information specialist to identify the bottlenecks and to ensure



                                             17
effective use of the MIS in the schools. The ES-COREP was proactive in drafting terms of
reference (TORs) for graduate tracer studies and management M&E worksheets to be filled
out by school and institute managers to help identify and resolve issues on delivering
priority and appropriate training. A gender audit study led by ES-COREP and funded by
the Spanish Cooperation Agency was also carried out in all the TVET institutions. The
audit was to study and make recommendations on the inclusion of gender issues in the
curriculum, and to inform on gender issues to be tackled during the design of the
qualifications.

51.     Revised Design. As mentioned previously, under the 2011 AF/Restructuring, the
PDO was narrowed and important changes were introduced to the RF and wider M&E
framework for the project. A market improvement in the M&E system was observed during
the post AF/Restructuring period. Specifically: (i) M&E data collection instruments were
fine-tuned and widely shared with relevant stakeholders and beneficiaries; (ii) M&E
reporting across each of the project’s components became well-integrated, allowing for a
more accurate assessment of the operation’s performance; and (iii) two in-depth
assessments of the FUNDEC competitive funding mechanism were undertaken and two
tracer studies were carried out. These systematic and comprehensive studies provided
evidence of the large number of achievements observed under the project and underscored
the operation’s positive impact on transforming the TVET sector in Mozambique.

52.     Implementation and Utilization. ES-COREP M&E team regularly provided Bank
missions with data and information that allowed teams to assess progress towards the
achievement of the PDO and the project’s overall implementation progress. This
information was consistently reported on by the Bank in aide-memoires and ISRs. As
indicated above, the data initially provided were inconsistent due to a weak MIS data-
gathering system. However, after the 2011 AF, M&E became more integrated and the
M&E team was strengthened and made responsible for collecting information on existing
partnerships between the private sectors and individual training institutions as part of their
monitoring exercise. Although there were some initial delays in hiring the firm to
undertaken the tracer studies, ultimately two tracer studies were carried in 2014 and 2015.
As indicated above, the two tracer studies and two in-depth assessments of the FUNDEC
funding scheme were undertaken and informed the writing of this ICR. The Government
of Mozambique has also widely disseminated the key findings from these assessments.
Based on the information described above, the overall rating for M&E design,
implementation and utilization is Substantial.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

53.     Procurement. Procurement was rated Moderately Satisfactory during the period
from 2012 to 2014 and was rated Satisfactory during the period prior to project closing. A
procurement manual was prepared by project effectiveness and flowed throughout the
project implementation. Although some delays in the provision of technical inputs for
project-supported activities were observed in the early stages of the project, these were
fully rectified and addressed. Procurement performance remained strong up through
project closing.



                                             18
54.     Bank supervision missions carried out ex-post procurement reviews and also
confirmed that the project was in conformity with the Bank’s procurement rules and
guidelines. The task team conducted a Post Procurement Review (PPR) during the May
2015 mission and noted some very minor deficiencies in the procurement processes,
including the lack of a delivery schedule in the contracts and corrections of arithmetic
errors not clearly spelled out in the evaluation report. Despite these initial challenges during
the early stages, procurement substantially improved over the life of the operation and
remained strong through the remainder of the project life. The team provided strong
support and proactively addressed and rectified any minor challenges encountered. For
this reason, procurement is rated Satisfactory over the life of the project.

55.     Financial Management. FM under the project is rated Satisfactory. Budget
expenditure rate of the original credit is at 107 percent, as the project gained US$2 million
from the exchange rate between the SDR and USD. For the AF credit, due to exchange rate
loses of approximately US$2 million between the SDR and USD, approximately US$ 35
million of net credit of US$ 37 million was disbursed. Annual audit reports were received
on time, revealed no irregularities, and were unqualified. Interim unaudited financial
reports were also submitted in a timely manner and in accordance with Bank procedures.
In instances in which minor issues were identified, corrective actions were taken by the
Bank and the government. The FM staff had relevant and adequate experience to carry out
their fiduciary responsibilities. An internal auditor performed independent and objective
internal audit activities including inspections and verification of the use of funds at the sub-
project level. The project audit accounts for FY2015 will start on mid-March 2016, by the
selected firm Ernest & Young, the final audit report will be submitted to the World Bank
before the deadline of June 30, 2016.

56.     The project remains adequately staffed, including an internal auditor, which
amongst others follows up on implementation of recommended actions by external auditors,
provides recommendations on activities of sub-projects and performs field trips as
necessary to the respective sub-projects to follow up on their reports. The final Bank
mission prior to project closing reviewed the FM arrangements in place with a particular
focus on project closing arrangements and concluded that the FM arrangements were
Satisfactory. However, the following issues were identified: (i) risk of works in IAC not
being completed by the project closing date; and (ii) unavailability of funds to cover
commitments under the project, mainly due to fluctuations between the SDR and the US
dollars. As noted above, all project-supported activities (with the exception of the IAC)
were completed by the end of the project. In addition, the Bank has agreed that up to
approximately US$2 million equivalent from the current Higher Education Science and
Technology (HEST) project AF will be allocated for sustaining the work of ANEP.

57.     Safeguards. Environmental safeguards were rated Satisfactory. The project was
rated a category “B”, triggering both the: (i) Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and
(ii) Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12), and therefore both an (i) Environmental and
Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a (ii) Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF)
were prepared and disclosed in Mozambique. Project-specific Environmental and Social



                                              19
Impact Assessments (ESIAs) were undertaken for all the construction/civil works
subcomponents. Environmental approval was issued by the relevant environmental unit in
Government. Additionally, twenty four (24) school level officials for 12 schools were
trained in environmental and social aspects of the project (e.g. in the use of environmental
and social screening processes, use of checklists, project impact and their mitigation
measures). All schools where construction or renovation took place were provided with
guidelines to cover environmental and social safeguards. While safeguard compliance was
sound during the implementation of the project, during its final year, these activities were
further concretized with ES-COREP formally agreeing to communicate to institutions and
support them in developing integrated waste management plans for the workshops and
laboratories to manage hazardous waste and minimize any negative social and
environmental impact (that were to arise as part of normal practices of the training centers)
and to ensure students’ environmental awareness. Additionally, ES-COREP agreed that the
construction of the building for the ANEP, financed by the Government Fundo de Apoio
ao Sector de Educação/Education Sector Support Pool Fund (FASE)15 other than by project
funds would still follow the safeguards procedures established for the project. In instances
where safeguards were triggered – including compensation for the use of land to be paid to
a number of families - the RFP guided the compensation levels and the Bank team asked
for and received a report on how these cases were handled.

58.     Under the June 2011 AF/restructuring, the environmental and social management
aspects were reviewed again and it was determined that the existing ESMF and RPF did
not have to be modified. The Bank team was required to prepare Environmental and Social
Management Plans (ESMPs) for all civil works during the AF period. In April 2012, with
an increase in the construction activity, a Bank social and environmental safeguards staff
person participated in field missions and provided detailed reports on safeguards and social
issues. During the final three (3) years of the project, the ES-COREP also made
commendable efforts in the area of environmental and social assessment by assigning a
focal point for the project within the ES.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

59.     The recently approved AF for the HEST project will allow for consolidation of
achievements made under this project, in particular, those related to curriculum reform with
private sector involvement, the development of partnerships with the private sector, and
improvements in learning conditions. Approximately US$2 million of HEST funds will be
allocated for these activities. Further, the HEST AF will also support the implementation
of decentralized institutional management, quality and accreditation which are key
elements in the future set up of TVET governance. Though an increase in the supply of
qualified teachers was observed under the project, continued efforts on the part of the
Government are necessary to ensure that the supply of qualified teachers is adequate to
meet demand within the TVET sub-sector. The Government has declared its intention to


15
   Education Sector Support Pool Fund (FASE) (Fundo de Apoio ao Sector de Educação). FASE is a pool
financing mechanism managed by the Ministry of Education which is governed by a Memorandum of
Understanding.


                                                20
provide an adequate level of resources to recruit and retain qualified teachers. In November
2015, the National TVET Law and regulations were reviewed by the Council of Ministers
and by the special commission of the National Assembly and the documents were cleared
by the National Assembly on November 18, 2016. The legislative package for the
governance and financing of TVET was approved on February 18, 2016. 16 The full
enactment of the recently approved National TVET Law and the establishment and
financing of the National Training Fund 17 will also be essential elements of the
Government’s continued support to the sub-sector.

60.     The reforms to TVET facilitated by the project are supported by the Government
and continue to have the support of various agencies (GIZ, Italy, Norway, Canada, DfID,
Korea, World Bank among others). This convergence of support across agencies has
contributed to the revitalization of the TVET system. This support is expected to continue
to contribute to the consolidation of the current results and, therefore, contribute to the
sustainability of the approaches and activities initiated by the project to support the
Government strategy to reform the TVET system. Strengthening the involvement of the
private sector in the roll out of the reform process and in the National Training Fund has
been identified by the Ministry of Education as a priority. Recent analytical work18 within
the Mozambican context provides strong evidence of the positive relationship between
educational attainment and earnings. The economic justification for investing in TVET
remains strong and the Government is committed to increasing the level of resources for
TVET institutions but also to promoting and further strengthening partnerships with the
private sector.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

61.     Relevance of Original and Revised Objectives. The original objectives were
Highly Relevant to the country’s sector needs at the time of project preparation. The
project’s objectives were also strongly aligned with the Government’s strategic agenda for
the sub-sector as outlined in a number of key documents including the Ministry of Labor
(Ministério do Trabalho – MINTRAB) Employment and Vocational Training Strategy
(2004-2010), the Education Sector Strategic Program (2005-2009) and the LDP (2005).
The PDO was also anchored in the government’s PARP which emphasized the importance
of providing good quality and relevant training to TVET graduates as a means to increase


16
   The legislative package for TVET was approved in principle on February 18, 2016. The National Assembly
of Mozambique officially approved this legislative package on March 16, 2016. The new legislation for
TVET takes fully effect starting in April of 2016.
17
   The NTF was organized by the Government and the private sector agreed to put forth resources to cover
some of the technical training. Specifically, the private sector and the government agreed to a funding
formula in which private sector enterprises would earmark up to 1 percent of their personnel budget for this
activity.

national growth and productivity while reducing poverty. The original project objectives
were also consistent with the CAS which underscored the importance of reforming and
expanding the TVET sub-sector in order to equip a larger number of graduates with market-
relevant skills. The revised objectives, which were introduced under the June 2011
AF/restructuring, were also highly relevant to, and consistent with, the Government’s
agenda for the TVET sector as outlined in the PIREP’s strategic documents. The objectives
remain Highly Relevant.

62.     Relevance of Original and Revised Design. The relevance of the original design
is judged to have been Modest. As indicated previously, the original design was strongly
aligned with the Government’s TVET strategies and programs, was informed by lessons
learned from other operations in the sector, and was guided by analytical work performed
by the Bank and the Government. The design also laid the foundation for a paradigm shift
in the TVET sub-sector as it supported: (i) the legislative reorganization of the TVET sub-
sector; (ii) the development of an occupational standards system; (iii) improvements in the
quality of training within a select number of institutes; and (iv) the provision of competitive
grants to increase access to employment-oriented TVET programs. Moreover, the project’s
results chain was clear as the activities and objectives supported across each of the project’s
components were logically linked to the overall objectives. However, the original design
was ambitious for a five year SIL and did not fully take into consideration the time required
to create the new demand-driven system, develop curricula, train appropriate numbers of
trainers in the new curricula, and to upgrade institutions to accommodate the training
requirements. There were also challenges associated with the original cost estimates due to
the high inflation of construction materials associated with the World Cup games which
impacted many projects throughout the region. Notwithstanding some of the strong
features of the original design, given the challenges noted above, the relevance of the
original design is rated Modest.

63.     However, it is important to highlight that there was strong recognition on the part
of the Government and the Bank that the original design included the needed elements to
ensure that the paradigm shift in the TVET sector could be successfully achieved. It was
within this context that the Government requested AF from the Bank in 2011. The Bank
team was proactive in taking the opportunity of the AF request to restructure the project as
suggested by the QALP-2 and MTR and revised the design to reflect the strategic
narrowing of the PDO. The Bank and the government also introduced revisions to key
indicators and made small modifications to the components. These important adjustments
introduced at the time of the AF/Restructuring are judged to be highly appropriate and
therefore, the rating for the revised project design is High.

64.     Relevance of Original and Revised Implementation. The relevance of project
implementation before the AF was Modest. As indicated above, the early stages of
implementation were impacted by the need to properly phase the implementation of the
project components related to policy reforms, curricula development, teacher training,
construction of schools, and procurement of equipment and consultant services. During the
early stages of implementation, the Bank and Government teams worked to implement the
needed activities and ensure proper alignment. However, after the 2009 MTR, it became



                                              22
evident that more time and financial resources would be required to ensure the achievement
of the development objectives and affect the sub-sector paradigm change. This recognition
led to the Government’s request for additional funding and the associated restructuring.
Implementation after the AF improved substantially. By this time, there was: (i) increased
capacity related to procurement and M&E; (ii) an increase in the pace of development of
competency based curricula; (iii) training of teachers and managers; (iv) improvements in
overall M&E with increased integration of data and improved collection; (v) increased pace
of construction and procurement of equipment; and (iv) the enrollment of students in
classes. As indicated, by project closing, all project activities had been completed; the
National TVET Law and regulations was reviewed by the Council of Ministers in the fall
of 2015. Minor changes were introduced and the overall legislative package for the
governance and financing of TVET (including the NTF) was approved by the National
Assembly on February 18, 2016. Government budgetary commitments have been reflected
in the 2016 budget, private sector involvement continues to take place in the development
of qualifications, agreement on their participation in the Fund has been secured, the
MITESS has moved forward with the establishment of the Labor Market Observatory, and
the standards-based assessment and certification system was developed. These are all
considerable implementation achievements and as such, implementation for the post-
AF/restructuring period is rated High.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

65.     For the purposes of this evaluation, and in compliance with the established
Operational Policy and Country Services (OPCS) guidelines, this section assesses project
performance in relation to the periods before and after the 2011 AF and restructuring.19 The
evaluation of the project’s performance is assessed in relation to the stated objectives in
the original PDO for the pre-restructuring period and in relation to the revised PDO for the
post-restructuring period.

66.     Pre-restructuring Period. The original PDO was “to facilitate the transition of the
existing TVET system to a demand-led training system and provide beneficiaries with
more market relevant skills and improved economic opportunities.” The following
provides an assessment of the project’s efficacy in the pre-restructuring period by sub-
objective. As indicated, there were four (4) PDO level indicators selected to measure
achievement toward the original PDO. Again, and as previously mentioned, there were
difficulties in collecting PDO related data on graduates’ skills, employers’ satisfaction with
graduates’ skills, and the access of graduates to economic opportunities efficacy because
the needed surveys and system for collecting this data were delayed. Based on this, efficacy
during the pre-restructuring period is rated Modest. However, it should be noted, that there
was important progress in project outputs during this period that laid the foundation for the
ultimate achievement of the project goals. These are as follows:



19
   The second restructuring simply extended the project closing date. Therefore, for the purposes of the ICR
evaluation there are two periods of evaluation: pre-additional financing (2006-6/2011 and post additional
financing (7/2011-9/2015).


                                                    23
67.     Transition to a demand-driven TVET system. The transition to a demand-driven
system was to entail achievement of the following: (i) the development of an institutional
and regulatory framework for the TVET system; (ii) development of a standards-based
qualification system and establishment of an accompanying training system; (iii) upgrading
and improvements to the quality of the TVET institutions; and (iv) the establishment and
provision of competitive grant funding mechanism to promote innovation and increase
productivity. Each of these sub-objectives was considered critical in ensuring the
development of a sustainable TVET system which was responsive to labor market demand
in Mozambique.

   Development of an institutional and regulatory framework for the TVET system.
    Prior to the AF, progress had been made with the development of an institutional
    framework. The Government, in close collaboration with industry representatives, had
    drafted the TVET regulatory framework for reforming the system; an institutional
    management capacity study had been undertaken which informed the creation of a
    capacity-building plan used to develop a training program for managers and teachers
    at targeted institutions; a quality management system (QMS) and related
    implementation manuals had been developed; a management information system
    (MIS) was established; country-wide consultations were carried out resulting in
    agreement on alternative models for governance, management and financing of the
    TVET system; and strategic studies were undertaken to inform the process for the
    creation of the National Training Authority. As noted above, the National Assembly
    reviewed the overall legislative package for the governance and financing of TVET and
    approval took place on February 18, 2016.

   Development of a standards-based qualification system and establishment of an
    accompanying training system. A National Vocational Qualifications Framework
    (which was approved by COREP) was developed. In addition, new qualifications
    continued to be developed with representation from the private sector, civil society and
    the Government. The policies, strategies, guides and manuals that supported the
    qualification system were also developed and finalized. Moreover, new curricula were
    developed in four (4) areas (industrial maintenance; hospitality and tourism; agriculture
    and agro-business; and administration and management) and were piloted in five (5)
    schools; the regulatory framework was institutionalized; and capacity-building in
    curriculum development was provided.

   Quality improvements in training institutions. During this period, the project began
    in-service training for teachers and management training for school managers and
    administrative staff. In addition, training had begun with a 3-year full-time courses in
    a number of areas (hospitality and tourism, accounting and management) and 4.5-year
    distance training courses in agriculture, industrial maintenance and administration and
    management were held in collaboration with the Instituto Superior Dom Bosco with
    the first group of 25 students per sector completing the course.

   Establishment and provision of a competitive grant funding mechanism to
    promote innovation and increase productivity. In terms of progress made with


                                             24
    regards to the provision of small grants through the Skills Development Fund, the
    following was achieved: grants were provided to 189 sub-projects – benefitting
    approximately 30,000 individuals nationwide (38 percent of whom were women); and
    an in-depth independent evaluation of the Skills Development Plan was completed and
    results were disseminated in January 2011. This evaluation provided evidence that this
    seed money contributed to the livelihood of individuals and communities; created the
    conditions for the development of new competencies; disseminated new technology
    and, in turn, created opportunities for income generation. The evaluation also provides
    a series of concrete recommendations to further strengthen this competitive and
    demand-driven funding mechanism.

   Provide beneficiaries with relevant skills and improved economic opportunities.
    This part of the original PDO was to be measured by the indicator that was to gather
    data on labor market earnings of graduates of targeted programs with the use of tracer
    studies. As described above, this part of the PDO and the PDO indicator were dropped
    because the needed tracer studies to collect this information were delayed and data to
    support this was difficult to collect in the context of Mozambique at the time. However,
    the tracer studies which were carried out in 2014 and 2015 provided some information
    pertaining to the achievement of these objectives and these have been incorporated in
    the analyses presented in Annexes 2 and 3.

68.    Post-restructuring Period. The revised PDO was “to improve the quality and
relevance of technical and vocational training in Mozambique, with a focus on selected
TVET institutions and programs”.

69.     Improved quality was to be measured by: (i) percentage employer’s/private sector
representatives reporting satisfaction with quality of new competency based training; (ii)
number of competency standards endorsed by STACs and qualification approved by
COREP; and (iii) number of learners assessed through competency based training regime.
The targets were exceed for all three indicators: (i) employer satisfaction with new
competency based curriculum was 80 percent, exceeding the target of 60 percent; (ii)
competency standards endorsed by STAC and approved by COREP increased from 20 in
2010 to 67 in 2015 far exceeding the target of 28; and (iii) learners assessed through the
competency based training increased from 500 in 2010 to 11,413 in 2015 again, far
exceeding the target of 1,300. These are significant achievements. Improved relevance was
to be measured by the percent of graduates of targeted programs that find jobs or create
jobs that are directly related to the field of study within six months. The percent of
graduates finding jobs in their field of study increased from 27.2 percent in 2010 to 57
percent in 2015 slightly missing the target of 60 percent. Although the target was missed
by 3 percentage points this is a significant improvement considering that it is reported that
students normally take four (4) months off after completing the programs before attempting
to find jobs.

70.    The post restructuring period not only showed high achievement of the PDO but
was also marked by High achievement related to the transition to a demand-driven TVET
system. This can be seen by the following:



                                             25
   Development of an institutional framework continued with substantial achievements
    as follows: (i) completion and approval of a new regulatory framework for governance
    and financing of the TVET sub-sector by the National Assembly in 2014 calling for the
    creation of a national regulatory body (ANEP) and the creation of a National Training
    Fund which would be supported by contributions from the private sector through the
    introduction of a payroll levy system paid by employers; (ii) completion of a framework
    supporting the autonomy of TVET institutions and the establishment of school
    governing bodies with representation of stakeholders; (iii) ES-COREP and COREP
    Board became fully functional; (iv) development of strategic plans for all pilot training
    institutions; (v) retention of some generated income for school improvements in 9 out
    of 11 (approximately 82 percent) of the training institutions; (vi) participation in
    regularly in tracer studies in all pilot institutions and 50 percent of non-pilot
    institutions; (vii) submission of enrollment and pass rates electronically through TVET
    MIS in all 11 training institutions; and (viii) production of one (1) annual report and
    two (2) biannual bulletins from the labor market information system (for each sector).

   Development of standards-based qualification and training system made notable
    progress. A total of 67 programs were developed and validated based on the established
    set of competency-based standards. This was a significant achievement under the
    project as it constituted a critical element of the Government’s effort to create a
    demand-driven system which was responsive to the needs of the labor market. Progress
    in these two areas was critical for ensuring the soundness and sustainability of changes
    necessary for ensuring a system able to provide quality and relevant training to
    beneficiaries.

   Quality improvements targeted towards training institutions showed that: (i) 50
    percent of students were provided with internships exceeding the target of 30 percent;
    (ii) the pass rate of students enrolled in targeted courses was 84 percent (85 percent
    female) exceeding the target of 65 percent (65 percent female); 2,027 teachers (233
    female) in target sectors received training under the new CBT system exceeding the
    target of 450 teachers (68 female); 25 TVET institutions were aligned to the CBT
    system exceeding the target of 16; 162 school managers (directors and deputies) had
    received training on quality school management exceed the target of 60; all CBT
    programs had been designed with private sector participation in qualification exams; 9
    institutions were fully rehabilitated and equipped (with classrooms, laboratories and
    workshops).

71.    Also critical to ensuring the quality and relevance of TVET programs was the
continued roll out and strengthening of the competitive funding program (FUNDEC). This
competitive funding mechanism supported innovative initiatives targeted at improving the
relevance and quality of TVET training and increased access to employment-oriented
TVET programs among underserved groups. Over the life of the project, seven (7) calls for
proposals were launched and a total of 405 applications were received. Of these, 189
(approximately 46 percent) were approved, reflecting the highly competitive nature of this
demand-driven skills development fund. The FUNDEC, which supported a variety of sub-


                                             26
projects supported within the strategic sectors targeted by the project, benefitted
approximately 126 TVET institutions across the country. Approximately 68 percent of
those grants awarded (128 of the 189) were also provided with financial contributions from
the beneficiary institution. This support from the institutions themselves was highly useful
as they provided additional resources to scale-up activities which were being supported
under these sub-projects and also increased the sustainability of these interventions in the
medium to long term. In addition, 25 partnerships had been formed between training
providers or promoters and private sector institutions by project closing.

3.3 Efficiency

72.     Analysis undertaken at the time of appraisal revealed that returns to TVET were
high in Mozambique. An updated analysis on returns to education provides strong evidence
that the returns to TVET education remain high within the Mozambican context. This
positive trend also provides a strong economic justification for the Bank’s support to the
TVET sector through this project. A tracer study undertaken in 2014 found that TVET
graduates earned higher income and wages, on average, than graduates of general
secondary education. Data gathered from this and a tracer study undertaken in 2015 provide
further evidence that earnings among CBT graduates (those who benefitted from the
program) were higher than those of non-CBT graduates (individuals who did not benefit
from the program). Moreover, results from recent analytical work undertaken by Cho and
Feda (2015) found that, among salaried workers in Mozambique, an additional year of
education is associated with an increase of 12.4 percent, on average, in monthly earnings.
Moreover, the incremental increase in income associated with completing TVET (relative
to completing upper secondary education) was 10.4 percent. Research by Simione (2014)
corroborates these findings and reveals that an additional year of schooling leads to an
increase in wages by approximately 16.2 percent, on average.

73.     The original project costing underestimated the financial resources necessary for
school rehabilitation and provision of equipment planned under the civil works component
of the operation (Component C). At appraisal, the total estimated cost for Sub-Components
C.2 and C.320 – which supported civil works activities as well as the provision of furniture,


20
     Component C consisted of 5 Sub-components.

equipment and tools – was forecasted to be US$17,068,103. During project preparation,
the Bank team carried out its due diligence and provided estimates using standard Bank
forecasting methods. However, due to the complexity of costing the rehabilitation of entire
institutions, coupled with the rising inflationary pressures, existing project funds were
insufficient to cover the actual cost of rehabilitating and equipping the targeted TVET
institutions. In order to fill this financing gap, additional funds were allocated so that this
component could be successfully completed. As showing in Table 2 above, by project
closing a total of US$40,299,212 had been spent, representing an increase of
US$23,231,109 million from the appraised estimates. Despite these significant cost
overruns, the majority of civil works activities were successfully completed by the project’s
closing date. These investments were instrumental in improving the quality and relevance
of training programs provided within the project-supported TVET institutions.

Execution Rate of FUNDEC Grants/Sub-Projects

74.     The FUNDEC grants were in high demand and the selection process was quite
competitive. A total of 405 grant proposals were received by the FUNDEC review
committee of which 189 (46 percent) were approved. As shown in Table 3 below, across
the seven FUNDEC funding cycles, the execution rate for these grants was very high –
with almost three-fourths (73 percent) of the allocated grants being fully executed. In small
instances where anomalies were revealed or bookkeeping did not fully adhere to standards,
the grants for these sub-projects were either interrupted or cancelled in order to prevent
any financial loss. Of the grants which were fully executed, financial audit and M&E
reports produced under the project showed that FUNDEC resources were used efficiently,
judiciously and for their intended purposes. The evidence highlighted that the use of grant
funding conformed to the prescribed expenditure categories as laid out in the grant
proposals which had been approved by the FUNDEC review committee. This efficient use
of resources was, in large part, a result of the Government’s concerted effort to establish
strong fiduciary controls and to provide strong M&E oversight at the approval stage and
throughout the implementation process. The FUNDEC also efficiently leveraged funding
from beneficiaries in the form of matching grants - with a total 128 provided to sub-projects
supported under the FUNDEC.

                            Table 3: Efficient use of FUNDEC financial resources

75.     Despite progress observed during the pre-restructuring period, the initial
implementation delays in enacting institutional reforms, recruiting a technical firm to assist
in the development of operational standards, and delays in the procurement of civil works
activities resulted in a modest rate of implementation efficiency. Moreover, the delays
which were observed during the pre-restructuring period also made it difficult to
systematically and comprehensively assess efficiency gains related to labor market


                                                                  28
insertion of graduates, employers’ satisfaction with beneficiaries’ market-relevant skills,
and improved labor market outcomes of beneficiaries who received support under this
project. As described above, as a result of external inflationary shocks and the difficulty of
costing the rehabilitation of TVET institutions, the cost of civil work activities during the
early years of the project was also greater than the estimated costs at appraisal. However,
the efficiency of the project’s implementation improved significantly during the post-
restructuring period. Under the 2011 restructuring/AF, the activities, indicators and targets
were appropriately calibrated to reflect available funding, implementation capacity and
available timeframe. Although the cost of civil works activities remained higher than the
initial forecasted amounts, the vast majority of the project’s outputs and outcomes were
achieved or exceeded by the project closing date. This was accomplished even in light of
the exchange rate losses observed during the latter years of the project. The coordination
unit established ensured activities were harmonized and that there was no duplication of
efforts particularly as it pertained to occupational standards and modularized training
materials.

76.     While significant internal and efficiency gains were observed over the life of the
project, given the significant delays and cost overruns related to civil works activities, the
overall efficiency under the project is rated Modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

77.     The relevance of the PDO was High given its strong alignment with the
Government’s own strategic agenda and Bank strategy for the country. The relevance of
the original design is rated Modest. The overall relevance of the project (combining the
sub-ratings for objectives and design) during the pre-AF/restructuring period is, therefore,
Substantial. As indicated, it is recognized that there were design challenges regarding the
ambitious nature of the project for a five year SIL and financing issues associated with the
cost of construction materials. However, the overarching design features related to
affecting the paradigm shift were central to the project from the beginning. The challenges
associated with the original design did lead to implementation delays, particularly in the
early years of the project life and, as a result, implementation and efficacy for this period
are rated Modest. However, during the post-restructuring period, the pace of
implementation significantly improved, in part as a result of the AF, which provided
sufficient financial resources to support a number of activities essential to achievement of
the PDO. Further, during this period, overall Government and implementing agency
performance significantly improved and, as such, the relevance of implementation in the
post-restructuring period is rated High due to the large number of outputs and outcomes
were achieved during this latter period.

78.     In terms of efficacy during the pre-restructuring period, project activities laid the
foundation for long-term reforms within the larger TVET system in the country, including
the development and adoption of an institutional regulatory framework and competency-
based occupational standards in sectors critical to economic growth. However, given the
complexity of data collection and delays in implementation, a number of the PDO-level
indicators could not be measured during this period. For this reason, efficacy is rated



                                             29
Modest during the pre-AF period. However, following the AF, with a more focused PDO
and the roll out of activities to a select number of institutions, the development objective
was achieved. Efficacy during the post-restructuring period is, therefore, rated High. The
efficiency for pre-restructuring is rated Modest due to initial implementation delays and
cost overruns which resulted from both endogenous and exogenous factors. In the post-
restructuring period, the project’s efficiency improved, evidenced in internal and external
efficiency gains as well as judicious use of project resources for their intended purposes.
Costs associated with civil activities, however, remained high. Efficiency, therefore, in the
post-restructuring period is rated Modest.

79.     The TVET project is judged to have been Moderately Satisfactory. During the
nine years of project implementation, the Government of Mozambique was able to
fundamentally reform its vocational and technical education system from the previous
supply driven system to a demand driven system. This paradigm shift was achieved with
new legislation to provide the new TVET legal framework, a new skills training financing
mechanism supported by the private sector, and a completely new set of Competency
Based Training modules. All of this was achieved with substantial involvement by the
private sector which guided the development of the training programs to more closely
respond to market demands. Tracer studies find that graduates from the training programs
are able to find employment matching their training skills and employers, which now
support the new TVET program, find that the skills they need are increasingly available.
By project closing, the intended transition from a supply-driven system to one which was
demand-driven and highly relevant to the country’s economic needs had occurred. Based
on the pre- and post-AF/restructuring rating for relevance of objectives/design, efficacy,
and efficiency—and weighted by proportion of the net credit disbursed within each
period—the overall outcome rating for the project is Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

80.      Institutional change and strengthening occurred at both the national and
institutional levels. Most importantly, the national reforms which introduced the new
paradigm of demand-driven TVET in Mozambique were strongly supported by this project.
The development of competency-based curricula was also strongly reinforced. The
adoption in 2014 of a new regulatory framework for governance and financing of the TVET
sub-sector, approved by the National Assembly, calling for the creation of both the ANEP
and a National Training Fund. Each of these newly established entities has been
instrumental in strengthening the capacity of the Government to manage a TVET system
that can remain responsive to labor market needs. The portion of the Government budget
focused on the TVET subsector increased by 178 percent over the period from 2009 to
2015 21 . Further, with the development of a standards-based qualification and training
system, the staff of institutions and schools (including principals and managers) received
training in quality school management. Further, a number of institutions have been
strengthened as a result of the strong relationship that has developed between the
institutions themselves and private sector representatives.

81.     The private sector, through their professional and industrial organizations, has had
a substantial role in setting the qualifications of the new CBT courses, and has been
increasing its role in the management of the new TVET institutions. The private sector has
also been able to have an impact on the teacher training programs which has been critical
in developing and effectively rolling out the CBT courses. This increased role of the private
sector in the TVET sub-sector demonstrated behavioral changes on the part of
Mozambique’s industrial and professional organizations in the defining of occupational
standards, the contents of training courses, and the financing of these skill development
programs. Under the project, the EMIS was also strengthened through a pilot program
which is expected to be expanded throughout the country to ensure the provision of
accurate data necessary to analyze relevant trends and to develop policy and to make
decisions related to the sector. Finally, the TA provided under the project, was instrumental
in identifying those sectors of the economy which were strategically important for
economic growth and development in Mozambique.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

82.      The risk to development outcome following the end of the project is rated
Moderate. The development of the TVET regulatory framework played an important role
in transforming the sector from one which was largely supply driven to one that is both
demand-driven and responsive to evolving private sector needs. In tandem with support to
the reform agenda, the project supported capacity-building activities to better ensure that
each relevant entity had sufficient capacity to implement key reforms and to ensure that
the TVET sector overall was adequately equipped to remain demand-driven and responsive
to economic needs. It also supported, as needed, entities that were essential to
implementing these reforms in the short- and long-term including the ES-COREP as well
as the ANEP and the National Training Fund. Moreover, it has institutionalized a number
of features which can ensure flexibility and responsiveness of the TVET system to labor
market demands. These include a Labor Market Observatory, better equipped TVET
institutions, participation of private sector in identifying sector needs and qualification
standards, and a well-functioning MIS, etc. One of the key objectives of the recently
approved HEST AF is to further strengthen the institutional framework for TVET.
Specifically, the HEST AF will continue to support a number of activities launched by the
project including those related to curriculum reform with private sector involvement, the
development of partnerships with the private sector, and improvements in learning
conditions. It will provide direct technical and financial support to ANEP. In addition,
HEST will support the implementation of the Government’s overall reform agenda within
the higher education sub-sector which includes – but is not restricted to – TVET.

83.     Financial commitment to the sector has been strong to date and this trend is
expected to continue in the future (see Annex 3 for additional details). A number of DPs
including GIZ, DANIDA, the Spanish Cooperation and Italian Cooperation, have indicated
their commitment to continue to provide financial backing to specific initiatives of the
sector moving forward. The Government has also increased its allocation to the sector, and
within its sector budget, to TVET. More importantly, the private sector, as noted earlier,
has taken a substantially enhanced role in the structure, content and financing of the TVET
training program, a commitment which has grown over the period of project
implementation. In mid-March of 2016, the Government met with representatives of the
private sector who viscid strong support of the reforms which had taken place in the TVET
sub-sector and committed themselves to continued involvement in the development of new
and continuing training course materials and financing the skills development programs.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

84.     The project design was closely aligned with the Government’s PARP II, the 2005
LSP, the PRSP, and the CAS FY04-FY07. The design was also informed by the
Mozambique Public Expenditure Review Phase 2: Sectoral Expenditures 22 which
highlighted the need to focus increased attention on skills development of the workforce in
order to accelerate the country’s economic growth and development. The preparation team
used the results of strong analytical work to design the project so that the operation would
affect a paradigm change in the TVET system with its far-reaching and comprehensive
approach to the reform process. The PDO which focused on modifying the TVET system,
as well as to ensure the provision of quality and relevant training to students was, therefore,
sound and strongly linked to the Government’s own TVET reform program. The design
also took into consideration the recommendations from peer reviewers and lessons learned
from other Bank-supported projects in Mozambique and other relevant contexts. The team
identified the risks and incorporated design features to mitigate them. However, mid-way
into implementation the Bank team realized, in retrospect, that there were both endogenous
and exogenous factors that were impacting implementation that had not been fully
accounted for in the original design’s mitigation measures. These were: (i) the needed
policy decisions/changes to affect a paradigm shift, that depended on government action
beyond the influence of the project, were going to take longer than the original five year
implementation period; (ii) the time required to build capacity and acquire the needed
technical assistance to develop new curricula would take longer than anticipated due to the
limited pool of qualified firms; and (iii) increased inflation in the region, leading to cost
overruns, was such that the financial resources were originally insufficient to ensure
completion of some activities. At the time of the AF, the Bank team took these challenges
into consideration as well as the QALP-2 recommendations and adjusted the project design
to ensure the original comprehensive goal of reforming the TVET sub-sector could be
achieved.

85.     While there were challenges associated with the original design, the Bank team
recognized these challenges and addressed them in the post-additional financing design. It
should also be noted that the overarching design features related to affecting a paradigm
shift were always the main focus of the project objectives and design and, as is evidenced,
were achieved. Despite the many positive features of the original design of the project,
based on the information summarized above, the overall rating for Quality at Entry is
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

86.     Throughout the project life, the Bank team worked closely with the Government to
implement the operation. The overall Bank team, some of whom were based in Maputo,
was able to build a strong working relationship with the Government and other DPs active
in Mozambique at the time. When implementation challenges arose, the Bank team
proactively worked with the Government to devise appropriate and timely solutions.
Project supervision benefitted from technical experts in key areas who worked closely with
other entities (e.g., ES-COREP) to build their capacity in key operational areas including
FM and procurement. Continued supervision and engagement of TVET specialists with the
ES-COREP staff facilitated the project’s achievements with regards to curriculum
development and the financing of skills development training.

87.     ISRs and aide-memoires were detailed and provided management with a thorough
assessment of the project’s challenges and achievements. These reports also laid out
specific recommendations to guide implementation of the project and to address challenges
related to FM, procurement and M&E that arose during the course of the project’s
implementation. The supervision teams consistently reported on financial management and
procurement progress during supervision missions and worked with the ES-COREP team
to build their capacity in these areas. Key to the project’s achievements was the consistent
supervision by a series of vocational technical education specialists who provided support
to the ES-COREP team on curriculum development and financing of skills training. The
Bank team played a proactive role in requesting, and then ensuring, funding to support the
project following the 2009 MTR when the financial gaps in the original project were made
clear which allowed initial project gains to be solidified and scaled up during the latter
years of the operation. The Bank team also successfully undertook the 2011
AF/Restructuring. By the project’s closing date, the vast majority of the envisaged outputs
and outcomes had been achieved, if not exceeded.

88.    In light of the above, Bank Performance in Supervision is rated Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89.    Based on the above, the overall Bank performance is Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

90.     The government expressed and demonstrated its high level of commitment to the
achievement of the PDO which was well-aligned with its own strategic agenda for
reforming the TVET sector. The MEC worked closely with the Bank team to design the
project and to determine those elements for which Bank support would be most effective



                                            34
and appropriate. There were, however, initial challenges with the original design including
an ambitious timeline to implement all of the envisaged activities. There were also initial
delays with procurement and challenges associated with the M&E system. Despite these
initial difficulties, the government did proactively work with the Bank to restructure the
project and added financial resources through the 2011 AF in order to ensure the
achievement of the PDO. The government supported and approved legislation which
formally introduced and supported key reforms to the sector as embodied, most
prominently, in the National TVET Law. This law, which established the governance and
financial framework to support the development of a TVET sub-sector characterized by
strong private sector participation and which was responsive to labor market needs, was a
major accomplishment observed under the operation. Further, under the government’s
purview, financial audits were of unqualified opinion. Procurement and M&E performance
did significantly improve following the approval of 2011 AF/restructuring. By the end of
the project the Government had successfully carried out two in-depth evaluations of the
FUNDEC competitive granting mechanism and two tracer studies. These comprehensive
studies provided detailed information on the outputs and outcomes achieved under the
operation.

91.      The Government did encounter some difficulties during the course of
implementation – including the timely provision of counterpart funds however, after the
initial delays, the Government provided substantial resources, particularly in the latter
phases of the project life to ensure reforms were fully developed and rolled out. In addition
to increasing its budgetary allocation to the TVET sector (see Annex 3 for additional
details), it has also provided necessary resources to support the completion of a few
activities which commenced under the project, particularly the rehabilitation of the IAC.
These latter achievements were critical to the project’s successful implementation. The
Government remains committed to the objectives supported under this project and through
the Bank-supported HEST AF continues to scale-up and consolidate many of the activities
which were initiated under this operation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

92.     The ES-COREP was responsible for managing all aspects of implementation.
When faced with implementation challenges, the ES was able to work effectively with the
Bank to resolve them fully and expediently. The ES-COREP, which benefited from
capacity-building support under the operation, took steps to ensure that an adequate project
FM system was in place and remained functional throughout the project life. This system
was able to provide accurate and timely information on the utilization of project funds. All
financial audits were of unqualified opinion. After the early procurement challenges with
construction costs, the project’s procurement performance significantly improved, and
post-procurement reviews revealed that procurement guidelines were adhered to and
procurement files were in proper order. Further, the ES-COREP ensured that graduate
tracer studies were conducted, data were analyzed and that the final report was produced
which detailed key findings. The ES also provided detailed project progress reports and
continuously updated the project’s RF with the up-to-date information. By project closing,



                                             35
in large part due to the Government and implementing agency’s performance, the majority
of the envisaged outputs and outcome targets had either been achieved or exceeded.
Recognizing the initial delays in project implementation, the ES-COREP made
modifications in their own structure to provide good M&E, financial management and
procurement services and judging what was ultimately achieved by their management of
the project, with outcomes at or above targets, the work of the Implementing Agency, ES-
COREP, should be judged as Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.    Based on the above, the rating for overall borrower performance is Moderately
Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

94.     The establishment and design of a robust M&E system with indicators for
which baseline data are readily available is critical in ensuring that the outputs and
outcomes of an operation are properly documented and appropriate targets are set
in light of the project timeline. Though initially there were challenges with the M&E
system’s ability to fully document the outputs and outcomes achieved under the operation,
the restructured M&E system proved to be very sound and robust. The project’s revised
results framework provided the necessary data to measure progress made against each of
the operation’s objectives. The revised M&E system also successfully carried out two in-
depth tracer studies and two evaluations of the competitive grant funding mechanism
(FUNDEC).

95.     Strategic sequencing of activities and realism in terms of the implementation
timeline should be factored into the design of a project which aims to undertake far-
reaching reforms within a given sector. This is critical in ensuring that objectives can be
fully achieved during the project’s implementation period. Although the original objectives
were highly relevant and strongly aligned with the Government’s strategic agenda for the
TVET sector, the project’s initial design was ambitious in light of the 5-year envisaged
implementation period. However, the AF/restructuring approved in 2011 provided the
necessary resources and time to effectively transform the TVET sector in Mozambique
from a supply-driven system to one which was demand-driven and highly relevant to the
country’s development needs and objectives.

96.     Close collaboration with the Government beginning in the preparation phase
can pay high dividends in project achievements, especially in the context of
introducing and implementing large scale reforms. The Bank team worked very
effectively and collaboratively with the Government of Mozambique throughout the life of
this project. This project was strongly linked to the Government’s own reform agenda for
the TVET sector. This strong alignment provided the necessary conditions to transform the
sector, while increasing the likelihood that these important changes would be maintained
and/or scaled-up in the medium and long term.

97.    The active participation of the private sector is instrumental in ensuring that
occupational standards and TVET training programs reflect the needs of the labor
market. Through a collaborative and consultative progress with TVET training providers
and institutions, private sector firms and representatives helped to define and develop the
occupational standards and associated training programs created under this project, thus
ensuring their relevance and link to the strategic needs of the labor market.

98.    The establishment, staffing and resourcing of entities capable of undertaking
new activities associated with sector reforms are important steps in strengthening the
perceived legitimacy of these reforms and promoting their sustainability in the
medium to long term. The TVET project supported the establishment and resourcing of a
number of key institutions including, among others: the National Vocational Qualification
Body, the National Authority for TVET (ANEP), and the Labor Market Observatory (as a
National Directorate within the Ministry of Labor). These entities are now well-placed to
scale-up the activities which were successfully supported under the project, while also
maintaining and consolidating the key reforms which were enacted under this operation.

99.    A competitive and demand-driven funding mechanism can be an important
instrument to effectively promote skills development and training. Through a
competitive selection process, FUNDEC financed a large number of strategic sub-projects
across Mozambique. FUNDEC contributed to the improvement of training facilities and
supported innovative training programs in agriculture, industrial maintenance, mining,
construction, etc. The high quality and relevance of the sub-projects supported under this
grant mechanism also led to the provision of matching grants from beneficiaries which
allowed these initiatives to be scaled-up.

101.     Considering the results presented in the ICR, we conclude that the program to
support the reform of the TVET sector in Mozambique has been very successful, overall,
even though delays took place during the process and even though hiccups occurred on the
way. The involvement of a number of relevant stakeholders, in particular the private sector
and organizations with professionals, in designing competency based curricula in various
fields, has been relevant. The ICR shows that relevance of the training delivered through
TVET institutions has increased, as expressed by the fact that graduates find jobs more
easily and given the fact that employers in general are satisfied with the competencies that
graduates have shown on the job. Inclusion of more practice oriented methodologies in

* Because of budget cuts resulting from the economic crisis, the overall Dutch Trust Fund support for the
TVET project was reduced in September 21, 2010 from USD 7.35 M to USD 6.709 Million (a sum from
which the Bank’s administrative fee was paid). In March 2012 USD 0.32 M was further cancelled resulting
in a total disbursement of the Dutch Trust Fund of USD 6.57 M.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      The Technical and Vocational Education (TVET) Project supported a subset of
activities and expenditures in the implementation of the Government of Mozambique’s
investment program Programa Integrado de Reforma da Eudcacao Professional (PIREP)
through targeting of activities and expenditures that are not covered in the ongoing
programs and/or areas with additional needs where the gaps are clearly identified to support
the essential building blocks of the reform agenda. The components and associated
outcome indicators to support this aim are listed below. The TVET project went through
an additional financing that also restructured some aspects of the project in June 2011. This
annex uses the indicators as listed in the revised restructuring results framework to assess
output achievements.

2.       Component A: Development of an Institutional Framework (US$12.0 million
including the cost of an Executive Secretariat both original and additional financing
totals; Actual Expenditure: US$17.5 million). Component A had a dual function: (i)
through analytical work and consultations, it was to provide the institutional, financial and
management framework for the reformed national TVET system, and (ii) it provided for
the establishment of an Executive Secretariat (ES) of the COREP which would coordinate
the implementation of PIREP.23 The original objective of this component was to reform the
governance and management structures for the TVET training system and develop options
for the reform through a system of financing in collaboration with relevant industry
representatives and social partners. This was to be achieved through four sub-components
that addressed: (i) the institutional framework for the governance of the TVET system,
including capacity building of DINET and INEFP and establishment of labor marketing
monitoring mechanisms, (ii) the mechanisms for providing a sustainable financing basis
for the TVET system, (iii) the arrangement for decentralized management of TVET
institutions in up to 12 24 pilot institutions, and (iv) studies and other research related
activities to facilitate the transition to a demand-led TVET system of competency-based
curricula and teaching. A major thrust of the component was to encourage involvement
and active participation of industry and enterprises in the management of TVET institutions
and to move towards the coordination and articulation of the different skills development
programs, offered the different providers. The modifications to this component at the time
of the restructuring was the elimination of Bank support for the establishment of a national
training authority and the corresponding alignment of DINET and INEFP’s role,
responsibilities and institutional arrangements. Although the project did not support the
establishment of the national training authority or the law creating the framework for the



23  The COREP Decree No., 29/2005 dated August 23, 2005 calls for the establishment of an Executive Secretariat
(Article 7) to coordinate the PIREP program (See Annex 17 Decree No. 29). A set of internal regulations for COREP
and for the Executive Secretariat were approved by COREP on January 27, 2006 and February 6, 2006, respectively, to
establish rules, regulations, competencies for the array of stakeholders expected to be involved in the implementation of
PIREP..
24 In the PAD there are 16 pilot institutions listed as pre-selected training institutions for the pilot project. Four of these

institutions were to be supported by Rede de Slaesianos. The project was to support the rehabilitation of up to 12 schools.
IIC Pemba was on the original list of pilot schools but was not included in the original costing due to an oversight during
preparation.


                                                             40
TVET system, the government did continue this work, with its own resources, in parallel
to the project implementation. Under this component, IDA support financed: (i) technical
assistance for problem diagnosis and conceptual work; (ii) capacity-building of
stakeholders and administrator/managers as well (iii) institutional development support.

3.     The six output indicators selected to measure achievement of this component after
the 2011 AF and the results are follows:

       (i) ES-COREP and COREP board fully functional which was fully achieved.
       Private sector participation on the COREP Board was expanded. ES-COREP
       initiated a marketing campaign focused on secondary schools to raise interest for
       TVET programs as well as supporting the implementation of the Academic and
       Vocational Counselling and Guidance System. The unit has continued its focus on
       the management of workshops, implementation of school improvement plans,
       establishments of partnerships with relevant industry and marketing of school own
       productions;
       (ii) agreement reached with stakeholders on framework for future financing of
       PIREP has been progressing well with the establishment of the National Training
       Fund, partial funding coming from a proposed 1 percent levy of private sector
       payrolls;
       (iii) pilot training institutions with strategic plans in place met the target of 100
       and has been fully achieved. ES-COREP has been instrumental in providing
       extensive training for school and institute managers for the development and
       utilization of strategic plan for implementation of the new course materials and
       equipment;
       (iv) training institutions which retain part of their generating income for school
       improvements has been achieved. In spite of the fact that all 11 institutions retain
       part of their income for school improvements more needs to be done in regard to
       systematic allocation of funds to support maintenance of workshops.
       (v) training institutions that participate regularly in tracer studies has been
       overachieved from a baseline of 50 percent and a target of 65 percent of institutions
       with to a final output of 100 percent. These reports have been used by institutions
       to assess the quality of their own training programs as well as monitor private sector
       acceptance of their trained graduates. The institutions own tracer studies are
       augmented by two project-supported tracer studies which review the project-
       supported TVET activities nationally;
       (vi) training institutions submitting enrollment and pass rates electronically
       through TVET MIS has exceeded the target of 10 with 11 institutions reporting their
       data. This level of achievement is important in that the TVET MIS system at the
       start of the project was weak and was the focus of substantial ES-COSEP technical
       assistance and training; and




                                            41
        (vii) reports from labor market information system produced annually per sector
        with the establishment of the Labor Market Observatory and the training of staff25
        and a systematic collection of data from government and relevant private
        companies, the target of 3 reports was achieved by the end of the project.

4.      In addition, four larger scale performance evaluation studies were included in the
project’s MEP. The first was a series of tracer studies aimed at assessing the impact of the
project over the medium- to long-term. The other three evaluated (i) the effectiveness of
FUNDEC, (ii) progress in terms of gender integration and (iii) progress in terms of
incorporating the HIV/AIDS prevention policy and mainstreaming its content. Gender and
HIV/AIDS was incorporated in the curriculum and mainstreamed across the system. All
qualifications have gender sensitive information and life skills are part of the topics covered
in selected subjects

5.      Sub-Component A.1: Establishment of the National Training Authority. As
indicated above, the 2011 AF/restructuring eliminated the activities under this
subcomponent. However, the government continued with the creation of a new TVET
regulatory framework and the project did provide support through ES-COREP for the
development of the framework. Substantial work has been completed related to the new
regulatory framework.

6.       In 2014, a law that establishes the regulatory framework for the TVET system was
approved and was published in the Boletim da Republica with the number 23/2014
(Suplemento n°.5). The approved legislation included the creation of ANEP which is the
new regulatory body for the TVET system. Although the creation of this umbrella
organization was removed from the project at the time of the AF, the government
proceeded with the process of lengthy consultations with industry, civil society,
beneficiaries of the TVET training system, and government institutions, among others, to
create the oversight body and ensure that the appropriate models for governance,
management and financing of the TVET system were developed. This framework was
developed in collaboration with industry and is crucial to ensure improvements in the
quality and responsiveness of the TVET system to labor market needs by providing training
that is delivered in a sustainable, integrated, effective, and equitable manner. ES-COREP
developed a series of regulations aimed at operationalizing the approved law which were
supported by the project. It should be noted that the new regulatory framework for
governance and TVET financing were moved away from the Ministry of Education to the
Ministry of Science, Technology, Higher Education and Technical Training (MCTESTP)
during this period because of the modifications to the governance framework. The
transition for ES-COREP to ANEP is planned to take place after the details related to
ANEP accountability are clarified within the government and administrative arrangements
and are approved by parliament. The framework was approved by parliament in February
2016.


25
  The first cycle of training was provided by Serviço Nacional de Aprendizagem Industrial (Brazil) SENAI
in 2012 for 16 staff. The beneficiaries were from INEFP (4), the Directorate of Planning (1), and
Employment Centers in the provinces (11).


                                                  42
7.      During the project period, and as part of the new regulatory framework, there was
the creation of a national training fund with contributions for the private sector through the
introduction of a payroll levy system to be paid by employers. Private sector involvement
continues to be strong with: (i) organization of meetings; (ii) participation in the ongoing
work of defining occupation standards and validation of qualifications, (iii) provision of
internships and (iv) development of partnerships with training institutions.

8.      Moreover, as part of the new regulatory framework, the government created a
national Labor Market Observatory (LMIS) under the Ministry of Labor, Employment and
Social Security (MITESS) to monitor and survey employment to determine the needed
labor market skills and training. At the request of the government, and because of the
importance of LMIS in determining labor marked needs, the project financed the training
of nine MITESS technicians. In addition to the central LMIS, plans include the expansion
local market observatories into one or two provinces with the support of other partners.
All-in-all these are substantial regulatory achievements during the project period that have
impacted the goals of a TVET paradigm shift.

9.      Sub-Component A.2: Sustainable TVET financing network. . This sub-
component was to provide technical support to conceptualize and prepare an
implementation plan for the introduction of a financing mechanism for supporting the
system on a sustainable basis. During the project period, government funding for the TVET
sub-sector has increased 178 percent over the 2009-2015 period.26 As mentioned above,
there has also been the development of a new policy by which private sector enterprises,
which benefit from the availability of well trained staff, will contribute to the fund by
paying a levy of up to 1.0 percent on their payrolls. Again, substantial gains were achieved
for the new paradigm.

10.     Sub-Component A.3 - Decentralized TVET management. The 2014 law
established greater autonomy for TVET institutions by establishing regulations that
included, but were not limited to: (i) establishment of school government boards with
private sector involvement and (ii) development of a decentralized management system
which included a robust EMIS system that could be used by managers in the daily
management, policy discussions and reporting to the national ANEP. During the project,
ES-COREP conducted a management capacity building plan of the 12 pilot institutions.
The results of this was: (i) development of a training program for managers and teachers;
(ii) completion of a quality management system (QMS) strategy along with the necessary
implementation manuals to be used in the training; and (iii) development and
implementation of a EMIS that is currently being used by the institutions to provided
needed and accurate data. Dissemination of technical information about the Mozambican
TVET reform to domestic and international institutions, governments, partners and
observers is ongoing and led by the Q&TP unit using information that is provided by the
EMIS (called SEGI in Portuguese).

                                                  43
11.      Sub-Component A.4 - Studies and other research related activities to facilitate
the transition of the TVET system. Achievements under this component included (i)
completion of a baseline study in early 2007 that helped better define the project
development indicators and develop intermediate outcome indicators; (ii) completion of an
institution management capacity assessment study that contributed to the creation of a
capacity building plan that was used to develop a training program for managers and
teachers at target institutions; (iii) completion of a QMS strategy and the necessary
implementation manuals; (iv) development of a management information system; (v)
country wide consultations and agreement on alternative models of governance,
management and financing the TVET system; (vi) completion of strategic studies that have
informed the process of creation of the national training authority27; (vii) the establishment
of an implementing unit with increased project implementation and sector specific
capacity; (viii) the HIV/AIDS mitigation programs have been mainstreamed throughout
the education system in Mozambique28; (ix) 58 MITESS staff have been trained on the
labor market information system and the first two bulletins and one labor market report
have been produced; and (x) five sector profile studies were conducted to cover Agriculture,
Fishery, Construction, Energy and Mining sectors.

12.     Component B: Standards-based Qualification and Training System. (US$7.0
million including original and additional financing totals; Actual Expenditure:
US$9.1 million) The original design of the component was to transform the existing
curriculum-based TVET system into a system that used occupational standards to ensure
that enterprises and experts, in the world of work had a strong influence on the definition
of competencies and training content; that a transparent and legitimate assessment system
was established; and that target groups ,with differing training and learning backgrounds,
were able to assess the TVET learning system and get recognition for their skills regardless
of where the learning/skills acquisition took place. The component had three sub-
components: (i) the development of occupational competency standards; (ii) the
development of modularized training courses based on occupational standards, and (iii) the
development of a standards-based assessment a standards based assessment and
certification system. At the time of the AF this component was modified to include two
additional standards based qualifications -- ICT and mining as well as continue support for
the original topics of industrial maintenance; agriculture; tourism and hospitality; and
administration and management. Issues related to gender and HIV/AIDS were to be
mainstreamed in the curricula for the pilot sectors. In addition, a core module on HIV/AIDS
prevention was to be developed for all pilot sectors to address workplace policy issues,
prevention and information related to availability and support services for HIV/AIDS.




27
   Examples of these studies include: a labor market observatory study that surveyed industry to determine
the demand of side labor needs; a review of the Mega project in Mozambique and how the TVET system can
interface with international companies and their labor needs; and a study on how to improve governance and
financing of TVET as well as sector profiles on tourism, construction, mining energy and fisheries.
28
   Project schools have received all the pamphlets and literature that are provided by the Ministry of
Education and this is a continuing mitigation program


                                                   44
13.     The two output indicators selected to measure achievement of this component after
the 2011 AF were: (i) targeted occupations levels with comprehensive occupational
standards and qualifications fully validated increased from 0 in 2007 to 67 in 2015 (fully
accredited) exceeding the revised target of 28. Equally important were the number of
programs developed based on competency standards which increased from 0 in 2007 to 67
in 2015 again, exceeding the target of 28. These are highly important accomplishment of
the project and are indicative of the substantial progress that has been made in the reform
agenda given the development and utilization of programs which were based on fully
validated occupational and competency standards. The third original indicator, number and
percentage of learners who are assess through the new CBT regime vs. those assessed under
the old system (by gender) was moved to a PDO level as and restated as: learners assessed
through the new CBT regime.

14.      Sub-Component B.1: Development of Occupational Standards. This sub-
component supported the development of the National Vocational Qualifications
Framework (NVQF) approved by COREP in December 2008 that were based on the key
principles of being: (i) demand-based; (ii) competency based; (iii) flexible; and (iv)
integrated along with ensuring stakeholder involvement. Technically the framework was
based on experiences from other countries and adapted to the Mozambique requirements
and validated by the Mozambique stakeholders. Moreover, the needed design of policies,
strategies, guides and manuals that supported the qualification system were completed and
available prior to the actual development of the occupational standards. The process was
well designed which is evidenced by the development of the 67 occupational standards in
the six priority pilot sectors of tourism and hospitality, management and administration,
industrial maintenance and agro-industry, mining and information technology. In addition
to the six pilot sectors, the project supported the development of occupational standards for
gas hydrocarbons. The government has also used the NVQF to develop standards for the
areas of education, public sector, social work and laboratories. It should also be noted that
19 independent shorter modules have been development and approved using the NVQF.

15.     Moreover, the project had a substantial impact on capacity development within the
ministry to continue the development of new standards/qualifications. There has also been
increased representation from the private sector29 either through the design of the standards
or in validation panels. This can be seen with the creation of 13 technical advisory
committees (STACs) that participate and contribute to the different stages of qualification
preparation. These committees work closely with the Qualifications and Training Programs
Unit of COREP during the preparation of the qualifications.

16.   A National Professional Qualification System (SNQP) 30 was developed and
implemented and has been in place since 2009 with the following characteristics:


29
   MOZAL, Mozambique Electricity, Mozambique railways, Mozambique Telecommunications, Agro-Alfa,
CITRUM, Fruitsul, Acuucareira de Xinavane, SASOL etc.
30
   Development of SNQP was based on an analysis of frameworks in Australia, England, Ireland, EU,
Mauritius, Namibia, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales. Participants in the process were
representatives of business, society, ministries and educational institutes. The process was also informed by


                                                    45
       Qualifications and standards approved by the productive sector
       Training centred on a desired graduate profile
       Multiple exit points to the labor market
       National Structure of Professional Qualifications (QNQP)
       Consultation mechanisms.

17.      In addition, other important support mechanisms were develop during the project
period for the new TVET system. These included: (i) registration and accreditation of
TVET institutions’ (ii) quality management and assurance system, including training
manuals; (iii) internal verification or external verification; (iv) accumulation and
transferring of training credits system; (v) methodological guidance and instruments for
the development of qualifications; (vi) qualifications development manual; (vii) guidelines
for student evaluation and sample of tests and examinations for each of the qualifications;
(viii) evaluator's training manual; and (ix) qualifications' validation and registration manual.

18.      Sub-Component B.2: Development of Training Programs Based on
Occupational Standards. Using the new NVQF, the six priority pilot sectors developed
the modular training courses based on the occupations standards which have been approved.
The training programs include teaching and learning materials as well as assessment tools
for all qualifications. In addition, to specific technical subjects, all qualifications cover the
essential skills of math, Portuguese, English, ICT, and life skills.

19.      The life skills component of the qualifications cover the required gender and
HIV/AIDS competencies. These competencies were developed by teams that included both
gender and HIV/AIDS experts. Since the inclusion of these competencies, the proportion
of females enrolled and graduating from the TVET system has 22 percent in 2009 to 38
percent in 2015. In the ongoing effort to increase female participation, individual TVET
institutions have implemented different initiatives to increase female participation in TVET.
These initiatives include: (i) free participation in entry exam preparation programs; (ii)
targeting of marketing materials and events to female candidates; and (iii) subsidizing the
cost of uniforms for female students. Greater gender equity is also being promoted by
development partners in the TVET sub-sector to continue awareness building around the
need for a more equitable TVET system.

20.      In addition to the six pilot sectors, the project supported the development of CBTs
for gas and hydrocarbons as well as for the areas of education, public sector, social work,
and laboratories. The new qualifications are currently being piloted in 25 project
institutions exceeding the original plan of 15 institutions. There are also a number of non-
project supported schools that are now piloting the new competency based curriculum, i.e.,
Instituto Agrario de Chokwe, Instituto Agro-Pecuario de Nacuxa, and Instituto Agriario
Boane are piloting the agricultural curriculum. This is a substantial achievement and shows
that the framework and process have been institutionalized.



the installation of a NYQF reference group composed of representatives from the business community,
academia, NINEP and INEFP.


                                                46
21.     Sub-Component B.3: Development of a Standards-Based Assessment and
Certification System. The certification system has been developed and is being piloted
for conventional training for students registered in the new qualifications. In addition to
traditional classroom assessments by teachers, it also includes internal and external
verifiers. The implementation of this innovative system has shown positive results. There
were 11,413 learners assessed through the new CTB system and the approval rate for the
CBT course is approximately 84 percent compared to 60 percent for the traditional courses.
Although the system has been developed, approved and is being used, there are ongoing
discussions with COREP, DINET, the schools currently implementing the reform in all the
provinces, the National Council on Exams, Certification and Equivalency, and the Institute
of Scholarships (IBE) on ways to continuous improve the system through the better use of
a feedback loop along with needed budget resources to continue the improvement process.
At the time of the project closing, a task force had been created to move the process forward.

22.     Under the project, a certification system for the Recognition of Prior Learning
(RPL) was developed to ensure that individuals and groups with different training and
learning backgrounds could access the TVET system and get recognition for their skills
irrespective of where the learning took place. The RPL was successfully piloted in Maputo
in collaboration with the railways company. This is an important component to the overall
system and going forward the ES COREP will begin the expansion of this program with
other stakeholders.

23.      Component C: Quality Improvement in Training Institutions. (US$38.1
million including original and additional financing totals; Actual Expenditure:
US$41.7 million). This component was designed to address quality problems affecting
DINET and INEFP institutions providing TVET training. It comprised five sub-
components: (C.1) the development and piloting of courses for teachers and management
staff; (C.2) the supply of relevant furniture, equipment, tools, and consumables; (C.3)
planning and implementation of the necessary rehabilitation of the physical infrastructure
for 12 pilot institutions; (C.4) the acquisition, development and piloting of new learning
materials; and (C.5) the development and piloting of student counselling and career path
guidance methods, including assistance in facilitating internship arrangements with
industry. Critical issues of gender and HIV/AIDS were to be mainstreamed in the
development of teacher/trainer programs and acquisition of learning materials, in the
rehabilitation of infrastructure to ensure proper water and sanitation facilities for students,
and counselling services to provide information or referrals to young students seeking
social and emotional support or information on career prospects. The modifications made
to this component at the time of the AF were: (i) reduction in the number of TVET
institutions to be rehabilitated from 12 to 9, and (ii) provision of equipment for 1031 schools
rather than 12.


31
   The ten training institutions that received equipment post additional financing were: (i) Escola Industrial
e Comercial de Pemba, Cabo Delgado Province; (ii) Escola/ Instituto Industrial e Comercial 3 de Fevereiro,
Nampula, Nampula Province; (iii) Centro de Formação Profissional – Nampula, Nampula Province; (iv)
Escola Agrária de Mocuba, Zambézia Province; (v) Centro de Formação Profissional – Beira Sofala Province; (vi) Escola
Profissional de Moamba, Maputo Province; (vii) Instituto Comercial de Maputo, Maputo City; (viii) Instituto Industrial


                                                         47
24.     The post AF output indicators used to monitor progress toward achieving
Component C goals were: (i) number and percentage of students provided with internships
increased from 0 in 2009 to 50 percent in 2015 exceeding the target of 30 percent;; (ii) pass
rate of students enrolled in targeted courses increased from 55 percent in 2011 when the
first cohort graduated to 84 percent in 2015 exceeding the target of 65 percent by 19
percentage points ; (iii) number of teachers in target sectors who received training under
the new CBT system (of which female) increased from 350 in 2010 to 2,027 (11.5 percent
female) exceeding the target of 450; (iv) number of TVET institutions aligned to the CBT
system increased from 5 in 2010 to 25 in 2015 exceeding the target of 16 institutions; (v)
number of school managers (directors and deputies) who have received training on quality
school management increased from 27 in 2010 to 162 in 2015 again, exceeding the target
of 60; (vi) percent of competency based training programs designed with private sector
participation in qualification exams increased from 20 percent in 2010 to 100 percent in
percent in 2015; and (vii) number of classrooms and education facilities rehabilitated and
equipped increased from 6 to 9 completed with 100 percent of project financing. The
remaining one institution (Agrario de Chimoio) 96 percent completed with project
resources and the remaining was completed government resources in early March 2016.

25.     Sub-component – C.1: Training of trainers, teachers and management. This
sub-component was to provide in-service training for teachers and instructors directly
involved in the delivery of the pilot courses. Limited project resources were available for
the training of teachers and school manager related to the underestimation of original
project costs. To compensate for the limited project resources, other development partners
also contributed to the teacher and instructor training. The training was implemented based
on an action plan that was developed following the 2008 and 2014 needs assessment32 that
identified weaknesses in selected topics across the sectors. Overall there were 2,207 33
teachers trained on the CBT system in the targeted sectors. Additionally, 887 professional
education teachers were trained at the bachelor’s level and 82 managers TVET leadership
roles received management training and competency related training. At the request of the
government, the project contributed for the development of a national capacity strategy in
procurement with support from the APPROCUR (Association of Procurement
Professionals) and the Bank which was needed due to support the increased demand for
procurement specialists

26.     In addition to the project and donors supported the training of teachers, it should be
noted, that there were parallel policy reforms, related to the training of TVET teachers, that

   The first needs assessment was completed in 2008 and focused primarily on teachers. The results were
used to formulate a training plan which was followed by basic training in subject areas. The 2014 needs
assessment was more comprehensive and included both teachers and school managers.
33
   The breakdown of the training for the 2,027 teachers is as follows: (i) 941 teachers trained in CBT; (ii) 30
teachers received a master’s degree in agriculture education; (iii) 48 teachers received secondary level
training in Portugal; (iv) 17 teachers were trained in renewable energy in Germany; (v) training; (v) nine
teachers received training in Italy in restaurant and bar; and (vi) 126 teachers received bachelor’s degrees.


                                                     48
there were being developed to support the overall paradigm shift. An important aspect of
this was the development of a strategy for TVET teacher training which is in the beginning
stages of implementation. There are currently three certificates in professional education
that have been development. These are:

      Certificate A. This certificate is for TVET managers, team and pedagogical
       coordinators and lead teachers. This is a higher education level certificate that can
       be offered after, or jointly with, a bachelor’s degree. This certificate has been
       approved. Implementation is likely to be the responsibility of Instituto Superior
       Dom Bosco (ISDB).
      Certificate B. This certificate is for TVET teachers that teach at the pre-secondary
       and secondary levels (basic and medium levels). This is a higher education level
       certificate that can be offered after, or jointly with, a bachelor’s degree. This
       certificate has been approved and there is an agriculture pilot being implemented
       with support from Italy’s PRETEP, ISDB and the project.
      Certificate C. This certificate is for TVET instructors that teach levels I and II of
       the QNQP at professional training center or other training institutions that offer
       basic training program. This requires the completion of a secondary school
       education. The certificate has been approved and is being implemented by ISDB.

27.    There are also discussions of a statue for trainers of vocational education underway
along with a draft decree being development. This statue aims to improve the conditions
of TVET teachers in the country and focuses on teachers’ rights and responsibilities. An
implementation plan has been created which also addresses the retention of teachers. All
important steps in the ongoing improvement of the TVET system.

28.      Sub-component - C.2 - Provision of furniture, equipment, tools, and
consumables. By the final stages of the project implementation 10 institutions were fully
equipped with furniture, equipment, tools and consumables. Overall 237 teachers have
been trained in the use of new equipment. All equipment had been acquired, delivered and
installed in the institutions. There have also been operational maintenance manuals and
guides developed for the workshops of industrial maintenance courses. The development
of such manuals benefited from the presence of the school based advisors financed by GIZ.
Institutions are expected to include funds for the maintenance of equipment and buildings
in budget for 2016. The Ministry of Science and Technology, Higher Education and
Technical Training (Ministério da Ciência e Tecnologia, Ensino Superior e Técnico
Profissional – MCTESTP) has also urged the institutions to make use of income to ensure
maintenance of equipment. The Bank team and ES-COREP have also advised INEFP to
include funds for the maintenance of equipment and buildings in budget for 2016.

29.      Sub-component - C.3: Improvement of physical infrastructure. This sub-
component focused on the improvement of physical infrastructure. As indicated, there were
9 institutions to be rehabilitated after the AF and restructuring. An additional institution
was added during the post-AF/Restructuring period, bringing the total to 10. Of these, nine
institutions were fully completed prior to project closing. The remaining institution
(Instituto Agrário de Chimoio – IAC) was completed in March 2016.


                                            49
30.      Sub-component - C.4 - Acquisition, development and provision of new
learning materials. Learning materials, such as training manual, instructor guides and
textbook, among others, have been developed and/or distributed to support the
implementation of the approved qualifications. Learning materials were distributed to all
institutions offering CBT. Training manuals and instructor guides were developed for the
new qualifications and 19,541 textbooks related to the CBT have been distributed to 11
institutions.

31.      Sub-component – C.5 - Professional guidance orientation. The project has
developed has an academic and vocational counselling and guidance system. The system
was designed based on review of systems in Botswana, Spain, Mauritius and Australia etc.
An action plan to inform the implementation of the system is currently being reviewed.
Working with ES-COREP, the STEM-Canada project is likely to pilot the system in four
institutions in Tete and Cabo Delgado Provinces as soon as the system receives the final
approval.

32.     Component D: Skills Development Fund or Fundo para o Desenvolvimento de
Competências Profissionais (FUNDEC) (US$11.4 million including original and
additional financing totals; Actual Expenditure: US$5.2 million). This component was
designed to promote innovation and initiatives for the improvement of quality and
relevance of training and to increase access to employment-oriented TVET for underserved
population groups. The component financed small grants that can be accessed, on a
competitive basis, through the Skills Development Fund (FUNDEC). Unlike Component
B and C where re-alignment was envisioned in selected sectors and institutions, activities
financed by FUNDEC were not limited to selected target sectors. Instead the intention was
to promote innovations and initiatives for the improvement of quality and relevance of
training and at increasing access to employment-oriented TVET courses for the out-of-
school youth and adults with a particular emphasis on women.

33.      FUNDEC consisted of three funding windows. (i) funding capacity building and
training activities offered by public providers who are not taking part in the pilot projects;
(ii) funding capacity building and training (formal and non-formal training) offered by non-
public providers; and (iii) funding targeted training courses to respond to needs of
underserved group who are located primarily in rural areas in order to improve their
livelihood opportunities.34 One original output indicator and two new indicators added at
the time of the AF and restructuring were used to monitor progress in this component. (i)
number of partnerships formed between training providers or promoters and private sector
institutions had an end target of 25 and this was fully achieved by the close of the project;
(ii) number of matching grant projects successfully completed with an end target of 120
was over achieved at 128; and (iii) number of institutions benefitting from grants scheme
with an end target of 120 was also over achieved at 126.



34
  Under the original design of the project, FUNDEC consisted of four funding windows. However, only three
of the four windows received and approved sub-project grants.


                                                   50
34.      Through the seven project funding cycles supported under the project, 189 sub-
projects in 126 institutions received financing. The grants benefited 68,432 individuals, 38
percent of whom were female. Of these 189 sub-projects, 128 received matching grants
from the beneficiary institutions. FUNDEC contributed to the improvement of training
facilities, development of new CBT qualifications, training of 322 managers and short-
term training programs for beneficiaries in the areas of project management and
implementation. The latter training programs were developed in order to ensure that grant
proposals were of high quality, as well as to facilitate the effective implementation of sub-
project grants. The majority of the CBT training programs financed under FUNDEC were
in the strategic areas of agriculture, industrial maintenance, mining, administration, and
civil works. The total FUNDEC funding is reported to be US$5.2 million. Two independent
evaluations of the competitive fund were completed. The evaluations showed that the
FUNDEC successfully supported innovative initiatives target at improving relevance and
quality of TVET training and increased access to employment oriented TVET programs
among underserved groups, especially women. All 10 provinces in Mozambique benefitted
from FUNDEC support. Financial audits and M&E reports carried out under the project
also revealed that the majority of FUNDEC resources were used efficiently and for their
intended purposes (see Annex 3 for additional information).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction

1.       The economic and financial analysis included in this annex includes an overview
of the assessment undertaken at the time of project appraisal and examines the efficiency
gains observed over the life of the Mozambique TVET Project. This Annex includes the
following sections: (i) background; (ii) returns to education; (iii) trend analysis of internal
and external efficiency gains; (iv) unit cost analyses; (v) execution rate of FUNDEC
grants/sub-projects; (vi) financial management performance; (vii) efficiency of
implementation during the pre- and post-restructuring periods; and (vii) financial and
institutional sustainability of project achievements.

Background

2.      In the years preceding project preparation, Mozambique’s economy had been
experiencing important structural changes. Manufacturing and mines sectors had almost
doubled their share of GDP (from 9 percent to 18 percent), while the share of the agriculture
sector declined from 82 percent to 72 percent. As the economy was shifting from labor-
intensive sectors to capital-intensive ones, the demand for labor was also experiencing a
shift from a heavy reliance on unskilled workers to one in greater need of highly skilled
labor. This was confirmed with data from the national household surveys in 1996 and 2002.
35
   The proportion of workers in the formal sector was small – accounting for less than 10
percent of the entire labor force. The increased demand for more highly skilled labor
triggered a sharp increase in the returns to post-basic education and beyond, particularly
with respect to workers with little or no education.

3.      However, the supply of labor was slow to respond to the structural changes within
the Mozambican economy and an insufficient number of graduates had received training
which would allow them to be absorbed within the strategic sectors of the economy.36 The
TVET system was facing serious challenges. The TVET system was characterized by low
quality programs, poorly trained education staff, an insufficient number of TVET facilities,
and a number of TVET institutions requiring rehabilitation and equipment. Further, the
system was fragmented with little coordination with and input from the private sector
contributing to the lack of alignment between the skills of TVET graduates needs of the
labor market. This was largely driven by the fact that there were only limited linkages
between TVET curricula and program design and the needs of the labor market.




35
   In the period from 1996 and 2002, the share of employed in the agriculture sector declined from 81 percent
to 72 percent while people working in manufacturing and mines reduced the (already) small share of the total
employment. Employment, however, increased in the trade and private services sector, which is in contrast
with reductions of the two sectors as a percentage of GDP. The construction sector is the only sector that
showed an increase in both the share of GDP and employment.
36 The strategic sectors which were subsequently targeted by this project were the following: tourism and
hospitality, management and administration, industrial management and agro-industry, mining and ICT.


                                                    54
4.      As described in the PAD, the drivers of the internal and external inefficiencies
were: limited relevance of training provided and skills acquired (through TVET programs)
to industry and labor market needs; poor quality of training programs driven by unqualified
teachers; a shortage of teaching aids; limited access and equity to training with an acute
shortage of spaces in secondary and technical schools and limited options for school leavers,
and other groups outside the education system as well as individuals living outside urban
areas; a highly fragmented and uncoordinated TVET system; and severe underfunding of
the TVET sector.37

5.      While efforts were made to address the above-mentioned issues, and to increase the
supply of skilled TVET graduates, the high level of labor market rigidity was identified as
a key constraint to doing business in Mozambique in 2003. In order to address the above
challenges, the Government launched an ambitious and comprehensive reform program in
2007 to transform the TVET system and to improve the quality and relevance of training
provided by the system in close cooperation with industry and social partners – as well as
to increase access of student to TVET. The shift in the TVET paradigm would entail a
multi-pronged approach which would involve reforming the governance and management
structures of the TVET system while also increasing the quality and relevance of the TVET
training provided. The improved TVET system would be demand-driven and would aim
to equip graduates with necessary and relevant skills to successfully gain employment
within the economy. It was in this context that the Mozambique TVET Project was
designed and appraised.

Expected Gains

6.       According to the PAD, the expected benefits of the original operation were the
enhancement of competitiveness and productivity in key growth (economic) sectors and
increased opportunities for gainful employment and earnings in the formal and informal
sectors. More specifically, as a result of project activities including the development of
institutional framework for the sub-sector, design and roll out of competency based
programs based on input from the private sectors, and the upgrading and set up of pilot
institutions, it was expected that: 1) the TVET graduates from pilot training institutions
would receive market relevant skills to improve their economic and social development
opportunities; and 2) graduates financed through the competitive grants program PIREP
(FUNDEC) would receive relevant training aimed at improving their livelihood
opportunities/their chances of gaining employment in the formal and informal sectors. It
was envisioned that improvements to the quality of TVET would not only increase the
relevance of training to the labor market – it would also provide incentives for TVET
students to remain enrolled and to complete their programs, thus reducing cost
inefficiencies related to high dropout and repetition rates.

7.     The TVET Project directly supported the Government’s ambitious reform and
aimed to increase the internal and external efficiency of the TVET system by increasing
the quality and relevance of the TVET training provided within Mozambique through a


37
     Among SSA countries, Mozambique had one of the lowest levels of spending in Sub-Saharan Africa.


                                                    55
series of key activities: the development of a regulatory framework; development of a
standards-based qualification and training system; support to the rehabilitation of selected
TVET institutions; and support to a innovate and demand-driven competitive fund.

Returns to Education

8.      The returns to TVET education were and remain high in the Mozambican
context. At the time of appraisal, analysis of data from two cross-sectional national surveys
(1996/1997 and 2002/2003) provided evidence that there were positive and significant
returns to TVET. The analysis showed that not only did workers with higher levels of
education earn a higher income and wages but that they also were more likely to be
employed in the formal sector. Furthermore, when controlling for individual and job-
related characteristics, graduates from TVET institutions received a higher market wage
premium when compared to general secondary education graduates. Wages for salaried
workers from TVET were 33 percent higher when compared with medium-level graduates
from ESG2.38 From a broader income perspective which takes into account formal wages
and other forms of remuneration, a worker who had graduated from the medium-level
TVET system earned, on average, 32 percent more than an ESG2 graduate and the income
of an elementary and basic TVET graduate was, on average 54 percent higher than an EP2
and ESG1 (secondary education) graduates.

9.      An updated analysis on the returns to education similarly provides a strong
economic justification for the Bank’s support to the TVET sector through this Project. A
tracer study undertaken in 2014 found that TVET graduates earned higher income and
wages, on average, than graduates of general secondary education. Data gathered from
this and a tracer study undertaken in 2015 provide further evidence that earnings among
CBT graduates (those who benefitted from the program) were higher than those of non-
CBT graduates (individuals who did not benefit from the program). Moreover, results from
recent analytical work undertaken by the Cho and Feda (2015) found that, among salaried
workers in Mozambique, an additional year of education is associated with an increase of
12.4 percent, on average, in monthly earnings. Furthermore, the incremental increase in
income associated with completing TVET (relative to completing upper secondary
education) was 10.4 percent. Research by Simione (2014) corroborates these findings and
reveals that an additional year of schooling leads to an increase in wages by approximately
16.2 percent, on average.

Internal and External Efficiency: Trend Analysis

10.     Internal efficiency. The internal efficiency of the system concerns maximizing the
relationship between inputs and outputs. The following inputs were supported under the
Mozambique TVET Project in order to improve the quality, relevance and overall


38
   The education system in Mozambique is comprised of two years of primary education (EP1 and EP2), two
years of secondary education (ES1 and ES2), two streams of TVET (professional and medium), teacher
education (middle), and tertiary education (higher). ESG1 and ESG2 refer to general secondary education
track.


                                                  56
efficiency of the subsector: teacher training/certification, equipment and learning materials,
competency-based programs and certifications, and rehabilitation/construction of
infrastructure and institutions. Under this operation, improvements were observed with
regards to the internal efficiency of the TVET sector. Evidence gathered from the 2014
tracer study found that the dropout rates and failure rates in Project-supported schools were
lower than those observed among schools not supported by the Project. By the end of
project, pass rates among students enrolled in targeted courses had reached 84 percent (and
85 percent among females). Finally, 2,027 teachers were trained under the new CBT
training modules and 162 school managers had been trained in quality management. In
addition to strengthened capacity of teachers from project-supported training, in-service
training of teachers is undertaken more frequently in project-supported schools than those
not supported by the project.39 Although the internal efficiency trends in the TVET system
are generally positive, cost overruns were observed under the component related to civil
works activities (Component C) of the Project.

11.     External efficiency. Substantial improvements were also observed in terms of the
external efficiency of the TVET sector. As described above, at the time of project appraisal,
there was limited cooperation between the TVET system and the private sector -- limiting
the ability for TVET programs and skills training to be responsive to the labor market’s
demand for skills. Further, there had been underinvestment in the TVET sector,
insufficient resource recovery and inadequate educational financing methods. Some of the
principle external efficiency gains were the following: (i) an increase in the percentage of
graduates of targeted (CBT) programs who found a job directly related to their field of
study within six months of graduation increased from 27.2 percent to 57 percent by the end
of project;(ii) graduates from CBT programs had a higher rate of employment than non-
CBT graduates; (iii) graduates from CBT programs also had higher salaries, on average
than non-CBT graduates40; and (iv) teaching in project-supported schools focused less on
theoretical knowledge (and more on non-theoretical or applied training). Employer
surveys conducted for the second tracer study provide evidence that a large portion of
employers of graduates from CBT programs were satisfied with the quality of the CBT
programs. Furthermore, by the end of the Project, all project-supported institutions were
retaining a portion of their generated income to support school improvements.




39
   Interviews and field-level observations at the institutions supported by the project confirm these positive
trends. Although year-on-year data are not readily available for all institutions targeted by the project,
administrative staff at the respective institutions also report reductions in repetition and dropout rates, as well
as increases in transition and completion rates over the life of the operation.
40
   Around 31% of CBT graduates earn over 10,000 MT per month while only 23% of non-CBT graduates
earn this level of income. (Tracer Study 2014)

12.      The original project costing underestimated the financial resources necessary for
school rehabilitation and provision of equipment planned under the civil works component
of the operation (Component C). At appraisal, the total estimated cost for Sub-Components
C.2 and C.341 – which supported civil works activities as well as the provision of furniture,
equipment and tools – was forecasted to be US$17,068,103. During project preparation,
the Bank team carried out its due diligence and provided estimates using standard Bank
forecasting methods. However, due to the complexity of costing the rehabilitation of entire
institutions coupled with the rising inflationary pressures, existing project funds were
insufficient to cover the actual cost of rehabilitating and equipping the targeted TVET
institutions. Rising inflation related to the procurement of goods and services during the
preparation for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa had a large impact in Mozambique
since most of the construction materials were imported from South Africa. In order to fill
this financing gap, additional funds resources allocated so that this component could be
successfully completed. By project closing, a total of US$40,299,212 was spent,
representing an increase of US$23,231,109 million from the appraised estimates. Despite
these significant cost overruns, 9 of the 10 supported TVET institutions under the Project
were 100 percent completed by the operation’s closing date. The remaining one institution
(IAC) was at advanced stages of implementation and was fully completed with the
Government’s own financial resources in early March 2016.

13.     A total of 19,541 TVET textbooks were procured and distributed under the project.
Following standard Bank guidelines and procedures, the procurement of these textbooks
was based on the lowest evaluated price. The average cost per textbook was US$ 25.21
and the total cost of all textbooks purchased was US$ 492, 617.95. Given the variability in
the complexity and nature of the textbook itself, coupled with the array of subject matters
covered, it is difficult to easily identify a relevant cost-comparator. However, it is important
to highlight that the textbooks were procured through a competitive bidding process and
these learning materials greatly increased the quality of training provided by the institutes
targeted by the project. It is also important to underscore that these textbooks can typically

be used for 6 consecutive academic years, suggesting that the average annualized cost of
these quality inputs is quite low, and therefore, efficient.42

14.     A total of 2,027 teachers received training under the new competency-based
training system established by the project. The average cost of the training per teacher was
US$ 555, while the total cost of this activity is estimated to be US$ 1,124,112. CBT training
was provided for each of the targeted sectors supported by the project, although
disaggregated data for each sector/trade type is not readily available. Given the variability
in the scope, duration, mode of delivery, trade type, etc., it is difficult to identify a clear
cost-comparator for this activity. However, the average costs for this activity appears to
be reasonable since CBT training tends to be a relatively more expensive form of education
because of its strong reliance on well-equipped laboratories, hands-on equipment, and other
pedagogical materials which are not necessary for more general or theoretical training
courses.

Execution Rate of FUNDEC Grants/Sub-Projects

15.     The FUNDEC (Fundo de Desenvolvimento de Competências Profissionais) was a
competitive funding mechanism established by the project. FUNDEC was designed to
provide competitive grants aimed at improving the quality and relevance of TVET, while
also increasing access to employment-oriented TVET programs. The FUNDEC grants
supported sub-projects across four funding windows although grants were received for
three of the funding windows. These grants were in high demand and the selection process
was quite competitive. A total of 405 grant proposals were received by the FUNDEC
review committee, of which 188 (46 percent), were approved. As shown in Table 2 below,
across the seven FUNDEC funding cycles, the execution rate for these grants was high –
with almost three-fourths (73 percent) of the allocated grants being fully executed. In small
instances where anomalies were revealed or bookkeeping did not fully adhere to standards,
the grants for these sub-projects were either interrupted or cancelled in order to prevent
financial loss. Of the grants which were fully executed, financial audit and M&E reports
produced under the project showed that FUNDEC resources were used efficiently,
judiciously and for their intended purposes. The evidence highlighted that the use of grant
funding conformed to the prescribed expenditure categories as laid out in the approved sub-
project proposals. This efficient use of resources was, in large part, a result of the
Government’s concerted effort to establish strong fiduciary controls and to provide strong
M&E oversight at the approval stage and throughout the implementation process. The
FUNDEC also efficiently leveraged funding from beneficiaries in the form of matching
grants - with a total 128 provided to sub-projects supported under the FUNDEC. This was
instrumental in ensuring the scalability and sustainability of the supported interventions.




42
   Textbooks were procured for the following subject matters: agriculture, administration and management,
tourism and hospitality, industrial maintenance, and general studies.

Strong Financial Management Performance and Judicious Use of Project Resources

16.     The public FM assessment which was carried out in 2004 concluded that the overall
public sector FM management system needed to be strengthened in order to ensure the
efficient and judicious use of project resources. Therefore, special emphasis was placed on
building the Government’s technical capacity in budget planning, accounting, and
reporting. In order to ensure that the project could fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities, ES-
COREP recruited a qualified FM specialist and provided direct FM support to targeted
beneficiaries (i.e., TVET institutions and grantees under the FUNDEC program). In
addition, the FM mechanism used for the FUNDEC program was made more robust and
provided strong oversight of the use of resources at the beneficiary/grantee level. This was
important insofar as it has increased the transparency of this program and ensured that
project funds were used in compliance with the stated objectives and criteria set forth in
the approved FUNDEC grant proposals.

17.     With support and oversight of the FM specialist at ES-COREP, fiduciary tasks
under this operation were effectively carried out. The Bank also provided significant
support to strengthen the Government’s capacity in this key area. Throughout the duration
of the operation, annual audit reports were received on time, revealed no irregularities, and
were of unqualified opinion. Interim unaudited financial reports were also submitted in a
timely manner and in accordance with Bank procedures. In instances in which minor issues
were identified, corrective actions were taken by the Bank and the Government. Available
evidence from the internal and external audits provides evidence that project resources
were used for their intended purposes and that no significant financial leakages or losses
had occurred during the project life.

18.     Although at this point in time it is difficulty to fully measure and quantify the
efficiency gains realized at the sectoral level, the policy reforms which were developed and
approved over the life of the project are also likely to have a long-term positive impact on
the overall efficiency of the TVET system in Mozambique.

Efficiency of implementation

19.     Despite progress observed during the pre-restructuring period, the initial
implementation delays in enacting institutional reforms, recruiting a technical firm to assist
in the development of operational standards, and delays in the procurement of civil works
activities resulted in a modest rate of implementation efficiency. Moreover, the delays
which were observed during the pre-restructuring period also made it difficult to


                                                                  60
systematically and comprehensively assess efficiency gains related to labor market
insertion of graduates, employers’ satisfaction with beneficiaries’ market-relevant skills,
and improved labor market outcomes of beneficiaries who received support under this
project. As a result of external inflationary shocks and the difficulty of costing the
rehabilitation of TVET institutions, the cost of civil work activities during the early years
of the project was also much greater than the estimated costs at appraisal. However, the
efficiency of the project’s implementation improved significantly during the post-
restructuring period. Under the 2011 restructuring/AF, the activities, indicators and targets
were appropriately calibrated to reflect available funding, implementation capacity and
available implementation timeframe. Although the cost of civil works activities remained
higher than the initial forecasted amounts, the vast majority of the project’s outputs and
outcomes were achieved or exceeded by the closing date. This was accomplished even in
light of the exchange rate losses observed during the latter years of the project. 43 The
coordination unit established ensured activities were harmonized and that there was no
duplication of efforts particularly as it pertained to occupational standards and modularized
training materials.

20.     As shown in Table 3 above, the Government’s financial commitment to the TVET
sub-sector has consistently increased over time. Between 2009 and 2015, total allocations
to the TVET sub-sector increased by approximately 178 percent in real terms—reflecting
the Government’s strong endorsement of the reforms and activities supported under the
Mozambique TVET Project. Further, support under the HEST Project is ongoing which
continues to support, scale up and fully institutionalize a number of initiatives and
interventions which were started under this project. A number of development partners
also remain actively engaged in the sector and have committed financial and human
resources to further strengthening the TVET sector in Mozambique. The Italian
Cooperation, for instance, plans to continue to support a number of institutions which were
beneficiaries under this operation.

Project, and evidence suggests project resources were used for their intended purposes

     MOZAMBIQUE TECHNICAL AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROJECT -
              IMPLEMENTATION COMPLECTION REPORT

 I.      Background

 1.    In October 2005, the Minister of Planning in Mozambique issued a letter,
 addressed to the World Bank (WB), outlining the government’s policy on technical and
 vocational education reform. The letter stated:

        "We intend to carry out an in-depth reform of the vocational system through the
       establishment of a new paradigm, where training, oriented by the search of both
       formal and informal work market, is more relevant for t he country’s development
       and has quality international standards."44

 2.    The following year, on 27 June 2006, the World Bank announced that it had
 approved a US$37.5 million credit45 for the government for a project (PIREP) that
 would finance the first 5-year phase of the Government fifteen-year Reforma da
 Educação Profissional (REP). Supplementary funds and technical assistance were
 obtained from other Cooperating Partners, namely Spanish and a major contribution was
 provided by GIZ through the provision of technical assistance which has been steady
 since 2006 and is still ongoing. Funds have also been provided by the Flemish
 Government in 2008 by DANIDA from 2009 to 2012 and technical assistance has been
 provided by Canada through the ACCC (currently CICan) Project and by Australia from
 201246 onwards.

 3.    The project officially started in July 2006 and was launched in September of the
 same year. The original Project was to end in December 31, 2011. The reform of
 vocational training (in Portuguese, Reforma da Educação Profissional, REP) is
 conceived to include three crucial phases namely, a pilot phase which was expected
 to be from 2006 to 2011 but lasted until 2015, followed by an expansion phase of
 another cycle of five years that have just started which is now expected to be merged
 with the consolidation phase which was planned to take place from 2016 to 2020.

   The facility is comprised of a US$30 million credit from the Bank and a US$7.5 million equivalent grant
from the government of the Netherland s which was reduced in 2010 to US$6.574.918.00.
46
   There are also other parallel projects financed by Italian and Canadian Cooperation, benefitting 16
Institutes


                                                   67
4.    Following the approval of the Bank financed TVET Project, the Government of
Mozambique initiated a since 2006 a major TVET Reform known as Reforma da
Educação Profissional (REP) whose first phase was designated Programa Integrado da
Reforma da Educação Profissional (PIREP) co-financed by the World Bank, the
Netherlands. As stated above supplementary funds were obtained from other
Cooperating Partners.

5.    To set the reform process in motion through decrees 29/2005 of August 23, and
16/2007, of December 17, the Government has created an Inter-ministerial Commission
for Professional Education and Training Reform (CIREP), supported by an Executive
Commission for Professional Education and Training Reform (COREP), under the
chairmanship of the Minister for Education with the Minister of Labor as Deputy Chair,
and composed by government officials, Employers from the Private Sector, Trade
Unions and Civil Society representatives. In order to support COREP, an Executive
Secretariat has been created which is responsible for conducting, implementing and
monitoring the overall reform program. CIREP is chaired by the Prime Minister and
comprises 8 Ministers namely: Education, Labour, Science and Technology, Finance,
Planning and Development, Public Administration, Agriculture and Trade and Industry.

II.   Overall Project Objectives

6.      The original Project Development Objective was to facilitate the transition of
the existing TVET system to a demand -led training system and provide the beneficiaries
with more relevant skills and improved economic opportunities. This original objective
is still relevant today but given the time frame for implementation of a project it was
ambitious. The reform has initiated a major change on the educational paradigm of the
TVET sub-system. In 2005 the Government had just been able to reconstruct the
primary school network that dilapidated the entire education system. The TVET sub-
system was characterized by: fragmentation, based on outdated curriculum, with
teachers that for many years lacked the required renewal of skills, institutions that
lacked the required equipment and the qualified human resources and the complete
absence of the private sector to support the system in the design of qualifications or
even simply indicating the qualifications required in the market.

7.      In 2011, the Project was restructured to ensure the objectives were feasible for
the first phase of the reform which required more time than initially envisioned. In
addition the implementation of the Project required more funds than those allocated by
the original credit. Therefore the Government in 2011 requested additional funds to
ensure that the objectives of the ongoing reform were achieved. An additional US 37.0
million were provided by a second credit support by the World Bank which permitted
the completion of most activities and achievement of most targets set by the Project.
The additional financing of the Project modified the project development objectives
and outcome indicators to align them with current implementation realities and scale
back the scope of project school rehabilitation Also Through the additional financing
the Project closing date was extended to September 2014 and later extended to
September 30, 2015.



                                          68
8.    The Project components remained the same but the Project Development
Objectives was revised: to improve the quality and relevance of Technical and
Vocational Education in Mozambique with a focus on selected key TVET institutions
and Programs.

III.     List of Project Components

9.     PIREP has four components:
        A -Development of an Institutional Framework
        B - Standards-based Qualifications and Training System
        C - Quality Improvements in TVET Institutions
        D - Skills Development Fund (FUNDEC)

10.    Component A: Development of an Institutional Framework. The objective of
this component is to reform the governance and management structures for the training
system and develop options for the reform of a system of financing in collaboration
with the relevant industry representatives and social partners.

11.     Component B: Qualifications and Training. This component aimed to transform
the current curriculum-based TVET system into a system based on occupational standards
to ensure that enterprises and experts in world of work have a strong influence on the
definition of competencies and training content; that a transparent and legitimate
assessment system can be established; and that target groups with different training and
learning backgrounds will be able to access the TVET learning system being recognized
for their skills regardless of where the learning/skills acquisition takes place.

12.     Component C: Quality Improvement in Professional Education Institutions. This
component addressed the quality problems affecting DINET and the INEFP institutions
and in this regard funds were used to train, teachers and managers,, supply of relevant
furniture, equipment, tools and consumables; rehabilitation of physical infrastructures
and development and acquisition of learning material.

13.    Component D: Expanded Access and Promotion of Equity (FUNDEC). This
component is designed to promote innovation and initiatives for improvement of quality
and relevance of training and increase access to employment-oriented TVET for
undeserved population group. The component finances small grants that were accessed,
on a competitive basis, through the Skills Development Fund (FUNDEC).

IV.    Summary of Project Achievements

14.     Through the implementation of the above components, the Project contributed for
the establishment of the foundations of the reform by improving the quality and relevance
of technical and vocational training in Mozambique, with a focus on selected key
TVET institutions and programs and contributing for the development of all the
necessary instruments to permit the continuity of the reform and take the reform to new
levels required to consolidate the ongoing achievements such as the implementation of


                                           69
a financing framework underpinned by a new governance system. The improvement in
the quality and relevance of training in selected institutions was accomplished, among
others, through: (i) the implementation of new school regulations in targeted
institutions; (ii) the rehabilitation, equipment, provision of learning materials and
training of teachers and managers of selected ins of institutions, provision of internships
to students of targeted programs; (iii) the implementation of new qualifications in six
sectors for which occupational standards and validation was done in collaboration with
private sector who have also the design and implementation of the assessment system;
(iv) the establishment of partnerships with the private sector; Also due to the new
dynamic of the market the development of qualifications was initiated for the area of
Gas and Hydrocarbons . In addition, new competence based qualifications (CBT) were
also developed (i.e., certificates for TVET teachers and ECD workers) and are in
implementation to ensure that the ongoing achievements are sustained by needed
qualified staff in the years to come. The project also contributed for the development
of the National Strategy in Procurement. In addition, the new governance and financing
framework of TVET sets the foundations for the major objective of the reform established
by the Government:

 15.       The above contributed for:
           The implementation of new school regulations in targeted institutions improved
            management and use of income;
           The involvement of the private sector in the development of qualifications and
            the introduction of new methodology of teaching associated with improved
            learning materials and improved assessment system resulting in improvements
            in the graduation rate of students of targeted programs;
           Substantial gains were observed in the proportion of graduates that find a job or
            creates a job which is directly related to their field of study (from 27% in 2007
            to 57% in 2015);
           The proportion of employers/private sector representatives reporting
            satisfaction with the quality of graduates trained through the Competency Based
            Training (CBT) increased from 78% in 2014 to 80% in 2015;
           The number of institutions aligned with the new methodology of teaching whose
            teachers and managers benefitted from training in CBT increased from 5 in 2009
            to 21 in 2015 well above the Project target.
           The number of students assessed through the new CBT system is over 11,000 in
            the TVET medium training institutions.
           The Skills Development Fund (FUNDEC) supported innovative initiatives
            targeted at improving the relevance and quality of TVET training and increased
            access to employment -oriented TVET program s among underserved groups.

 V. Evaluation of Project Objectives and Design (are the objectives linked to
 Government's strategy, sector needs, etc; are the project-supported activities linked
 to the PDO)

 16. Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) in Mozambique is
 primarily offered through government technical schools managed by the Ministry of


                                               70
Science Technology, Higher Education and Professional Education (MCTESTP) and
vocational training centres under the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social
security (MITESS) and a diverse number of different Ministries. The Government
strongly encourages the participation of the private training providers which are
increasingly entering the market. It should be clarified, however, that technical education
was previously under the Ministry of Education but, since January 2015, it is being
overseen by the newly created Ministry of Science Technology, Higher Education and
Professional Education.

17. In fact, in all Government Programs drawn during the lifetime of the Project,
TVET has been given special attention as it is considered a key instrument for economic
and social development as well as poverty reduction. The creation of the of CIREP
and COREP shows that TVET has been a priority for the Government.

18. The Government confirms its commitment to transform the TVET system and
improve the quality and relevance of training in close cooperation with industry and
social partners. The Government's Program also underlines its desire to expand the
TVET sub-system as part of the overall effort to increase access to post-primary
education and, most importantly, respond effectively and efficiently to the needs of
the labour market.

19.   The Government vision includes the following key elements:

  a) the creation of a consultative governance and institutional framework with equal
     representation from Government, industry , organized labour and civil society
     organizations to lead the transformation of the TVET training system;
  b) the adoption of a demand-led paradigm to ensure planning and delivery of
     training fully coincides with requirements of a growing economy and changing
     labour market requirements;
  c) a commitment to addressing and mainstreaming transversal issues of gender
     and HIVIAIDS in the selection of programs for investment ,
  d) learning content and delivery of training in all training institutions and in the
     workplace;
  e) the introduction of occupational standards set and validated by industry and a
     modular curricula;
  f) the establishment of an independent national system for assessment and
     certification of learners;
  g) the introduction of an accreditation system for public and private providers
     offering Competency Based Training (CBT) courses and qualifications;
  h) the establishment of a new system for technical teacher training; and
  i) the introduction of a decentralized system for TVET management.
     Furthermore, the Government has expressed its commitment to diversify the
     funding sources for TVET in order to maintain long-term sustainability.

20. Nominally, the implementation of the first phase of the reform which was
financed through the Project provided the first opportunity to bring the planning


                                            71
 processes of different Ministries under a single planning framework. This facilitated
 the construction of a common understanding and consensus around having a consistent
 approach to the development of TVET courses and qualifications which enabled these
 courses to be recognized - as either qualification s or credits towards a recognized
 qualification - on an approved new TVET qualification framework. In addition, the 13
 Sector Technical Advisory Committees (STACs) have played an important role to
 secure the participation of industry, academia, civil society in the development of
 occupational standards, validation of qualifications and in opening the dialogue on
 new areas that proved to be relevant to the market such as gas and oil but also in
 other areas such as Early Childhood Education (ECO) and land management where
 qualified professionals were almost non-existent.

 21. The COREP Board continues to meet on a regular basis and is giving its
 approval to important documents and instruments developed under the TVET Reform
 which form the "architecture" for a new TVET system.

 VI.   Evaluation of Implementation                   Performance        and     Key
 implementation challenges

 22. During the implementation , a number of activities were successfully
 undertaken , namely the development of the TVET regulatory framework including
 the creation of a TVET National Fund, the establishment of an M&E system for the
 Project; the development of a National Vocational Qualification Framework (annex!),
 the development of new qualifications in selected six sectors (annex 2); the
 involvement of the private sector in the definition of occupational standards and
 validation of qualifications (annex 3), the rehabilitation of infrastructure and provision
 of furniture and equipment to the institutions, the provision of in- service training
 programmes for trainers and managers, and the implementation of a competitive fund
 to finance skills development projects with particular focus on out-of-school
 population youth and women, in particular.

23.     All Project activities were successfully completed and some of which exceeded
the planned targets. A major challenge encountered during this period had to do with
the understanding of the new TVET paradigm by different stakeholders. This has been
addressed though the creation of mechanisms to promote greater involvement and
active participation of all T V E T stakeholders at all levels, with special attention given
to schools, through the establishment of implementation support committees.
Workshops with private sector also facilitated building the needed consensus to move
the reform forward and to set the ongoing partnerships (i.e., relevant and qualified
industry professionals are members of the advisory sector committees, increased in
the support of internships, active participation in workshops related to skills
development).

24.    On the other hand, due to its complexity, the project faced a time constraint
challenge as the period of its implementation was initially under-estimated which led
to the need to extend the timeframe of the project, though the provision additional



                                             72
funding.

 25. It is also important to mention that the process of approval of the TVET law
 took longer than expected due to the complexity of the consultation process to
 ensure overall consensus of all relevant stakeholders national wide.

VII.     Overall Government Performance (covering both quality at entry and
quality of supervision)

26.     Throughout the implementation of the project the Government has provided
political leadership and guidance (CIREP, COREP and Ministries) and has expressed
its commitment to the Reform by encouraging the private sector to participate at various
levels. In addition, the Government approved a number of instruments for the TVET
system including the TVET Law which was then approved by the Parliament. The
main features of the Law are: (i) the creation of the National TVET Authority with
the participation of the private sector in the Management Board (ii) the creation of
National Training Fund with contributions from Companies though a training levy and
(III) the provision of a decentralized management system of the institutions granting
them with greater autonomy and opening up participation of different stakeholders at
the school management boards. Also the allocation of resources to TVET through
increased budget and direct support to training institutions, deployment o f trained
teachers, rehabilitation and equipment of selected institutions contributed for significant
improvement in learning conditions which permitted a growing number of institutions
to embrace the reform with the minimum acceptable conditions. Recently the
Government conducted the National Meeting of Director of TVET institutions
(ENDET) and have reiterated the importance of the reform. The meeting was also used
to capture challenges in implementation and agree on the way forward.

VIII. Overall World Bank Performance (covering both quality at entry and
quality of supervision)

27.     The Bank was instrumental for the successful implementation of the Project,
particularly through its continuous support mechanisms, which included the supervision
missions that were carried out during the period of implementation. Rather than being
mere supervision missions the Bank missions turned to be an effective supporting
mechanism to ensure the achievement of the project goals and indicators. These missions
were undertaken in collaboration with the Government and other cooperating partners
interested in the TVET Reform in order to create a good platform for collaboration and
sharing of efforts to ensure successful project implementation.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


1.      The comments received by the Royal Dutch Embassy in Mozambique are included
directly below. The formal letter received from the Royal Dutch Embassy has been
archived in WB docs.

2.     Thank you for sending us the draft implementation completion and result report
(ICR) of the Technical and Vocational Education (TVET) Project in Mozambique. The
Netherlands has contributed to the project via a trust fund, for a period of 5 years and for
an amount of 6.57 million USD.

3.      Considering the results presented in the ICR, we conclude that the program to
support the reform of the TVET sector in Mozambique has been very successful, overall,
even though delays took place during the process and even though hiccups occurred on the
way. The involvement of a number of relevant stakeholders, in particular the private sector
and organizations with professionals, in designing competency based curricula in various
fields, has been relevant. The ICR shows that relevance of the training delivered through
TVET institutions has increased, as expressed by the fact that graduates find jobs more
easily and given the fact that employers in general are satisfied with the competencies that
graduates have shown on the job. Inclusion of more practice oriented methodologies in
TVET institutions has also proven to be successful.

4.      Although our contribution was modest in funding, we feel that it was still useful,
as our funding contributed to designing ‘professional profiles’ and to the development of
qualification standards. We were also involved in the TVET policy development dialogues
and we hope that this also contributed to the success of the program.

5.     We trust that the Ministry of Science and Technology, Higher Education and
Technical Training (MCTESTP) will succeed in sustaining the positive results and that the
Ministry will ensure sufficient and continued teaching/training capacity within the system
in order for the TVET system to become a solid robust system that will serve economic
development in Mozambique. Furthermore, we hope that the relationship between the
TVET sector and the private sector will be strengthened so as to ensure continued
involvement of the private sector in maintaining quality and relevance for the TVET sector.

6.     Last but not least, we would like to commend the professional support that was
provided by the World Bank office in Maputo and by the various World Bank TVET
experts that have helped making the program successful.
