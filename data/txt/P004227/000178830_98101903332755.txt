MALAYSIA
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND TELECCMMTNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CCNCLUSIONS
i.         The Government of Malaysia has asked for a Bank loan to help finance
the expansion of its teleconaunications services under the Second Malaysia Plan
(1971-75). A loan of US$18.7 million equivalent is proposed. The Telecommunica-
tions Department (TDM) of the Ministry of Wbrks, Posts and Teleccmmunications,
which is responsible for all public telecommunications services in Malaysia would
carry out the project.
ii.        The Second Malaysia Plan includes an extensive program to enlarge and
improve telecommunications, the cost of which, including ongoing works brought
forward from the First Malaysia Plan, will be equivalent to US$115.9 million.
The new schemes in the Second Plan constitute the Project which is appraised
in this report. The estimated cost of the Project is equivalent to US$94.o million,
of which US$47.3 million would be in foreign exchange.
iii.       The Project will improve and extend Malaysia's local and long distance
telephone and telex services, and provide for minor additions to the international
services.  In all, some 80,000 additional subscriber lines will be provided to the
104,000 lines existing at the end of 1970 and a further 20,000 lines being added
under ongoing works.
iv.        Malaysia is a widely-spread country where underdeveloped transport
facilities enhance the importance of telecommunications. Long distance telephone
services account for about a third of the cost of the project, and local services
about a half. The program is technically sound; the estimated costs are reason-
able; the arrangements for execution with the assistance of contractors' install-
ers are satisfactory.
V.         The proposed Bank loan would be used to finance purchase of equipment
by international competitive bidding with a possible application of local pre-
ference for certain items of 15% or customs duties, whichever is lower. Supplies
_       of switching equipment have already been contracted for.  Other purchases will be
subject to international competition; however, in the case of equipment to be
financed bilaterally through suppliers credits or by lines of credit, bidders
will be required to outline the proposed financing facilities; and a margin of
local preference exceeding that allowed under Bank financing may be applied for
items financed by TKM.
vi.        The loan now proposed would be the second for telecommunications in
Malaysia.  The first, 560-MA, for US$4.4 million (equivalent) became effective
in November 1968. After initial delays outside the control of TDM, performance
has been satisfactory.
vii.       TIM is, in its technical operations, a well run and efficient organi-
zation. Its financial organization is in process of being improved; a covenant
in the agreement for Loan 560-MA required that TDM should set up a commercially-
adequate accounting system in order to improve accounting and financial procedures,



- ii -
to be in operation by 1972. Legislation has recently been passed to enable
this to be done, and TDM is in process of introducing the new system. It is
now necessary to ensure that the new system operates efficiently and is used
to maximum advantage. Specific responsibilities for the Financial Department
have been agreed during negotiations and an assurance obtained for adequate
provision of qualified staff for the introduction and operation of the new
arrangements.
viii.      Since TIE had operated only a budgetary cash accounting systeA,
notional accounts have been prepared. These indicate that TDM will be able to
generate internally about 58% of the funds needed to meet the cost of the
program after payment of surplus funds to Government, and that the rate of
return for its operations in 1970 was 10.7%; a corresponding return of 12.7%
is estimated for 1975. The internal financial return of the Project is assesed
at 15%.                                                                                 9
ix.        The Project is suitable for a loan of US$18.7 million for a period
of 20 years including a grace period of five years.

APPRAISAL QF-'THE SECOND TELECCMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Malaysia has asked the Bank to help finance
its program for the expansion and improvement of telecommunications
included in the Second Malaysia Plan (1971-75). The Project, which
will cost M$282 million (US$94.0 million), including a foreign exchange
cost of ML$142 million (US$47.3 million), will be carried out by the
Telecommunications Department of Malaysia (TDM) and will improve and
extend local and long-distance telephone and telex services and provide
for minor additions to international services. In all about 80,000
additional subscribers' lines will be connected. At the end of 1970 there
were 104,000 subscribers'lines in service, a further 20,000 lines are in
course of being provided under ongoing works so the size of the local network
will approximately be doubled during the plan period. A Bank loan of US$18.7
million equivalent is proposed.
1.02      The proposed loan would be the second for telecommunications in
Malaysia. The first loan - Loan 560-MA - for M$13.2 million (US$4.4 million)
was signed in August 1968 and became effective in November 1968. The present
closing date is December 1971. After initial delays outside the control of
TAM, performance has been satisfactory and completion of the ongoing works
is expected by early in 1972.
1.03      This report is based on information provided by the Economic
Planning Unit of the Malaysian Prime Minister's office (EPU) and TDM, and
on the findings of an appraisal by a mission composed of Messrs. C. R. Dickenson,
S. Alber-Glanstaetten and H. Hillebrenner which visited Malaysia in December
1970. Mr. Dickenson visited Malaysia again in February 1971 to review the
Project following a Government decision to reduce the overall telecommunications
development program by about 5%.



2. THE ECONOMY AND THE SECTOR
The Econom;y
2.01      Malaysia is divided grographically between the more developed and
populated peninsula of West Malaysia, having an area of 50,7bo sq mi, and the
less developed and less populated regions of East Malaysia with an area of
77,730 sq mi cousisting of Sabah and Sarawak. West Malaysia is separated
from East Malaysia by a sea crossing of about 500 miles. Malaysia's total
population in mid 1970 was about 11 million. The population during the
period 1966-1970 grew at a rate of 2.7 per annum.
2.02      The GNP per capita in 1970 was about US$336. Its growth in real
terms was 2% per annum from l965 to 1970. Retail price indices are available
only for West Malaysia; they indicate extremely stable conditions with a
weighted index of 108 in mid 1970 as against 100 for the base year 1959.
2.03      Agriculture constituted about 29% of GDP (at current factor costs)
in 1969 and is largely concerned with the production of rubber. Manufactur-
ing and construction contributed about 16%, and the wholesale and retail
trade about 15%. Mining, mainly tin from West Malaysia, constituted about
6% of GDP. Exports are mainly rubber, tin and timber (41%, 20% and 14%
respectively in 1970). The development of industry is being actively
encouraged at a number of locations in East and West Malaysia by means of
tax credits and other incentives.
2.04      The planned development of industry and natural resources and the
growing needs of commerce and administration require the support of a well
developed infrastructure. Adequate telecommunication facilities are an
essential part of this infrastructure, particularly when related to the
geographic separation of East and West Malaysia, the distances between the
main centers of production and the limited availability of surface and air
communications to many locations.
The Sector
2.05      All telecommunication matters in Malaysia fall within the portfolio
of the Minister of Works, Posts and Telecommunications. TDM, as a department
of the Ministry, is responsible for the provision and operation of the local,
long-distance and international public telephone, telegraph and telex
services. In addition, it provides Government departments, local authorities,
estates and other organizations with fixed and mobile radio-communications
and certain special services (fire alarms, railway control, etc.). It also
leases facilities to the Ministry of Information for the relay of television
and radio programs, and maintains their TV and broadcasting transmitters on
a cost plus basis. Annex 1 gives details of these activities and shows
diagrammatically TDM's relationship with the Ministries and other Departments
of Government. The organization of TDM is discussed in paragraphs 6.02 and
6.03.
2.06      TDM asaumed responsibility for development of telecommunications in
East Malaysia, in July 1967 at which time facilities in that part of the
country were very limited and service fell short, both in extent and quality,
of that which had been provided in West Malaysia.



2.07      TDM's first development plan (1966-70) for the expansion of tele-
communications facilities throughout Malaysia, was estimated to cost M$206
million (US9$68.7 million). This plan, partly financed by the first Bank loan,
was designed to satisfy the outstanding demand for local telephone and telex
facilities and improve and extend long-distance and international facilities.
Delay in making the necessary financing arrangements, including obtaining
approval of the first Bank loan, delayed commencement of major project items
by about two years and, despite very good progress made by TDM in the later
stages of the program, has resulted in a shortfall in achievement and a carry
forward of expenditure (para. 4.02).
2.08      There is a continuing demand for extension of telecommunication
facilities and for the further raising of standards of service in East Malaysia.
Industry, agriculture and administration are all handicapped by the present
shortages and inadequacy of the telecommunications services.



- 4 -
3. EXISTING FACILITIES
3.01      In West Malaysia service standards are generally good, but with
some overloading of telephone facilities during business hours. In East
Malaysia a reasonable standard of service has been provided at the main
centers, but service elsewhere is very limited and those long distance
facilities which have been provided are generally overloaded and in many
cases do not meet accepted transmission standards.
3.02      The development of telecommunication services in West Malaysia
has been closely related to economic and administrative needs, with a con-
centration of plant and installations on the western side of the peninsula
where the main cities and also about 80% of the population and 90% of the
industrial, mining and trading activities are located. In East Malaysia
initial development has been largely concentrated in the ports and coastal
towns which are the main centers of population, trade and administration.
There is considerable outstanding demand for telephone connections in both          0
parts of Malaysia.
3.03      The telephone density for Malaysia in 1970 was 1.52 per 100
people. Annex 2 compares telephones per 100 people and GNP per capita for
a number of Asian countries at the latest dates for which comprehensive
figures are available. These figures indicate that the state of development
reached is about average compared with other Asian countries. Basic data
on the network are given in Annex 3.
Local Telephone Facilities
3.04      Automatic telephone exchanges serve all the main centers of
population. Some manually operated exchanges still exist in the smaller
towns and rural areas, but represent only 6% of the total installed capacity.
At the end of 1970, TDM had a total of 384 telephone exchanges in service
with a capacity of about 131,000 lines and with 103,800 subscribers exchange
lines in service. The total number of telephone stations in service was
178,600. Automatic exchanges in both East and West Malaysia are generally
well installed, in good condition and adequately maintained. Plant fills
for both exchange equipment and primary cables (from 70% to 80%) are
satisfactory.
3.05      Distribution is normally by underground cable in the larger towns
and by aerial cable and open wire line elsewhere. Local line plant is
generally adequately constructed and maintained in good condition. Remote
areas have been provided with subscribers' radio telephone services with
about 1,800 subscribers' stations obtaining service through approximately
60 master centers.
Long Distance Facilities
3.06      In West Malaysia, large-capacity microwave systems link the principal
towns along the West Coast, and link Kuala Lumpur with Kuantan on the East
Coast, with small-capacity radio systems linking the main network with the
less important population centers. Telephone subscribers' trunk dialing (STD)
has been provided on the main traffic routes during recent years. Some 80% of



the subscribers now have access to SrD facilities and about 90% of the
long distance telephone traffic is handled by subscribers' dialing.
3.07      In East Malaysia, interurban circuits are provided by means of
HF and VHF radio systems with some overhead lines and overhead carrier
systems along the West coast of Sabah. Microwave systems, partly financed
by the first Bank loan, will considerably strengthen the East Malaysian
network from late 1971 onwards.
3.08      Service between West Malaysia and Sabah is via Singapore and the
SEACOM cable to Kota Kinabalu; service to Sarawak is via a recently commission-
ed VHF tropospheric scatter system between Pulai (Johore Bahru) in West
Malaysia and Kuching in Sarawak.
3.09      There were 3,752 long distance circuits totalling 223,700 circuit
miles working at the end of 1970. The principal routes are shown on the
.       maps.
Telegraph and Telex
3.10      At the end of 1970, 31 main public telegraph offices and about
270 minor collecting and distributing offices existed in Malaysia. Teleprinter
service is provided between the main offices and to certain of the minor
offices in urban areas; elsewhere telegrams are mainly telephoned by the
operators. Some manual Morse circuits exist in East Malaysia.
3.11      Telex facilities are available in Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh and Penang
in West Malaysia and Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan and Kuching in East Malaysia.
All six exchanges, to which 182 subscribers were connected at the end of
1970, operate on a nanual basis. The present traffic-handling capacity
limits connection of additional subscribers at most exchanges. However,
new automatic exchanges will be brought into service in 1972 as part of
the first development plan.
International Facilities
3.12      West Malaysia has available two high quality international tele-
communications routes, the first via the Kuala Lunpur-Singapore microwave
system connecting into the SEACOM cable at Singapore, and the second via a
satellite ground station at Kuantan on the east side of the peninsula.
Some 29 telephone, 27 telex and 11 telegraph circuits are at present working
through these facilities. Operator-dialing is available to a number of
overseas countries. There are VHF radio links of rather poor quality to
Thailand and Indonesia (Sumatra) and HF radio schedules are operated with a
number of adjoining Asian countries.

The Project, together with the ongoing works brought forward from the
First Plan and estimated to cost M$66 million (US$21.9 million) constitutes
Malaysia's total 1971-75 telecommnications program. The total cost of the
program is estimated at M$348 million (US$115.9 million).
Contingencies
J4.03      TDM has made no specific provisions for physical contingencies or for
unexpected changes in demand. The system is well established and no technical
difficulties are anticipated; the project consists of a number of small works
with an established overall growth pattern, any increase in demand in specific
areas will in all probability be offset by reductions in others.
4.04       In preparing its cost estimates TDM has provided for inbuilt price
contingencies on the following basis.  The cost estimates for switching equip-
ment are based on two contracts entered into in 1967 with Messrs. L. M. Ericsson
Ltd., the first covering supplies from overseas and the second, to operate from
1972 onwards, from a local assembly plant. Firm prices on a unit cost basis
are known through 1972; for the three following years increases in wage and
material costs are expected to amount to about 10%. Estimates for all other
items have been based on unit costs ruling in recent international tenders for
supply of equivalent equipment with a price contingency provision of 5% through
1975 which TDM4 considers adequate since the estimates are based on purchases made
when copper prices were relatively high. In addition teleccmmunications equipment
prices have recently shown a downward trend resulting from improved production
techniques. Local installation and building costs are based on actual experience,
adjusted for a recent wage increase and with a further price contingency provision
of 5% for possible future cost increases through 1975.  Given the history of rela-
tive price stability, the cost estimates including contingency provisions are
reasonable.
Items Proposed for Bank Financing
4.05       The estimated foreign currency costs of goods to be imported for
the project is M$142 million (US.$47.3 million).  TDM has already entered into
contracts for switching equipment for M$31 million (see para 4.04) and for other
items (M$23 million) using bilateral aid.  TI)I would use M$l million available
from the first Bank loan and proposes to procure microwave equipment (M$31
million) using bilateral or supplier financing. The proposed loan would provide
the balance of M$56 million (US$18.4 million) for the items shown below.

Procurement
4.o6       All equipment required for the Project, whether financed by the Bank
or not, has been or will be procured by international bidding. The telephone
exchange switching equipment financed from TIM's own resources will be purchased
under the contracts with Messrs. L. M. Ericsson (para 4.04). These were signed
after full international competitive bidding. Domestic manufacture is, at the
moment, restricted to wire, small cables, locally assembled vehicles and certain
minor plant fittings and items. TIK has indicated that there is a possibility of
domestic manufacture being extended to include telephone instruments and larger
sized telephone cables to be financed under the proposed Bank loan. Depending
upon the amount of work to be carried out in Malaysia, local manufacturers would
be allowed a margin of preference on the c.i.f. landed price of 15%, or customs
duties, whichever is lower.  TDM, in making purchases with its own funds,
will provide for a domestic preference of 10% on the c.i.f. value of imported goods,
plus customs duties, equivalent to about 35% over c.i.f. costs.  Bidders for the
main microwave systems not financed by Bank funds mill be asked to provide finan-
cing facilities or set out a basis for purchase under existing lines of credit.
Disbursements
4.07       The proposed loan would be disbursed against c.i.f. costs of imported
equipment and material, the foreign currency costs of installers' aervices and
of training, and in the event of purchase from local manufacturers against the
total costs of such goods which is not likely to exceed K$8 million (US$2.7
million) including a local component of M$3 million (US$1.0 million). Estimated
quarterly disbursements are shown in Annex 7. As the Project is part of an
ongoing investment program and consists of many items, it is proposed that any
unused balance should, after consultation with the Bank, be applied to the purchase
of additional items of the same types as those included in the Project.

Execution of the Project
4.o8       TIN, who will be assisted by Contractors' installers, has the planning,
engineering and supervisory capacity to carry out the program, and to operate
the network after installation. Training at the Telecommunications Training
Center or under equipment svpply contracts should be adequate to provide for
installation and subsequent maintonance and operation.
Future Develcnent
4.09       The Bank wi   first be consulted if it should be considered necessary
for TIN during the period of ececution of the project to undertake any development
works not required for the Project in any one fiscal year exceeding US$1 million
or 5% of preceding year's capital expenditures, whichever is greater. It will,
however, be necessary in 1974-75 to enter into ooaituaents for the 1976-80 prograuo.
lance in preparing the financing plan (para. 7.20) a suitable allowance has been
made.

5.  JU3TIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
5.01      In consequence of the delay in completing the Kirst llanl, andt partly
because of increases in demand over earlier forecasts, the telephone subscribers'
waiting list is now about 10,4.0  in WTest Malaysia and 3,200 in  Mast Malaysia.
This is about 13% of the existing nuaber of subscribers anld eqivaLo L an
average waiting period for service of sixteen months.  There is also a. need
to provide for the growth of long distance traffic iyI both West aond E1'a.;t Malaysia
and improve the somewhat rudimentary loIng distance services ex.isting,f in East
Malaysia.  The project is designed to meet these requirements on the basis of
established priorities and within the framework of available resilrces.  It is
well balanced both in relation to its components, its emphasi; on thc imirprovement
of long distance services in Elast Malaysia, and its terri.torial provisions.
Demand for Local Service
5.02      The growth in telephone lines in service since the formation of
Malaysia in 1963 has been 9.Lb% per annum.  But dernand, as reflected by the              9
increases in the waiting list,has grown at about 11.2% per annum. The waiting
l-st is now so large that many potential subscribers are discouraged fro,m
applying for service under the present conditions.
5.03      For planning purposes demand growth has been projected to continue at
11.2% per annun on a 1970 base of 118,000 subscribers (104,000 actual plus 14,000
applicants). On this basis the total demand at the end of 1975 would be 200,000
lines, requiring 96,000 additional lines to be put in service in this period.
About 20,000 additional lines are provided for under carried forward items from
the First Plan. The project would provide an increase of about 80,000 lines and
thus just provides for new demand plus the present waiting list.
Demand for Long Distance Service
5.o4      Following the introduction of STD a fairly major increase in long
distance traffic is to be expected. The overall rate of growth over the last
five years, including this initial STD stimulus, has been slightly over 20% per
annum or about twice the rate of growth of subscribers' lines.  Disregarding
this initial increase,traffic in Wbst Malaysia has been increasing by 15.5%
per annum. TDM's expansion plans are based on a continued rate of growth of
15.5%.
5.05      In East Malaysia, projections of past growth cannot be used because of
the poor quality of the service and the limited facilities available. The present
daily calling rates for subscribers are about a tenth of those for similar parts
of West Malaysia. Nlth the provision of improved and extended facilities, TIN4
has based initial circuit requirements on a calling rate of about one third of
that in similar parts of West Malaysia, with a subsequent growth of 15.5% per
annum.



- 11 -
Demand for International Service
5.o6      Following the initial increase wuiich took place when improved
facilities were provided via the SEACOM submarine cable and the satellite
ground station, the recent growth of international telephone traffic has
been at a rate of 15% per annum, with telex and telegraph traffic increasing
at 29% and 3.5% per annum respectively. The SEACOM cable and the ground
station have adequate system capacity for the foreseeable future and the
Project includes additional multiplexing and switching facilities to meet
the growth in traffic. The facilities proposed for services to adjoining
countries are justified by the traffic between Malaysia and the countries
in question.
The Least-Cost Solution
5.07      The design of the existing local and long distance network facilities
is based on earlier decisions to minimize network expansion costs.  In 1967,
after international bidding, TDM standardized the use of a crossbar switching
system. Main long-distance routes were established using microwave equipment
after comparing costs on a present value basis of alternative schemes. The
extensions to the switching and long distance network now proposed flow
logically from these earlier decisions, and represent the least-cost solution.
The remaining major investment is in the local distribution network. Here
development is a continuous process, where the design, dimensioning and
programming of installations are done by planning engineers who follow
practices established to ensure the least cost on a present-value basis.
Internal Financial Rate of Return and Economic Benefits
5.08      The internal financial rate of return for the Project is estimated
at about 15% (see Annex 8). This return almost certainly underestimates the
full benefits to users, and thus the economic benefits of the project, in
view of the high level of use of the telecommunications facilities for
business purposes as explained in the following paragraph.
5.09      Since TDM cannot meet the total demand for service, telephones are
alloted through a system of priorities with preference given to essential
services, government, industry and commerce. In consequence, about 70% of
telephone subscribers in Malaysia are in the business/administrative category.
The concentration of long-distance traffic during business hours also indicates
very high business usage. This pattern is likely to be maintained until such
time as the waiting list is eliminated.

6.  TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT OF MALAYSIA
6.01      The Borrower would be the Government of Malaysia.  The Telecommuni-
cations Department (TDM) of the Ministry of Works, Posts and Telecommunications
which operates all public telecommunications services in Malaysia, would
carry out the project.
Organization
6.02      TD14's present organization chart is shown in Annex 9.  The Director
General is assisted by his Deputy in the day-to-day running of TDM. There
are seven separate departments with functional responsibilities to the
Director General. The engineering and operational sections of TDM are well
run and efficient. Certain deficiencies in financial management were recog-
nized at the time of the last appraisal, and it was agreed that improved
arrangements would be introduced. Legislation making provisions for financial ^
management, setting up a telecommunications fund and introducing a commercial V
accounting system, was approved in February 1971. The proposals for imp2 .ment-
ing these arrangements are discussed in Chapter 7 of this report.
6.03      Because of the growth in size of its services, and to meet its
additional responsibilities, TDM has recognized the need to further improve
its organization, particularly in the coordination of its operational and
planning activities, and has engaged a Swedish firm of telecommunications
consultants financed under the first Bank loan. The Consultants report was
expected to be available in May   1971; the Bank will be supplied with a copy
and informed by TDM regarding any implementing action it proposes to take.
Staff
6.o4      TDM had about 12,300 employees at the end of 1970 who were responsi-
ble for the construction, maintenance and operation of the telephone network,
the telex and telegraph networks, and the various services provided for
other Departments. In the telephone branch (including installation staff)
there are about 52 staff per 1,000 telephones, which is reasonable at this
stage of development of the network.  The annual growth of staff during
1971-75, including trainees, is estimated at 4.5% compared with estimated
telephone provisions of 11.5% per annum and long distance network growth of
15.5% per annum. This will result in a greatly improved staff ratio of
38 per 1,000 telephones by the end of 1975.
6.o5      During the period of the First Malavsia Plan TDM has replaced the
majority of its expatriate staff with suitably qualified Malaysian staff.
Whilst the staffing position in Till is adequate to maintain the services,
there are a number of unfilled positions in the establishment. The shortage
has been caused partly by some of the senior staff leaving TLM to take up
better paid jobs in industryj and partly because of new Government regulations
requiring staff to be proficient in the Malay language. This requirement
has presented problems to Malaysians whose mother tongue is not Malay. There
has also been delay by the Public Service Commission (PSC) - it sometimes
takes over a year to fill vacant posts - even though the supply of university
graduates and the output from secondary schools is adequate. Recruitment



- 13 -
procedures have been examined by the Economic Planning and Development
Administration Units of the Prime Ministers's Office with a view to speeding
up recruitment. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the
above cause of delay had now been eliminated and that TDM could now fill
vacant posts at once and thereafter to submit the matter to PSC for formal
approval.
Training
6.06      TDM operates a Telecommunications Training Center (TTC) with
residential facilities in Kuala Lumpur, and regional training schools in
Kuching and Kota Kinabalu. The Center is very well equipped and well
run and the training facilities are adequate to meet TDM's requirements
for the project period. The TTC provides initial and vocational training
for engineering and operational personnel. The regional schools concentrate
on lower-level vocational training.  The TTC was set up as a joint United
Nations-Government venture, with an initial staff of eight ITU/UNDP experts/
instructors. All experts other than an adviser have now been withdrawn, and
the center is operating with a Malaysian principal and instructors. The
Center's maximum capacity is 300 students; the existing hostel capacity is
150, which will shortly be extended to 225. Courses are run for engineers,
(graduates) technicians and operators. About 60% of training is of new
recruits and 40% is in service and refresher training.

7. FINANCES
Summary of TDM's Finances
7.01      Since TDM's reorganization in 1966, its financial performance
has been satisfactory. With the introduction of an effective system of
commercial accounting and financial management as from January 1, 1971,
TDM is expected to further strengthen its financial position. Future
earnings should cuntinue to be satisfactory and cash generation throughout
the construction period 1971-75 will be ample.
Reorganization of Financial Systems
7.02      Under Loan 560-MA it was agreed that the Government would exempt
TDM from the Government system of cash accounting and establish by
December 31, 1972 an effective system of commercial accounting and financial
management. Following this agreement, TDM obtained the services of experts
from the Australian Post Office who designed a system of accrual accounting         0
with associated budgetary, financial and management information systems.
This new system is acceptable to the Bank.
7.03      Legislation authorizing the new system came into force in February
1971 (para. 6.02). TDM's financial transactions will now be processed in
accordance with commercial principles and practices through a separate
Telecommunications Fund which will be operated and controlled by the Director
General of Telecommunications. The legislation would not only provide
for important improvements in financial procedures, but also will give TDM
a considerably increased financial autonomy, although decisions of the
Director General would remain subject to the overall authority vested in
the Minister of Works, Posts and Telecommunications and the Minister of
Finance.
7.o0      In order to further strengthen TDM's financial systems reorganiza-
tion, it is important that the duties and responsibilities of the Director
in charge of financial matters be more precisely defined. Proposed duties
and responsibilities have therefore been drawn up and are set out in
Annex 10; these were agreed to during negotiations.
7.05      TDM is in the process of introducing the commercial system of
accounts. At least one expert from the Australian Post Office will continue
to assist and advise TDMIls accounting staff in implementing the new system
until the work has been completed.  But it will also be necessary for TDM
to employ an adequate number of qualified accountants to make the system
effective by December 31, 1972.  During negotiations assurances were obtained
that every effort would be made to secure such staff if necessary on a
contractual basis.
7.06      TDM's records of asset values were not a part of their previous
accounting system, nor have they been reconciled with expenditure each year.
Therefore, a valuation of assets in accordance with commercial principles
will be necessary before incorporating them in the new commercial accounts.
Practical methods for the valuation of TM4's assets have already been outlined
by consultants. By following these methods, TDM should be in a position to
have their assets properly valued before the end of fiscal year 1971. Assurances
to this effect were obtained during negotiations.



- 1 -
7.07      The present stores accounting system is well conceived and could
easily be fitted into the new commercial system of accounts. The revenue
accounting process is fully computerized and operates satisfactorily.
Audit
7.08      Under the new legislation (paras. 6.02 and 7.03), TDM will
continue to have its accounts audited annually by the Government Auditor
General. In the past, such auditing has taken the form of verification
of receipts and payments and was not based on commercial principles. Such
an audit is deficient in many respects. Therefore, future audits by the
Auditor General should either follow full commercial principles, or in-
dependent auditors, acceptable to the Bank should be appointed to do the
audit. TDM should also transmit to the Bank certified copies of the
audited financial statements together with a certified copy of the Auditor
General's or the independent auditors report not later than  siX months
after the close of each financial year, commencing in 1973.   Assurances
to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
Tariffs
7.09      The present tariffs are adequate to provide a satisfactory rate
of return and to finance a considerable portion of the capital costs of
expansion (para. 7.20). A summary of the basic tariffs is given in Annex 11.
Some special features are discussed below.
7.10      Telephone rentals for both business and residential subscribers
vary in West and East Malaysia and have been maintained at a relatively
high level in West Malaysia as compared with neighbouring countries.   East
Malaysian tariffs are generally lower. However, they will be adjusted to
the West Malaysian level when service conditions become comparable.
7.11      New subscribers are required to pay deposits which are refunded
only upon termination of service, ranging from M$75 (residential connections)
to M$200-500 (business connections). These charges are high, but many other
countries have adopted similar measures.
7.12      Tariffs for domestic services are fixed by regulations approved
by the Minister of Works, Posteand Telecommunications.  These regulations
must be placed before Parliament and are subject to automatic ratification
unless a resolution cancelling them is passed at the next session. Inter-
national tariffs are agreed directly between TDM and the other administra-
tions concerned.
Past Financial Performance
7.13      Although TDM has no commercial accounts yet, the available
financial data are sufficiently reliable to permit the following analysis
of TDM's operations on the basis of pro forma commercial presentations of
the past four years and five-years forecast of financial operations and
position of TDM including income statements (Annex 12), cash flow state-
ments (Annex 13; and balance sheets (Annex 14). Notes and assumptions used
for preparing these statements are given in Annex 15

7.14      A siumnary of TDM's past operating results (Annex 12, page 4) is
given below.

Rate of return                   10.5%   10.8%   9.6%    10.7%
During the period, revenues increased at an annual rate of about 10%;
expenses by 8% and operating ratios were acceptable.  Rates of return wore
well above the 8% which Loan 560-MA requires.
7.15      During 1967-70, internally generated funds (net of debt service)         0
provided 79% of capital construction cost plus increase in working capital;
19% was met by loans and 2% by Government funds. The high proportion of
self-financing of expansion is due to relatively high tariffs and the low
amounts of debt service.

7.17      No cash is shown in the above pro forma balance sheet because
TDM did not control its funds during the period. The ratio of current
assets to current liabilities was about 2:1, which is conservative.
Accounts receivable were about two months billings, which is acceptable.
7.18      TDM's notional equity is the balancing figure between the sum
of fixed plus current assets and the sum of long-term debt plus current
liabilities, and represents the Government's net investment in TDM.
7.19      Long-term debt consisted mostly of suppliers' credits incurred
by Government on TDM's behalf. Details are given in Annex 16. In order
to present TDM's finances on a commercial basis it has been assumed that
TDM will be responsible for all such debt. On this assumption, TDM's
debt/equity ratio was 11/89 as at December 31, 1970.
Financing Plan
7.20      The capital investment and additional capital requirements for
tihe five-year period 1971-75 and the sources from which they would be
met are summarized below. Internal cash generation (net of debt service
and payments to Government) would contribute about 58% of total require-
ments. Forecast statements of sources and application of funds are given
in Annex 13.

7.21      Substantial funds in excess of TDM's requirements would be
generated during the program. The new legislation provides that all surplus
funds be paid into the Government's Consolidated Revenue Account but does
not define a specific basis for these transfers. During negotiations
assurances were obtained, that although no procedure has been set forth in
the legislation, the Government would preserve the financial viability of
TDM and make adequate provisions for TDM's funding when considering the
transfer of anv surplus to Government.
7.22      Borrowings would contribute 31% of total requirements.  The
proposed Bank loan of M$56.2 million (US$18.7 million) would be for a
period of 20 years including a five-year grace period.  For the financial
projections an interest rate of 7-1/4% has been assumed.
7.23      TDM expects to arrange M$25.4 million (US$8.5 million) by way of
suppliers' credits towards the cost of microwave provisions. M$13.3 million
(US$4.4 million) would be incurred in 1971 and M$12.1 million (US$h.O million)
in 1973. For these credits, the forecast assumes repayment over eight years
after a two-year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-1/2%.
7.24      M$42.2 million would come from subscribers' deposits.  Deposits
have been charged by TDM since 1967 but paid into a Government Trust Account
whose closing balance was M$12.6 million on December 31, 1970. Under the
new legislation TDM would not only be credited with this amount and be
allowed to retain all future deposits but also would use all deposit funds
for financing capital works. This was confirmed during negotiations.
Future Operating Results
7.25      Forecast statements are shown in Annex 12, page 4.  Notes and
assumptions as to these forecasts are shown in Annex 15. The following is
a summary of TDM's expected operating results during the period 1971-75:
1971    1972    1973    1974    1975
(in millions of-WY
Total operating revenues      117.3   131.8   147.9   165.7   185.1
Total operating expenses       85.8    95.2   105.1   115.3   125.8
Net income             31.5    36.6    h2.8    50.4    59.3
Operating ratio                73      72       71      70       68
Rate of return                10.1%   10.0%   10.4%   11.3%   12.7%
7.26      Forecast revenues are based on existing tariffs.  Revenues would
increase annually by about 14% and expenses by about 12%, resulting in the
steady improvement of the operating ratios from 73 in 1971 to 68 in 1975.
These prospects are satisfactory.



- 19 -
7.27      Under Loan 560-HA., TDM is required to have a return of 8% per
year; it has exceeded this target (para. 7.14). To ensure that TDM
will continue to generate the funds required for the program, the same
rate covenant is proposed for the new loan. This was agreed during
negotiations.
Future Financial Position
7.28      TDM's financial position is expected to remain satisfactory
throughout the program. Net plant in service would increase from
M$253.3 million on January 1, 1971 to M$h90.8 million by the end of
1975, an increase of about 94%. Even after allowing for substantial
payments to Government (para. 7.21), retained earnings would increase
equity from M$265.5 million at January 1, 1971, to M$371.1 million at the
end of 1975, an increase of about 40%. The ratio of long-term debt to
equity would range between 18/82 in 1971 and 27/73 in 1975. These ratios
do not include subscribers' deposits which do not constitute long-term debt.
7.29      Debt service coverage by internal cash generation would range
between 11.7 times in 1971 and 6.3 times in 1975. This would be more than
adequate, and would provide a substantial margin for further borrDwings.

8.  AGREEMENTS, ASSURANCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points which are embodied in the draft loan agreement:
(a) Auditing will follow conmercial lines and the audit
report together with the audited financial stateme nts
will be sent to the Bank not later than six months
after the close of each financial year, beginning with
1973 (para. 7.08);
(b)  telecommunication tariffs of TDM will be maintained to
provide revenue sufficient to produce an annual rate of
return of not less than 8% on the value of TDM's net
fixed assets (para. 7.27);
(c)  the Bank will be consulted before TDM undertakes any                    9
capital expenditure during the project period and not
required for the project, if such expenditure exceeds
an amount of US$1 million or 5% of the aggregate amount
of all TDM's capital expenditure made during the preceding
fiscal year, whichever amount is greater (para. 4.09).
8.02      In addition the Bank received assurances that:
(a) Staff recruitment procedures are being improved (para. 6.05);
(b) the proposed duties of the Director dealing with financial
matters as set out in Annex 10 are acceptable (para. 7.0h);
(c) sufficient qualified staff will be made available to ensure
effective operation of the commercial accounting system
by December 1972 (para. 7.05);
(d) an evaluation of the assets will be carried out before
incorporation in the commercial accounts (para. 7.06);                  4
(e)  payments to Government will not affect TDM's financial
viability (para. 7.21);
(f) subscribers' deposits will be made available to TDM and
used for financing local capital expenditures for the
development program (para. 7.24).
8.03      The propose(d project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$18.7 million for a period of 20 years including a grace period of
five years.

Internal Financial Rate of Return
1.  Table 1 presents the cost ancd benefit streams for the proposed investment
for 20 years, the assumied life of the project.  The internal financial rate
of return is the equalizing discount rate which equalizes the cost and
benefit streams.
2.  In setting up -the cost and benefit streams the following assurmptions were
made as to:
Project Period:  The 20 year project period is derived from an assumed
composite depreciation rate of :5% used in the finanicial statements.
Construction Costs:  This cost stream is the cost of the project.excluding
any duties or taxes.  Construction costs are not expected to va.ry dlue to
the fact that the system is well established, the proposals are well
designed and related to stable demand trends and prices for equipment are
extremely stable.
Operating Costs and Revenues: Income statement data was adjusted to reflect
costs and revenues attributable to the project. Operating costs are net of
depreciation.  There is no sales tax applied in Malaysia..
Residual value of plant in 1990: Since exchanges, line network, and buildings
have service lives longer than the assumed project life, a residual financial
value for the,e items was included at the end of the period.
3.  'The calculation in terms of constant prices results in an internal financial
rate of return of 15%.
11.  2ensitivity tests on the operating cost and revenues streamsshowed the follow-
ingfe results:
1)  An increase in the subscribers' growth rate by 1/5              liate of iteturn
of forecast rate of growth
)  A decrease in the subscribers' growth rate by 1/5
of' forecast rate of growth                                          13.5%
Uince revenues were estimated rather conservatively the actual ;internal financial
rate of' return is likely to be in the range of 15-1.6%.

ANNEX 15

MALAYSIA
DEPARTMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
At the time of the Bank's appraisal TDM was still keeping its
accounts on a cash basis.  In order to allow for a meaningful analysis
of TDM's finances, the financial statements for this report were prepared
as pro forma commercial presentations.
A. Notional Income Statements (Annex 12)
1.    Due to different rates and operating conditions in the three
regions of Malaysia, separate income statements were prepared
for West Malaysia (Annex 12, page 1), Sabah (Annex 12, page 2)
and Sarawak (Annex 12, page 3) by making use of TDM's regional
budgetary accounts. The consolidated income statements (Annex 12,
page 4) represent the combination of revenues and expenses in
these regional statements.
2.    Assumptions for revenue projections:
Installation fees - were projected on the basis of new demand
and stations added;
Rentals            - would accrue according to the annual growth
of stations in operation and on the basis
of the annual average yield per station in
the three regions;
Trunk revenues    - would increase in accordance with historical
trends;
Revenues from
international
calls              - are  assumed to grow relatively faster in
East Malaysia but would result in on overall
*                                          annual growth rate of about 25% for Malaysia
as a whole;
Telegraph revenues- are assumed not to exceed an annual growth
rate of 3% in the three regions of Malaysia;
Telex revenues    - are projected to result in an annual growth
rate of about 30% for Malaysia as a whole;
TV-Bearers         - would yield revenues in accordance with a
formula used by TDM and agreeable to the Bank.
3.    Assumptions for expenditure projections:
Salaries           - are assumed to grow in East Malaysia faster
than in West Malaysia. The resultant growth
rate for Malaysia as a whole was assumed to
be in the order of about 10% per annum;
Industrial wages  - are assumed to increase 1/2 less than the
growth of stations;



ANNEX 15
Page 2 of 4 pages
Maintenance and other
operational costs      - are assumed to increase 1/3 less than
the station growth.
4.   "Special expenses" contain items of a capital nature which are
additional to those included under capital construction. It was
assumed that such capital items would average 90% of the assumed
"special expenses", and have accordingly been transferred as
"capital expenditure".
5.  The item "staff pensions, gratuities, housing, etc." represents
expenses which have been borne by Government. Under the
conmercial accounting system such costs would be borne by TDM,
and have been assumed to amount to 30% of salaries and wages.
6.  The item "staff cost to capital" arises because TDM did not
provide for apportioning part of the executive staff salaries
to capital construction. It was assumed that 15% of total
staff cost per annum had to be transferred to capital ex-
penditure and included under capital construction.
B.  Notional Balance Sheets (Annex 14)
1.   The notional balance sheets represent the combination of
financial data of the three regions of Malaysia and reflect,
therefore, the Telecommunications Department's consolidated
financial position.
2.    Fixed Assets - The Telecommunications Department commenced keeping
records of assets in 1958. The records have been maintained but
not as an integral part of the accounting system and not reconcil-
ed with the annual expenditure. The values of gross fixed assets
were compiled for this report as foUows:
(a) In West Malaysia the 1958 valuation of gross plant
has been accepted as revised by the Department in 1970, and
adjustments made for subsequent annual capital expenditure. The
valuation at December 31, 1966, of M$225.6 million was taken as
the base for projecting future gross assets.
(b) In Sabah, the gross value of plant amounting to N$11.9
million at December 31, 1966, was assumed as the accumulated
development expenditure since 1958 and accepted as the base for
projecting future gross assets.
(c) In Sarawak it was assumed that the gross value of
plant amounting to M$16.3 million at the end of 1966 is the
accumulation of the annual development expenditure. This value
was accepted as the basis for the projection of gross assets.



ANNEX 15
Page 3 of h pages
3.   Depreciation - In West Malaysia the accumulated depreciation
was assumed to be 33% of the gross assets as at December 31,
1966. For 1967 and subsequent years a composite rate of
depreciation of 4.5% was assumed. Accumulated depreciation
expressed as a proportion of gross assets at the end of 1966
was assumed to be 25% in Sabah and 30% in Sarawak. Thereafter
a composite rate of depreciation of 5% was applied.
4.   Work in Progress - Work in progress at December 31, 1967 through
1970 has been estimated in accordance with TDM's actual construct-
ion works. Thereafter work in progress has been assumed to equal
35% of the sum total of the work in progress brought forward
plus the gross capital construction for the year.
5.   SEACOM Investment - This item represents TDM's contribution to
the South Asia Management Committee the members of which are
Australia, Great Britain, Canada, Malaysia, New Zealand and
Singapore. The contribution was for the construction cost of
the extension of the Commonwealth Pacific Cable. The construct-
ion commenced in 1961 and TDM's final contribution was made
during 1968.
6.   Cash - No cash balance is shown in the balance sheets 1967
through 1970 because TDM had to pay all cash collections into
the Government's Consolidated Fund during that period. As from
January 1, 1971, cash was assumed to be one month's cash
operating expenses.
7.  Accounts receivable - Based on previous actuals the level of
accounts receivable at the end of each year was assumed to equal
two months billings, excluding rentals which are billed and
payable in advance.
8.   Inventories - The values of inventories at the end of 1970 refer
0                   to actual figures in the unallocated stores accounts.  Thereafter
inventories were increased in accordance with the growth of
fixed assets.
9.   Accounts payable - The amount outstanding at the end of 1970
was based on a calculation of a delay of about three months
after bills are received, until payments are made. During 1971
through 1975 accounts payable have been projected in accordance
with the growth of TrN's fixed assets.
10. Equity - Until December 31, 1970, equity was assumed to be the
balancing figure between the sum of fixed and current assets and
the sum of long-term debt and current liabilities. No retained
earnings were assumed up to the above date because TDM was
required to pay all earnings into the Government's Consolidated
Fund. Under the legislation introducing commercial accounting
practices with TDM as from January 1, 1971, TDM's pro forma equity



ANNEX 15
Page 4 of 4 pages
has been established by taking retained earnings as the amount
of profit transferred to retained earnings at the end of 1971
and thereafter, and Government investment as the balancing figure
between the amount of total assets and the sum of retained
earnings, long-term liabilities and current liabilities.
11. Long-term liabilities - Long-term liabilities as of December 31,
1970 consist of IBRD Loan 560-NIA and foreign supplier credits
from Australia, Japan, Sweden and U.K., the amounts and terms
of which are shown in Annex 16.
12.  Subscriber deposits - Subscriber deposits which are repayable
if a subscriber gives up service have been incurred since 1967
and paid by TDM into a Government Trust Account. At the end of
1970 the closing balance amounted to M$12.6 million.  Under the
commercial accounting system beginning January 1, 1971, subscriber
deposits are assumed to be retained by TDM for financing capital
works. The annual balance is shown in the balance sheets,
Repayments have not been assumed during the forecast period.
