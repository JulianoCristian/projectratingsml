Project Development Objectives
Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the policy, management and administrative capacity in MOLSA and MOF to develop, manage and monitor pension
and social safety net reforms. Since this is a small Technical Assistance project, which will be implemented over a short period of time, it will be difficult to measure final
outcomes. One intermediate measure of success will be that both MOLSA and MOF are able to use information generated by the new systems for social safety net and
pension decision making.
Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

0..  The SSN Information System is a key output of the project, and in partnership with USAID, MOLSA has deployed the system to all four sites in Baghdad. The system has been
operational since March 2011 in the Baghdad sites, and to date the use of the system has led to the development of a central beneficiary database, which has allowed MOLSA to
identify duplicates (sometime triplicate) beneficiaries (excluding about 57,000 ineligible households out of 120,000 in Baghdad), resulting in savings to date of about US$18 million to

A key challenge is to have the system operational in all other governorates in Iraq. The system has been deployed in eight governorates (Basra, Najaf, Salah-Eddine, Ninawa,
Karkuk, Erbil, Sulaymania, and Dohuk). The process of deployment (i.e., system installation, data entry, and training) is time consuming, and is followed by system operationalization
CL (actual use to process beneficiary applications). Data entry, data validation, and data cleansing stand at about 85 percent nationwide. The deployment of the SSN Information System
O   to the nine remaining governorates in Iraq will be scheduled by the end of May 2012.
U   The SSN Information System has now become a critical piece of the Ministry's SSN strategy, allowing it to capture beneficiaries and to use the system to improve service delivery. As

-6  such, the project will need more time to complete activities that will ensure system sustainability, through additional equipment, training, and software maintenance services.
.   Therefore, and based on the schedule of remaining project activities, MOLSA requested during the mission an extension of the project closing date to April 30, 2013. Project
)   extension is subject to World Bank management approval.
Subsequent to the mission, a workshop and learning visit (January 9-11, 2012) were organized for the Iraqi delegation to the Turkish General Directorate of Social Assistance and
Solidarity in Ankara.
