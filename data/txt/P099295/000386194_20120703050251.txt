7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the policy, management and administrative capacity in
MOLSA and MOF to develop, manage and monitor pension and social safety net reforms. Since this is a
small Technical Assistance project, which will be implemented over a short period of time, it will be
difficult to measure final outcomes. One intermediate measure of success will be that both MOLSA and
MOF are able to use information generated by the new systems for social safety net and pension decision
making.
