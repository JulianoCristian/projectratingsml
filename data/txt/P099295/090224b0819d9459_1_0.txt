                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the policy, management and administrative capacity in MOLSA and MOF to develop, manage and monitor pension
                         and social safety net reforms. Since this is a small Technical Assistance project, which will be implemented over a short period of time, it will be difficult to measure final
                         outcomes. One intermediate measure of success will be that both MOLSA and MOF are able to use information generated by the new systems for social safety net and
                         pension decision making.

                         Based on the request by MOLSA, the project closing date has been extended to April 30, 2013. MOLSA made the request to the World Bank to extend the project closing date a third
                         time from June 30, 2012, to April 30, 2013, to ensure completion of all project activities, and to meet project development objectives.

                         To ensure sustainability of investments made under the project, the ministry has now allocated resources in the 2013 budget towards maintenance and operational aspects, and

                         included resources for software maintenance, connectivity costs, and fuel costs (for electricity generators). This is an excellent measure of ownership and sustainability.

                         However, the assessment during the mission is that Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) and the PMO will need to accelerate specific activities prior to the project closing
                         date. Two activities will require concerted efforts by the PMO: (i) finalization of the Service Level Agreement (SLA) contract for the Social Safety Net Information System; and (ii)
                         finalization of the training contract. The PMO is urged to finalize these contracts to allow time for their implementation before the project closing date.

                         Remaining project activities up to the project closing date were recently reviewed and all parties agreed on the action plan for the coming period. The World Bank has asked His
                         Excellency’s close follow-up on the action plan to ensure that all activities are completed on time.
