RESTRUCTURING OVERVIEW


  A. Summary of Changes

Based on the request of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, the Emergency Social
Protection Project (ESPP) is being restructured along the following lines:

     (i)   Extension of project closing date from June 30, 2012, to April 30, 2013.
    (ii)   Reallocation of grant proceeds.
   (iii)   Streamlining of procurement actions review by the World Bank

  B. Project Status

1.      The Grant Agreement was signed and became effective on June 6, 2006. The
project development objective (PDO) is to strengthen the policy, management, and
administrative capacity in the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) and the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) to develop, manage, and monitor pension and social safety
net reforms.

2.      The SSN Information System is a key output of the project, and in partnership
with USAID, MOLSA has deployed the system to all four sites in Baghdad. The system
has been operational since March 2011 in the Baghdad sites, and the use of the system
has led to the development of a central beneficiary database, which has allowed MOLSA
to identify duplicate (sometimes triplicate) beneficiaries (excluding about 57,000
ineligible households out of 120,000 in Baghdad), resulting in savings to date of about
US$18 million to the SSN budget.

3.      Out of the Grant amount of US$8 million, US$5.6 million has been disbursed,
which represents 70% of the grant. Net commitments as of March 31, 2012 stand at
US$232,000. To address procurement issues identified during the January 2012
supervision mission, the following actions are being taken (documented in the mission
Aide-Memoire): (i) the PMO procurement officer attended additional training, sponsored
by the World Bank, that took place in Baghdad in early March 2012; (ii) the PMO will
add an IT Officer to support development of technical specifications and to speed up the
evaluation process; (iii) the procurement methods and prior review threshold will be
revised and reflected in the procurement plan, to allow for streamlining and
simplification of procurement processes; (iv) the PMO will use a simplified RFQ for
simple shopping below US$10,000 to simplify the process and make it easier to be filled
by the suppliers; and (v) the Fiduciary Monitoring Agent will intensify its support to the
PMO during the upcoming period.

C. Proposed Changes

 (i)    Reallocation of Grant Proceeds: As indicated in Annex 1, the reallocation is
        necessary because specific requirements for equipment arose in order to be
        compliant with software requirements. This also entails additional training
        requirements, including policy and technical study visits to learn from other
        countries’ experiences in targeting and social protection policies and
        strategies.
 (ii)   Extension of Project Closing Date: As indicated in Annex 2, the reason for the
        closing date extension is to allow sufficient time for all remaining activities to
        be completed and for the PDO to be fully met.
(iii)   Streamlining of Procurement: In order to contribute to the work on
        streamlining and simplification of procurement processes, allowing an
        increased reliance on the MOLSA’s capacity, the procurement methods and
        prior review threshold will be revised and reflected in the procurement plan to
        be agreed between the World Bank and the MOLSA.

                                TF056808
                                  Restructuring Paper

1.      Proceeds for Iraq Emergency Social Protection Project, TF056808, P099295 will
be reallocated as follows:

Category of Expenditure        Allocation                    % of Financing
Current                        Current     Revised           Current
1. Goods                         5,015,000         5,400,000         100%
2. Consultants Services          1,100,000           750,000         100%
3. Training                        930,000         1,050,000         100%
4. Operating Costs                 955,000           800,000         100%
Total                            8,000,000         8,000,000

2.      Project implementation is satisfactory. Achievements to date include: (a)
establishment of a social safety net (SSN) information system within MOLSA to record
and process information on safety nets as a foundation for policy design which is a key
output; it has already been deployed in eight governorates and the deployment of the SSN
information system to the nine remaining governorates is planned by the end of May
2012, and thus operationalizing the system for all of Iraq would be expected in the first
quarter of calendar year 2013; (b) consolidation and expansion of the information base
for the SSN program in order to develop effective targeting strategies; (c) design and
implementation of monitoring and evaluation systems for the expanded social safety net
program; (d) development of an updated digitized database on beneficiaries, contributors
and employers in the pension system; (e) strengthening of technical capacity within
MOLSA and MOF for policy analysis and design in the area of safety net and pensions;
and (f) development of a draft pension reform strategy.

3.      The reallocation is necessary because specific requirements for equipment arose
in order to be compliant with software requirements. For example, the connectivity
mechanism was only recently agreed upon, and will use newer technology available in
Iraq that will make connectivity speeds higher, with lower costs. It was the strategy of the
Project to wait until the system was ready for deployment before acquiring equipment, to
ensure the most up-to-date technology.

4.     Prior audit reports have all been found acceptable by the World Bank, and there
are no outstanding audits. The next audit report is due June 30, 2012 for the year ended
December 31, 2011.

                                 P099295
                                TF056808

                                  Restructuring Paper

1.    The closing date for Iraq Emergency Social Protection Project, TF056808,
P099295 will be extended from June 30, 2012 until April 30, 2013.

2.    Project implementation has been progressing well towards achieving the Project
Development Objectives (PDO) and is satisfactory.

3.       The closing date extension is necessary to allow sufficient time for all remaining
activities to be completed and for the PDO to be fully met. This mainly involves
operationalizing the systems yet to be deployed. MOLSA has had great success the past
few months with the first step (system deployment). The SSN information system has
now become a critical piece of the Ministry’s SSN strategy, allowing it to capture
beneficiaries and to use the system to improve service delivery. As such, the project will
need more time to complete activities that will ensure that the system is fully operational,
through acquisition of remaining required equipment, training, and software maintenance
services.

3.     This will be the third and final extension of the closing date. The closing date has
previously been extended twice, from September 30, 2007 to June 30, 2011 and again to
June 30, 2012.
