for Iraq were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low\n            or negligible, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Grantee performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: building and instilling a sense of\n            ownership within the government will increase likelihood of\n            project success. It is essential to identify and provide\n            support to a champion within the counterpart team who can\n            lead efforts and push forward with implementation. Building\n            capacity of the counterparts is essential to satisfactory\n            levels of implementation. Flexibility in implementation and\n            the ability to adapt to local market conditions is essential\n            to overcoming unexpected implementation challenges.\n            Intensifying implementation oversight through collaboration\n            is essential when working in post conflict environments.\n            Partnership with other organizations operating on the ground\n            is a key success factor, particularly working in conflict\n            affected environment."}, "docdt": "2013-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
