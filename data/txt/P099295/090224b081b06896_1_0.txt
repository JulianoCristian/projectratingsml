                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the policy, management and administrative capacity in MOLSA and MOF to develop, manage and monitor pension
                         and social safety net reforms. Since this is a small Technical Assistance project, which will be implemented over a short period of time, it will be difficult to measure final
                         outcomes. One intermediate measure of success will be that both MOLSA and MOF are able to use information generated by the new systems for social safety net and
                         pension decision making.

                         per the recently updated action plan before this date.

                         Overall, the project continues its good implementation progress. Since the November 2012 mission, the project has increased disbursements and commitments by US$1m. The
                         Social Safety Net (SSN) Information System is now operational in all governorates, except in Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Total project commitments have exceeded 90
                         percent, and are expected to reach close to 100 percent by end of the project duration (an amount of US$21,000 is projected to be canceled). Project sustainability is assured, as the
                         Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) has put in their annual budget sufficient resources to maintain the inputs provided through ESPP, including budgets for software and

                         hardware maintenance, and funding for connectivity costs. The outputs of the project are now recognized not only by the Ministry but also across Iraq as a success story in an
                         otherwise difficult environment. The MOLSA team deserves sincere appreciation for the impressive efforts put forth during the past few years, under very difficult circumstances, and
                         has been able to achieve successful results that they can be very proud off.

                         Due to the need to supply additional equipment for MOLSA and KRG utilizing remaining funds, two new supply packages of total value of US$250,000 need to been procured before
                         the closing date.

                         In recognition of the forthcoming project closing date, the team initiated the preparation of the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR). During the March/ April, 2013
                         mission, the ICR was discussed on April 1 and discussions were attended by the PMO and the World Bank teams. The teams discussed the requirements in detail and agreed on: (i)
                         the relevant data/information that needs to be collected; (ii) the delivery schedule; and (iii) on next steps. The mission also spent substantial time providing guidance to the PMO on
                         writing the Government's own ICR.
