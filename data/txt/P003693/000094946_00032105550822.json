The lessons show that better preliminary\n            engineering, and detailed geo-technical studies, along with\n            the right use of regional comparators, would achieve more\n            advanced economic, and cost evaluation tools to assess,\n            realistically, the viability of an operation. It is further\n            suggested that environmental management should be\n            strengthened in future operations with the Public Works\n            Department (PWD), particularly addressing the environmental,\n            geo-technical, and slope failure mitigation measures, at the\n            design stage of sup-projects, and, since the private sector\n            participation in local works, and services proved effective,\n            PWD should be encouraged to expand outsourcing, because its\n            inadequate capacity for implementing civil works, and\n            services, hindered project implementation. Although the\n            parallel co-financing relationship with the Asian\n            Development Bank in the administrative capacity, succeeded\n            during project preparation, and implementation, procedural\n            differences, such as the absence of certain controls in\n            procurement, or the slow pace in land acquisition, suggest\n            the preference for uniform procedures, as a pre-condition to\n            co-financing, thus, subsequent co-financing could remain dubious."}, "docdt": "2000-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
