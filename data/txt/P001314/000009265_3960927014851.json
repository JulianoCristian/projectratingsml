The project is composed of two\n            components. The first, a geothermal component, which\n            consists of : (i) drilling supplies and materials for 32\n            wells; (ii) procurement of a drilling rig rated for 2800\n            meters; (iii) drilling infrastructure and geothermal\n            scientific equipment; and (iv) 36 man-months of technical\n            assistance and an engineering study. The second component is\n            energy preinvestment, which consists of : (i) a feasibility\n            study of hydro resources of the Miriu-Sondu basin, and an\n            engineering report for the Lower Miriu weir and power\n            station; (ii) comparative reconnaissance on several\n            potential hydro sites; (iii) an energy pricing study; (iv) a\n            study of the Kenyan LPG supply; and (v) a rural\n            electrification cost minimization study."}, "docdt": "1988-12-02T00:00:00Z"}
