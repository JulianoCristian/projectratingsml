The project achieved its objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development was substantial,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, with an appropriately\n            designed capacity building program, it is possible to\n            improve skills to a point where an agency can operate with\n            minimum long-term technical assistance. Second, identifying\n            the right mix of skills required for project implementation\n            and ensuring that the staff are in place prior to project\n            implementation with clear roles and responsibilities is\n            important for successful execution of the project. Third, a\n            comprehensive mid-term review can be instrumental in\n            identifying problems and taking corrective actions at a\n            critical stage in project implementation. Finally, financial\n            covenants need to be properly designed at the beginning,\n            taking into account the existing structural constraints in\n            the sector."}, "docdt": "1997-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
