KENYA
GEOTHERMAL DWVELOPMENT AND ENERGY PREINVESTMENT PROJECT
Credit and Proiect Summary
Borrowers        Government of Kenya (GOK)
Amount:          SDR 31.6 million (US$40.7 million equivalent)
Beneficiaries:   The Ministry of Energy (MOE) and The Kenya Power Company
(KPC)
Terms:           Standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity.  Up to US$9.7
million to KPC as equity contribution, remaining bulk of
credit onlent at not less than 7.59Z (IBRD rate at
negotiations), repayment period of 20 years including a grace
period of seven years.
Project          The project's principal objective is to assist Kenya in
Obiectives:      preparing the necessary expansion of its electric generating
capacity at least cost through utilization of indigenous
energy resources. This includes in particular the mobiliza-
tion and institutional development for a major geothermal
development program to be implemented over the next 20 years.
It also includes comparative evaluation work on potential
hydro sites. Another important objective is to develop
options for energy pricing policies which encourage more
efficient use of fuels and achieve savings and resource
mobilizatic,. The project will also address selected aspects
of rural electrification policy and household fuel supply and
distribution.
Prolect          The proposed project would (i) carry out a drilling program
Description:     of about 32 geothermal production, exploration, reinjection
and make-up wells; (ii) provide associated equipment, infra-
structure, engineering, training and advisory services; (iii)
carry out feasibility, engineering, and comparative
reconnaissance work on promising hydrosites; (iv) define
policy options for pricing energy products; and (v) study
selected aspects of rural electrification policy and
household fuel supply and distribution.
Project Risks:   Project management weaknesses and implementation delays are
addressed through agreed organization staffing, training, and
procurement arrangements. Most geothermal drilling takes
place in an area already producing steam, and therefore the
risk of drilling dry wells is lower than usual. Drilling
results will also be reviewed regularly and the program
modified as necessary.

KENYA
GEOTHERMAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY PREINVISTMENT PROJECT
STAPF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Introduction
1.01     Kenya has a population of about 20 million people with a per capita
income of US$285 in 1987. Over the past two decades, it has enjoyed considerab'e
social and economic progress and quality of life indicators have been notably
better than the average in the Region. GDP growth averaged 6.42 p.a. from
1965-80, decreased to 3.1S p.a. from 1980-85, and improved to 5.42 p.a. in
1986-87. However, Kenya's rapidly growing population (3.8S p.a.) has constrained
growth in per capita incomes and intensified pressure on all sectors of the
economy to provide more employment oppertunities. Hence, in its Sessional Paper
No. 1, the Government singled out the acceleration of economic growth as its
priority for the period 1985-2000. tgriculture is the leading productive sector
of the economy, generating 272 of GDP and employing 70Z of the labor force. The
sector is well diversified due to variations in climate, and under normal
conditions Kenya is largely self-sufficient in food. Kenya's manufacturing sector
accounts for about 13S of both GDP and employment and is among the largest
industrial sectors in Sub-Saharan Africa. The service sector accounts for about
5OS of GDP and includes tourism, the largest foreign exchange earner for Kenya
in recent years.
1.02     An economic report entitled  'Kenya:  Policies and Prospects  for
Restoring Sustained Growth of Per Capita Incomew was distributed to the Executive
Directors on March 24, 1986 (Report No. 6021-KE).
Sector Oraanizations
1.03     Until March 1988, the Ministry of Energy and Regional Development
(MOERD) wase responsible for the energy sector. Since then, the two functions
have been separated and a Ministry of Regional Development (MRD) and a Ministry
of Energy  (MOE) have been established.   The MOE oversees energy policy
formulation, elec;.ric power, oil and otner fossil fuels; and wind, biogas, solar,
geotherml, and woolfuel. Responsibility fot forests rests with the Ministry of
Env.ronment and Natural Resources (HER). The Ministry of Finance (MOP), in
consultation with MOE, establishes prices and tax rates for all energy resources.
Coordination among the different entities does exist and Kenya has in general
followed appropriate energy sector policies.
1.04     The electricity industry is composed of six entities: the Kenya Power
and Lighting Company Limited (KPLC), the Kenya Power Company Limited (KPC), the
Tana River Development Company Limited (TRDC), the Tana and Athi Rivets
Development Authority (TARDA), the Kerio Valley Development Authcrity (KVDA),
and the Lake Basin Development AutLority (LBD.;,.  KPLC is 40X privately owzked,
all other entities are fully state-owned. XPLC coordinates the power grid,
purchases in bulk from WPC, TNDC, and TARDA (KVDA and LBDA do not yet have
generating facilities in operation), and is the sole distributor. KPLC also
operates and manages all generating facilities under management agreements with
the other companies and authorities. TARDA, KVDA, and LBDA have mandates to



- 2 -
develop the river basins and are thus also pursuing interests in irrigation,
reforestation and industry. As part of the ministerial reorganization mentioned
in para. 1.03, the generating assets of TARDA and KVDA in operation and under
construction will be transferred to KFC.   This is a first step towards
consolidating asset ownership, eliminating institutional fragmentation, and
pooling technica. and managerial skills. As a second step for the medium term,
the Government is considering to merge KPC and TRDC which would complete the
consolidation.
1.05     Subsidiaries of six multinational oil companies, i.e. AGTP. BP. CALTEX,
ESSO, SHELL, TOTAL, two private Kenyan compantes, i.e. KOBIL and KENOL, aad two
parastatals under the Ministry of Energy (MOE), i.e. Kenya Pipeline Company and
National Oil Corporation - NOCK, operate in the petroleum subsector. The Kenya
Pipeline Co. operates the white products pipeline from Mombasa to Nairobi and
is planning to extend the pipeline into Western Kenya (para 1.25). NOCK was
established in 1981 to oversee exploration and, eventually, production
activities.    Later  the Government  delegated  to NOCK  responsibility  for
negotiating, concluding and supervising production sharing agreements. In 1987,
NOCK's mandate was b-- dened to include the procurement of up to 30Z of Kenya's
crude imports. In an associated move, NOCK entered Into a technical assistance
agreement with NESTE, the national Finnish oil company. CIDA and Petrocanada
are also assisting NOCK.  Government is also considering whether to acquire
interests in existing companies active in the petroleum products distribution
and retail business.   SHELL, BP, ESSO, and fTEX operate and co-own with
Government (50X) the Kenya Petrole'tm Refinery Company Limited (KPRL).   The
refinery agreements guarantee the shareholders a 12.82 return on revalued fixed
assets and there is thus not much incentive for cost saving measures. This is
one reason why refinery processing fees are high (para 1.10). Various technical
upgrading options with capital costs between several million and several hundred
million U.S. dollars equivalent have been and/or are under discussion among the
shareholders to increase the volume of white products which may be reiined from
a barrel of crude. None of the proposals has been implemented so far.
Energy Consumption
1.06     In 1987, total energy consumption in Kenya is estimated to have been
about 8.4 million tons of oil equivalent (toe). In per capita terms, this level
of energy consumption is equivalent to about 380 kilograms of oil equivalent
(kgoe) per annum, which is low by world standards, but is about twice the average
for sub-Saharan countries. Traditional energy sources (fuelwood and charcoal,
used mainly for cooking) met about 702 of the total 1987 demand for energy with
the remainder being supplied by petroleum (222), hydro and geothermal energy
(7O), and coal (1X).  Petroleum's share of commercial (i.e. nontraditional)
energy consumption has declined from about SOZ in 1977 to 74? in 1987, mainly
because of the decrease in pe.roleum-based electricity generation. However, at
the consumer level, after taking account of transmission and generation losses,
the share of petroleum products in net commerci4l energy consumption has remained
virtually unchanged at about 90X during the past ten years. Consumption of
petroleum products, which in Kenya is imported energy, declined in the early
1980s in response to the sharp increase in international and domestic oil prices
but has grown relatively quickly in recent years due to an increasing urban
population, economic growth and a decline in real terme Iu the prices of
petroleum fuels; petroleum consumption increased by 6.3Z Annually from 1.4
million toe in 1983 to 1.7 million toe in 1987. Electricity consumption also



increased steadily at 6.91 per annum between 1983 and 1987 from 153.5 thousand
toe to 200.4 thousand toe, driven largely by new connections which, by 1987 had
given 52 of the population direct access to electricity. Over the *ame period
(1983-87) coal consumption doubled, mainly due to the conversion to imported coal
of a MHclbasa based cement plant, but coal still accounts for less than 41 of
commercial energy consumption. Total consumption of commercial fniels increased
at an annual rate of 6.1Z between 1982 and 1987 compared with 42 for real GDP.
The relative rates of growth in coomercial energy and GDP imply a GDP commercial
ehergy elasticity of about 1.5 during 1983-87, which is above the average for
low-income developing countries.

1.07     Electricity tariffs.   KPLC's electricity tariffs have been raised
several times in recent years, most recently by an average of 92 in Novembe:
1987. During 1980-88, average revenue per kWh increased at an average annual
rate of 10.82 (from 0.48 KSh in 1980 to 1.09 KSh ir 1988), representing an
average annual i-acrease in real terms of about 1.62. While the average tariff
has more than kept pace with inflation, it is still some 272 below the long run
marginal cost (LRMC) of suppliea, currently estimated at about 1.50 KSh (US
cents 9.0) per kWh. This higher economic cost reflects the increasing and rather
high costs of power development in Kenya. as the better hydro sites have already
been exploited.  Assuming a rate of inflation of 52 per annum, the gap between
LRMC and the average tariff will be slowly bridged by the annual tariff increase
of Ksh 0.09 per kWh which KPLC plans to implement over the next five years.
1.08     Over the past ten years, increases in KPLC's tariff rates have also
been accompanied by significant changes in tariff structure. The January 1979
tariff revision replaced a flat rate which had aimed purely at meeting KPLC's
financial objectives with a multi-rate structurp designed to reflect, in addition
to financial targets, differences in costs of providing electricity to different
categories of consumers.  The structure of tariffs implemented in 1979 also
included a lifeline rate for those residential consumers using less than 30 kWh
per month. FoAlowing a tariff study in 1982, revised tariffs were introduced
in July of that year which further altered the structure of prices by replacing
the flat rate for those residential consumers above the lifeline rate by an
increasing block tariff to encournge conservation amongst high-income consumers.
At the same time the off-peak discount on energy (kWh) consumption by large
industrial consumers was eliminated. L. subsequent tariff revisions, in May 1985
and February 1986, incentives for off-peak cor.sumption by large industrial and
commercial consumers were reintroduced by eliminating demand (kVA) charges during
off-peak period, while the size of the first block of monthly residential
consumption, eligible for lifeline rates, vis increased from 30 kWh to 50 kWh.
1.09     Although there has been a significant improvement in the level and
structure of tariffs over the past ten years, a number of anomalies still exist.
For example there is no obvious justification for the off-peak discount on the
demand charge for large ind-ustrial and commercial consumers eapecially given the
relatively flat daily demand curve and the energy, as opposed to the power,
constrained nature of the system. There are also questions regarding the large
size of the first tariff block for residential consumption, which is sold to all
consumers in this category at the lifeline rate. The definition of basic needs
is arbitrary, but in the context of low income developing countries, lifeline
rates usually cover a family's lighting needs and perhaps the use of a fan, for



- 4 -
which total monthly requirements would be about 20 kWh. The current size of this
block, 50 kWh, is well above the norm for lifeline rJtes (in low income LCDs
including those in Africa) and not only confers greater monetary benefits to
larger, and likely more affluent, consumers but it also reduces the number of
kWh sold at prices reflecting margJnal costs. Another area where tariff policy
needs to be reviewed concerns charges to rural consumers. Present tariffs do
not cover the operational and capital costs of supplies, and losses on this
account, which are covered by the Rural Electrification Fund (REF), amounted to
KSh 1.3 per kWh during 1986187.  As about 752 of the funds for the REF come from
the Government budget, rural consumption of electricity is in effect being
supported by the general taxpayer. Finally, the present classification system
for electricity consumers, which is shown in Annez 2.2, makes market analysis
difficult. In particular, the current tariff schedule combines commercial and
industrial consumers into a general category which distinguishes between as many
as 7 types of consumers according to their level of monthly consumption (kWh)
and the supply voltage. Separating commercial and industrial consumers into two
different categories which are each subdivided into, at most, 3 types of
consumers would make it easier to interpret and implement these tariffs and
assist KPLC in forecasting sales. These and other issuee will be addressed as
part of the pricing study to be carried out under the proposed Project (para.
1.11).
1.10     Petroleum Prices.  Prices of all petroleum products, except LPG and
kerosene, increased more than six-fold between 1973 and 1987.   The average
wholesale price of gasoline rose from KSh 1,509 per tonne in 1973 to KSh 11,234
in 1987, while the cost of a tonne of LPG increased from KSh 2,060 to KSh 6,400
over the same period. There have also been parallel increases in the prices of
other types of petroleum products.  Following the fall in international oil
prices in 1986, GOK did not reduce retail prices but used the opportunity to
increase taxes on petroleum products in order to mobilise resources to reduce
the budget deficit. In late 1987, retail prices of petroleum products in Nairobi
-veraged 255Z of border  (CIF) prices.   Although retail prices have been
maintained on an increasing trend, more recently they have not kept pace with
inflation, so that in real terms the consumer has derived some benefit from the
fall in international prices: for example, while retail prices of regular
gasoline in Nairobi increased at an average annual rate of 2.32 from 7.52 KSh
per litre in 1982 to 8.43 RSh per litre in 1987, in real terms prices in 1987
were about 282 below their 1982 level. Prices of gas oil (diesel) have declined
even more, and the 1987 retail price of gas oil in Nairobi, KSh 5.62 per litre,
is some 342 below 1982 levels.
1.11      Petroleum pricing policy in Kenya is designed to reflect conditions in
international oil markets and to raise revenue, but the efficiency and revenue
objectives are tempered by the concern to keep prices relatively low for low-
income groups and industry. In terms of the structure of prices, gasoline is
the most heavily taxed petroleum fuel. Thus in 1985, the most recent year for
which information on the make-up of petroleum prices is available, the wholesale
price of regular gasoline at Mombasa, inclusive of taxes, was about 1402 above
its CIF price.  By comparison, wholesale prices of diesel and kerosene were
respectively 602 and 102 higher than their CIF costs. The diesel pricing policy
aims to protect users of public transport and the agricultural sector. However,
the comparatively low price encourages excessive use of diesel relative to
gasoline; thereby increasing the imbalance between refinery output mis and
domestic demand. The relatively low tax on kerosene also distorts the economic



- 5 -
differential between kerosene and other productss for example, wholesale prices
of kerosene in 1985, were., on a volume basis, about 402 below those for diesel
evsn though in international markets kerosene cost more tham diesel.   The
distortion in the relative prices of kerosene and diesel, which *till persists,
encourages adulteration of diesel by kerosene, particularly in road
transportation uses, thereby artificially stimulating demand for kerosene.
Studies in a number of developirig countries have concluded that gains from
reducing price distortions may well outweigh the income distribution impact on
poorer groups, especially since it appears that more efficient pricing of
kerosene and diesel would only make a small impact on household budgets. These
and other aspects, including the policy of cost-plus pricing in the refining,
distribution, and marketing of products, will be examined in the context of the
energy pricing study.
1.12      Woodfuel prices. As a consequence of the imbalance between demand and
sustainable supply of woodfuel (see para 1.18 below), woodfuel prices are on a
rising trend. Fuelwood prices in major urban centers have increased by about
502 in real term over the 1980-87 peviod.  In rural areas also, the cost of
gathering wood hae risen significantly as denudation has increased distances
from forests, with families in some areas spending upto 602 of their available
time in gathering fuelwood. As a result of price controls, official prices of
charcoal have not increased since 1984. However, price control are circumvented
and market prices are more than 1002 above gazetted prices. While the existence
of the official price controls are largely irrelevant to the day-to-day operation
of the charcoal market over the longer run these act as a deterrent to large
scale, and more efficient investment in woodfuel supplies by commercial operators
(see Kenya Woodfuel Study, para 1.28).
Energy Resources
1.13      Hydropower.   The hydroelectric power potential of the country is
estimated to be about 6,000 MW (about 30,CjO GWh per year). However, half of
this is located on small rivers, and because of topographical conditions and
the small scale, most are uneconomical to develop. Substantial hydro potential
is concentrated on the Tana and Turkwel Rivers. The Tana River has a hydro
potential of about 3,000 MW, but of this, only about 820 MW is likely to prove
economic to develop. This would produce about 4,000 GWh per year or about 1
million tons of oil equivalent. Four hydroelectric power stations - Masinga
'40 MW), Kamburu (91 MW), Gitaru (145 MW) and Kindaruma (44 MW), operating in
cascade some 100 miles northeast of Nairobi, have developed 320 MW and an
ad.litional 140 MW hap recently been commissioned at Kiambere (Loan 2359-KE)
au.out 40 km downstream of Kindaruma. Another significant source of hydro power
potential is on the Turkwel River in north-western Kenya, where a multi-purpose
project (Turkwel Gorge) providing about 106 MW to the system is currently under
construction, and is scheduled for commissioning in 1991.
1.14      Hyoro potential exists on a few other rivers including Eweso Ngiro
(100 MW), Sondu (100 MW), Webuye (20 MW), Nyando (35 MW), Arror (15 MW), and Athi
(60 NW).   The Sondu basin has been the subject of two studies towards the
multipurpose developmient of the basin's hydropower and irrigation potential.
The studies' recommendations were reviewed in mid-1986 as part of the UNDP/Bank
ESHAPICIDA funded consultancy study which resulted in the National Power
Development Plan (NPDP) for Kenya. The consultant's review suggests that the
development of the Miriu site and power station could be a source of economically



- 6 -
produced power and that selecting the best components of the two studies for the
development of the remainder of the basin could also result in an attractive
element in the NPDP, providing that complimented with irrigation benefits from
an approximately determined area in the Nyakach and Kano Plains, the total
multipurpose development can be shown to be economic. An engineering report is
to be prepared, under the project, of the promising Hiriu Falls hydrosite. An
optimization and preliminary economic evaluation study of the basin will be
carried out under the proposed project and will advise Government whether a full
feasibility study should be undertaken of the most economic development
combination.
1.15      About twelve other sites could be economic to develop, if resulting
benefits can be identified which will off-set the inherent high cost of
development of hydroprojects. The proposed project includes for a consultancy
study of these which is expected to be bilaterally funded.   The study will
include reconnaissance of about twelve sites, and prefeasibility work on four
or five of the most economically rromising. The economic evaluation of the sites
will take into asrcount the cost of developing each site, and the resulting
benefits to Kenya of energy generation, flood control, irrigation and any other
identifiable benefits of site development.
1.16      Geothermal Power.  Areas of geothermal potential in Kenya are located
in the Rift Valley which runs from the border with Tanzania in the south to
Ethiopia in tne north.  There are three major areas of geothermal activity:
Olkaria, Eburru and Lake Bogoria, with possible reserves measured in the
thousands of megawatts of electrical generating capacity (MW). The Olkaria field
area near Lake Naivasha, about 100 km west of Nairobi, contains proven reserves
of 45 MW which are the basis for power generation at the existing plant, and
probable reserves of 180 MW at exploration sites.  A further 30 MW have been
delineated by KPLC through the drilling of several exploratory and assessment
wells in the North East Olkaria area during 1986, 1987 and 1988 (para 2.11).
In addition, at Olkaria there is a possible reserve of a further 300 MW. The
Eburru prospect, 30 km north of Olkaria, contains possible reserves in the order
of 1000 MW.   Although none is yet proven,  scientific studies give strong
indications that this field could be very productive. An eight-well exploration
drilling program for Eburru is being carried out, of which four wells are under
the ongoing Geothermal Exploration Project (CR 1486-KE) and four wells are under
the proposed project. There are numerous thermal manirestations at a series of
locations in the Rift Valley between Eburru and the northern border of Kenya.
These indicate the existence of an extensive, but as yet unquantified additional
energy resource.   The NPDP study indicates that geothermal generation of
electricity is the least cost form of energy available in Kenya, by a significant
margin, and concludes that a 2X30 MW geothermal plant at East Olkaria, followed
by a 2x55 MW plant probably in the West Olkaria field, should be the next
development in the expansion of Kenya's power system.  A major part of the
program under the proposed project will be the drilling of about 16 production
wells to deliver the steam for the 2x30 MW development (para 4.06).
1.17      Hydrocarbon and Mineral Energy.  No commercial petroleum resource has
yet been discovered.  3ased on evidence available from drilling by privately
owned oil companies, in Kenya (20 wells to date) and neighboring countries,
Kenya's petroleum prospects are rated as modest, but in view of the sparse data
coverage its petroleum potential remains to be evaluated. The most attractive
areas at the present are the Rift-related structural basins in the interior.



- 7 -
Also of interest is the coastal margin basin where the majority of Kenya's
exploration to date has taken place. IBRD has supported petroleum exploration
promotion under LN 2065-KE and IDA is continuing to provide technical assistance
under CR 1675-KE. Three oil companies are currently drilling and exploring on
five different blocks. No significant coal deposits have been discovered so far.
1.18    Forests.  Kenya has large and diverse forest resources.  According to
latest estimates almost 862 of the country's total land area of 57.5 million
hectares (ha) is under forest cover. However, only about 32 of the land area
(1.7 million ha) is covered by closed high forests, located largely in the
central part of the country where rainfall is comparatively high. The rest of
the forest cover consists largely of secondary forests in various stages of
degradation (612,000 ha) and savannah woodland covering as much as 47 million
ha. In 1985, the standing volume of wood in Kenya's forest cover was estimated
to be 1,170 million cubic meters and, with a natural growth rate of 1.5-2.0S
per annum, the annual sustainable wood supply would be approximately 18-23
million cubic meters.  This sustainable yield is considerably less than the
annual woodfuel consumption estimated in 1985 at 31 million cubic meters of
which about 20 million cubic meters was consumed directly as fuelwood and the
remainder used to produce charcoal. As a consequence of the imbalance between
demand and sustainable supply, a significant depletion of the standing stock of
wood is emerging: it is estimated that more than half of current total demand
(including 901 of urban charcoal demand) is being met by the felling of standing
stocks which are not replaced. Both visual inspection and satellite imagery
surveys have recently indicated a marked denudation in the densely populated
Central, Nyanza, and Western Provinces. A variety of supply and demand side
measures, including removal of price controls on woodfuels, are being considered
by the Government. These are discussed further in para. 1.28.
1.19    Other Biomass Resources.  The only non-woody biomass resource which is
utilized on a proven commercial scale in Kenya is bagasse. The Kenya sugar
industry produces about 350,000 tons of bagasse annually, which supplemented by
fuelwood or fuel oil is used to raise steam for processing sugar cane and
generating about 25 GWh of electricity from turbines installed at individual
sugar mills. The efficiency of power production from bagasse is low and could
be increased with the introduction of pre-drying, pelletizing and other measures,
which could create surpluses to produce power for additional uses such as pumping
water for irrigation or for sale to the power company. The use of other plant
and annual residues is limited because the relatively high costs of collecting
and transforming these residues into a form suitable for energy use makes them
uneconomic relative to competing fuels, except in special circumstances.
Currently the Coffee Board is experimenting with the production and sale of
briquettes made from coffee husks. These briquettes are being sold locally and
marketing tests are being undertaken for sale in export markets. However the
commercidl viability of the scheme has yet to be established. In rural areas,
the Government is also encouraging use of biogas, derived from the anaerobic
decomposition of animal waste, for cooking and lighting. Since the program was
initiated in 1979, 300 digesters have been installed, mostly on large private
farms. More widespread adoption of this technology is inhibited at present by
the high initial capital costs of the biogas digesters, shortage of artisans for
constructing and maintaining the digesters, and the low operating efficiency
experienced in existing units because of the difficulties of organizing adequate
supplies of waste and water on a sustained basis.  The MOE is attempting to



address these problem, among other ways, by encouraging the installation and
operation of bicgas units as comunity projects.
1.20    Wind and Solar. In Kenya, wind and solar energy have economic potential
for meeting energy requirements in many areas. and -ould be of particular
significance for rural coimmunities due to the high cost of supplying conventional
energy to these areas. Water-pumping windmills have been used in Kenya since
the turn of the century and currently some 200 are in operation, many of thrA
manufactured by local suppliers. An ESMAP study of October 1987 on Wind Pumping
in Kenya concluded that there is significant potential for increased use of
windmills in many parts of Kenya both for pumping water and for generating
electricity on a small scale with payback periods of between two to seven years,
depending on output. There is widespread utilization of solar energy in crop'
drying applications in Kenya, but the open-air process used is rudimentary an4
often reduces product quality. Considerable scope exists not only for improviri
the efficiency and effectiveness of the crop drying process, but also for niw
coumercially viable applications such as installation of hct water heating
systems in hotels and large public institutions.   The Government attaches
importance to wind and solar energy but the development of these renewable energy
fonms is impeded by inadequate information about the resource base. Solar and
wind energy systems are presently being offered in Kenya on a commercial basis
and it is expected that suppliers will market these systems, where they are
viable, on their own initiative.   However the Governmeut shculd facilitate
diffusion of this technology by disseminating available information on the
resource base to suppliers and by encouraging them to assees- the commercial
attractiveness of undertaking demonstration projects in different parts of the
country.
Energy SuDply
1.21    Electric Power. Kenya's system demand (including losses) for electrical
power of 430 MW and 2,595 GVh in FYS7,  is met by RPLC's hydroelectric,
conventional thermal and geothermal power stations anl imports of power from
Uganda. Details are shown in Table 1.1 below.
1.22    Crude Oil and Petroleum Products.  Kenya relies entirely on imports,
mostly in the form of crude oil, to meet patroleun products demand. Imports in
1987 were about 2.1 million tons, of which a'aout 60,000 tons were refined
products. This compares to imports of 3.3 millin tons in 1980, including 220,000
tons of products. Domestic consumption cf petroleum products was about 1.6
million tons in 1987 and 1.7 million tone in 1980. Reexports from the Hombassa
refinery declined from about 1.6 million tons in 1980 to about 0.5 million tons
in 1987. This has been largely due to che loss of regional markets as a result
of competition from other more efficient refineries coupled with falling demand
for petroleum products in neighboring countries.
1.23    Import costs of crude and products totalled about US$308 million in
1987, and revenues from reexports were about US$97 million. Net oil imports in
that year absorbed about 26Z of export earnings, down from 36Z in 1980.
1.24    Imported crude is processed at the Mombasa refinery (para. 1.06) which
has a capacity of 4 million tons per year and thus operates at about 502 of
capacity. The refinery continues to follow largely the white-oil rule, i.e. to
process crude according to domestic demand for middle distillates and gasoline.

Fuel oil accounts for about 402 of refinery output and with domestic demand at
400,000 tons p.a. there are large low-value fuel oil surpluses for re-export
offshore.  Government and private oil companies are considering several options
to modify the operation of the refinery to reduce the relative outsut of fuel
oil. None of the proposals has so far been implemented, at tLe same time the
condition of the refinery warrants consideration for upgrading. The processing
fee at the refinery in 1987 was about US$2.40 per barrel, much higher than
similar refineries elsewhere. In part this is due to the low capacity
utilization. Also, with the guaranteed return on investment for the shareholders
(para. 1.06) there is little incentive to implement cost saving measures, or to
reduce the margins.
1.25     Total crude storage at Mombasa is 208,000 tons, of which about 88,000
at the port and 120,000 at the refinery, which is adequate. Storage facilities

for imported products is more limited. Ship unloading facilities can only handle
loads up to 30,000 metric tons and below 32 feet of draft, and th!trefore use of
smaller vessels for offloading is a common occurrence. White petroleum products
are transported through the Bank financed pipellue (LN 1133-RE approved in 1975)
from Mombasa to Nairobi while liquefied petroleum gas and all black fuels,
including industrial diesel, are transported by rail and road to Nairobi for up-
country consumption. From Nairobi onward to the interior, 701 of the product
volume is transported by road, 30S by rail.   For coastal consumption, all
products are transported by road. The pipeline operates at about 402 of design
capacity and since pipeline tariffs are set to yield a return of 15S p.a. on net
fixed assets, the cash generation is good and the company pays considerable
dividends to the Treasury.
1.26     Since completion of the Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline in 1978, an extension
from Nairobi to Western Kenya has been considered. A feasibility study was
completed in 1985. At that time the Government postponed the extension in favor
of strengthening the existing railroad so that it could handle petroleum products
including exports. Because of uncertainty regarding export traffic volumes to
Uganda (and to Rwanda, Burundi, Eastern Zaire and Southern Sudan), and because
of the lower capital cost involved, the decision to proceed with rail transport
was reasonable at that time. The study was updated in 1988 and Kenya Pipeline
Co. is now actively seeking financing for the pipeline project and negotiating
with seviral consortia.   Project costs reportedly total about US$120 million,
a significant public expenditure outlay. IDA has asked to review the feasibility
study of the project in the context of its review of the Public Investment
Program. IDA has further offered to consider participating in the financing of
the project, which otherwise is likely to attract only commercial sources of
financing.
1.27     Government is concerned to reduce to a minimum the cost of LPG bottling
and distribution, and the project recognizes this concern by including a study
to help economize LPG marketing.
1.28     Household fuels. Household consumption of energy is about 602 of final
energy consumption in Kenya. Fuelwood supplies for household cooking dominate
the residential component of national energy demand.   Including charcoal,
woodfuels serve 952 of national household demand with the remainder supplied by
modern fuels  (kerosene, LPG,  and electricity).  I   There are significant
differences between the pattern of urban and rural consumption of household
energy. In rural areas, household energy consumption is almost entirely based
on fuelwood, which remains a 'free' or non cash good for the vast majority of
rural households, with most families gathering their wood requirements from local
forest resources. By contrast, in urban areas, woodfuels (both fuelwood and
charcoal) are traded at a price and compete with other fuels in the market for
household supplies. As deforestation has progressed and distances from forests
have increased, charcoal's lower transport cost per unit of energy has added to
its attraction as an alternative to fuelvood and charcoal now accounts for at
1/  The share of modern fuels in final energy consumption, however, tends to
underestimate their importance to households as it does not take account of
the fact that the conversion efficiency of appliances that use electricity
or kerosene is typically five to six times higher than those based on
traditional fuels. for example woodstoves.

least 80S  of urban household woodfuel supply in Kenya.   These patterns are
expected to continue for the foreseeable future, with a rapidly growing
population and declining accessibility to woodfuel resources adding to the
pressure on woodfuel prices and increasing the tendency of households to switch
from fuelvood to charcoal and tfrom woodfuels to other sources of energy (LPG,
kerosene and electricity).    I  Without intervention, the deficit between
sustainable supply and demand for fuelvood is projected to increase from its 1985
level of about 11 million cubic meters to 32 million !ubic meters in the year
2000. This imbalance is estimated to lead to a loss o. some 2.7 million ha of
savannah woodland or 450,000 ha of closed high forest (or some combination of
the two) by 2000. To cope with this problem the Government is considering a
combination of supply and demand side measures including: (i) improved forestry
management, (ii) removal of price controls on charcoal, (iii) introduction of
incentives  to  encourage  private  sector  investment  in  forestry,  and
(iv) increasing use of modern fuels and more efficient woodstoves and charcoal
kilns. Even without intervention, a significant switch to modern fuels is
expected by the year 2000 under the influence of rising incomes and prices of
traditional fuels. Residential use of electricity is expected to expand under
the impetus of new electrification programs.  At the same time, demand for
kerosene and LPG is expected to increase at around the rate of growth of the
urban population iu Kenya, which is projected at about 62 annually.  Issues
relating to the pricing aspects of household fuels will be addressed in the
pricing study to be undertaken under the proposed Project.
Energy Trade
1.29     Power. Thirty megawatts of power are imported from Uganda's 'Owen Falls
hydroelectric project under a contract that remains in effect until 2004. In
recent years Uganda has been unable to meet contracted po.er demands during
evening peak demand periods, although higher power flows during off-peak times
have kept average annual energy exports to Kenya above 200 GWh or about 82 of
current total system demand. KPLC expects that a dependable supply of power
exports will only be provided by Uganda Electricity Board when the ongoing
Rehabilitation Project (CR 1560-UG) nears completion in 1991. Power is currently
delivered at a tariff of US 0.3/kWh, a very advantageous rate for Kenya. Uganda
has a considerable potential of hydro electric sites which are low-cost in
comparison to Kenya's undeveloped sites, and coald even be lower-cost sources
of energy to Kenya than Kenya's geothermal stations. therefore prospects for
expanding the power trade should be pursued to the economic advantage of both
countries. By the mid to late-1990s, Uganda will require new generation capacity
to meet its own demands, and if a large enough site is developed, further imports
to Kenya may then become available. Infrequent communications on energy trade
are taking place between Kenya and Uganda, and these, mainly for political
reasons, fall far below the full dialogue needed to undertake joint long-term
planning. Also, Uganda needs to rehabilitate its generation and transmission
facilities as well as determine its own long-term development program. IDA has
indicated to both parties its willingness to assist in the dialogue, and is
supporting power development in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, so that trade benefits

could eventually evolve. Between Kenya and Tanzania there is no transmission
interconnection at present. The feasibility of such an interconnector is being
studied, and preliminary results suggest mutual benefits, given Tanzania's
expected surplus of hydropower generating capacity in the 19909.  Secondary
energy would be available to Kenya in the short term and probably firm energy
in the mid-to late 1994s.
1.30     Petroleum Products.  The export of petroleum products peaked in 1980
when about 1.7 million tons of products were exported to neighboring countries,
to foreign airlines in Nairobi and Mombasa airports, and offshore (heavy fuel
oils). Since then expoxts have fallen off to about 0.5 million ton in 1987.
As mentioned in para. 1.22 the decline of reexports has been largely due to the
loss of regional markets as a result of competition from other more efficient
refineries which supply these markets at prices lower than those obtained in
Kenya, coupled with falling demand for petroleum products in neighboring
countries. Furthermore, in 1982, the Government, due to limited foreign exchange
availability decided to temporarily suspend export of petroleum products to
neighboring countries. By the time this was lifted, a substantial part of this
market had been lost. Trading prospects with Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Northern
Tanzania, Southern Sudan and Eastern Zaire will strongly influence the viability
of the pipeline extension project (para. 1.26).
Bank Participation in the Energy Sector
1.31     The Bank Group has helped to finance six power projects (Loans 745-KE
of 1971, 114&-UE of 1975, S-12-KE of 1978, 1799-UE of 1980, 2237-UE of 1983, and
2359-UE of 1983), and one credit to help finance the Geothermal Exploration
Project (Credit 1486-UE of 1984). Implementation of the power projects has
generally been very good, although there have been some problems in the
management and procurement of the geothermal drilling. The proposed project
specifically addresses these (para. 3.01 and 3.04). Three loans were made for
reforestation (Loans 641-UE of 1969, 1132-KE/Credit 565-KE of 1975 and 2098-
KE/credit 1213). The first loan was implemented satisfactorily, while the second
loan suffered from cost overruns and implementation problems. In the petroleum
subsector, the Bank financed the construction of the products pipeline from
Mombasa to Nairobi (Loan 1133-UE of 1975), and two petroleum exploration
promotion projects (Loan 2065-RE of 1981 and Credit 1675-UE of 1986). Pipeline
construction was completed on schedule and the economic rate of return was 192.
The promotion projects have been successful in helping to attract six
international companies to take up acreage in Kenya, but no commercially viable
oil or gas reserves have been discovered to date.
Rationale for IDA's Involvement in Energy Sector
1.32     The country assistance strategy for Kenya is based on promoting medium-
term structural adjustment focussed on boosting growth in the key productive
sectors and on greater efficiency of resource utilization. The lending program
emphasizes sector adjustment operations and discrete project investments in
priority areas, including energy, supporting the growth initiatives. In the
power subsector, IDA's role is to support the timely and least cost expansion
of capacity with revenues producin- an adequate contribution to investment so
that the system can continue to support growth through reliable delivery of
electrical energy at reasonable cost. Under the proposed project the geothermal
drilling work is designed to provide a physical and institutional basis for the



- 13 -
construction of the major geothermal developments and the hydro (pre)feasibility
work for the hydro developments. In the petruleum and household fuel subsectors,
IDA's role is to support improvements in the efficiency of resource use and to
assist in evaluating investment options. Key to this would be work on energy
pricing policies, supplemented by work on rural electrification policy,
encouraging mutually attractive energy trade links with neighboring countries,
and generally offering consistent and timely advice and support if so requested.
It is hoped that over time this approach, coupled with the results of the various
studies included in the proposed project will lead to a context in which sector
reform questions can be discussed and addressed in subsequent Bank operations.
II. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
Existing Power Facilities
2.01     The total installed capacity of the interconnected power system is
702 MV, of which 493 MV is hydro, 45 MW is geothermal, and 164 MV is oil-based
thermal. The Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) also provides 30 MW (para. 1.29).
KPLC has about 13,500 km of transmission lines operating at various voltages
throughout the country, and total distribution transformer capacity in service
is about 3,200 MVA. Detailed information regarding the existing power facilities
is given in Annex 2.1.
National Power Development Plan
2.02     Demand Trends. Electricity sales by KPLC increased at an average annual
rate of 6.8Z during the period 1980-87, compared to the 8.12 average growth
experienced during the previous seven years, 1973-80. The decline in the rate
of growth of electricity sales accompanied a proportionate slowdown in the GDP
growth rate, from 4.7? per annum during 1973-80, to 3.92 per annum over the 1980-
87 period. As both GDP and electricity sales experienced a similar reduction
in growth rates, the GDP elasticity of demand for electricity (defined as the
percentage change in electricity sales divided by the percentage change in GDP)
remained unchanged at about 1.72 during both seven year periods. In the past
two years, 1986-87, growth in GDP and electricity sales have again rebounded,
with GDP expanding at 5.2Z annually while electricity sales increased at a rate
of 8.9X to reach a level of 2,330 GWh in 1987, with a peak demand of 430 MW.
Per capita consumption of electricity was 106 kWhlyear in 1987 compared with
68 kWh/year in 1973, representing an annual growth rate of 3.2Z.
2.03     Most of the growth in sales during the 19809 has been due to the
increase in the number of new connections. The number of customers increased
at an average rate of 4.8Z from 167,675 in 1981 to 222,301 in 1987. Sales per
customer, on the other hand, increased at the more modest pace of i.7Z per year,
from 9,530 kWh in 1981 to 10,480 kWh in 1987, thereby making a more limited
contribution to the 6.5? growth in sales which occurred in this period. Kenva's
experience of electricity sales being largely driven by new connections is dot
unusual in the context of developing countries where electricity consumption is
not curtailed by load shedding of existing customers.   The growth in new
connections has been uniformly spread across the main customer categories whose
share of electricity males has consequently not shown any significant change
since 1980.   During 1987, domestic, small commercial, asd small industrial
consumers accounted for 292 of sales, medium size commercial and industrial firms



- 14 -
absorbed 242 of total sales, while large industrial and conmercial enterprises
took the largest share of 42X.  The absence of a significant shift in the
sectoral composition of sales has allowed the daily load curve, chaticterized
by a fairly level demand from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and an overnight demand which at
its minimum is 752 of the awerage daytime load, to remain relatively unchanged
during the past 5 years. This is also reflected in the system load factor which
has maintained a level of around 682 since 1982.
2.04     On a regional basis, Nairobi and the Coastal Region represent the major
load centers, accounting for about 762 of sales. However sales in Western Kenya
are growing, reflecting the Government's intention to industrialize the area (as
shown in its decision to develop Kisumu and Eldoret as industrial centers) and
the extension of the transmission system to the region.   Since 1975, this
region's share has grown from 8.52 of sales to about 152. Sales in the Rift
Valley and in the Mount Kenya area which account for the remaining 92 of KPLC
sales, have grown, like the Nairobi and Coastal Region, at a rate which is
slightly below the average for the country as a whole.
2.05     Three load forecasts for 1987-2005 were prepared under the NPDP.  The
median forecast is given in Table 2.1 and in detail in Annex 2.2. KPLC's total
energy (Gih) sales are forecast to increase at the average rate of 5.3Z a year
over 1987-2005, with a slightly faster rate of growth of about 5.82 per annum
over 1987-90 due to the assumption that the present enviroament of lower oil
prices, which has had a beneficial impact on the balance of payments and the pace
of economic growth, will continue through to the early 1990s. Total electricity
sales are projected to be about 5,700 GWh in the year 2005, peak demand to be
1,133 MV, and total generation to be about 6,670 GWh.
2.06    The sales forecast assumes that the economy will grow at about 52 during
1987-90 and 4.52 thereafter, which implies that over the forecasting period,
1987-2005, the average annual rate of GDP growth, 4.72, will be about the same
as recorded in the decade of the 19708.  However, the relationship between
electricity sales and GDP is forecast to change over 1987-2005, under the
combined influences of (i) a higher real term growth in tariffs than ex.-4rtenced
in recent years, and (ii) structural changes in the economy brought about by the
higher energy efficiency of new capital investments and an above-trend growth
rate in the agricultural an& light industrial sectors.   The effect of the
relatively high growth in agficulture and manufacturing is reflected in the
forecast in the increased share of sales to commercial and industrial co)nsumers;
the figures in Table 2.1 underestimate the shift because sales to small
industrial and commercial consumers, based on KPLC's present reporting system,
are subsumed under the domestic sales category. At the same time, due to rising
tariffs and increased efficiency of electricity use (including reduced demand
from less energy intensive industry), average sales per consumer is expected to
remain more or less constant over the forecast period. Consequently all the
growth in sales is projected to emerge from a continuing brisk pace of new
""'inections, which averaged about 10,000 a year in the period 1985-87, and is
recast to be about 12,000 a year in the next five years.
2.07    As new connections are the only source of growth, the increase in
electricity sales is limited to 5.32 per year over 1987-2005, with an implied
GDP elasticity of 1.15. If the decline in GDP elasticity from its historical
trend level of 1.72 to 1.15 does not materialize, then sales could be
significantly higher than forecast, in which case KPLC will need to consider

options  to  balance  supply  and  demand  including  a  combination  of:
Ci) accelerating the development of planned generating facilities (see para. 2.09
below); (ii) curtailing new connections; and (iii) load shedding of existing
customers (i.e. a deterioration in service). Actual sales in 1987, 2,330 GWh,
have exceeded the median NPDP forecast by 42. If this trend continues RPLC will
have to take action along the lines suggested above.
2.08      Generation.   The NPDP provides Kenya with a least cost plan of
expansion of the country's electrical generation and transmission for the years
1986-2006. The study concluded that Kenya's least cost source of electrical
energy, by a margin of between 202 and 40X, is from its geothermal resources,
and it recommends that for low, median and high load forecast scenarios further
investment in both geothermal explor%tion and geothermal development should be
undertaken.   Under all scenarios geothermal energy is the least-cost for
supplying the base load.
2.09      The NPDP also indicates that further feasibility study work should be
performed with regard to several hydro sites. The NPDP included an inventory
of Kenya's hydroelectric potential, derived from available studies, but because
there is a shortage of studies of water supply and irrigation benefits anr
economic evaluation of the sites was not possible. The NPDP recommends that
further work be carried out to investigate and evaluate these benefits, and the
study referred to in para. 1.15 responds to this recommendation.   The NPDP
further recommends the installation of a 30 MV ga3 turbine in 1989 if no reliance
is placed by Kenya on the Uganda energy supply from Owen Falls hydro power
station (para. 1.29). The NPDP includes the installation of four additional
30 Mg gas turbines in the period 1992 to 1995. The NPDP's analysis of net energy



- 16 -
generation indicates that these turbines may be required to generate back-up
energy of between 100 GWh in 1992 and 300 GWh in 1997) in any dry years during
the Plan period. After 1997 generation demand on these gas turbines falls off
as coal-fired stations are proposed to progressively take over the load. The
NPDP reconmmends that to develop the system at least cost, 60 MU of coal-fired
capacity will be required almost every other year beginning in 1999.   The
commissioning of these coal-fired units would be deferred if irrigation ar.. flood
control benefits of the remaining undeveloped hydrosites could bring additional
hydro generation into the least cost development plan instead of coal, or if
imports of power from neighboring countries were increased.
2.09      Transmission.   The transmission system development in Kenya has
generally been based on the premise that the system should be capable of
functioning satisfactorily under the condition of a single contingency line or
transformer outage. Exceptions to this have been decided upon by KPLC because
the system, fortuitously, has geographically located infeeds of energy
(hydroelectricity, geothermal, oil) which are geographically balanced by consumer
demand. Thus for the next twenty years, using this criteria, only a few 220 kV
transmission interconnections would be required. But with growing demand and
with outages evaluated to have a high economic cost to the country, the single-
contingency outage criteria may have to be extended throughout th'. transmission
system. This would result in the need for a second 220 kV coastal interconnector
and a third 132 kV circuit betwuen Naivasha (in the area of geothermal
development) and the main system at Lanet. The NPDP recommends that two new
220 kV substations in the industrial area and in the north-east segment of the
capital are required.   KPLC have already begun work on developing these
substations. Reinforcements of the transmission system will include two douLle
circuit transmission line connecting Nairobi's Dandora substation to the
industrial substation and Dandora to the North-East substation. These will be
required to be commissioned by 1990 and 1991. The NPDP also indicates the need
for a 220 kV single circuit line from Kiambere hydroelectric power station to
the new industrial substation.   KPLC's consultants are studying the most
economical timing for the commissioning of this line, the construction of which
is to be funded by KiN.
2.10      Rural Electrification.  With the adoption of the 1986 Sessional Paper
on Economic Management of Renewed Growth, Government declared rural
electrification to be a high priority infrastructural program wihich is expected
to accelerate rural industrialization, commerce and social development, and will
help curb the rural urban migration in Kenya. The Konyan Rural Electrification
Program (REP) is managed by the Ministry of Energy, and RPLC undertake the
engineering,  construction  and  operation  of  the  rural  electrification
developments. Currently, Kenya is investing about KSh 200 million per year in
the REP, but it is estimated that at this rate of investment, some twenty years
would be required before electricity could be made available to Government's
targeted load centers which are within a reasonable diLtance of the grid.
Recognizing Government's aims, the proposed project includes a National Rural
Electrification Study which will focus on cost minimization, network voltage,
capacity and routing methodology, and econonic methods of rural house wiring and
metering. It is proposed that the study be carried oult by consultants for KPLC.

2.11      Exploration and Develoment Stratega.   menya faces important decisions
over the next several years if the goal of 325 MW of geothermal power is to be
achieved by 2005.  First, sufficient additional productive acreage must be
dedicated to the Olkaria production field in order to maintain the existing 45
MW, and make-up walls will have to be drilled on a periodic schedule. Second,
development drilling and reservoir assessment must continue at Northeast Olkaria
in order to determine if 60 MV of geotherml reserves are available. Because
of the possibility that demand growth will require comnissioning of the 60 MW
beginning in 1993, i.e. one year earlier than recomended by the NPDP, drilling
must proceed rapidly. Therefore, the funding to be provided under the proposed
project (for the period 1989-92) will go preponderantly to help assess and
develop Northeast Olkaria.  Third, while Eburru remains an unknown factor,
subject to the drilling o' 4 to 8 geothermal exploration wells which is expected
to begin in late 1988, the prospect remAins highly attractive. Nevertheless,
it is still uncertain if Eburru can sustain a future 55 NW development, such as
has been recommended for both 1998 and 2001. Thus, if Eburru is not commercially
successful, an alternative field will have to be drilled and assessed for
development. Fourth, West Olkaria and other portions of the Olkaria area may
have signifirant commercial potential, based on the few wells drilled to date.
Three additional wells are planned for West Olkaria by 1992.  If these are
successful in allowing an estimate of developable reserves, it may be possible
to develop West Olkaria in the late 19909. However, if 55 NW cannot be proven,
drilling and development of yet an additional field will be required. Annex 2.3
gives details of the likely drilling program.
2.12      Thus, between Eburru and the various sections of Olkaria, iX may be
possible both to support the existing 45 NW and to add several tens to several
hundreds of NW of geothermal power generation. Accomplishing this will require
Ci) timely and effective drilling of more than 100 wells by the end of this
century, for purposes of exploration, assessment, development and make-up;
(ii) strengthening of RPLC to allow more effective mobilization and resource
utilization; and (iii) building a trained and well-equipped cadre of technical
and administrative specialists within KPLC.
2.13      However, it remains a possibility that Olkaria and Eburru together will
not be able to provide all of the additional 280 MV of geothermal generation
recommended by the NPDP; or that reserves, if available, cannot be developed by
KPLC in a suitably rapid fashion. Therefore, a strategic alternative should be
plauned for.   This consists of, first, prioritizing the known geothermal
prospects in Kenya (this is being done under CR 1486-KE); and, second, exploring
and drilling the highest priority prospects in time for decisions to be made
regarding field development in the middle and late 19908. Because there is still
uncertainty regarding Olkaria and Eburru, all sources of financing for drilling
and field development need to be pursued including both private sector and
development agencies. Projects have been started at Menengai, Logonot, Suswa
and elsewhere  under UNDP and bilateral funding.   However, drilling  and
development should not occur without, first, assessi.g the results of
prioritization of the geothermal resources of Kenya (para. 2.14). Agreemen. has
been obtained during negotiations that IDA will have the opportunity to review
and conmut on any non-ID  funded geothermal drilling programs in Kenya.

2.14      Institutional Arrangements. The goothenmal sector is regulated by the
Geothermal Resources Act of 1982. The Act states that geothermal resources are
vested in the Government (MOE) vhich can issue exploration and exploitation
licenses. It further provides for private sector activity. Implementation
regulations for the Act are currently under preparation and IDA vill be asked
to comment on them. On a small scale, geothermal energy is already privately
used in agricultural applications such as crop drying by private farmers aad as
hot water in residential buildings in Nakuru. Geothermal condensed steam is also
the only source for water supply in the Eburru area for local farmers. To date
there has been no direct involvement by private companies in geothermal
exploration and development on a large scale (as has happened in the Philippines)
because of the relatively small size of the power market. However, the planned
development of geothermal resources over the next 20 years is likely to increase
the interest of private companies. A study which vill examine the institutional
aspects of the geothermal sector including a framework for private sector
involvement is included under the ongoing Geothermal Exploration Project (Cr.
1486-RE); the TOR for this are currently being developed by MOE with advice from
IDA.
Investment Costs
2.15      The NPDP identifies and recommends new investments in the power
subsector of US$360 million equivalent in the next 10 year period, and a further
US$760 million equivalent in the following decade; in 1986 values. During the
20 year period about USS500 million will likely be spent on geothermal
development (280 MV), US$350 million on conventional oil (150 MW), and coal
(240 MW) fired plant, and about US$100 million on the Miriu Sondu (60 MV) hydro
scheme. The remaining US$170 million will be required to finance the associated
transmission projects.

3.01      Organization and Management.  KPLC is a well-managed utility and is
operated in accordance with sound commercial principles. The company is led by
a Managing Director, and has a Board of Directors consisting of 11 members
including the Managing Director, Government representatives and Kenyan
businessmen. The line organization below the Managing Director is appropriate
and comparable to good utility practices elsewhere. KPC, as mentioned earlier
(para.1.04) is integrated with and managed by RPLC. The geothermal development

activities, 50 in scientific work and the remaining in various technical and
administrative support functions. Over the next 20 years, about 200 wells will
need to be drilled to develop and maintain the 280 MW of geothermal power
stipulated in the power master plan. KPLC intends to undertake a majority of
the drilli-g itself, building upon and expanding its expertise; contract drilling
will suDplement RPLC drilling as necessary. Responding to the increasing
importance of geothermal development activities, KPLC will create the position
of Geothermal Development Coordinator, responsible for all aspects of geothermal
development up to the well head, i.e. excluding steam collection and power
generation, (currently the geothermal development section reports to the chief
distribution manager). The appointment of a qualified coordinator is a condition



- 19 -
of effectiveness for the proposed credit. Agreement has further been reached
that the Coordinator for Geothermal Development be maintained during the project
implementation period. Agreement has also been reached on establishment/
maintenance of about 12 key subsidiary positions. Annex 3.1 shows these and,
as an integral part of the program, the counterpart arrangements for those
positions initially held by expstriates. A managerial staffing and development
plan for the geothermal section, including the designrtion of counterparts has
been presented by KPC wita implementation to begin immediately.
3.02     Oerations and Maintenance. KPLC's hydroelectric, geothermal and oil-
fired power stations are operated efficiently and are well-maintained through
the observance of routine maintenance procedures and timely major overhauls.
KPLC stores an adequate amount of spares and consumables for the maintenance of
its power stations, substations, and its transmission and distribution system,
but the distribution system is showing signs of lack of attention to maintenance.
RPLC is recruiting additional technicians and is training extra lines-men in
order to replace and reinforce the transmission and distribution maintenance
staff, who are being diverted to build high-priority rural electrification
schemes to the detriment of the existing system.
3.03      System Losses.  The total transmission and distribution system loss
is currently about 121 of units generated. This improvement, of about 3?, has
been achieved over the last four or five years as KPLC has installed suitable
system compensation equipment, and strengthened power lines within its general
development program -.o reduce losses as far as economically possible.
3.04      Geothermal Engneering.   KPLC have a staff of over 200 personnel
experienced in drilling or thi maintenance and operation of drilling
infrastructure. The decision by KPLC to retire their old second-hand T12 rig,
which is out of commission, and even if rehabilitated at substantial expense,
only marginally capable of production well depths, has left KPLC with an excess
staff with drilling experience.   During 1987 and 1988, using their N370 rig
(procured in 1981 and currently derated to 2,000 m), KPLC have demonstrated that
their drilling crews are capable of keeping successfully to a reasonable drilling
schedule. The management arrangements discussed in para. 3.01 are intended to
ensure the consistency of KPLC drilling performance. To make efficient use of
this in-house human resource the proposed project includes for the procurement
of another drilling rig, which will be used for both investigative and production
drilling by RPLC. Although RPLC keeps an adequate stock of drilling materials
and consumables, RPLC sometimes encounters difficulties in the procurement
process--delays in tiuder award, customs clearance or trunsportation. A portion
of the proposed credit will be used to finance additional supplies, but to help
ensure their early delivery a condition of effectiveness of the credit will be
the signing by KPLC of contracts for strategic procurement packages and contract
award for the drilling rig (para 4.09).
3.05      Training and Personnel.  KPLC, which employs 6,760 personnel, accords
high priority to training of indigenous manpower, recognizing it to be the
lasting solution to its problem of shortage of skilled personnel.   RPLC
undertakes or sponsors university and advanced technical education and craft,
accountancy and managerial skills courses, but as a temporary measure, recruits
from the overseas market, and uses technical assistance from the Government and
donor agencies to fill key technical posts.



- 20 -
3.06      Both KPLC's euisting drilling and the drill rig, which it is proposed
be funded under the project. will be staffed by KPLC persomnel. To ensure this,
a second complement of drilling crews will be trained and made fully operational
prior to the arrival of the IDS funded rig. Prior to Credit effectiveness KPLC
will have recruited the second complement of drilling crews and training will
have commenced.
3.07      Accounting and Audit. KPLC and KPC accounts are prepared in accordance
with sound conmercial and public utility practices and audited annually by
auditors acceptable to IDA. In line with earlier Bank/IDA projects, KPLC/KPC
will continue to submit audited accounts within eight months of the end of the
financial year. The audit will include the project accounts which will be kept
separately and contain a separate opinion from the auditors covering credit
amounts withdrav' on the basis of Statements of Expenditure.
Ministry of Energy (MOE)
3.08      MOE's Planning Division is led by a qualified Principal Planning
Officer, reporting to the Permanent Secretary. The Planning Division has three
planning officers and a planning assistant and is adequately staffed to implement
the project's energy component (para. 4.08).
Iv. THE PROJECT
4.01      Proiect Objectives.  The project's principal objective is to assist
Kenya in preparing the necessary expansion of its generating capacity at least
cost through utilization of indigenous energy resources.   This includes in
particular the mobilization for a major geothermal program to be implemented
over the next 20 years. It also includes systematic and comprehensive evaluation
work on about a dozen potential hydro sites. Another important objective is to
develop options for energy pricing policies which encourage more efficient use
of fuels and achieve savings and resource mobilization. The project will also
address selected aspects of rural electrification policy and household fuel
supply and distribution.
4.02      Proiect Preparation. Under the Joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment
Program, consultants produced the Kenya National Power Development Plan in June
1987.  A Bank energy mission visited Kenya in October 1937 to identify the
components of a geothermal development and energy preinvestment project based
on the findings and recommendations of the NPDP. An appraisal mission took
place in May 1988. IDA has worked closely with KPLC and with its consultants
and with MOE in formulating the proposed project. The Project is also based on
the results of IDA's ongoing (eothermal Exploration Project (CR 1486-KE) and is
consistent with that project's drilling program.
Proiect Description
4.03      A brief description of components of the proposed project is given
below, and details are contained in Annex 4.2.



- 21 -
Geothermal Compouent. The geothermal component would consiet ofs
(a)   Drilling supplies and materials for about 32 wells (presently
planned as 17 production, 8 make-up, 2 assesment, and 5
exploration wells) in the existing Eastern Production field (EPF),
Northeast Olkaria, West Olkaria, and Eburru. Annex 4.1 describes
in deLail the drilling program.
(b)   Procurement of drill rig rated for drilling to at least 2,800 m.
(c)   Necessary associated infrastructure, specifically including the
Moi South Lake Road, drill crew housing, repair shops and
workrooms, and tools and equipment.

as well testing, drilling, or scientific data analysis, for help
in field development, and support training of RPLC staff.
(f)   Engineering Study for the 2 x 30 MV powerplant.
4.04    Energy Component.  The energy component would includes
(a)   a feasibility study of development of the Miriu-Sondu basin and
its hydro resources and an engineering report for the Lower Miriu
weir and power station;
(b)   comparative reconnaissance, optimization and prefeasibility work
on several potential hydro sites, including benefits of irrigation
and flood control;
(c)   an energy pricing study, including the definition of policy
options for pricing energy products;
(d)   a study of the LPG supply in Kenya with a view to alleviating
shortagess and
(e)   a rural electrification cost minimization study.
Proiect Cost
4.05   The total cost of the proposed project is estimated to be about US$59.6
million of which about US$48 million (including indirect and direct foreign,
costs) is in foreign exchange. The geothermal component is estimated at about
US$49 million, the hydro studies at sbout US$9 million, and the other studies
component at US$1 million. An ineAicative cost summary is shown in the table
below.

Cost estimates for the various studies are based on recent World Bank-financed
studies of similar nature and magnitude. The cost estimates for the geothermal
exploratory and development drilling and infrastructure are based on recent KPLC
experience,  and advice from their geothermal consultants.   Standard IBRD
assumptions have been used to calculate escalation on foreign cost; local costs
have been inflated in line with current country assumptions. Assumptions on
devaluation of the Kenyan shilling have been based on the differential between
domestic and international inflation, starting with a May 1988 rate of KSh 16.9
per US$. Physical contingencies have been estimated throughout the proposed
project at 10X.
Pro3ect Implementation
4.06     Geothermal Component.  It is presently planned that the first of 2 x
30 Mg power generation units will go on line at Northeast Olkaria in 1994 and



- 23 -
that the second will begin operation in 1995. However, it is possible that this
schedule will need to be accelerated, to meet Kenya's growing needs for electric
power, such that the first unit goes on line in 1992 or 1993, and the second a
year later. To accommodate this accelerated schedule, it will be necessary to
drill an average of about 6 wells per year in the Northeast Olkaria field. This
is beyond the present capability of the existing KPLC drill rig and crews, which
currently are drilling a maximum of 4 wells per year. KPLC therefore plans to
procure a second rig for delivery to site early in 1990. It is expected that
this rig will be capable of drilling a further 4 wells per year. KPLC's schedule
of drilling anticipates plant start-up in 1994 and 1995, and is based on the use
of one drilling rig in the Olkaria area from the present until the arrival of
the second KPLC rig in early 1990, and two rigs thereafter. The schedule also
assumes the drilling at Eburru by a contracted drilling rig financed partly under
Credit 1486-KE (para. 1.16). Together, this series of rigs is scheduled to drill
37 holes from the present through to the end of 1992, of which eight are proposed
to be exploration wells at Eburru, three are to be resource assessment wells in
West Olkaria, nine are to be make-up wells for Olkaria production field, and 17
are to be development wells for Northeast Olkaria. However, this schedule can
be modified, if necessary, to provide additional production wells for Northeast
Olkaria in the case of accelerated power development (2 x 60 MV by 1992/3). In
such a case, as few as four wells would be drilled at Eburru, one well in West
Olkaria, and six in the main Olkaria production field, and as many as 26 in
Northeast Olkaria. RPC will inform IDA about the drilling program for each well
based on the approved overall drilling program.
4.07     Meetings are planned to be held every six months in Kenya, in which
the technical, administrative and fiscal performance of the project will be
considered. Performance milestones will be established for each 6-month period,
reflecting project goals and performance in the previous 6-month period. 'Where
goals have not been achieved, remedial programs and compliance dates will be
established, along with supplementary review meetings as needed.
4.08     Energy Component.  The energy component of the project, to be funded
from bilateral sources, will be carried out under the auspices of the Ministry
of Energy and under TOR mutually agreed between MOE and IDA.
Procurement
4.09     Procureia-nt under the proposed Credit would be mainly on the basis of
international competitive bidding, but also include some local competitive
bidding and some shopping items, in accordance with the Bank Guidelines and as
summarized in Table 4.2.   One item of the proposed project would be the
procurement of a drilling rig for KPC (with drilling carried out by KPLC staff),
using funds from the proposed Credit. KPC's consultants have advised that a
substantial saving can be made if, rather than procuring a drill rig specifically
manufactured for KPC's needs, KPC procure, through international competitive
bidding, one of the many drilling rigs located around the world which have become
redundant as a result of current low oil prices and which in many cases are new
or near-new. The use of IDA funds for the procurement of a not brand new piece
of equipment is unusual but not without precedent. The mission is satisfied that
the method of bid advertising and bid evaluation following international
competitive bidding which KPC propose be used for the procurement of this
component, will ensure equity for bidders, and economy and efficiency in the
execution of the proposed project for Kenya and KPC. Drilling consumables will

be grouped Into five tender packages and assodiated service contracts into eight
packages. Signature of two key consumable contracts and one service contract
is a condition of effectiveness as is ths recamendation for award of the drill
rig contract. Table 4.2 shows procurement arrangements.

Financing Plan
4.10     Project costs total US$59.6 million, of which IDA would finance US$40.7
million equivalent, cofinanciers US$9.4 million, and [PC US$9.5 million. US$34.1
million of the IDA funding would be for direct foreign cost and US$6.6 million
for indirect foreign cost. Bilateral cofinanciers under consideration by the
Government include CIDA, FINNIDA, KfW, ODA and Japan. Table 4.3 summarizes the
financing plan.
4.11     Government will pass on as equity contribution to [PC up to US$9.7
mlllion of the proceeds of the proposed credit reflecting the risk factor
associated with the geothermal drilling that will be undertaken. Government will
onlend the remaining bulk of the proposed credit at not less than 7.59Z (IBRD
rate at negotiations) and a term of 20 years including a seven year grace period
with [PC carrying the foreign exchange risk. Signature of a subsidiary credit
agreement acceptable to IDA will be a condition of effectiveness. Cofinancing

Disbursements
4.12     The proposed Credit would be disbursed against (a) 100? of the foreign
expenditure for directly imported equipment and materials quoted on a cif basis;
(b) 1002 of ex-factory cost for equipment and materials manufactured locally;
(c) 55Z of the local cost of drilling; (d) 65? of the costs of the Moi South Lake
Road; (e) 65? of the costs of the KPLC houses, workshops and offices; and (f)
1001 of foreign cost of technical assistance, and (g) 100? of the cost of
training.   Annex 4.4 gives the proposed credit disbursement schedule which
indicates that the bulk of disbursements are expected to be earlier than those
in the standard regional profile because much of the Credit funds are to be used
for drilling materials which will be procured and consumed during a three-year
period, and because a major item is the drill rig which, it is proposed, be
procured at the time of credit effectiveness (para. 4.09). Disbursements would
be made against full documentation, except for payments against contracts valued
at less than US$100,000 equivalent, and local drilling costs; these items would
be reimbursed against certified statements of expenditure detailing sailaries,
wages, materials and fuels.   Supporting documents would be suitably cross-
referenced to the relevant withdrawal application, and retained by RPC in a
central location for review by visiting missions and auditors.

Monitoring and Reporting
4.13     Satisfactory procedures will be agreed for monitoring and reporting on
the progress of project execution. These will be similar to the satisfactory
arrangements of reporting on a quarterly basis which are currently in place for
the ongoing IBRD-financed Kiambere project and the IDA-financed Geothermal
Exploration Project. A project completion report will be furnished by KPLC to
IDA within six months after the closing date of the credit.
Special Accounts
4.14     Discussions with Government are underway with a view to ensuring that
accounting and reporting systems are in place which would then enable special
accounts (revolving funds) to be operated by some beneficiaries in Kenya.
Currently, KPLC is not permitted to operate foreign funds accounts. The minimum
acceptable withdrawal application will be US$S50,000 equivalent, and expenditures
below this level would be prefinanced and aggregated until US$50,000 or more are
reached.
Environmental Aspects
4.15     Most energy conversion processes have associated environmental effects.
For the generation of geothermal electricity, the effects can be grouped as
follows, and these are being assessed in an environmental impact study financed
under the Geothermal Exploration Project (CR 1486-KE):
(a) Possible health or safety hazards resulting from gas and water emissions
from geothermal wells and power plants;
(b) Changes in wildlife and flora habitat arising from changes in land-use
patterns;
(c) The possibility of induced seismicity as a result of well production
and the injection of waste fluids;
(d) Effects on tourism and visual aesthetics from such matters as increased
noise and dust levels, soil erosion and situation of waterways, and road
traffic arising from drilling and construction; and
(e) Increased consumption of the limited surface and shallow groundwater
resources.
The results of the study will be reviewed with the Bank and the study's
recomuendations taken into account in the ongoing well drilling program, and in
the well drilling to be financed under this proposed project. Environmental
impact of the drilling program is expected to be minimal.
4.16     Gas and water emissions can be reduced and almost totally eliminated
by the use of gas scrubbers and H2S converters on the steam supply lines, and
by re-injection of all residual geothermal fluids not evaporated to the
atmosphere. The area of habitat loss associated with geothermal development is
relatively small, in comparison to the size of the Rift Valley.   Selected
individual species will be studied to determiue degree of endangerment. Induced
seismicity has not proven to be a noticeable effect in any operating geothermal

field, although the incidence of microseasm (not strong enough to be felt by
humans) has increased at several fieldc.
4.17     Tourism will not be adversely affected by the geothermal development,
because Olkaria and Eburru are distant from and do not impinge on the regular
major tourist centers.
4.18     Olkaria and Eburru are areas that rely on ponded rainfall, intermittent
streamflow or condensed fumarole stem as their principal water supply.
Confirming that a permanent water supply, both for drilling and other field
operations and for use at the power plants and their support communities, will
be an important consideration of the environmental stady. Water-supply lines
have been built to connect Lake Naivasha with each geothermal area. The effects
of their consumptive use will be monitored as that part of the study which is
to investigate the hydrology of the Naivasha-Olkaria region. This will help
determine if potable groundwater supplies exist locally or regionally, and if
there is any connection between the lake and the geothermal reservoirs at depth.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
5.01     To carry out the financial analysis of the Kenyan power industry it is
necessary to consolidate the financial results of the six entities active in the
sector, i.e. KPLC, RPC, TRDC, TARDA, KVDA, and LBDA (para 1.04). It is also
important to note that RPLC is a public company with 40S of its stock held by
private shareholders, both Kenyan and foreign, whereas the other five
companies/authorities are fully government-owned.  KPLC is the distribution
company (para. 3 01) and thus the only one with a primary revenue flow from
electricity consumers. Among the others, KPC, TRDC and TARDA own generating
assets in operation, whereas KVDA has one hydro asset under construction
(Turkwel) and LBDA is in the preparation phase for a hydro project (Miriu).
Their operating costs and debt service are funded from the proceeds of bulk
supply agreements with KPLC. Payment formulas thereunder are based on
ascertained costs' i.e. average gross costs per kilowatt hour, taking into
account inter alia operating and maintenance costs, depreciation, and exchange
losses, and are adjusted from time to time. Borrowing for investments is
undertaken directly by each companylauthority, in whose balance sheet the
associated assets and liabilities are entered. Contributions to investment
generated from tariff revenues are channelled from KPLC to the other
company/authorities through annual development surcharges earmarked for specific
projects during their construction period. RPLC currently pays surcharges for
the Olkaria Geothermal, Kiambere Hydro, and Turkwel Hydro projects, to KPC, TARDA
und KVDA respectively.
502     Following the ministerial reorganization (para. 1.03) of March 1988,
the Government intends to transfer the power assets in operation and/or under
construction by TARDA (Masinga, Kiambere) and KVDA (Turkwel) to KPC. It is
further envisaged that KPC and TRDC will eventually be merged so that all fully
Government owned power generation assets are under one company. In the course
of the transfers, modifications of financing agreements with lending agencies
will become necessary. The Government has indicated that this will be done in



- 28 _
full conformity vith existing legal agreements and that lenders will be kept
informed as the reorganization progresses.

bI July 1 - June 30
The financial year up to and including 1985 was the calendar year, for the first
six months of 1986 separate accounts were prepared, and thereafter the financial
year was changed to begin July 1 and end June 30. T"e finsncial position of the
power industry is generally satisfactory and compares favnrably with that of
other countries in the region. While the exchange losses on foreign debt in
1985-87 temporarily reduced income and resulted in small losses for 1985-86,
preliminary results for 1987/88 suggest that the industry's net income as a
percentage of sales will be restored to pre-1985 levels.   Nevertheless the
industry's financial structure has come under some strain since 1985 as indicated
by a rather low current ratio of 1.08 in 1986/87, and a more highly leveraged
capital structure. The industry's reasonable cash position, reflected by a debt
service coverage ratio of above 2 and contributions to investments (after debt
service and working capital increases) averaging 25Z during 1985-87. and the high
return on (unrevalued) assets is consistent with the book nature of the losses
incurred during these years. Returns on revalued assets (Table 5.1), although
lower than the 82 stipulated under an earlier Bank loan (2359-KE), need to be



- 29 -
seen in conjunction with the industry's contribution to .4nvestment and overall
financipl position. As mentioned in para. 501 the power industry is in part
privately owned and RPLC is paying income tax to the treasury and dividends to
its shareholders. During 1982-87, annual tax payments averaged KSh 72 million
and dividends RSh 23 million. Accounts receivable outstanding from electricity
consumers have averaged about 63 days of sales, which by regional standards is
quite low, indicating that KPLC's consumer related policies and systems are
functioning and that the company is enjoying a high degree of payment discipline
by its consumers.
5.04     As shown in Table 5.2 below, tariffs have generally kept pace with
inflation during the period 1980-88. While tariffs decreased by about 1OZ in
real terms between 1983 and 1986. this vas more than compensated by the increases
in 1987 and 1988 and the 1988 tariff is about 62 higher in real terms than the
1980 tariff.  During the next several years, RPLC plans to implement annual
tariff increases of RSh 0.O9/kVh, equivalent to about 72 p.a.  With the Kenya
rate of inflation forecast at about 5Z p.a., the trend of moderate real term
tariff increases can therefore be expected to continue, narrowing the gap between
the tariff and long run marginal costs (para. 1.07).

Financial Prospects
5.05     Projected financial statements for FY88-FY95 are presented in Annexes
5.1 through 5.3. Selected indicators through fY1994 are shown in Table 5.3.
Ssles projections are based on the median demand forecast of the NDPD, i.e. 5.32
per annum. Investment program and timing are also based on the NDPD. Tariffs
are based on annual increases of KSh 0.09/kWh, consistent with current KPLC
policy.  Annual tariff increases average about 7Z which is above the expected
long-term domestic inflation rate of 52 p.a. The projections indicate that under
these assumptions the power industry will be able to maintain a sound financial
position. The rate of return is expected to be around 5Z and contribution to
investment after debt service and working capital increases (excluding surplus
cash) is above 302. The debtldebt plus equity ratio should improve to well below
702. Current ratio and debt service coverage also show satisfactory values.
With tariff increases kept uniform to portray the trend of present policy, the
power industry's annual cash position fluctuates, but shows a cumulative surplus
of about RSh 1.2 billion (US$70 million) during the period from PY88-FY94. As
and when the surplus materializes, various parameters of sector activity could
be modified, including investment levels (rural electrification), borrowing and
dividend policy and tariffs.

Financial Covenants
5.06     The power industry's financial performance will be monitored during
project implementation as part of the portfolio management for the different Bank
projects in the power subsector (Ln 2359, Cr 1486). Agreement has been reached
with Government and RPLC that the power industry will (i) generate funds from
internal sources of not less than 252 in FY89, 272 in FY91 and 302 in PY94 and
thereafter (after debt service and working capital requirements) of its average
annual investment program for the year in question plus the following year; and
(ii) incur new debt only if a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.5
can be maintained, maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.1, and a debt/debt
plus equity ratio of not more than 75Z in FY90 and 702 in FY91 and thereafter.
The proposed financial covenants reflect the mixed public/private ownerships of
the industry.   While the cash contribution covenant is designed for public
utilities, the debt service, current and leverage ratios are designed to maintain
a sound financial position under essentially co m  rcial operating conditions.
The cash contribution covenant would replace the existing 8? return convenant
under LN 2359-RE. To achieve an 8? return on revalued assets in operation would
require tariffs above the long run marginal cost of power and generate large cash



- 31 -
surpluses in general and windfall profits to KPLC in particular.  In view of the
ownership structure of the industry the covenant is therefore less suitable for
ensuring a sound fiuancial performance of the sector.   The cash generation
covenant on the other hand, is not only consistent with current (satisfactory)
performance, but will be applied against * steady multi-annual investment program
with increasing trend, a situation for which it is well-suited.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Justification
6.01          The National 2ower Development Plan, prepared under the joint
Bank/UNDP ESMAP program, has ahown that geothermal generation is the least-cost
form of energy available in Kenya, by a significant margin. Based on operating
and investrant data from the existing geothermal units at Olkaria as well as the
geothermal industry elsewhere, the unit cost in Kenya for energy generated by
geothermal steam is estimated at about US$0.036/kWh.  This is 20-402 lower than
electrical energy from other sources. Unit costs are estimated at US$0.043/kwh
for the lowest cost hydro project, Miriu (other hydrosites are at or above
US$0.06/kWh) and at US$0.06/kWh for coal-fired steam projects, the lowest-cost
conventional thermal er.ergy; the long run marginal cost of power in Kenya is
estimated to be about 9 US cents per kMh. The internal economic rate of return
(ERR) of future geothermal power investments, based on successful drilling, is
estimated at about 112 if benefits are measured at the existing average tariff,
a minimum benefit level. Willingness-to-pay (14P) measured at the weighted
average benefit of incremental consumption to different classes of consumers,
is estimated at KSh 2.07/kWh, yielding an ERR of 23Z. Annex 6.1 gives details.
6.02     The geothermal generation facilities planned up to 2005 total 280 MW,
representing 28Z of the new capacity required until then.  This corresponds
closely with the portion of cumulative demand that is usually constant, i.e.
base-load.   Geothermal facilities will thus rarely be required to operate at
less than full output.   This is consistent with a continuous base-load
utilization of the geothermal resource, under which its economic benefits are
maximized.
6.03     A key aspect of the geothermal resource is the rate at which it can be
developed.   This is affected by both the drilling program and geologic
uncertainties.  The main benefit of the proposed project is that a domestic
resource base, on which power investments should be based if at all possible,
would be further explored and confirmed. Another important benefit would be the
continued strengthening of RPLC's geothermal capabilit.es--managerial,
scientific, and technical--so as to build the institutional framework necessary
for implementation of the geothermal program. A benefit with wider implications
is the skill and technology transfer associated with the drilling expertise built
up by KPLC, which could eventually be applied elsewhere in Kenya, including the
petroleum sector.
6.04     The project's energy component will strengthen systematic planning of
investments and pricing policy in the energy sector resulting in more efficient
use of fuels, and savings and resource mobilization for sector investments.



- 32 -
Ri.sla
6.05 All geothermal drilling under the proposed project takes place in an area
already producing steam, and therefere the risk of drilling dry wells is much
lower than for exploration in new areas. Out of 32 wells, nine make-up wells
are expected to be drilled in the existing production field with an estimated
success rate of 90Z. Sixteen production wells for the next power house (2x30
MW) would be drilled in Olkaria Northeast adjacent to the existing production
field. For this the estimated success rate is about 802 because tne reservoir
underneath has been delineated and reserves of at least 45 MV have already been
proven. The three assessment wells to be drilled in West Olkaria and the four
investigatory wells to be drilled in Eburra have a higher risk factor with an
estimated success rate of only 50X. Drilling program, results and performance
will be reviewed semi-annually (para. 4.07) to determine whether modifications
are necessary. These Laviews adequately address the drilling risks and limit
the exposure of KPLC should the drilling results be unsatisfactory.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Agreements Reached
7.01        The following agreements have been reached with Government and
KPLCIF.PCs

Drill development wells for first 30 KW unit (for commissioning
during period 6/92-6194; drill initial wells for 2nd 30 MV unit (for
commissioning during period 6/93-6195). Wells initially to be drilled into
rprovenm zone bounded by wells 702, 705 and northern border of EPF. Wells
eatimated to average 2.0 to 2.5 MU. Approximately 10 MW currently
available from wells 701 (4.2 MW), 702D (2 KW), 705 (2.7 KW), and 706
(untested). Therefore, additional initial deliverability of about 20 KW
and 50 MW needed, plus 15-20Z standing reserve.

V Olkaria
Drill up to three assessment wells, to confirm field areas for
future development and to allow preliminary assessment of reserves and
deliverabilaity. Average well yield expected to be in range 1.5 to 2.5 MW.
Estimated drilling success rate of 0.5.
Ebur?u
Drill four to eight exploration wells to 2,500 m depth, to
determine existence of commercial geothermal resource. Program to be
reviewed after fourth well, with decision to continue or abandon drilling.
Estimated success rate of 0.25 to 0.5 (one or two producible wells of four
to be drilled).
Fluid Disposal by Iniection
It is expected that injection of up to 502 of the total mass of
produced geothermal fluid ultimately will be required at both the Existing
Production Field (EPP) and NE Olkaria in order to help maintain pressure in
the reservoir. Injection probably will take place into unsuccessful
production wells, especially those at or beyond the field boundary.
Injection tests a.e beginning at the EPF, and are planned for 2989-90 at NE
Olkaria. One permeable injection well probably will accept effluent from
four to eight production wells, at least initially, depending upon fluid
enthalpy, mass flow rate and percentage of produced mass to be injected.
At present it is not planned to drill any wells specifically for injection.

tg) Engineering study of the 2s30 MV powerhouse to include final
analysis of the reserve availability at the NE Olkaria field.
Energy Component
2.       The energy component will consist of:
(a)   An engineering report for the Lower Hiriu Weir and 46 HW power
station.
(b)   An optimization study of the Miriu-Sondu basin.  The first phase of
the study will be to identify and recommend to Government a scheme
of hydro development for the basin which optimizes the development
potential for hydropower, irrigation and flood control.  If an
economic scheme can be identified, then the second phase of the work
will consist of a feasibility study of the recommended scheme.
Cc)   A study to prefeasibility level of Kenya's remaining undeveloped but
most promising hydresites, estimated to be about five in number.
These will be selected following a preliminary analysis of about
twelve sites, which will be economically evaluated taking into
account the cost of developing each site, and the resulting benefits
to Kenya of energy generation, flood control, irrigation and any
other identifiable benefits of site development.
Cd) An energy pricing study to recommend an appropriate pricing
structure for energy products, based on long-run economic costs with
a view to encouraging the efficient use and supply of energy by and
to the various sectors of the economy.
(e)   A  national  rural  electrification  study which  will  focus  on
construction and maintenance cost minimization, ideal levels of
network voltage, capacity and routing methodology, and economic
methods of rural house wiring and metering.
(f)   A feasibility study for the storage, transport, distribution and
marketing of LPG.

GIOTHERMAL DZVELOPHENT AND ENERGY PREINVESTMENT PROJECT
Estimation of Economic Rate of Return for the Proiect
1.       If electricity is valued at the existing average tariff of XSh 1.09/kWh,
the economic rate of return on the project assuming as planned that the steam
produced will be used to generate power from a 60 MV plant, has been estimated
at 10.7Z. However, using average tariffs provides only a minimum measure of the
benefits associated with the project.  A more realistic measure of the rate of
return can be obtained by estimating consumer willingness-to-pay (VTP) for
incremental electricity sales.  A conservative estimate of WTP can be derived
as follows: For residential and street lighting, assume the weighted average
tariff rate for incremental consumption in the respective tariff categories,
while for industrial and commercial consumers, assume the incremental operating
cost of captive diesel plant--resulting in a weighted average WTP of KSh 2.07
per kWh. On this basis the economic internal rate of return 1EIRR) is estimated
to be about 232. However, it should be stressed that this is still only a
partial measure of EIRR. The use of weighted average tariff rates of incremental
consumption in the residential and street lighting categories means that WTP is
underestimated since it generally excludes any measures of consumer surplus.
