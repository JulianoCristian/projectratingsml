the groundwork for universal\n            basic education by upgrading the quality of primary\n            education, improving resource allocation, increasing\n            enrollments, strengthening institutions, and facilitating\n            future planning. There are five project components. The\n            first reinforces human resources capacity by training school\n            teachers, school administrators, state and local education\n            agency staff, procurement and financial management staff,\n            and television production staff. The second component\n            improves the school environment by setting up focus schools\n            provided with furniture and equipment whose attendance will\n            be determined by local communities; and by funding self-help\n            projects to promote increased access, equity, and quality.\n            The third component improves the quality and availability of\n            curriculum materials. The fourth component develops an\n            enhanced information base for decisionmaking to lay the\n            groundwork for universal basic education. The fifth\n            component uses the mass media to increase HIV/AIDS awareness\n            among school staff, children, and communities."}, "docdt": "2000-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
