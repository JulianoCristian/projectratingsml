Lessons\n            learned: The project was designed during aftermath of the\n            military government and implemented during a transition time\n            by the democratically elected government. This placed\n            restrictions on what the project could realistically\n            achieve. The sub-projects were scaled-up from 740 Focus\n            Schools (FS), this scale-up helped to build momentum within\n            the community and also led to increased interest by the\n            local communities. The project supported community schools\n            with funds for non-personnel expenditure to be used directly\n            by the head teachers to carryout projects identified by the\n            communities. The self-help approach seemed to be potent in\n            improving retention of pupils as well as parents and\n            community involvement in school activities. Improving\n            quality of instruction in the classroom requires concerted\n            and long term efforts. While having the right political\n            environment is necessary, it is not sufficient to transform\n            the structures, attitudes and values that are at the root of\n            social inequalities and injustices. It is important to have\n            the appropriate capacity building activities before project\n            is declared effective."}, "docdt": "2005-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
