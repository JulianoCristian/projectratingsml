About this Report
       The lndependentEvaluationGroupassessesthe programsandactivities of theWorld Bankfor two purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrity of the Banksself-evaluationprocessandto verify that the Bank'swork is producingthe
expected results,andsecond, to help developimproveddirections, policies, andproceduresthrough the
disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As partof this work, IEGWBannually assessesabout 25 percentof
the Bank's lendingoperationsthroughfield work. Inselectingoperations for assessment, preference is givento those
that are innovative,large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudiesor country evaluations;those for
which Executive Directorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments; andthose that are likelyto generate
importantlessons.
       To preparea ProjectPerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR),IEGWBstaff examine projectfiles and other
documents, interviewoperationalstaff,visit the borrowing country to discuss the operationwith the government,
and other in-country stakeholders,and interviewBank staff and other donor agency staff bothat headquartersand
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subjectto internalIEGWBpeer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commented onby the responsibleBank department. IEGWB incorporatesthe comments as
relevant. The completedPPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers'comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Boardof Executive Directors.After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosedto the public.

About the IEGWBRatingSystem
       IEGWB's use of multipleevaluationmethods offersboth rigoranda necessary levelof flexibilityto adaptto
lendinginstrument,project design,or sectoralapproach. IEGWBevaluatorsall apply the same basic methodto
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definitionand ratingscale usedfor each evaluationcriterion
(additionalinformationis availableon the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extentto whichthe operation's major relevantobjectives were achieved, or are expectedto
be achieved, efficiently.The ratinghas three dimensions: relevance,efficacy,and efficiency. Relevanceincludes
relevanceof objectivesand relevanceof design.Relevance of objectivesis the extent to which the project's
objectivesare consistentwith the country'scurrent development prioritiesand with current Bank country and
sectoralassistance strategies and corporategoals (expressedin Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers,Country
AssistanceStrategies,SectorStrategy Papers,Operationat Policies).Relevanceof design is the extent to which
the project'sdesignis consistentwith the stated objectives. Efficacy ISthe extent to which the project'sobjectives
were achieved, or are expectedto be achieved,taking into account their relativeimportance.Efficiencyisthe
extent to which the project achieved, or is expectedto achieve,a returnhigher than the opportunitycost of capital
and benefitsat leastcost compared to alternatives.The efficiencydimension generallyis not appliedto adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Riskto Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that developmentoutcomes(or
expectedoutcomes)will not be maintained(or realized). Possibleratingsfor Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant,Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extentto which services providedby the Bank ensuredquality at entry of the
operationand supportedeffective implementationthroughappropriatesupervision(includingensuring adequate
transitionarrangements for regularoperationof supported activities after loanlcreditclosing,towardthe
achievement of developmentoutcomes. The ratinghastwo dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possibleratingsfor Bank Performance: HighlySatisfactory, Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      BorrowerPerformance: The extentto which the borrower(includingthe governmentand implementing
agency or agencies) ensuredquality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenantsand
agreements,towardthe achievement of development outcomes. The ratinghas two dimensions:government
performance and implementingagency(ies)performance. Possibleratingsfor Borrower Performance:Highly

PREFACE

        This is the Project PerfonnanceAssessment Report (PPAR) for the Nigeria
Second PrimaryEducationProject andthe Nigeria UniversalBasic EducationProject.
The first operation was financed through IDACreditNo. 3346 inthe amount ofUS$55
million (SDR40.1 million) andwithplanned government contributiono fUS$3.5 million.
The credit was approved on May 11,2000, became effective on August 21,2000, and
was 97 percent disbursed when it closed on schedule on December 31,2004. The second
operation was financed through IDA CreditNo. 3711inthe amount o fUS$lOl.O million
(SDR76.3 million), a grant o fUS$l5.0 millionfrom the UnitedKingdom Department for
InternationalDevelopment, and withplanned contributionso f govement (US$13.O
million). The credit was approved on September 12,2002, became effective on
November 10,2003, andwas closed early on June 30,2006 (2 years ahead o f schedule)
with SDR 27 millioncancelledfrom the remainingcredit. Thesetwo projectswere
chosen for a PPARbecauseo ftheir importance to Nigeria's development strategy andto
Africa's achievement o f Educationfor All (EFA).

        The findings ofthis assessmentare based on a three-week mission to Nigeria
conducted by the Independent EvaluationGroup (IEG), from October 22 - November 9,
2007. The missionmet inAbuja with authorities and staff o fthe Federal Ministryof
Education, the Universal Basic EducationCommission, and development partners. The
missionalso visited schoolproject sites inthe states o f Imo, Kano, Kaduna, Niger and
Nasarawa as well as the Federal Capital Territory, where itmet with education
authorities, teachers, principals and students and assessed education inputs andactivities
supported bythe Bank. A list o fpersons interviewed is given inAnnex C. Key sources
o f evidence consulted include: (a) World Bankproject files; (b)project-related reporting
andevaluation; and (c) education data, studies, surveys andresearchbythe government
anddevelopment partners.

        The IEGteam gratefully acknowledges the assistanceand support o fthe resident
missionprofessional staff and, particularly, Ms. Ngozi Malife for her assistance in
expeditingthe work ofthe mission. A special acknowledgement i s due to allthose inthe
Government and donor community who made time for interviews andprovided
documents andinformation.

        Following standardIEGprocedures, copy o fthe draft PPARwas sent to the
relevant government officials and agencies for their review and feedback. Their
comments are presented inAnnex D.

 SUMMARY

        Nigeria i s a large country (140 millionpeople 2006) with a complex federal
 structure with 36 states that has a direct bearingon the problems andprospects o fthe
education sector. Education i s a concurrent responsibility o fthe federal, state, andlocal
governments, although the division o fresponsibility is still not clear, creating problems
for governance andmanagement ofthe education sector. Within this complex
institutionalenvironment, the education system faces challenges o f expanding access and
restoring quality after years of deterioration o finfrastructure, materials andhuman
resources.

 SecondPrimary EducationProject

         The objectives ofthe SecondPrimaryEducationProject (PEP2) were to assist
Nigeria in: (a) strengthening the humanresource capacity inprimary schools; (b)
creating an environment conducive to effective teachingandlearninginits primary
schools; (c) improvingthe quality andavailability o f curriculum and other instructional
materials inthe primaryschools; (d) developinganenhanced information base to
facilitate decision-making; and (e) increasing national awareness o f AIDS.
         The project experienced a slow start-up due to project staff capacity andperiodic
problems with provisiono f counterpart funds. Staffwas added andtrained, counterpart
funds problems were resolved and a mid-term review restructured andreallocated funds
to community-based self-help schemes. Implementationthenwent as plannedwiththe
project disbursing the full credit amount by closingin2004. Duringthe last two years
4,500 teachers were trained, 10,354 classrooms were rehabilitatedas part o f community
self-help projects, and 1,110 focus schools received curriculum materials. The
Monitoring andEvaluation subcomponent conducted the school census, processed the
data and organized the EducationManagement Information System (EMIS). The
HIV/AIDS component produced a large amount o f materials.

        The outcome o fPEP2is rated moderately unsatisfactory, basedon substantial
relevance, modest efficacy, andmodest efficiency. The achievement of the first three
objectives was rated modest, andthe achievement o fthe other two was ratednegligible.
The major achievement was an increase inenrollment inproject schools from
830,580 (2000) to 1.1 million(2004), an increase o f 34 percent versus the target of 15
percent. However, learningoutcomes inthe project schools did not increase
significantly, the standardized test inthe project schools going from a score o f 35 percent
(2000) to 38 percent (2004). The efficacy ofthe HIV/AIDSand self-help subcomponents
could not be evaluated due to lack of data.

        Bankperformance was satisfactory. The qualityat entry was satisfactory asthe
Bankrecognizedthe difficult institutional environmentfor projectimplementation and
made provisions for institutional development. The Bank responded appropriately when
the project got offto a slow start. After mid-term review and some restructuring,
implementation improved dramatically due inlarge part to the quality o f supervision
support bythe Bank. Borrower performancewas rated satisfactory. After initial start-up
problems, capacity constraints were addressedby appointing more skilledproject staff

andprovidingnecessarytraining. The riskto development outcomes i s rated as
moderate.

UniversalBasic EducationProject

        The objectives o fthe UniversalBasic EducationProject (UBEP) were to: (a)
support implementationo fNigeria's universalbasic education program; (b) strengthen
the country's capacity to provide quality schooling; and(c) raise primary school
admission, completion, andtransitionrates, with a priority to the poorest areas. The
project hadtwo major components, one for the federal level andthe other for the 16
participating states, with numerous activities (10 for federal and 8 for the states).

        The projectraninto implementationproblems almost immediately. Although
approved inSeptember 2002, the project didnot become effective untilNovember 2003
because ofbureaucracy andthe election cycle, resulting inthe loss o f more than one year
for implementation. The TA aimed at institutional capacity building, financed by DFID,
was not well coordinated withthe project objectives to beginwith. Thus another year
was lostto slow implementation. The mid-term review inJune 2005 proposed
restructuring, which helpedto accelerate progress, but not to the point o fmakingupfor
the first two years o fproblems. Thus the government requested that the Bank close the
project two years early and cancel 35 percent o fthe credit. The project was closed on
June 30,2006 after having disbursed US$44.6 million.

        The FederalComponent deliveredvery little o f its intendedoutputs, disbursing
only 17percent o f its fundsbyproject closing. The State Component respondedbetter to
the restructuring, which allocated more funds to community self-help schemes, with
4,250 classroomblocks beingbuilt andrefurbished. Two milliontextbooks and 50,000
sets of learningmaterials were distributed. However, these self-help schemes were not
evaluated under the monitoringandevaluation activities, andno learningassessmentwas
carried out as underPEP2. The learning assessment was not includedinthe Monitoring
andEvaluationdesign since itwas felt that underthis first decentralized education project
state capacity andresources were lacking. The admission, completion andtransitionrates
fell short ofthe targets.

        Theprojectoverall outcome was ratedunsatisfactory, basedon substantial
relevance, negligible efficacy andmodest efficiency. The first objective was not rated,
since it was treated as an over-arching objective that relies uponthe achievement o f the
two more precisely stated objectives. The achievement ofboththe second andthird
objectives was rated negligible, with botho fthese objectives falling short o f their targets.
The performance of both the Bank andthe borrower was also ratedunsatisfactory. The
quality at entry was unsatisfactory. Duringsupervision the Bankwas slow to recognize
andrespondto problems developingwiththe TA. The borrower also showed lack of
commitment to the project by delays insigning, meetingconditions o f effectiveness and
providing counterpart funds. Giventhe weak institutional capacity at the start o f the
project, and limitedprogress on institutional capacity duringproject implementation, the
risk to development outcomes is significant.

Lessons

    Good performanceduringimplementation cannot make up for fundamental
    design flaws ina project inwhich component activities are not well aligned with
    the project development objectives (PDOs). UBEP suffered from too much
    complexity and spread limitedresourcestoo thinly amongthe 16 states andnumerous
    federal agencies. The states didnot have the capacity to implement such a complex
    design and spreading the resourcestoo thinly didnot allow for reachingthe critical
    mass neededto have a catalytic impactuponthe system;

    Lack of readiness for implementation cannot be compensated for by imposing
    many conditions of effectiveness. Inhindsightthe UBEPwas not really ready to
    start implementationat the time o f Boardapproval andthe introductiono f conditions
    o f effectiveness could not makeup for this lack of readiness;

    Technical assistance (TA) needs to be closely aligned with the project
    development objectives and institutional capacity gaps, and closely supervised
    by the Bankand eo-financiers to prevent itfrom driftingaway from PDOs.
    Although the TA was implemented by the DFIDcontractors, the Bankdidnot
    exercise close monitoring and evaluation initially. The broadly statedTOR ledthe
    TA providers to focus initially on school development andnot onthe strategic
    management competencies neededto manage a Bank supported project; and

n   Effective monitoring and evaluation of learningoutcomes require a long lead
    time to design and develop and thus need to b e addressed early inproject design
    along with PDOs. A major shortcoming inthe UBEPdesign was its failure to build
    uponthe measures o flearning assessmentbuilt into PEP2. Learning assessments, or
    other measures for monitoring quality o f outcomes, can be usedto feed back into the
    improvement o f curriculum, teaching and school management.

Perspectivesfor On-going and Future Support

        There is a net positive contribution o fBanksupport for the education sector o f
Nigeria. The Bankneeds to stay engaged inthe education sector for the longterm.
However, this long-term engagement has serious resource implications interms o f
economic and sector work, project preparation and supervision, monitoringand
evaluation of quaIity, especially ifa decentralized approach such as inthe ongoing State
Education Sector Project is to be scaled-up. Effective partnerships betweenthe
Government andDevelopment Partners and among the Development Partners canhelp
alleviate the resource constraints to some extent, but careful sector analysis and
management will be needed to set achievable and relevant goals.

1. BACKGROUNDAND CONTEXT

GENERAL     BACKGROUND

1.1 Nigeria's complex federal structure andits struggle to achieve social cohesiveness
have a direct bearingonthe problems andprospects o fthe education sector. After
gaining independence in 1960with four regions (roughly reflecting its major ethnic
groups) under a parliamentary democracy, the devastating civil war o fthe late 1960s led
to a series o fmilitary governments with only brief civilian interlude during 1979-83*.
There was also a proliferationinthe number of states created over the years inanattempt
to give Nigeria's various religious and ethnic groups more equitable voice inthe affairs
o fnational, state andlocal government. Changes inthe constitutionhave given riseto
the present situationinwhich there are 36 states plus the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)
o fAbuja under a presidential style Federal Government o fNigeria (FGN) with an
independent legislativebranch (house and senate) andjudiciary. While Nigeriai s a large
country with anestimated population o f 140million(2006 census), this i s a large number
o f states when compared to other federated countries such as Brazil(26 states for a
populationo f 184millionin2006) or India (28 states for a population o f 1.1billionin
2006). Withinthis constitutional arrangement, education is specified as a concurrent
responsibility o fthe federal, state andlocal governments, althoughthe division o f
responsibility is still not clear, creating problems for governance andmanagement o fthe
education sector.

1.2 Inearly 1998, withthe sudden death ofthe last militaryheadof state, there began
the transitionto civilian government. Inearly 1999, the transitionfrom militaryto
civilianrule was completed withthe election and inaugurationo f President Olusegun
Obasanjo after almosttwo decades o fmilitaryrule. Most observers o fNigeriawould
characterize the years o fmilitary rule as showing deteriorating economic conditions
(despite having significant oil resources), increasing inefficiency andcorruption, as well
as reductions incivil liberties2. This took its toll on all aspects o fNigerian society, the
education sector included. Thus the transitionto anelected civilian government brought
about optimism for Nigeria's future, andthe Bank andother Development Partners (DPs)
againresumed a more active partnership with the FGNafter years o fonly minimal
involvement. Itis an encouraging signthat two more civilian elections were held, in
2003 re-electing President Obasanjo, and in2007 electingthe current President Yar'adua.

GOVERNMENT        EDUCATION       POLICY AND STRATEGY

1.3    In1999President Obasanjo announcedamajorneweducation initiative offree and
compulsory Universal Basic Education(UBE) to be achieved by2015. Nigeria had

1990sinNigeriaupto the inauguration of the new civilianpresident in 1999. The book also draws upon
scholarly work as well first hand experiences ofmanyNigerians.

signed onto the Educationfor All (EFA) declarations in 1990 (Jomtien) and 2000 (Dakar)
as well as the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs) in2002. Nigeria's formal
education system has a 6-3-3-4 structure with six years o fprimary school, three years of
junior secondary school, three years o f senior secondary school and four years o ftertiary
education. Basic education as defined inNigeria includes6 years ofprimary education
plus3 years ofjunior secondary education. Therationalefor goingbeyondthe goal of
Universal PrimaryEducation (UPE) to that ofUBEwas the necessity for laying a firm
humancapitalfoundation for the economic growth strategy Nigeriaispursuing. The
necessary levels o fliteracy andnumeracy as well as other life skills would require at least
the basic education level. Then students could continue to 3 years o f senior secondary
education or proceedto some type o f training to prepare them for the job market.

 1.4 Nigeriahad come close to achieving UniversalPrimary Education (UPE) duringthe
 1970swhen a booming oil sector allowed for rapid expansion o f educational facilities.
However, throughout the 1980sand 1990seconomic decline set inas oil prices fell and
economic mismanagement and corruptionbecame a too familiar pattern. Financingfor
education was inadequate, andthe gains inprimaryeducation were lost3. Teachers were
not beingpaid and teacher attendancebecame a serious problem. Schoolbuildings
deteriorated andtextbooks andmaterials were inshort supply. Thus, in 1999President
Obasanjo declared the UBEpolicy o fthe government to rectify this dismal situation in
the education sector.

 1.5  Looking at trends inprimary school enrollment, it appearsthat the euphoria
surrounding the endo f militaryrule andthe UBEdeclaration could have had some effect,
inter alia. Total enrollment inprimary education fluctuated duringthe 1990s,andthen
showed a markedincrease startingin 1998 with a muchlarger one in 1999 inthe year
2000 followedby a levelingoffin2001 (see Table 1.1 below).

   World Bank (2004) points out that data from a sample o f 12 states suggestthat education spendingwas
about 2.3 percentof GDP inthe late 199Os, a significant decline from previous decades and low compared
to most other African countries. .
   World Bank (2004) gives a good analysis o fthe sources and problems of Nigerian education statistics
that make it difficult to get a good picture o fthe sector.

1.6 The Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) was formed bypresidential
decree in2001 (andby law in2004) inorder to expeditethe rapid implementation ofthe
UBEprogram. UBEC is aparastatalagencylegally underthe FederalMinistryof
Education(FMOE) althoughit enjoys a considerableamount ofautonomy withrespectto
its budget and operational authority. It i s the successorto a similar parastatal,the
National Primary Education Commission (NPEC), formed duringthe 1990sto facilitate
the drivefor UPE. Correspondingto the federallevel UBEC there are State Universal
Basic EducationBoards (SUBEBs). These state level boardsas well as the State
Ministries of Education(SMOEs) work withthe Local Government Authorities (LGAs)
andthe LocalGovernment EducationAuthorities (LGEAs) to provide education, thus
creatinga complex institutional environment withinwhich individualprimary schools
mustfunction andBanksupportededucationprojects, suchasthe two underassessment
here, must na~igate.~

WORLDBANKSUPPORT

1.7 The Bankhas beeninvolvedinthe educationsector inNigeria sincethe 1960s
whenitfirst started lending for education. There were three educationprojects inNigeria
inthe late 1960s/early 1970s,butthenNigeriadidnot borrowmuchafter that becauseoil
revenues were increasing significantly during that time. Nigeriaused its increasingoil
revenues duringthe 1970sfor reconstruction after the civil war inthe late 1960sand
made significant progressinexpandingeducationenrollment, inparticular almost
achieving universalprimary education. However, as the oil price decline ofthe 1980s
took place, the education sector faced budgetarypressures that didnot allow for
sustainingthe previous progress. Duringthe 1980sthe situation ofprimary educationin
particular deteriorated, andyears ofmilitary government after 1983withmismanagement
andcorruptionmadethe situation worse.

1.8    Economic and sector work (ESW) in 1987documentedthe issues facedbythe
educationsector.6 Although the Bank also supportedother education sub-sectors, suchas
the FederalUniversities Development Project (1990), the sector work ledto afocus on
primaryeducation andthe preparationofthe first PrimaryEducationProject (total cost
US$158.4 millionequivalent, 1991-2000). PEP1hadfive objectives: (a) upgradethe
quality ofprimary education; (b) improve resourceallocation to allow for more non-
salary spending; (c) increase enrollments; (d) strengthen public institutions responsible
for primary education; and(e) stimulate future planning for the next phaseofthe



 For more detail onthe institutional reforms and developments since 1999,see World Bank(2007), which
provides a comprehensive matrix describing the allocation o feducation functions andresponsibilities to
various levels of government. While that is too complex to quickly summarize here, this mustbetaken into
accountwhen designingand implementing education projects, especially a decentralized one such as
UBEP.
6"Nigeria: Primary Education Subsector Study", June 30, 1989 (Report No. 7389-UNI). No education
ESWwas done duringthe 1990sand duringpreparation ofPEP2. Only duringthe preparation ofUBEP
was there more ESW, published later as two separate sector reports inthe Afiican Human Development
series-- World Bank(2004) already cited and Orbach (2004) dealing with organizational capacity to
deliver UBE.

                                            4


program. The project hadthe following components aimed at the above objectives: (1)
ProvisionofBookdMaterials and Teacher Training for Quality PrimaryEducation, (2)
ImprovingResource Allocation through the National Primary EducationFundand Local
Cost Sharing, (3) Increasing Enrollmentsthrough "enlightenment" campaigns, and (4)
Strengthening InstitutionalCapacities inmanagement, planningand establishing a
management information system (MIS).      The Bank was one o fthe few external donors
who remained engagedineducationinNigeria duringthe 1990s andfollowed only alow
scenario assistancestrategy that allowed for support to education andhealth.

1.9 The PEP1 got offto a slow start andby 1997 (the original closing date) had
disbursed only 10percent o fthe US$120 million credit. The FGNrequested and
receivedanextension o f the credit closing date in 1997, but also canceled US$30 million
o fthe original credit. The performance o fthe project improved, resulting incompletion
o fthe projectby 2001 with full disbursement o fthe remaining credit after 10years o f
implementation. However, the project overall was still rated unsatisfactory as the more
rapid implementationand disbursement over the last years didnot make up for the
problems experienced throughout most ofthe project, such as extremely slow
procurement o ftextbooks.

1.10 The objectives andcomponent activities under PEP1were continued into the
Second Primary EducationProject (PEP2), the UniversalBasic EducationProject
(UBEP) andeventhe recentlyapproved State EducationSector Project(SESP), albeit
under differing institutionalandimplementationdesigns. As the focus shifted from
universalprimaryto universalbasic education, many institutional changes took place and
the implementing agencies have changed, butthe overall goals andimplementation
challenges have remained remarkably constant over the past decade or so.

OTHERDONOR       SUPPORT

1.11 Othermajor donors resumed support for education inNigeriaafter thereturnto
civilian government in 1999. The PPAR does not have a quantitative compilation o f all
donors financing, but meetings withthe maindonors gave a qualitativeunderstanding o f
the role of donor support for education. The UK's Department for International
Development (DFID) i s one o fthe major partners inBank supported projects as well as
runningits own set ofprograms. DFIDwas a co-financier o fthe UBEPas well as the
newly approved SESP. The UnitedStates Agency for InternationalDevelopment
(USAID) i s supporting primaryeducation, focusing on a few states, andis also actively
supportinga number o ftechnical areas o feducational activities, e.g, improving education
statistics andtheir dissemination. The Japanese Agency o f InternationalCooperation
(JICA) is supporting the construction o fprimary schools inthree states (Kaduna, Plateau
andNiger) inadditionto strengthening science andmathematics education. UNESCO
has helped inproviding sciencekits made from localmaterials, andUNICEF has been
promotingprograms o f education for girls. The African DevelopmentBank(AfDB) has
also beeninvolvedinsupporting the areas o f skills training anddevelopment for Nigerian
youth, aproblemthat is gettingmore serious withrapidpopulationgrowtho fabout 2.3
percent and the increasing numbers o fprimary andjunior secondary graduates. It
appears from the Country Partnership Strategy (2005) that, after the Bank, which i s the

largest donor, DFID, JapanandUSAID are the largestinreIative magnitudesfor the
educationsector.


2. SECOND PRIMARYEDUCATIONPROJECT

OBJECTIVES      AND DESIGN

2.1 The secondPrimaryEducation Project was approvedon May 11,2000 for US61.1
million andbecameeffective onAugust 21,2000. Itwas financed by a US$55.0 million
equivalent IDA credit (or 40.1 million SDh) with a government counterpart contribution
ofUS$6.1 millionequivalent. According to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA),
the objectives of PEPwere to assistNigeriain:7

      a)      strengtheningthe human resourcecapacity inprimary schools;

      b)      creatinganenvironment conductive to effective teaching and learninginits
              primary schools;

      c)      improving the quality and availability of curriculum andother instructional
              materialsinthe primary schools;

      d)      developing anenhancedinformation baseto facilitate decision-making; and

      e)      increasingnational awareness ofAIDS.
2.2      The projectwas national inscope, designedto assist all 36 states, andits
objectives were inline with the poverty reduction andimprovedsocial services goals of
the InterimCountry StrategyNote (April2000). PEP2 consistedof five componentsand
various subcomponents of activities that closely matchedeachofthe objectives (see Box
2-1).

2.3      PEP2 started off during a difficult time ofpoliticaltransition from military to
civilian government. Itwas designedto beimplementedunder adecentralized
environment with fiscal federalism as a guiding principle andthe states were also keento
assert their constitutional authority inthe domain of education after years o f central
control. PEP2was designedas a bridgingproject betweenPEPl and a future UBE
project with the intentof injecting muchneededresourcesintothe primary education
system across all ofthe 36 states. There was no major ESWthat fedintothe preparation
ofthe project, which was preparedinonly six months duringlate 1999. Since PEPl
performed well with respectto increased disbursementsand outputs inits last two years
(although unsatisfactory overall interms of outcomesandsustainability over the whole
timeperiod 199I-2000), the ideawas to continue those activities inorderto provide
immediate Bank support to the newly elected civiliangovernment, while preparationwas
ongoing for the UBEP. However, the AIDS awareness objective ofPEP2 was a

IMPLEMENTATION

2.4 The National Primary EducationCommission (NPEC) hadbeenthe implementing
agency for PEPl.However, the Universal Basic EducationCommission (UBEC), created
in1999,was responsiblefor implementingPEP2. Although some staffremainedfrom
NPEC, the UBEC lacked experienceandcapacity at the outset. Further, over the four and
a halfyear duration ofthe project, there were three ministers ofeducation, two permanent
secretariesandtwo project coordinators. These factors ledto slow implementationand
disbursement. Thus, implementation ofthe project was ratedas unsatisfactory bythe
supervisionmission inOctober 2001, retaining that rating untilSeptember 2003.

2.5    The Mid-TermReview(MTR) mission(December 20,2002) restructured the
project andimprovedperformance. Itwas agreedthat resourcesbe allocated to faster
movingactivities, especially to the community-driven self-help activities. Credit Funds
were moved from Goods andEquipment(US$38.3 millionat appraisalversus US$17.4
actual) to the Self-Help Grant (Sub-component 2 of Component ByUS$3.7 million at
appraisalversus US$26.6 million actual) under local shopping procurement procedures.

                                                      7


The Special Account was increased from US$1.O millionto US$3.0 millionandthe
ceiling raised on items procured via local shopping from US$3.4 millionto US$21.8
million). This provedto be very popularas almost all communities wanted to make
physical improvementsor additions to school infrastructureand disbursements improved
rapidly as a result. The number o f focus schools was also increasedfrom 740 to 1,110.
The EarlyChildhoodEducationsubcomponent o f Component C was dropped and
replaced with a sub-component to addressprimary school age childreninnomadic
communities. The net effect o f restructuring left the development objectives unchanged,
butmoreemphasis (interms ofdisbursement) was placeduponComponent B(Teaching
andLearningEnvironment) above andits subcomponents.

2.6 After steady improvementindisbursements as a result o fthe restructuring at MTR
andcloser supervisionbythe Bank,the project movedback into satisfactory performance
by September 2003 andwas closed, as planned on December31,2004, with97 percent o f
disbursement, all physical targets met, andthe credit hlly disbursed (see Table 2.1
below for total project costs). The reallocationo f disbursement from goods to self-help
grants referredto above took place mainly withinthe Components 2 and 3, as self-help
schools were built and supplied(see note /a/ inTable 2.1 below). It should be notedthat
the original credit was SDR 40.1 million, at that time equivalent to US$55.0 million.
However, changes inthe exchangerates andthe composition o f currencies inthe SDR
basket wound upto be US$65.6 million.

Table 2.1: PEP2ProjectCostsby Component




Source:ICRfor PEP2 (2005)
/a/ The self-help activities are located inthis component. Giventhe large increaseinself-help according to
the disbursement categories as mentioned above, it i s puzzlingthat there i s no corresponding increase in
ComponentB. The largest increase inactual versus appraisal is inComponent C. A table that cross-
tabulatescomponents by disbursementcategory could help to resolve this puzzle, butthe mission couldnot
find such data.

2.7 The fiduciary andsafeguardsaspects o fthe project were appropriate and
satisfactory. According to the PAD, there were no particular safeguard issuesthe project
neededto address. Inthe PADthe project design recognizedfinancial management
weakness withinthe ProjectAccounts Section (PAS) o fthe Special Projects Unito f
UBEC, the implementing agency. To develop the capacity ofthe PAS to provide
fiduciary management, a FinancialAction Planwas developed which included
strengthening the capacity o fthe PAS to play its role.

2.8 The timingof outputs from the components all came inthe secondhalfo fthe
project as a result o fthe delays inthe first half. The MTR improved performance.
However, reviewingthe sequenceo fproject reports shows that the outputs of the first

                                              8


three components were delivered almost inthe same time frame inthe last two years o f
the project. Bythe last year o fthe project, muchteacher traininghadbeen done,
classrooms added andrenovated, and curriculum materials delivered, all of which could
have had some impact bythe end o fthe project.

MONITORINGEVALUATION
                AND

2.9    Design. The design o f M&E followed up on some features that were intendedto be
partofPEP1. The standardizedtests o fPEP1,althoughdeveloped andtested, were not
completed and so the administrationo fthese tests for the focus schools was incorporated
into the M&Eplans for PEP2. There was no provisioninthe design o fthe standardized
tests for a control group to compare to the focus schools. Inaddition, much o f the data
collectedfor PEPl was not collatedandanalyzed as plannedandthis activity was also
brought into PEP2. The designo f EMIS activities, tracking data on pupils, teachers, and
facilities, was intended to introduce new features that would leadto a better picture
nationwide o fprogress towards the goals o f EFA and UBE. There was no provisionfor a
design to evaluate the HIV/AIDS component andthe community self-help scheme was to
be evaluated, but no design was providedfor this evaluation.

2.10 Implementation. The implementation o f M&EinPEP2 had some important
achievements. The pre-test (baseline test) and post-test for learningachievement inthe
focus schools were administered as scheduled in2000 and2004. After a slow start-up,
the procurement o f computer andnetworking equipment, as well as software andtraining,
for the EMIS was also implementedfor the most part. The School Census, funded
mainly by the project, was also carried out to give a baseline year o f data for 2001 and
later for 2003. Within the states and federal ministries, capacity was created to collect,
analyze and distribute nation-wide statistics as part o f a credible education data system.
However, the planned monitoringandevaluation ofthe self-help sub-component, the
plans for which were not developed indetail inthe PAD, was not done.

2.1 1 Use of data for decision-making. The improved data, albeit still lacking inmany
important ways, was used inthe preparationo fthe UBEP (2002). While only the
baseline data was available for the preparation o fUBEP, the baseline data combined with
the project's compilation o f data from the late 1990swas usedinthe sector study on
enrollment trends by K.Hinchliffe (2004) that gave an improvedpicture o fthe situation
inprimary education for policymakers. Italso highlightedareasfor policy makerswhere
priorities should beplaced inimprovingthe data available. Later this improved data base
was used for preparation o fthe new SESP (2007) andthe EducationPublic Expenditure
Review (2007).


OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMESBY OBJECTIVE


Strengthen humanresources at the school level

2.12 The plannedtraining o f classroom andheadteachers was carried out following a
school based approach, meaningthe training takes place inthe schools or nearby so that
teachers can apply their training. This built upon similar activities under PEPl and

                                                      9


developed national and state level cadre o ftrainers. Overall about 4,500 classroom
teachers (versus target o f 4,000) received training innew methods o f curriculum delivery,
subject matter o f core curriculum andIearningassessmenthecordkeeping.* About 1,100
headteachers (versus target o f 1,000) were trained school management, procurement and
use o fEMIS. However, only 500 o fthe 1,110 focus schools prepared School
Development Plans as called for inthe project logframe.

2.13 Baseline data from the school census shows that attendance has risen from 70
percent in2000 to almost 100percent in2004. The PPARmission asked about teacher
attendanceat most ofthe schools visited (17 schools) andwas told that it would be about
90 percent or more (consistent withobservations o fthe missionifthe school was open).
While project inputs may have contributedto this improvement, other non-projectfactors
also intervened, the main one beingthe more regular payment o fteacher salaries.
Previously, non-payment o f salaries hadledto teacher strikes andpoor attendance. Now
strikes have beeneliminated.


Create a conducive environment for teaching and learning

2.14 There were 9,650 community self-help projects completed, especially after mid-
term restructuring, which ledto physical improvement inbadly run-down infrastructure.
One reason for the increase inself-help was the eliminationo fthe matching grant
requiredo fthe community. Repairingthese problems, andinmany cases, adding
classroom blocks alleviated overcrowding and ledto improvedpupilattendance as well.
As a result, 10,354 classrooms were rehabilitatedin5,177 schools (compared to about
50,000 public primary schools inthe country), 878 latrines were built and 599 schools
were providedwithwater wells. Yet, still muchmoreremainsto be done. Inmany
cases, the PPARmissionobserved damaged roofmgthat leakedduringrainy season and
was thus unusable for a large part o fthe year.

2.15 The mainoutcome o fthis component was the increase inenrollment inproject
schools from 830,580 (2000) to 1.1million(2004), an increase o f 34 percent versus the
target of 15 percent. This can be attributedinpartto the expanded facilities from
renovationactivities andthe increased attractiveness o fmore child friendly andbetter
equipped schools. However, a controlled comparison was not made withnon-project
schools.

Improve the quality and availability of curriculumand other instructionalmaterials
inthe primary schools

2.16 About 2.2 millionsupplementary readers were supplied to 1,110 schools, and 120
libraries were established with 2,000 books for central libraries. The PAD didnot specify
numericaltargets, except for providing 740 focus schools withthese supplementary



  Thisnumber o fteacherstrained mustbe a small percent ofthe total, probably less than 1percent. There
i s an estimate o f494,259 primary teachers o fschool year 2004/05 (PAD for SESP2007, which cites
FMOE andNEMIS). Reliable data onteacher employment trends is not available accordingto the
EducationPublic Expenditure Review.

                                                     10


materials, which was increasedto 1,110focus schools. The video program subcomponent
was also modified during restructuring to include InteractiveRadio Instruction (IN)for
nomadic andmigrantfishing communities. The IRIprogram hadnot reached the
classroom by project closure, but it was continued andmaterials were producedafter the
project.

2.17 Althoughthe libraries andsupplementary materials didnot receive a separate
evaluation, the teachers at schools visited bythe PPAR mission felt they were definitely
helpful, andthe mission observed a number o fwell maintainedlibraries, which were
beingusedby students ina few cases observed by the missionwhen school was in
session. A number o f INlessonswere produced which the PPARmissionobserved to
still be inuse, especially inscience lessons. This can be useful inthe early gradesto help
teachers who do not have indepthtraininginsubject areas like science. Instructional
radio programs were also introduced. The Nomadic EducationDepartment inKano
pointedout that this was especially used inthe activities for nomadic education, which
replaced the early childhood education sub-component duringmid-termrestructuring.
However, no systematic research or evaluationo fthe IRIwas carried out.


Developan enhancedinformation baseto facilitate decision-making

2.18 Better school data became available as result o f school censusesbeingcom leted.
There was baseline data for 2001 and followed upwith the 2003 School Census!                         The
PPARmissionvisitedthe EMIS departments inKano andKaduna states; they were still
functioning along with the computers andother equipment after project completion.
According to the UBEC coordinators at the nationallevel, most state level MIS's from
the project are functioning. Duringdiscussions withinterviewees, only the teacher-
trainingstudy seemedto have some impact as itwas commented uponby some people.
The main conclusion is that the National Certificate o f Education(NCE) does not provide
anappropriate qualification for primary school teachers. Insome respects, it over
qualifiesby presenting too much o f a theoretical training insubject matter, almost
university level. Inother respects it does not supply enough practical pedagogical
training for the real life situationo fNigerianprimary schools.

EnhanceHIV/AIDS awarenessnationally

2.19 A large amount andvariety ofmaterials were producedfor this purpose, including
943,500 copies o fposters were producedanddistributed, a radio/television campaign
withjingleswas developed, 1,000 copies ofthe FamilyLife andHealthEducation
(FLHE) curriculum were produced anddistributed, and450,000 copies of a booklet "Yes
to Life andN o to AIDS" were produced and distributed, aimed at teachers andtheir
students inthe last two grades o fprimary (ages 10, 11and overage students). One
hundredand eleven people were trained as master trainers andinturntrained 79,000
school teachers, headteachers, supervisors and LGApersonnel.



 The school censushad a very rich questionnaire of over 20 pages with many details on school
characteristics. Apart fiom the most basic tabulations on enrollment, teachers, etc., it hasnot yet been
exploited and fully analyzed for policy purposes.

2.20 Themission observed some ofthese posters inanumberofplaces, but not that
manyinthe schools visited. Although, when someheadteacherswere askedabout it,
they mentioned it as abigimprovementinattitudes and awareness. There was no
systematic monitoring andevaluationinthe project to helpjudge the ultimate success in
improving awareness. Thus, no indicatorsare available that could document the outcome
ofthe HIV/AIDS activities interms of actual increase inawareness. A number of
intervieweesrespondedto the PPAR missionthat the awarenesslevel hadbeenraised,
butthis isjust baseduponimpressionsnot backedupby datafrom a goodresearch
design. The fact that these activities were to be continued inUBEP indicatesthat much
still remainsto be done.

Impacton LearningOutcomes

2.21 Despite the satisfactory implementation resulting inimproved inputs and outputs,
the anticipated impact on learning achievement didnot materialize. The project
attemptedto addresslearning achievementby measuringbaselineandpost-project
achievement inthe 1,110focus schoolsfor grade 5 languageandmathematics. This
couldbeviewedas anoutcomeconnectedespeciallyto the first three objectives inthe
results chaino fthe Logical Framework. Teacher development, infrastructure provided
through self-help andimproved learningmaterials should show up inimproved learning.

2.22 The results showedonly amarginal increasefrom a standardizedscore of 35
percent in2000 to 38 percent in2004." There was no attempt at comparisonto a control
groupof a sample o fnon-project primary schools." The results of a larger study (World
Bank,2007d), which drew uponthe Monitoring ofLearningAchievement (MLA)
conductedinNigeria by UNICEF/UNESCO in1996and2003, showedlarger gains in
English language, although at still low levels, andmarginal gains inmathematics (see
Table 2.2). This larger study of learning achievement covereda random sample of all
primary schools.

2.23 The PPAR missionvisited 17 schools (from either PEP2 or UBEP) invarious cities
andnearbyrural areas. Thephysical condition ofalmost all ofthese schoolsvisited
could only be describedas poor to very poor, despite having participatedinself-help
projectsthat added classroomsor repairedmajor damage. Textbook availability varied,
butnonewas better thantwo children sharingabasic class6 Englishbook. The mission


loThemission requestedthe PCUto provide abreakdown oftest scoresby languageandmathematics.
This has not yet beenprovided.
l1Futureefforts at evaluationshouldinclude suchcontrolgroups. Efforts could alsobemadeto look at
state-levelprimary exams grade 6 for analysis and comparison. There is no longer any nationalprimary
school certificate, but some states have their own exam systems, e.g., the PPAR mission was told duringits
visit to Imo statethere is still aprimaryleavingexam.

                                                      12


conducted a rapidreading assessmentat the schools visited and found that only about 12
percent o fthe students tested could read fluently at the grade 6 level. l2

2.24 Giventhat PEP1 andPEP2 provided resources to schools over the time period
tested (1996 to 2004), larger gains from a low base inlearning achievement mighthave
been expected. However, the resources provided by these projects were small inthe
grandschemeofprimaryeducation needs inNigeria13andthey appearednotto have any
catalytic effect that would spill over into the sub-sector as a whole. The project logframe
was hoping for such a spillover, distinguishing focus schools, all schools and system
wide. Perhapsthe improvement ininputs/outputs was not enoughto crossthe threshold
neededto get the desired outcomes, even infocus schools. Another factor to consider i s
that enrollment increased inthe focus schools. An influx o f students from lower socio-
economic backgrounds can lower average learningoutcomes even ifthe quality o f
instruction is unchanged. Itis also possible that learningoutcomes for the poor could
increase even when the average learning outcomes remainunchanged or decline. Thus,
care i s neededininterpretingtrends inaverage learningoutcomes without other
information about the distribution o fresults.


3. UNIVERSALBASICEDUCATIONPROJECT

OBJECTmS ANDDESIGN

3.1    The $129 million UniversalBasic EducationProject (UBEP) was approved on
September 12,2002, and became effective onNovember 10,2003 withaninitialclosing
date o f June 30,2008. Itwas financed by a US$101million IDA credit with a
government counterpart contribution o fUS$13 million equivalent andDFIDgrant
financing o fUS$15 millionequivalent for the TA. The broadpurpose o fthe TA was to
develop andimplement a sustainable UBEprograminthe 16 states, withpriority onthe
educationally disadvantaged LGAs. The implementationarrangements for this TA
followed DFIDprocedures andpriorities andwere not sufficiently harmonizedwiththe
initial capacity needs o fproject entities, resulting inimplementationproblems (see para.
4.14). ExtensiveESW duringpreparationwas financed by a PHRD Grant o f




l2 The missionalso conductedrapidreading assessments for 23 students randomly chosenfrom some o fthe
grade 6 pupils. Only about 12 percento fthis sample (admittedly not scientific) couldreadnear grade level,
inlinewithwhat would beexpectedfromthe assessmentsabove. The methodusedwasto selectapassage
o f about 150to 200 words from their class 6 Englishtextbook. Only students ingrade 6 were selected (24
intotal) to keep some degreeof comparability. By grade 6 allpupilshave beenstudyinginEnglishsince
grade 3, while prior to grade 3 they started reading intheir mother language. The students read the passage
out loudand were timed onhow long they took, whether or not they read fluently or stumbled, andthen
were askeda few questions to check comprehension. They were assigneda score on a scale o f 1to 4 based
onreading fluency and comprehension. For a full explanation o frapidreadingassessmentmethodology,
see Abadzi et al. 2005.
l3The latestEducation Public ExpenditureReview (World Bank 2007c) estimatesthat for the nine states
covered inthe review an amount (US$178 million) close to 7 times larger than current total state and local
government spendingwill be neededannually for new infrastructureinbasic education duringthe next ten
years.

US$725,000 anda Norwegian Trust FundGranto fUS$254,600.'4 This projecttook 20
months to prepare versus 6 months for PEP2. The statement o fproject objectives varied
among the maindocuments-the          Project Appraisal Document (PAD) andthe DCA. The
statement inthe DCA i s the most clear among these and it is taken as the basis for
evaluation. The project's objectives were to: (a) support implementationofNigeria's
universal basic education program; (b) strengthen the country's capacity to provide
quality schooling; and(c) raiseprimaryschool admission, completion, andtransition
rates, with a priority to the poorest areas.

3.2 The first objective is an over-arching objective that relies on achievement o fthe
more precise statements o f objectives two andthree, especially interms o fthe
outcome/output indicators as given inthe Logical Framework (see Annex 1,PAD). The
second objective relates to the capacity to provide quality schooling. By implication
from the reference to the borrower's program o fUBEinthe DCA, quality must involve
most students achieving at an acceptable standard o f learning. Governmentdocuments
onUBEclearly state that learningachievement is currently very low andthe aim o fthe
UBEprogramisto restore quality interms oflearningachievement for the vast majority
o f students who complete their basic education. Thus, the UBEprogram o f the
government was concerned withincreasing learningachievement as well as universal
enrollment. However, improved learning outcomes are omitted from explicit mentionin
the PDOs andno indicatorsrelated to leaming outcomes are part of the project design, a
step backwards from PEP2inthis respect. The project had only two major components --
organized not by objective, but by implementer. Although the project hadno specific
sub-components as described inthe PAD, there was a list of eight activities that could be
ineachof 16stateprograms and 10activitiesatthe federal level (see Box 3-1). With
respectto the State components, the project had a decentralized design (the first one tried
inNigeriafor education) witheachstate expectedto design aUBEplanwithinwhich
these activities that could vary by state. Resources were provided for the federal
agencies, but there was no implementationplaninthe project documents.

IMPLEMENTATION

3.3     The UBEPalmost immediately raninto problems. Typically, there i s a period o f 90
to 120 days duringwhich the DCA should be signed by Government andBank
representatives. Although state and nationalelections were not scheduleduntilApril
2003, according to the Project SupervisionReports (PSRs), political activity relatedto
elections practically paralyzedthe federal bureaucracy by the end o f2002 (elections were
due inMarch2003). For whatever reason, there was not enough effort or ownership in
the FGNandFMEto expedite the D C A through the various bureaucratic steps to get it
signed. It was notedinthe first PSR (February 2003) that delayed signingof credits is a
problemacross the Nigeria portfolio andneededto be addressedinthe next Country
Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR). The PSRs at that time did not indicateany high
level pushfrom Bankmanagement to expedite the process. The project D C A was not
signed untilMay 2003, a full eight months after Board approval. Such a delay insigning
is often an indicationo f some significant issue concerningGovernment commitment to
the project, butinthis case, according to those interviewed, it appearedto be the Nigerian
political cycle and slow bureaucracy inthe year prior to an election.

3.4 The delay insigning was compounded bythe delay of over a year inproject
effectiveness, the next stage inthe legalprocess before the Credit funds canbe accessed.
Inlargepart, thiswas dueto the federalandstate governments havingdifficulty in
meeting stringent conditions o f effectiveness.l5Bank project staff andmanagement felt



l5There were seven conditions o feffectiveness for UBEP: (1) subsidiary agreementsbetween the FGNand
three states (of the 16participatingones); (2) three states (of the 16 participating ones) establish PCUs; (3)
Project ImplementationManuals adoptedbythe NPCUand three state PCUs; (4) independent auditor

                                                   15


the conditions were necessaryto ensure the project would be ready to implement. Butto
a significant degree, the difficulties inmeeting conditions o f effectiveness also stemmed
from a lack o f strong ownership and commitment. Ittook more thana year (November
2003) after approval for the UBEproject to become effective. Bythis point a full year o f
implementation was lost andthe project was already ratedas unsatisfactory.

3.5    The technical assistance (TA) for capacity buildingwas financed through DFIDand
provided by a consortium underthe BritishCouncil             - Capacity   for Basic Education
(CUBE). Although acknowledgedto be critical for project success, since it was known
from the ESW duringpreparation that state level capacity was very weak, the TA didnot
deliver as anticipated. There were 16 PCUs (one for each participating state) that needed
support fiom this TA, which was spreadtoo thinly. Through misunderstandings about
priorities inthe basic objectives, CUBE didnot initiate strategic capacity buildingfor the
management agencies o f the project. Rather, they focused their initialefforts at the
school level, which shouldhave come later. Also, the initial TA only provided one
advisor per state, clearly not sufficient inview ofthe quantity and quality o f institution
buildingrequired. Moreover, ittook morethan ayear to get the TA contracts signed and
a year and a half (around mid-2004) to get the state-level advisors inplace. The year
2003 was lost to slow legal procedures andthe year 2004 was largely one o f loss fiom
delay inthe TA for implementationand capacity building.

3.6    Thus, early in2005 discussions were held concerningrestructuringthe project,
whose implementation hadbeenrated unsatisfactory inalmost every PSR upto that
point. By June 2005 only 9 percent o fthe credit hadbeendisbursednearly three years
after project approval. There was clear fi-ustration inthe Bank and inDFID as well as in
the Federal Ministry o f Finance (FMOF) inNigeria, andthis project was only one o f
several problemprojects inthe country portfolio. The operating environment o f all
projects inthe country was acknowledged to be difficult becauseofthe complexity o f
federal, state and local inter-relationships andsteps were neededto improve the overall
portfolio performance. Although it was observed by supervisionmissions that a few of
the states were beginningto improve their performance, it was clear that some project
restructuring, ifnot outright cancellation, was inorder.

3.7    Basedupon the potential for improvements shown insome states cited above,
duringthe May 2005 supervision missionthe projectrestructuringwas planned. The
project objectives remainedthe same, but some implementationchanges were made: (a)
inclusiono fthe FederalCapital Territory (FCT) inthe project because it showed
motivation and commitment, providing its own counterpart funds before restructuring
was officiaIly approved; (b) eliminatingthe need for counterpart funds, allowing the
Credit to fund 100percent o f activity costs; and (c) allocating more funds to community
self-help activities as was done inthe previous PEP2 restructuring, which would help
speed up disbursement .


appointed for Federaland States Special Account; (5) Resettlement Policy Framework adoptedby FGN;
(6) detailed and satisfactory procurement andwork plansfor first year bythree states; and (7) Project
Accounts openedbyFMOE and three states with initial deposits. Having so muchto be done bythe states
with their weak implementation capacity proved difficult. But even standard actions, such as establishing
project accounts, were delayed bythe FGN.

                                                     16


  3.8    As aresult ofthese actions andthe gradualbuild-upo fcapacity insome states,
  disbursemento fthe credit increaseddramatically, with cumulative disbursement rising
  fiomUS$3.2 million(December 7,2004) to US$44.5 million(June 30,2006) at the time
  o f closing. Most o fthis increase indisbursement came about inthe activities underthe
  State Component, especially the community self-help activities, while those activities
 under the Federal Component, which were aimed mainly at administrative andplanning,
  showed very little improvement as a whole. The HN/AIDSactivities were especially
  disappointing, showing only about 15 percent disbursement o fits allocated funds.
  However, giventhe project design, the State Component didnot depend for its success
  uponthe Federal Component. As inthe case o fPEP2, most o fthe progress inproject
  performance at the state level was inthe self-help projects.

  3.9    Nonetheless, it was finally judged that the project would not ultimately achieve its
  objectives. After discussions among the Bank, which wantedto clean up its portfolio o f
  projectsat risk, andDFID, not happy withthe progress o f its TA provider, the FGN, now
  withtwo newreformandresults orientedministers inFinance andEducation, formally
  requestedto close the project two years early (June 30,2006 instead o f June 30,2008)
  andto cancel a largepart ofthe Credit (SDR 27 million)16. However, accordingto the                    '
  BeneficiaryAssessment conducted inlate 2005, the states and Local Government
  EducationAuthorities (LGEAs) were not sufficiently consulted inthe process and
  ultimate decision to close the project early. Some states reported that they were caught
  unaware bythe early closure decision. Although the decisionthat the project would not
  likely achieve its objectives wasjustifiable, the manner inwhichthe early closure was
  handledisthe issue. The communication withthe states andother stakeholders hadleft
  the impression, according to interviews o fthe PPARmission, that a new andbetter
  designed project would be quickly forthcoming.

  3.10 By the time o f early closure the outputs delivered bythe project were muchless
  thanenvisagedat appraisal, especially for the Federalcomponent. The table below
  shows that the federal component disbursed only 17percent o fthe appraisal amount. The
  State component disbursedmore o f its appraisal amount (70 percent), but almost all o f it
  inthelastyear oftheproject andmostofthat inthe community self-help activities. The
  more detailedfinancial and cost tables showing how muchwas disbursed bythe activities
  under eachcomponent are not shown here. These tables are extremely long for all
  activities inall sixteen states andthe numerous federal agencies.

  l6Changes inministers of education, as well as project managementstaff, presenta serious implementation
 problem inNigeria. There were three nationalMinisters o fEducationduringthe time o f UBEP. Seven
 ministers o f education haveheldoffice since 1999. While the Bank cannot control such events, insuch an
 environment, broad commitment at the state level is critical, especially for a decentralized project.

                                                    17


3.1 1 The PAD for UBEPrecognized the weaknessesinfinancial management. There
was a Country FinancialAssessment for Nigeria (CFAA) that revealedthat the systems
for planning, budgeting and financial management didnot provide reasonable assurance
that funds would be used for intendedpurposes. The financial andprocurement
management systems for the project were designed to address the issues raised inthe
CFAA. There was a State Project Financial Management Unit(PFMU) set up inthe
Accountant General's office to provide financial safeguards. Since the ICRmentions
problems o fpolitical interference andwith ICB procedures, the PPARmission followed
uponthis withthe country procurement staff. Inmost cases, itwas the result ofPCU
staff not understandingprocurement andhavingministers insist on following Nigerian
government procedure. Duringthe preparation o fprocurement documents these problems
sometimes surfaced, butthe procurement officers inthe Bankreportedthat there was no
misprocurement. The other safeguard inthe project was resettlement policies with
respect to existing school land, which turnedout not to be an issue inthe project.

MONITORINGEVALUATION
                  AND

3.12 Design. The outcome and output indicators inthe Logical Framework o fthe PAD
are consistent withthe objectives o fthe DCA except for monitoringquality o f schooling.
Neitherthe DCA nor PAD gives a clear operational definition o f "quality schooling".
The outcome indicators, outputs andtargets choseninthe project document arenot the
most pertinent for producing evidence on this objectivebecause, unlike PEP2, no attempt
to measureor assess learningoutcomes was part o fthe project design. Given that this
was the first attempt at a decentralized education project inNigeria, where the states
implemented their ownprogram o f activities andresources were limited, the M&Edesign
didnot includea learning assessment activity. However, the PADdoes not include
enough discussion o fthis design issue, giventhat standardized tests were already
available from PEP1and PEP2, and some states may have beenable to administer these
tests inproject andnon-project schools. Eventhough the School Census i s still being
carried out, very little provision was made to define andcollect relevant data for
indicators at the level ofproject schools (andcomparable non-project schools) that would
help to see what the project contributedwith respect to community self-help schemes,
learningimpact andimpact on HIV/AIDS a~areness'~.Ina country as large as Nigeria
withover 50,000 public primary schools, use ofnationor statewide indicatorsisnot
likely to showproject impact.

3.13 Implementation. Collection o f other indicators and implementation o fthe MIS
subcomponent was hampered by the generally slow start upofproject implementation.
However, the TA for the MIS activities was satisfactory inhelping with collection and
analysis o feducational data from the states into a national .framework. But the overall,



l7With respectto HIV/AIDS,hardly any use o f information existing at the time o fproject preparation was
used. For example, the 1999Nigerian Demographic andHealth Survey was available and hadusehl
informationabout education and HIVIAIDS awareness, which could havehelped establish some baseline.
The NDHS(1999)shows that primary school as a sourceofinformation about HIV/AIDSranks low among
sources of information. After these two education projects with HIV/AIDS components, there is still no
base-line establishedagainst which impact canbe assessed. Likewise, for community self-help schemes,
no provisions were made duringpreparationandrestructuring to evaluate them for effectiveness.

                                             18


beyondthe publication o fthe annual statistical yearbook for education, implementation is
negligible. Giventhe definition o f basic education, the project schools includedboth
primaryandjunior secondary schools. Complicatingthe implementationwas the
institutional arrangement whereby primaryschools come underthe SUBEBs andthe JSS
schools come under the state level MOE. Some states decided to provide resources only
to primary schools. However, data on implementationis notbrokendown bythe primary
andJSS category.

3.14 Use o fthe data for decision-making. The data from the monitoring andevaluation
systemwas hardlyused duringthe implementation phase o fthe project. The project level
monitoring system was weak. Information on project schools versus non-project schools
was not used, which could have been done to assess project impact. Despitevarious
efforts, the Bankdidnot receive a consolidated M&Ereport baseduponthe format
agreedduringsupervision. Progressreports were submitted bythe NPCUand several
state PCU's, butthese did not contain sufficient information to determine project progress
andimpact. However, the education sector dataprovidedthroughNEMIS at least gave
useful indicators for the transitionrates inthe state component. But giventhe emphasis
o f community self-help activities, there was little emphasis on the evaluation o fthese
activities andhence very little useful information for community self-help activities came
out ofthe monitoring and evaluation system. Onthe positive side, efforts at improving
NEMIScontinuedwithsupport from DFIDandUSADafter UBEPclosed. As a result,
some improveddata was usedinthe preparationo fthe SESP (2007) andEducationPER
(2007).


OUTPUTSAND OUTCOMESBY OBJECTIVE.


Strengthen the capacity to provide quality schooling

3.15 The Results Framework for the project took implementationof state plans (at least
70 percent o fthe plan) by project-supported states as the indicator o fthis capacity. By
the time o f closure, most states developed their annual implementationplan, but none o f
themwere able to implement upto 50percent o ftheir plans. It appears that delays in
starting up andinproviding appropriate TA reduced the potential ofthe TA to build
capacity. Parental and community participation, defined as participationinPTA or
school-based management meetings, was also taken as an indicator for this objective,
which increased from 1,920 cases (September 2002) o fparticipationto 3,538 cases (June
2006). However, it was notedthat most o fthis revolved around self-help projects andnot
muchinvolvement inschool, curriculum or textbook issues. The project also financed
the purchase o f about two milliontextbooks and 50,000 sets of learning materials, e.g.,
sciencekits, butno project sponsoredtraining was provided for teachers inthe best use of
textbooks.

Raise primary school admission, completion, and transition rates, with a priority to
the poorest areas

3.16 The admissionrate into class 1 o f primary increased from 46 percent (September
2002) to 55 percent (June 2006). Many o fthese states includethe poorest ones as well as

                                                   19


conservative ones o fthe northern part o fthe country. This indicator at the end o f the
project did show animprovement o f 9percent, butwell below the target increase o f 20
percent for the project. Many other factors other thanthe project could be responsible for
the observed increase, for example, the UBEawareness campaigno f the government,
which hasbeen on-going since the announcement o fUBEin 1999. Ifthe Monitoring and
Evaluationpart ofthe project hadtried to keeptrack o fthe participatingschools and
communities versus control group schools, greater attributionofthese quantitative
indicators to the project investments would have beenpossible.

3.17 According to the data collected by the project, primary completionrates (PCRs)
showed an increase from 65 percent (September 2002) to 70 percent (June 2005) inthe
participating states, an increase o f only 5 percentage points compared to the project target
increase o f20 percent. Prior to the project, during 1996 to 2002, it i s difficult to say what
the year by year PCR trendwas. However, the sector study by Hinchliffe (2003) presents
a time series for the PCR from 1990to 1998 showing a steady increase andthen decline
inthe PCRto about 65 percentfor bothboys andgirls (Figure 3.1). The increase inthe
PCR ofabout 5 percent came about inthe mid-1990s when Bank projects were not very
active, PEPl beingvery slow during implementation at the time. The point o fthis is to
show that modest changes inthe PCR can occur as result o ffluctuations inenrollment
anddemographic trends, without beingattributable to aproject.

3.18 The modest increase o f 5 percent inthe PCRfrom 2002 to 2006 couldhave been
the outcome o f UBEP, but it could also be the laggedimpact o f PEP2 (2000-2004) or the
final years o fmore intense PEPl activity (late 1990s). It could also be the impact o f
other government investments andthe overall awareness campaigno f the government
since a similar increase o f 5 percent came about inthe mid-1990s as noted above without
Bankproject attribution. The PCRnationwide increasedfrom about 62 percent in1998
above to about 80 percent in2005 (theBank's EDSTAT data base), representing 18
percent increase over sevenyears versus the 5 percent increase inproject states over six
years. However, the underlyingdata and the method o f calculating PCRs over time must
beexamined carefully before conclusions canbe drawn. This shouldhave beenbuiltinto
the M&Ecomponent givenitsimportance as one ofthe project's outcome indicators."




l8The PCR is usually defined as the ratio ofcompleters to the populationof completion age (usually the
age range near the end ofprimary cycle). The large increase in the national rate to 80 percent might come

                                                     20


3.19 The transition rate (percent o fprimary completers who enter junior secondary) to
junior secondary school also showed a modest increase o f 7 percent from 38 percent
(September 2002) to 45 percent (June 2006). This is far short o fthe project target rate o f
a 20 percent increase inthe transition rate. Ineach o fthe targets for the indicators, there
i s nojustification or rationale given inthe PAD for the chosen value o f 20 percent. There
were no enrollment andprogression projectionstojustify this target. Ifmore JSS school
places were constructed duringthe UBEP, this would contributeto the increased
transition rate by providing more JSS classrooms. 4,250 classroom blocks were built and
refurbished, butthe project database does not break this downbyprimary andJSS, which
shouldhave been done for the project monitoring system.

3.20 The project's objective o f raising admission, completionandtransition rates also
mentioned focusing efforts onthe poorest areas. N o indicatorswithrespect to poorest
areas could be found. The gender gap inprimary schools was loweredby increasing
girls' participationinclass 1primary from 43.6 percent inSeptember 2002 to 47 percent
June 2006 (World Bank2007a). Although not indicated inthe statement o f objectives,
the gender gap target i s listed inthe LogFrame o fthe PAD, with a target o f 50/50
admission into class 1by the end ofthe project. The gender indicator is relevant, but it
should also havebeenplannedhow to get data about the poorest areas.

3.21 Still, most ofthe project participants inthe states visitedby the missionthought the
project was improving inits thirdyear (calendar 2005) andthat they were not given
enough o f a chance to improve performance. When asked the counterfactual question
about what ifthere hadbeenno project, the answertypically was that the self-help
activities would not have happened. Although anecdotal information supports the belief
that these were effective, a systematic evaluationo ftheir contribution o fthe 2,223 self-
help projects to access and quality objectives should have beenundertaken. N o w
community participation has become a regular way o f doing business for them. Most o f
the state officials met by the missioncontended that their stateswould have finished the
project on time ifthere hadnot beenearly cancellation.

3.22 When discussing the counterfactual question o f "what ifno early cancellation'' with
BankandDFIDstaff, itwas admittedthat maybe the projectmighthave disbursednearly
all o fthe funds after restructuring, especially for the state component. Nonetheless, they
believedthat the objectives would still not have been achieved because the investments
were too dilutedby being spread over so many states. That a project can fully disburse
andstill not achieve its objectives is anindicationofa design flaw, anissueto be
discussedlater inthe lessons and perspectives section.




about from increasedenrollment levels and low repetition rates, which are amenableto government and
project interventions. Infact, FMEofficial statistics show an increaseinprimary enrollment from 19.8
million (2002) to 22.3 million (2005), anincrease of 13 percent. Butrapiddemographic changes inthe
relevant age group that comprises the denominator o fthe PCR can also fluctuate.

4. RATINGSFOR EACHPROJECT

4A. PEP2

Outcome

4.1 Overall PEP2 is ratedas moderately unsatisfactorybaseduponthe triad o f
factors-relevance,   efficacy andeficiency. With respect to relevance, the first three
objectives o f PEP2were aligned withthe CSP2005 strategies o f improving social service
deliveryfor humandevelopment andempowering the community through participationin
self-help schemes. The objective o f the fourth component to improve statistical and
monitoring capacity was inline with developing the federal level monitoring and
planningfunctions. The HIV/AIDS awarenessobjective is also inlinewiththe health
sector objectives o fthe CSP 2005, which emphasized combatingHIV/AIDS, malaria and
other diseases. However, PEP2was not inline withthe new CSP objective o f emphasis
on lead states and stuck to the old design o f a nation-wide project implemented from the
nationallevel (UBEC was the lead federal agency for implementation) with investments
inprojectschools scatteredacross all ofthe states. Also, the design o fmonitoringand
evaluation was lacking inthe HTV/AIDS component, as there was no baseline survey o f
awarenessand no method o fmonitoring the project's impact on HIV/AIDSawareness.
The project didprovide for measuringenrollment and learning outcomes inthe project
schools, butwithout a control group for comparison. Overall, considering shortcoming in
both objectives anddesignfeatures, the relevance o f PEP2 i s substantial.

4.2 PEP2is rated modest withrespectto efficacy. The first three objectives all work
together to give a modest outcome (see Section 2). The first component trained a large
number o fteachers andprincipals, butthere were no follow-up evaluations. The second
component expanded facilities and allowed for substantial increases inenrollment. The
third component providedbooksandlearningmaterials that could contributeto both
teaching andlearning. The standardized tests indicate that there was a marginal increase
inlearning achievement, despite a large increaseinenrollment inthe projectschools.
Likewise the fourth objective concerningthe projectMISmade progress towards its
intended outputs/outcomes. Without the standardized tests and school census, almost
nothingwould be known about project outcomes. The fifth component concerning the
HIV/AIDS awareness objective producedmanyposters and other materials, but the
impact o fthese was negligible. However, the weight o fthe HIVIAIDS component was
small relative to the other components. Taken altogether, these considerations result ina
modest efficacy.

4.3   When it comes to efficiency considerations, there is not enough project or country
wide education data to do a quantitative assessmentofhowmuchactivities cost relative
to benefits. Onthe cost side, the cascade methodo ftraining, community involvement in
construction andprocurement, and the production o fHIV/AIDSmaterials all involved
relatively low cost methods. Thus, increased access was provided at low cost. Giventhat
the gain incognitive skills was only marginal, the benefits also would be modest. The
recent Bank evaluationo f support to primaryeducation foundthat mucho fthe benefit

                                             22


from primaryeducation comes from the cognitive skills acquired, notjust from the years
spent inschool (World Bank2006). Thus, efficiency i s rated as modest.

Riskto Development Outcomes

4.4    The riskto development outcomes of this project i s moderate. Bythe time o f
project completion, the staff o fthe UBEC (which was the successor to the NPEC under
PEPl) haddeveloped capacity inproject management ingeneral and Bank
procurement/disbursementinparticular. There was a tendency to staffturnover, but at
least some o f the staffhave remained andnow occupy senior management positions
withinUBEC. AlthoughUBECplayedasignificantrole inthe preparationofthe UBEP,
its role was limited duringand after the negotiations o fUBEP (during 2002) because its
legal status hadnot yet beenconfirmedby the UBElaw (2004). Thus, full advantage was
not taken o fthe management capacity developed duringPEP2.

BankPerformance

4.5    Bankperformance is ratedsatisfactory. The projectwas preparedrapidly (inonly
six months) andthere was not enoughtime to addressthe capacity buildingneeded, thus
reducingthe quality at entry. The Bank supervision team recognizedthese problems and
responded appropriately andintimely fashion. The teamrecognizedthe needfor
substantial institutional capacity buildingwhile also providing the needed support in
Bankprocurement anddisbursement procedures. Effortswere also made during
supervision to get the monitoring and evaluationback on track, though this was only
partlysuccessful (the last PSRinDecember 2004 acknowledged that the project was not
strong onmeasuring outcome indicators). M e r the MTR andappropriate restructuring
andreallocationoffundingfor components, the projectperformanceimproved
dramatically and agency counterpart staff showed improvement intheir own capacity to
manage andimplement the project.

Borrower Performance

4.6    Borrower performance i s rated satisfactory overall, despite a slow start-up and
periodic problems withprovisiono f counterpart funds. A more skilled team was
deployed after supervision missions pointed out staffing and capacity problems. A few of
the core staff, who are still withthe current UBEC, informedthe PPARmission that they
hadbeentrainedunder PEPl whenthey were NPEC staffat that time. Once the
problemswith counterpart funds were resolvedandproject funds were reallocated to pilot
self-help schemes, this small core staffwas able to improve the procurement and
disbursement performance.


Monitoring and Evaluation

4.7   Monitoring and Evaluationi s rated as modest overall. PEP2took over and
completed some o f the monitoring and evaluationtasks that were supposedto be done
under PEPl. For example, the standardized tests for baseline andpost-project evaluation
were to be done under PEPl. These standardizedtest results were used inconjunction

                                             23


with the UNESCO/MLA studyto get atrend o fachievement levels inprimaryeducation.
However, the PEP2tests o fproject schools didnot provide for a control group. Other
features o f PEP2 included collating and analyzing data collectedunder PEP1,so there
was some continuity and follow-up. Although many individuals trained under PEP2have
movedon, the PPARmissionmet with a few o fthe individualstrained under PEP2 so
that there appearedto be some minimal institutionalmemory that was achieved under the
monitoring andevaluation activities. However, shortcomings include the failure to
evaluate the self-help andHIV/AIDS activities.

4B. UBEP

Outcome

4.8   Overall UBEP i s ratedas unsatisfactory. Withrespect to relevance UBEP i s rated
overall as substantial. The first objective o f supportingthe capacity o fthe government to
provide quality schoolingandthe second objective o ffocusing on admission, completion
andtransitionrates were relevant tothe government programandthe Bank's CSP 2005
for humandevelopment. The emphasis onthe community participatory approachthrough
self-help schemes also supportedthe CSP's strategy of community empowerment.
However, the project had designflaws. As a result o f selecting two states from each o f
the six geo-political zones plus including the DFIDproject states, the project covered too
many states andspreadresourcesthinly (US$5.0 millionper stateirrespective state size).
This i s not inline withthe current Bank strategy o f focusing on a few lead states,
althoughitwas notedbeforethat the project objectives were relevant to the interimCSP
(2001) at the time o f approval. Manyofthe states includedinthe project were poor ones,
makingthe project objectives relevantto the poverty emphasis ofthe country strategy.

4.9 The efficacy o fUBEPis rated as negligible. The first objective o f supporting
capacity to provide quality schooling does not have good indicatorsrelatedto quality.
The PAD specifies stateplans andcommunity participation as indicators, butthe state
plansfell short o fthe target andthere was no target set for community participation.
When the state plans were produced, they were inadequate andhadto be redone. There
was no indicator for learning outcomes or quality o f educationplannedfor inthe project.
Giventhe delays inthe first two years o fimplementation(only about 3 percent ofthe
loanwas disbursed inthe first two years), no outputs were producedduringthe first two
years that couldhave had an impact on outcomes for both objectives. Concerning the
admission, completionandtransitionrates o fthe second objective, outputs interms o f
additional classroom space fiom self-help projects were delivered mainly inthe fourth
year o fthe project and could hardlyhave had a significant impact onthose rates. Thus
this objective i s ratednegligiblefor efficacy.

4.10 The efficiency o fUBEP is rated as modest. Lack o f quantitative dataprecludes a
precise evaluation interms o f rate o freturn on investment. With respect to costs, much
of the spending inthe state component consisted of self-help activities, which are
relatively low cost ways o f adding or renovatingclassrooms, resultingincapacity to
enroll more students for UBEgoals or alleviate classroom overcrowding inmany cases.
The manyproject staff changes and need to re-start activities as a result with new staff

                                             24


also underminedefficiency. The Federal component disbursed 17percent o f funds
without muchbenefit, except for some progress on the EMIS. Onthe benefit side, the
quality o fthe low cost, self-help constructionwas lower thanthat o f a private contractor,
resultinginonly a modest benefit. When the PPARmissionvisited schools, the contrast
between buildings done by community self-help versus private contractor was easily
visible. Onthe other hand, the community self-help classrooms were still sufficient for
the purpose o fteaching and learningifadequateteachers andbooks were provided.
Beneficiary surveys and observations by the PPARmission indicate that community
empowerment itselfwas also a benefit from this approach. Thus, overall the efficiency
comes out as modest. Giventhe substantial rating on relevance, the negligiblerating on
efficacy, andthe modest rating on efficiency, the overallUBEP ratingis
unsatisfactory.

Riskto DevelopmentOutcomes

4.11 The riskto development outcomes is significantfor this project giventhat it closed
two years early andthe implementationproblemsencountered from the beginningdidnot
allow institutionalchanges at the federal or state levelto take root. The objective o f
increasing capacity to provide quality schooling was not really achieved by the increased
pace o f school construction and renovation inthe last year o fthe project. The emphasis
there was more quantitative, making space to reduce over crowding or to increase access.
The objective o f increasing access and completion can be partially maintained as UBEC
i s still providing fundingto the SUBEBs for self-help projects inlocal communities.
While this i s a good development, the emphasis i s still too muchonthe physical
infrastructure andnot enough onthe other elements o f what comprises an effective
school.


BankPerformance

4.12 Overallthe Bank performance i s rated as unsatisfactory. Withhindsight it seems
clear that the quality at entry was unsatisfactory. One indicationo f this i s the large
number(seven) ofconditions o feffectiveness andthe nature ofthese conditions, some of
which should have beenfulfilled by appraisal inorder to consider a project ready for
implementation. For example, one conditionwas to have the Project Implementation
Manual, including a chapter on procurement, adopted bythree states. Another was to
have three states furnishtheir first year work andprocurement plans. Such conditions are
more appropriately done by appraisal or negotiations so that there is assurancethe project
is ready to implement. There were a number o fpressures onthe Bankteam and
management to get resources quickly to the new civilian government so that it could
deliver on its poverty alleviationagenda. The project suffered as a result o f the Bank's
desire to provide early support for the new civilian government, as well as the Bank's
unrealistic optimism inbelieving the FGNcould deliver on its promises to fulfill these
conditions.

4.13 Bank supervision o fthe UBEPproject is also rated unsatisfactory overall.
Problems developed immediately after Board approval (September 2002) and the project
was rated unsatisfactory evenbefore it became effective morethan a year (November

                                              25


2003) after Board approval. This could have beentaken as a sign that aggressive
supervision would be needed, butthe schedule o f PSRsdoes not indicate any special
actions. Onthe other hand, PPARmission conversations with staff and donors indicate
that the FGNand state governments tend to regard suchprojects that spread funding
thinlyover manystatesasrelativelyunimportant, especially giventhat Bank funding is
smallrelativeto overall government spending. Also politics duringthe election
campaign inearly 2003 almost paralyzed the FGNbureaucracy with no one willing to
take simple decisions to pushthe signing o fthe DCA through the necessary legal steps in
the government. Thus, more thana year was wasted.

4.14 The arrangement and TOR for the DFIDprovided TA after effectiveness was not
adequately designed andthe TA drifted out o f alignment with the PDOs andthe
implementationprogram. The initial TA was conceived interms o f broad capacity
development objectives (see para. 3.1). Apart from beinginsufficient inquantityit was
also inadequate interms of focusing on specific priority activities, such as project
management, procurement, financial management, etc. Based uponthe PSRs and
discussions withproject staff, overall Bank supervision was slow to catch andrectify this
gap inthe design o fthe TA. So a second year (calendar 2004) was ineffect wasted with
little progress to show onthe ground. By then, itwas apparent to some people
interviewedthat the project was flawed and would not achieve its stated PDOs and
discussion o f restructuring and outright cancellation began.


Borrower Performance

4.15 The performances o fthe borrower (FGN) andits implementing agencies (FME and
individual states) are ratedunsatisfactory. The FGNdidnot expedite the signing o fthe
DCA, allowing it to languishinthe bureaucratic steps without taking ownership.
Although the aide-memoires and PSRs cite electoral politics as a reason, a committed
borrower could have dealt withthe signing o fthe DCA seven months prior to an election
(Board approval was inSeptember 2002 andthe elections were March2003). For
whatever reasons, it appears the Bankmisreadthe commitment o fthe FGN, FMF and
FMEto this project. Eventhoughthere was a federal component along with a state
component, the federal component was small inthe scheme o f their interests with small
amounts o f funding scattered amongmany federal agencies so there was not much
interest inthe project at the federal level, where much o fthe conditionality was placed,
andwhich is responsible for signing andeffectiveness.

4.16 Although most o fthe states wantedto proceed quickly, since they were more direct
beneficiaries o fproject funds, they were hampered bythe FGNdelays insigning and
providing counterpart finds. The FederalComponent was a very mixedbag o f activities
andagencies, none o fwhich showed a great deal o finterest andcommitment. Withno
real ownership, there was nointernally generated pressure to push for conditions o f
effectiveness. The states were also hampered bytheir own capacity limitations. Most
had completed plans, butthe TA providers reported that these plans were not o f sufficient
quality andhad to be revised substantially. Also, as mentioned before, the TA was
delayed coming on stream anddidnot provide the type o fproject management TA
neededto start up a Bankfunded project.

Monitoring and Evaluation

4.17 Monitoring and evaluation for UBEP i s rated as negligible overall. The
shortcomings indesign and implementationwere discussedpreviously. Many ofthose
interviewed bythe PPAR missionexpressedthe view that the NEMISandthe EMIS in
manystates are finally comingtogether (this isthe thirdprojectto attemptto buildupa
MIS). There are still doubts about the accuracy o f the data, but, as one knowledgeable
observer put it, at least it is knownwhere the problems are locatedandthus actioncanbe
taken to improvethe situation.

    NIGERIA

LESSONS

Generic Proiect Lessons

5.1   Good performance during implementation cannot make up for fundamental
design flaws. UBEP introducedtoo much complexity and spread limitedresources too
thinly amongthe 16states andnumerous federal agencies. The states didnothave the
capacity to implement such a complex design and spreading the resources too thinly did
not allow for reaching the critical mass neededto have a catalytic impact uponthe
system, a lessonthat can also apply to PEP2. Inthe case o fUBEP, even thoughproject
performance improveddramatically duringthe last year before closure, nonetheless it
was concluded that PDOswould not be attained due to design flaws. Iti s likely that
projectswith simple designs would be more cost-effective inNigeria.

5.2 Lack of readinessfor implementation cannot be compensated for by imposing
many conditions of effectiveness. Inhindsightthe UBEPwas not really readyto start
implementationat the time of Board approval andthe introduction o f conditions of
effectiveness couldnot make up for this lack o freadiness. Although there were good
reasonswhy the Bankmanagement wantedto support the new civilian government after
years o fmilitaryrule, corruptionandmismanagement, approving a project that i s not
ready inthe endi s counterproductive. Itwould be better to do simpler andmore
manageable projects insequence inorder to buildup capacity or to use conditions o f
appraisal or negotiations to ensurethe project is ready for implementationby Board
approval.

5.3   It is critical for TA to be closely aligned with the PDOsand institutional
capacity gaps and to be closely supervised by the Bank and co-financiers to prevent
TA from driftingaway from PDOs.Althoughthe TA was implementedbythe DFID
contractors, the Bank didnot exercise close monitoring and evaluation o f TA initially.
The broadly statedTOR ledthe TA providersto focus initially on school development
andnot onthe strategic managementcompetencies neededto manage aBanksupported
project. Some PCUcoordinators expressedthe view that these advisors, while good

                                                     27


educational professionals, were not experienced enough inBankprocedures, resultingin
a mismatch inthe kindo f critical TA support neededbythe state PCUs.

5.4      Constant turnover of project staff cannot be prevented in many projects, thus
requiring repeated trainingthroughout project implementation in critical areas
such as project management, financial management and procurement. BothPEP2
and UBEP suffered from this problem. As longas project staff who leave remainin
country, the training they receive benefits the economy. However, it i s not realistic to
expect to train a PCU director at the start o f a project andhave that personremainwith
the project throughout. It i s better to make provisions somehow inthe project design to
finance training for newproject staff as a result o f constant staffturnover. With respect
to changes inministers and highlevel officials, working with statesthat have already
demonstrated strong ownership and commitment i s essential, especially for a
decentralized project such as UBEP.

Education SDecific Project Lessons

5.5      Effective monitoringand evaluation of quality of education require a long lead
time to design and develop and thus need to be addressed early inproject design
alongwith PDOs. A major shortcoming inthe UBEP design was its failure to build
uponthe measures oflearningassessmentbuilt into PEP2. Giventhat the learning
assessments after PEP1andPEP2 showed no significant improvementsinachievement
f?om 1996to 2004, itwas allthe more importantto continue learningassessmentsinto
UBEP, at least for those schools participating intheproject. AIso, despite changes inthe
average learningoutcomes, it i s necessary to usethe monitoring and evaluationto
understandthe distributiono flearningoutcomes, especially for the poor. The average
can remainthe same or change, butresults for the poor can move differently than the
average. Moreover, learning assessments, or other measures for monitoring quality o f
outcomes, can be usedin a way that feed back into the improvement o fcurriculum,
teaching and school management.l9

5.6      Inaddition to improvedmonitoringandevaluation of education projects,
Nigerian education statistics are still deficient in coverage, lack of sufficient detail
and reliability2'. Although recent improvements, with support fromthe donor
community are acknowledged, there is a longway to go inobtaining education statistics
that are needed for planningand assessing progress towards the MDGs and EFA. After
takingstock ofrecent improvements, consideration couldbe givento a dedicated
education statistical improvement program, supported bythe donor comunity, without
too many other components that would result inexcess complexity.


    Theneedto focus on learningoutcomesandto evaluatethem effectively is one ofthe main lessonsfi-om
the IEG evaluation o fBank support to primary education, "From Schooling Access to Learning Outcomes:
An UnfinishedAgenda" (2006). UBEPis an example ofthe failure to do this, butthe new SESP (2007),
*'citingthe IEGevaluation, wilI try to improve inthisrespect.
    Some donors commented that educational statistics were so unreliable for Nigeriathat agencies often do
not includethem intheir statistical compilations. For some years, UNESCOand the Bank's EDSTAThad
manygaps intheir education data for Nigeria comparedto other countries. USAIDandDFIDalsohave
been active insupporting improvements inNigerian education data. Thus it appearsinternationalsupport
to improve Nigerianeducational standards up to internationalstandards could be forth coming.

PERSPECTIVESFORONGOINGANDFUTURE                       SUPPORT

5.7    Although only two projects -PEP2andUBEP-are                    the subject o fthis PPAR, it i s
necessaryto look at them inthe historical context starting with PEP1and lookingtowards
the future withthe newly approved SESP. The recently approved STEPB Project (2007),
baseduponextensive analytical sector work andpreparation, also indicates the Bank's
recognition o fthe importance o f secondary andtertiary education as part o f a balanced
andhighquality education sector strategy for Nigeria. This longer view highlightsthe
need for the Bankto pay more attentionto good design o fprojects from the concept
stage, including a relevant andwell funded programo f ESW for the education sector as a
whole, andto pay more attentionto monitoring andevaluation as a necessary part o f the
design, notjust as an add-on or as a separate component. Monitoring quality o f
education should be an essential part ofthis withquality defined not only withrespect to
the whole package o finputsbut also with respect to learning achievement with an
adequate distributiono f learningoutcomes. An essential aspect o f monitoring and
evaluation i s that it feeds back into programmanagement withthe purpose o f improving
teaching and school management.

5.8    Itis astep forward comparedto UBEPthat the CUBEteam, which is again
providingthe TA, will conduct a baseline learning assessmentandagain at the end o fthe
project. However, there i s not much detail inthe PAD as to how this will be planned,
which should have beenpart o f the project planningfrom the start. To understand
attribution to the projectthese learning assessments must linkedwith other variables,
such as school quality andhousehold characteristics, so that there can be analysis ofthe
average andthe distributionabout that average for different socio-economic groups.
There is still time to think about initiating a comprehensive learning impact assessment
that can cover these three states inthe project as well as future states that may decide to
join the next phase o fthe SESP. The CUBEteam might also look into usingthe results
o f JSS leaving examination still given for selection purposes to SSS level. While such
exams are designedfor selection o f individualstudents as opposed to assessment o f the
system, some analysis o fthem canbe u s e l l incomparing project andnon-project
schools.2'

5.9    Insomerespectsthenew SESPincorporates someimportantlessonslearned above.
The conditionality is muchmore limitedandthere is more front-loading o fconditions as
part o f appraisal andnegotiations. Also, the SESP will concentrate project resources on
three states, which is a welcome departure from the past practice o f including all six
geopoliticalzones ofthe country for political reasons. Yet there are some disturbing
signs o fthe FGNagain delaying effectiveness. This may well requirevery highlevel
interventionfrom Bank management to avoid repetitiono fthe UBEP experience.

5.10 IfESW i s also factored into the Bank dialogue and support, the evidence suggests a
positive contributionto the Nigerianeducationsector. The ESW included: (1) "School
EducationinNigeria: Preparing for UBE", World Bank (2004) ;(2) the institutional


*'The  mission observed that one JSS principal had atime-series chart ofher school's performance onthe
JSS exam onthe wall of her office. The trend of results was down from the late 1990s,which she
attributed to more students inthe school and less resources per student.

                                             29


capacity for UBEstudy (Orbach 2004), (3) the science andtechnology ESW (2006) to
prepare for the Science andTechnology EducationPost-Basic (STEPB) Project (2007),
(4) the report "Language, Literacy andinPrimary Schools" (Adekola2007), and(5) the
extensive education public expenditure review (2007). This shows that the ESW is
addressing relevant andtough issues for the education sector. Inaddition, the fact that
the FGNis willing to abandon its political approach o f distributingproject resources
equally over the six geo-political zones is a significant turningpoint. Eventhe failure of
UBEwas a lessonfor the FGNas well asthe Bankthatpointedthe way towards the new
approach o f focusing resources more as inthe new SESP. The Bankneedsto stay
engagedinthe Nigerian education sector for the longterm, all the while being alert and
ready witha pro-active response to developments that could be detrimentalto
performance o fthe portfolio. However, this long-term engagement has serious resource
implicationsinterms o f ESW, project preparation andsupervision, monitoring and
evaluation o f quality, especially ifa decentralized approach such as inthe SESP is to be
scaled-up. Effectivepartnerships between the Government andDPs and among the DPs
can help alleviate the resource constraints to some extent, but careful sector analysis and
management will be needed to set achievable andrelevant goals.

  This is to acknowledge, albeit lately, the receipt of your letter dated
  April 22, 2008 on the above subject matter.          Iamtoexpress
  happiness that the Project reviews went on successfully and
  satisfactorily.

  Having carefully studied the Draft Project Performance Assessment
  Report, the Commission wishes to agree with the Independent
  EvaluationGroup (IEG) on its comments on Project background with
  regard to Concept, Government-policies, Implementation strategies
  and Government partnering relationship with the
  other InternationalDevelopmentAgencies.

                                 44                                    ANNEX D




 With particular regardto PEP 11, the assessment of the attainment of
 physical targets, disbursement, fiduciary, safe guards and closure of
 the project are also found to be acceptable. It is also true that not
 much attention was paid in the project design to systematic
 monitoring and evaluation to help judge the ultimate success in
 improving HN/AIDS        awareness.       However,   this did not
 discountenance the fact that, a lot of progress was achieved through
 the strategies applied by the Project in creating awareness through
 production of posters, radio and television jingles and the multi-
purpose master-trainers sensitization workshop for teachers and
 head-teachers.

The overall comment on the Project impact on pupils learning
achievements was however found to be hastily made because, in our
opinion, this is a longterm issue that could not have been objectively
assessed within the life span of the Project.

We also noted that, there is a significant shift among the ICR, ICR
Review, PPAR and the current IEG ratings. Whereas the ICR, ICR
Review and PPAR all concurred that the overall project rating was
satisfactory, the IEG ratingdepartssubstantiallyfrom that position by
giving the project an unsatisfactory rating. That PEP I1was not in
line with the new Country Strategic Plan (CSP) objectivesof emphasis
on fead States should not be faulted because the idea of lead States
was built in the 2005 Country Strategic Plan (CSP) at a time PEP 11
was either being closedor hadclosed.

Thus, in our opinion, especially consideringthe physicaltargets met,
which is acknowledged by the IEG, the overall rating of the projectin
terms of relevance, efficacy and efficiency should be at least
'satisfactory'. The Project, it should be recalled strategically and
greatly too had improved the capacity of both the Federal and State
staff in the planning and implementationprocesses of the Universal
Basic Education Programme.

For the many implementationflaws observedat the takeoff stage of
UBEP I, we tend to agreewith most of the ratingsof the project. But
we are aware that considerable effort was put by both the World

It is only hoped that the les    arnt in running the two projects
will guide the design and implemen
