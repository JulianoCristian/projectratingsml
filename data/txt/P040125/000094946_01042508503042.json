development impacts. Lessons address: 1) sustainability\n            issues, to be assessed during appraisal, by including\n            socioeconomic, and institutional analysis of the beneficiary\n            community, whose results should enhance, and be reflected in\n            project design, and implementation. Despite the efficient\n            nature of the community agent \"Nucleo Ejecutor\"\n            (NE), its short-term character, limits its contribution to\n            project sustainability; thus it should be reviewed whether\n            its responsibility to follow-up, on the transfer of the\n            project to the appropriate entity, could be feasible; 2)\n            empowerment issues, i.e., participation depends on the\n            existing social capital. Thus, where communities are weak,\n            it would be appropriate to have proactive strategies,\n            including a promotional component, rather than demand-driven\n            schemes, even though, as in this case, these may be\n            considered assets to the National Fund for Compensation and\n            Development's (FONCODES) projects, but are not the\n            instrument of choice for the poorest communities; 3)\n            targeting issues, where local governments have a key role to\n            play in the micro-level targeting, and, communities should\n            also be involved in promotion interventions, prioritizing\n            the poorer communities, who have not benefited from FONCODES\n            financing. The role of governments, and of Social Funds in\n            the promotion, and financing of productive projects should\n            be reviewed."}, "docdt": "2001-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
