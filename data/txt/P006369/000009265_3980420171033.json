"loan_no": "2861;2718;2762", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "This is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for three projects under the Northeast Rural\n            Development Program (NRDP) in the States of Pernambuco,\n            Piaui and Minas Gerais in Brazil. All three projects have an\n            overall rating of satisfactory. The initial objectives of\n            the NRDP through its component state projects, as outlined\n            in the Memorandum of the President (MOP), were to: (i)\n            increase regional agricultural production and productivity;\n            (ii) generate income and employment opportunities for\n            low-income farm families; (iii) increase the states capacity\n            to provide efficient agricultural services to small farmers;\n            and (iv) promote water resource development and technology\n            generation and diffusion to reduce small farmers\n            vulnerability to recurring drought. The Minas Gerais MOP\n            project included an additional objective: to increase\n            community participation in all phases of the development\n            process. Lessons learned from these projects are as follows:\n            (a) most rural development projects will falter under severe\n            macro-economic and fiscal pressures and a policy environment\n            unfavorable to agriculture; (b) When a program strategy and\n            project design is overtaken by events which make it\n            redundant, the Bank should promptly undertake the needed\n            changes, including complete reformulation if necessary, and\n            which will enable it to succeed in the new circumstances;\n            (c) the willingness to experiment benefits projects\n            Bank-wide. The reformulated projects emerged from a\n            successful pilot experience (APCR), enriched by drawing on\n            wider experiences, and their successors the Rural Poverty\n            Alleviation Program (RPAP) have continued to pilot\n            increasingly progressive variants of the core model; (d)\n            grant-based investment is a legitimate and effective tool\n            for jumpstarting capital accumulation by the rural poor, and\n            the matching grant approach contributed to sustainable local\n            development in the three states; and (e) supervision is\n            indispensable for subproject and overall project success and\n            should be strengthened, and involve local entities closest\n            to the communities, particularly Municipal Councils and\n            Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs)."}, "docdt": "1997-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
