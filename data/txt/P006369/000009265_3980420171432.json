The\n            project hopes to achieve (a) increased agricultural\n            production and productivity in the State of Piaui; (b) more\n            employment opportunities for low-income farm families; (c)\n            increased institutional capacity to provide efficient\n            agricultural services for small farmers; and (d) greater\n            water resource development and technology generation and\n            diffusion. This latter objective will decrease small farmer\n            vulnerability to recurring droughts. It will support water\n            resource development for both agriculture and domestic use,\n            agricultural research, agricultural extension, investment\n            credit, marketing services, funding for community\n            subprojects and project administration and training."}, "docdt": "1986-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
