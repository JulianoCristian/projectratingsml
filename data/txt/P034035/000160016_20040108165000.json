Some of the\n            lessons learned include the following: Greater beneficiary\n            agency involvement is necessary from the outset. Clear\n            performance indicators should be developed. No matter how\n            simple the design and how well defined the activity,\n            building capacity for institutional reforms may require a\n            longer time frame than what is generally practiced. The\n            Office of Minister of State for Administrative Reform(OMSAR)\n            has become an important source of technical expertise and\n            know-how. However, its lack of clear mandate, and the\n            difficult relationship it has with the traditional civil\n            service may have affected its effectiveness. It is clear,\n            that under this circumstance, these highly qualified, highly\n            paid cadres must be mainstreamed into the fiber of the\n            traditional civil service. This lesson is being internalized\n            in certain other ministries which have similar situations.\n            There is a clear correlation between the capacity at entry\n            and the closeness of supervision to be provided. The Bank\n            needs to carry a closer supervision of technical assistance\n            projects in post-war reconstruction situations. The\n            supervision responsibility moved to the country office\n            eventually but should have been done much earlier."}, "docdt": "2003-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
