Beyond filling the need in key\n            equipment and other resources as identified in the National\n            Adminstrative Rehabilitation Program (NARP), the project\n            assists in streamlining procedures, designing and initiating\n            longer-term public administration and civil service reform,\n            encouraging participation and building consensus to foster\n            the sustainability of the process.
