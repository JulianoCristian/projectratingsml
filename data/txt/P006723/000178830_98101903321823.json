The paving of the\n            approximately 1,600 km of highway included in the project\n            would increase the total of paved national highways from\n            about 4,000 km to about 5,600 km. The project includes the\n            construction of a major bridge across the Magdalena River,\n            which would replace overcrowded ferries on the only direct\n            highway between Barranquilla and Santa Marta, the two\n            largest ports on Colombia's Atlantic coast. The project\n            also includes the upgrading of a 9.5 km highway from El\n            Pailon to Buenaventura, thus improving access to\n            Colombia's largest port on the Pacific coast."}, "docdt": "1970-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
