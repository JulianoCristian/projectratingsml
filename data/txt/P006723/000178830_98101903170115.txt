INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REFORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
FRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROFOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR THE SIXTH HIGHWAY FROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$32 million to the
Republic of Colombia.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank has been closely associated with highway development in
Colombia since 1951, having made five loans totalling US$84.5 million
equivalent in 1951, 1953, 1956, 1961 and 1968 respectively. In addition
an IDA credit of US$19.5 million was made in 1961. The emphasis of the
projects financed by these loans has been, initially, to create a viable
national highway network and, subsequently, to upgrade and expand the
network to meet rising traffic demands and to improve maintenance of the
Colombian highway system generally. The Bank has now been asked to help
finance a continuation of the Government's program of improving priority
highways through a loan for the paving of approximately 1,600 km.,. of
highway, the construction of a major bridge over the Nbgdalena River at
Barranquilla, the upgrading of 9.5 km. of highway between El Pailon and
Buenaventura, and consulting services for the supervision of the paving and
construction work.
3.        A Bank mission to Colombia appraised the proposed loan during
November-December 1969, and negotiations were held in Washington during
Irjarch 23-27, 1970. The Government was represented by Dr. Bernardo Garces,
Minister of Fublic Works, who was assisted by Dr. Carlos Ospina, a private
consultant.
4.       The proposed loan, which would be the forty-first made to Colombia,
and the proposed loan of US$6.5 million to the Republic of Colombia for a
Second Education Project, would increase the amount of Bank loans to ColombiI
to US$656.8 million' (net of cancellations). The US$19.5 million credit
mentioned above represents the total of IDA lending to Colombia. The
folloming is a suimary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to Colombia
as of March 31, 1970:

5.        The status of disbursements of loans is described in paragraph
5 of MYDy Report and Recommendation on the loan for the Second Education
Project ( P-799), dated Ap5ril 30, 1970.
6.        IFC has made 34 investments and underwriting commitments in
seventeen enterprises in Colombia totalling US$17.9 million (net of cancella-
tions).
PART II - DESCiiIPTION OF THE PROFOSED LOAN
7.        Borrower:                   Republic of Colombia.
Purpose:                    To help finance the paving of
approximately 1,600 km. of national
highways, the construction of a
major highway bridge, the construction
of a 9.5 km. highway, and consulting
services for the supervision of the
paving and construction work.
Amount:                     Equivalent in various currencies of
US$32 million.
Amortization:               In 25 years, including a four-year
grace period, through 42 semi-
annual installments beginning
December 1, 1974 and ending
June 1, 1995.
Interest rate:              7 percent per annum.
Commitment Charge:          3/4 of one percent per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        A detailed description of the Project is given in the attached
report entitled "Colombia - Appraisal of the Si--th Highway Project" (PTR 44a).
9.        The three mountain ranges which cross Colombia from northeast
to southwest present formidable barriers to movement between population
centers, which until recently developed as essentially isolated, largely
independent regional communities. It is only within the last twenty years
that a national highway system began to develop, and, owing partly to the
assistance of Bank loans, it now consists of about 19,000 km. of trunk
highway linking the principal population centers and of secondary roads
linking the smaller towns to the primary network. Neveitheless, only about
20 percent of the national network is paved, and the main purpose of the



- 4 -
Rroject is to bri ng the paved portion of the network up to the level
justified by increased traffic demand. The paving of the approximately
1,600 km. of highway included in the Project would increase the total of
paved national highways from about 4,000 km. to about 5,600 km. The Project
includes the construction of a major bridge across the Magdalena River,
which would replace overcrowded ferries on the only direct highway between
Barranquilla and Santa Marta, the two largest ports on Colombia's Atlantic
coast. The project also includes the upgrading of a 9.5 km. highway from
El Pailon to Buenaventura, thus improving access to Colombia's largest port
on the Pacific coast.
10.       The total cost of the Project is estimated at the equivalent of
about US$62 million, including a foreign exchange component of US$31.2 million.
The proposed loan would finance this foreign exchange component, plus
US$800,000 equivalent of local expenditures on consultants. At the request
of the Colombian authorities, and in order to avoid any apparent discrimi-
nation between foreign and local consultants,I agreed to recommend Bank
financing for 50 percent of consultant services irrespective of their source.
Since it now appears that Colombian consultants will do a major part of the
work, the foreign exchange component of consultant services comes to only
$1.0 million as compared with the $1.8 million proposed to be financed by thc
Bank.
11.       The executing agency would be the Ministry of Fublic Works assisted
by consultants. Construction contracts for the paving, bridge and El Pailon
Buenaventura sub-projects would be let in accordance with the Bank's normal
international competitive bidding procedures.   Costs incurred prior to the
signing of the Loan Agreement would not be eligible for financing under the
Loan. For bidding purposes, the 48 sections of roads in the paving program
have been grouped into 13 packages, which have been determined on the basis
of geographical proximity, and are of a size which ensures wide opportunities
for international competitive bidding.
12.       The economic rates of return on the various sections of the Froject
range from 10.2 to 25 percent.
PA.iT IV - LEGAL II\'STRUNENTS AND AUTHORITY
13.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of the Resolution
approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the Executive Direc-
tors separately.
14.       The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions generally used for
highway projects. The Borrower would undertake a study of the effects of
tolls upon the traffic using the Barranquilla Bridge, and in the light of



the study, agree with the Bank on the criteria to be employed in deter-
mining the structure and level of such tolls. The Borrower would also
conduct a study to determine methods of improving cargo handling opera-
tions at major ports, especially reducing the turn-around time for trucks
serving the port of Buenaventura,and consult with the Bank on the recommen-
dations resulting therefrom. Finally, the Borrower would undertake to
continue the reorganization of the Ministry of Public Works, which was
begun as part of the Fifth Highway Project (Loan 550 CO).
PAiRT V - THE ECONOMCY
1h.       A summary of recent economic developments and a favorable con-
clusion regarding Colombia's creditworthiness for additional external
borrowing is contained in paragraphs 15 - 20 of my Report and Recommendation
on the loan for the Second Education Project (P-799 ), dated April 30, 1970.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
15.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
16.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
