The primary objective of the project was the\n            reduction and alleviation of poverty in Zambia through\n            support of measures aimed at increasing economic growth and\n            improving social services. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: 1) first, budget\n            targets can be an effective tool for improving several\n            services, provided there is follow through on monitoring\n            actual disbursements and provided that policy reforms within\n            the sectors are proceeding at the same time; 2) second,\n            sub-sectoral budgetary targets (e.g., for supplies) are\n            particularly important in achieving final results since\n            overall sectoral spending targets can be met by inflating\n            personnel costs with little discernible impact on the\n            quality of services; 3) third, providing access by the\n            government to independent expertise can be an effective way\n            of allowing them to discover the analytical merits of a\n            particular position; and 4) fourth, it is better to keep\n            such operations simple with a minimum of tranches and\n            specific conditions."}, "docdt": "1996-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
