It will also help relieve the acute\n            shortage of housing, begin the process of completing and\n            divesting existing Government owned housing units, and\n            demonstrate more cost-effective approaches to the provision\n            of shelter for the urban poor. Given specific objectives of\n            the project and its short 2-year duration, institutional\n            development objectives should be limited to those critical\n            to successful project implementation.  Specifically, the\n            project includes infrastructure rehabilitation and\n            maintenance works in Accra, Tema, Kumasi and\n            Sekondi-Takoradi; urban upgrading; housing consolidation;\n            and sites and services.
