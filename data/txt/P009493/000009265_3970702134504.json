operational and\n            financial performance, expansion of existing water supply\n            and sewerage systems in metropolitan Dhaka, and\n            strengthening of sectoral training and planning.  It aims to\n            achieve them through:  implementation of a large-scale leak\n            detection program to reduce leakage and unaccounted-for\n            water; installation of a computer system in DWASA for\n            commercial management and monitoring of operations; and a\n            study of DWASA staff productivity and deployment of staff\n            resources.  The project further supports expansion of water\n            supply and sewerage facilities; rehabilitation of old water\n            mains; and a pilot low-cost sanitation program.  Lastly,\n            this venture provides for the resettlement of residents at\n            Demra if necessary."}, "docdt": "1986-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
