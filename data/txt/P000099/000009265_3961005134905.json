Security Project will assist the Government in\n            improving the food security and nutrition standards of the\n            most vulnerable population groups of the country. The\n            project will focus on poverty alleviation in pre-identified\n            problem-areas, however, the situation would be regularly\n            monitored and the scope of the project adapted. Further\n            targeting will be carried out in those areas to ensure that\n            assistance be provided to the most disadvantaged segments of\n            the rural population. The approach will build upon specific\n            situations and constraints, aiming at their solution through\n            the empowerment of local communities, with particular\n            emphasis on women groups. Selected nongovernmental\n            organization's will help rural groups design and\n            implement micro-projects aimed at developing sustainable\n            income generating activities, employment opportunities and\n            improve their nutritional standards. NGOs will help raise\n            group interest and participation in the implementation of\n            development activities and help the community access sources\n            of financing and support. The project will comprise three\n            major components: a) local community support for preparation\n            and implementation of micro-projects; b) nutrition\n            activities, through local community nutrition agents\n            supported by NGOs, children in the target populations and\n            implementation of beneficiary assessment; and c) institution\n            strengthening to support the planning and monitoring of the\n            nutrition and food security situation, and management\n            coordination and support of project activities in the field."}, "docdt": "1994-03-09T00:00:00Z"}
