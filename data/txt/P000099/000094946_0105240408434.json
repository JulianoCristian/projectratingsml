The overall sustainability rating of\n            the project is uncertain because of the numerous risk\n            factors still existing and because project activities cannot\n            be expanded without a new project. However, there are\n            positive factors for sustainability: The Government is\n            systematically following the market-oriented policies put in\n            place nearly a decade ago. These policies have removed most\n            of the disincentives to increasing agricultural production,\n            and emphasized greater transparency, accountability, and\n            private-sector involvement in development of the rural\n            sector. The overall performances by the World Bank and the\n            Borrower were both rated satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            included the following: a pilot project will not give all\n            the lessons needed and the design of the first follow-on\n            must be flexible enough to allow for corrective actions.\n            Linking of the nutrition and micro-project components and a\n            community approach was essential for the success of this\n            project. Implementation of food security and other programs\n            using micro-projects can be trusted to local nongovernmental\n            organizations, but it is possible only if the government has\n            a positive attitude toward NGOs and allows that borrowed\n            funds can be disbursed for their programs. Strict selection\n            criteria needs to be applied when admitting NGOs into the\n            program. Early and firm action must be taken when NGOs are\n            failing or are misusing financing opportunities."}, "docdt": "2001-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
