MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR A COMMUNITY-BASED FOOD SECURITY PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Benin for SDR 7.1 million (US$9.7 million
equivalent), on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a community-
based food security project. The project was prepared in close collaboration with the Danish
International Development Agency (DANIDA) who will provide the equivalent of US$4.9
million towards the project. The World Food Program and participating NGOs would also
contribute to project financing.
2.   Background. Agriculture accounts for about 40% of GDP, over 70% of exports and
75% of the active population. The annual per capita income was abott US$410 in 1992,
which makes Benin one of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Population is
estimated at 4.9 million in 1991 with a growth rate of 3.2% per year. The geographical
distribution is very uneven with densities varying from 14 inhabitants/km2 in the north, to
340 inhabitantslkm2 in the south.
3.   While food insecurity in Benin is far from being as serious a problem as in the Sahel
countries or regions which have suffered from droughts or major conflicts, the percentage of
malnourished people is three times higher than in neighboring Togo or countries where climatic
and physical conditions are quite comparable. Notwithstanding a good potential for agricultural
production and an overall self-sufficiency in food, about 18% of Benin's populdtion and almost
30% of the children are considered to suffer from insufficient food intake or malnutrition.
Generally, insecurity situations result more from pervasive poverty and weak distribution
systems in remote areas than from a national lack of food supplies. Food insecurity situations
appear to be localized in pockets of a) overpopulated areas in the south, where land holdings
are small and severe degradation is taking place; b) enclave areas in the north with poor soil
quality or high degrees of erosion; and c) coastal areas where fishermen are experiencing
depletion of the resource base and little diversification opportunities. In some areas food
insecurity is chronic, revealing structurai shortcomings, deteriorating resources, remoteness
and lack of nutrition education, while in others the problems are transitory and vary from one
year to the other according to the overall supply, marketing and pricing situation.
4.   Attempts by the previous Government to control and regulate the food market through
storage, processing and market interventions have failed. Recent national policy changes have
permitted to redefine the role of the State in the context of a liberal economy, whe,e the
private sector will play the major role in food marketing. In that respect, the previous Cereals
Market.ng Board (ONC) was restructured in 1992 to become the National Bureau for Food
Security (ONASA) within the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR), with the mandate to
monitor the food security situation, disseminate the information on prices and markets,
promote private sector activities and export opportunities and fo,mulate and coordinate food
security strategies.
5.   Proiect objectives. The project would build on the experience of the IDA-financed pilot
operation, which, for three years, has successfully promoted an innovative partnership
between the Government and NGOs in support of grassroots local development initiatives.



- 2 -
Moreover, an important information collection effort led to the constitution of a data bank and
to the preparation of food security and nutrition maps of Benin. This has helped identify and
monitor areas at food security risk and set the basis for better planning and targeting of
project interventions.
6.   The proposed five year project would focus on poverty alleviation. It would assist the
Government in improving the food security and nutrition standards of the more vulnerab!e
population of about 20 areas ("sous-prefectures"), pre-selected for their high level of
insecurity. The project would aim at: a) improving the income base of those groups through
new income generating opportunities and regular access to food in the more risky areas
through simple agricultural, commercial, fisheries, peri-urban and socio-economic activities;
b) reducing malnutrition rates with particular focus on children under five years and pregnant
and lactating wormen; and c) strengthening the Govemment food security planning, monitoring
and evaluation capacity for better identification of the vulnerable populations and areas at risk.
7.    Proiect description. Within the limits of identified local implementation capabilities, the
proposed project would extend and develop the approach and the activities initiated during
the pilot phase. It would support target groups in preparing, implementing and managing
activities aimed at improving their food security and nutrition situation. The approach would
build upon specific constraints, aiming at their solution through the empowernent of local
communities with particular emphasis on women groups, who are key actors in the
implementation of food security strategies. Activities would comprise: (a) community support
for local development initiatives (64% of project costs, including about 17% as NGO and
beneficiary contribution) including i) income generating activities benefiting rural groups for
small agricultural projects and livestock raising techniques, food processing, small trading and
marketing; ii) small constructions and other rural works of a productive nature such as local
storage and conservation facilities, bottom-land development, watershed management or tree
nurseries; and iii) improvement of small infrastructures with direct local participation,
improvement of village access and feeder roads, anti-erosion works, livestock watering points,
and rehabilitation of market infrastructure; (b) nutrition activities (about 14% of project costs)
for the improvement of the nutritional status of women and children in the target populations,
through education, growth monitoring, supplementary feeding and referral to health
rehabilitation centers when required; and (c) institution building and coordination of field
activities (about 22% of project costs), including i) strengthening of the food security planning
and monitoring capacity, updating of the data base on vulnerable populations and information
systems; and ii) project management, technical and administrative support and training for
implementation and monitoring of field interventions.
8.    Project implementation. Field operations would be demand-driven and implemented by
rural groups and village communities with the assistance of selected NGOs and Det!elopment
Associations acting as sponsors of grassroots development initiatives and micro-project
proposals. The active involvement of the target groups concerned within each proposed
activity would be sought at the identification, planning and implementation stages. Criteria for
eligibility of micro-projects include that they a) contribute to improve food security and
nutrition standards of the poorest segments of the population; b) be financially sound; c)
demonstrate the beneficiaries' interest through initial contribution, corr mitment to recover the
initial capital and capacity to maintain the investment; and d) do not substitute for other
sources of financing. Eligible beneficiaries would be rural groups aild communities receiving
assistance and training from eligible NGOs, private consulting firms, and support services.
Fifty per cent of the project's budget for income generating activities would be devoted



exclusively to women's groups. Beneficiaries would contribute about 20% in cash or in kind
to the inve3tment cost of each activity. Assets and equipment directly benefiting rural groups
for income generating and socio-economic activities, would be subject to capital reconstitution
and cost recovery. Funds thus recovered would be rotated for other activities for the same
or another group. Small irnfrastructure or community investments would not be subject to cost
recovery but would require direct and voluntary community participation in the construction
and maintenance. Two workshops were held in the course of project preparation with
representatives of the Government, the NGO community and IDA to define the eligibility
criteria for the beneficiaries and the NGOs, and the mechanisms and procedures governing
micro-project preparation, implementation and financing. An Implementation Manual has been
prepared and agreed upon during negotiations. The community nutrition program would be
implemented by selected local community female nutrition workers with the assistance of
specialized NGOs and in coordination with the decentralized structures of the Food and
Applied Nutrition Directorate (DANA) of MDR and the Ministry of Health.
9.   Administration, support, coordination and monitoring of NGO field activities would be
entrusted to a small Management and Monitoring Unit (MMU), within ONASA, with staff
recruited from the domestic private market. The MMU would establish two regional offices,
one for the north and one for the south of the country. The MMU would also be in charge of
reviewing and appraising micro-project proposals, verifying eligibility criteria and entering into
contracts with approved NGOs and support agencies. ONASA would oversee project
implementation and would be responsible for institution building, including food security
planning and monitoring. A Coordinating Committee, with representatives of Government
services and of the NGOs, would provide overall guidance for project activities. The University
of Benin would be responsible for the evaluation of the project's development impact on the
targeted populations and for carrying out a beneficiary assessment.
10. Proiect sustainabilitv. Project activities would help address the needs of the most
disadvantaged communities and play a catalytic role to reactivate local economies. This would
enhance the beneficiaries' credit worthiness and enable them to eventually access local
financial institutions on a regular basis. By its in-built participatory approach, rural
communities involvement and contribution would be the most effective guarantee for
ownership, maintenance and sustainability of the activities at the ground level. Cost recovery
mechanisms would permit expansion of the project scope and durability beyond project life.
In addition, participation of the local Development Associations and of the public extension
staff in the implementation of NGO supported field activities, would contribute to establish
a relationship of complementarity and cooperation for better long term development impact.
By promoting a close linkage between income generating and nutrition activities, the project
woulk. not only aim at providing immediate nutritional assistance but also at reducing
pervasive poverty which in the long term is the main cause of malnutrition.
11. Lessons from orevious IDA involvement. Previous agricultural projects have often been
dictated by regional approaches focused on short-term production objectives with little
consideration for local community participation and farmer strategies. Moreoves,
administrative structures, although subject to a major reform, have proven ineffective in
targeting and accessing the poorest segments of the population to provide services tailored
to local community needs. The pilot phase proved that NGOs have a comparative advantage
in targeting assistance to the most vulnerable groups in a more effective and participative
way. Although the scope and scale of NGO interventions remain limited, they have proved
effective for the type of activities proposed. The overall development Inipact was positivo in



- 4 -
terms of promoting local economies and improving the nutritional status of the populations.
NGO coordination with public services in implementing specific actions would have to be
improved at the central and field level as a way to complement each other's specificity and
for increased long term development impact. Coordination mechanisms initiated underthe pilot
ohase proved useful to ensure guidance and dialogue between the Government and NGOs.
However, management and support of field activities should, as proposed, be decentralized
and benefit from great autonomy to be best responsive to the approach adopted.
1 i.  Rationale for IDA involvement. In the context of the Bank's involvement in food
security and poverty alleviation in Sub-Saharan Africa, Benin would be representative of
coastal countries where some insecurity prevails. A food security strategy paper for Benin was
prepared by IDA in 1990 and agreed upon with the Government. It also helped lay the
foundations of a national food security strategy and institutional and policy reforms. IDA has
played an important catalytic role in initiating new ventures cf partnership between the
Government and NGOs to promote remedial and sustainable actions among the most
vulnerable groups through a more targeted and grassroots approach. The proposed project is
fully in line with IDA and government strategy of fostering participation of the poor i l the
growth process. The country assistance strategy (CAS) for Benin was last discussed by the
Board in February 1992. A new CAS discussion is scheduled for June 1994 in the context of
a proposed Economic Rehabilitation Credit.
13.  Agreed actioyons. During negotiations the Gsvernment and IDA have agreed on a) the
content of the Imp!emento -ion Manual; b) the reporting and auditing requirements; c) the
focus on women activiL.es and the establishment of a 50% target of financing for income
genera'g activities to be devoted to women groups; and d) the implementation of a mid-term
review about .wo and a half years after Board approval. Conditions for effectiveness would
be that the Government appoint project auditors acceptable to IDA, establish an accounting
management and monitoring system, establish the Coordinating Committee and appoint the
professional staff of the MMU.
14.  Environmental aspects. The proposed project activities would not entail any significant
environmental impact or risk. By aiming at improving income levels, and stability of and
access to food supply, the project would contribute to limit rural exodus and enhance general
standards of living in rural areas, which should have a beneficial impact on the environment.
It has been classified as a Category C project.
1 5.  Program obiective categories. The proposed project belongs to the Program of Targeted
Interventions. It is in line with IDA efforts to better integrate poverty issues into the design
of assistance strategies, improve food security and address issues related to the Social
Dimension of Development (SDD) initiative. The project would dovetail with the on-going
poverty assessment to be completed in FY94. Its focus toward the support of women
activities is also in line with the Gender Development objective category.
16.  Pigiect benefits. Pilot activities show that NGOs have a comparative advantage in
addres-ing ioual community constraints in a cost effective way notwithstanding the small
scale and scope of their interventions. Most benefits would have a direct on-the-ground
visibility and would result in the reduction or elimination of the factors conducive to food
insecurity and malnutrition in the targeted project areas. Land development, diversification and
better crop conservation would enhance food supply, smooth before-harvest shortages and
increase producer income. Support for crop processing and marketing, and new income



generating activities would reactivate local economies. Small inf astructure and better access
to enclave areas would facilitate village integration into regional economies. Nutritional
activities and monitoring of infants growth would enhance the awareness of the household
of malnutrition causes and effects and improve their nutrition status. The project would also
help improve the capacity of NGOs and community groups and contribute to a better
identification and monitoring of food insecurity situations.
17.  fRisJ. The innovative project approach promoting partnership between the Government
and ONGs entails some risks which may stem from (a) changes in attitude and relationship
or lack of coordination between the Government and NGOs; (b) possible managerial and
technical weaknesses of NGOs, deriving from their relative inexperience; and c) the emergence
of opportunistic NGOs with different agendas from those of the beneeiciaries. These risks
would be reduced by (i) setting up collaboration and monitoring mechanisms, and maintaining
a constructive dialoaue between the different partners at the local and central level. IDA
resident staff and supervision missions would play a catalytic role in this respect; (ii)
strengthening of MMU's capacity to provide technical, financial and administrative support to
field activities; and {iii) the establishment of an Implementation Manual defining eligibility
criteria for the selection of NGOs according to criteria of experience and capability to sponsor
grassroots operations. Moreover, NGOs performance would be regularly monitored and
evaluated. Anotner risk may be linked to the slow implementation of the cost recovery
system. This would be reduced by (i) ensuring beneficiary commitment to the investments
through their initial contribution and participation; (ii) permitting rotation of recovered funds
at the local level; (ii) establishing contractual arrangements between the NGOs and the
beneficiaries, including monitoring and default clauses; and (iv) undertaking a training and
outreach effort to explain cost recovery mechanisms to potential participants. Finally, possible
institutional conflicts that may arise for the coordination of nutrition activities would be
mitigated by the preparation of a national nutrition policy and by ensuring coordination of the
different existing structures concemed.
18.  Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.

DISBURSEMENTS
The bulk of the portfolio has been put in place since Benin's move to a
democratic government and a market-oriented economy in 1991. Credit effectiveness
and, for that matter, project implementation of some operations have been delayed
because of the insistence of the newly elected Parliament, in which the Government
only holds a small majority, to review in detail the related legal documents. Moreover,
project implementation issues, such as poor administration of special accounts and
non-compliance with the Bank's procurement procedures have slowed down
disbursements. A country implementation review in June 1992 addressed these and
other issues and agreed upon specific corrective actions, such as carrying out an audit
of the government debt (CAA) management ag incy, restructuring of some projects and
organization of a disbursement seminar for project coordinators which took place In
February 1993. The reorganization of the CAA is expected to be completed shortly.
Moreover, in September 1993, Government agreed to improve management of special
accounts, formerly admin-istered by the CAA. Special accounts would be opened and
maintained in a commercial bank, in line with the Bank's Loan Administration
Department's recommendations.
