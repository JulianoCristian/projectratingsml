"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Public Financial\n            Management Reform Project (PFMR) for Afghanistan were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was high, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: management oversight is a key to good\n            governance. This oversight is constrained by the lack of an\n            effectively operating internal audit function, except in the\n            Ministry of Finance (MOF). Building internal audit capacity\n            in each line ministry cannot be done in the short term so\n            implementing the approach provided in the public expenditure\n            and finance law which entrusts MOF to establish internal\n            audit throughout the government will be the most effective\n            and expeditious route to establish the function across\n            government, while at the same time supporting the\n            development of internal audit in the line ministries, where\n            feasible.  The country operating environment carries a high\n            risk to perceived corruption. Further strengthening of\n            procurement and audit including developing social\n            accountability and support for the activities of the public\n            accounts committee should help address these issues.  The\n            PFMR tended, correctly, to measure results in terms of\n            quantitative achievements (numbers trained, audits received,\n            line ministries adopting rules) but these are more like\n            necessary conditions for progress; the project could also\n            have taken additional steps to track changes in the business\n            culture (for example, timeliness and quality of functions;\n            employee morale; turnover and absenteeism, among other\n            indicators related to business culture)."}, "docdt": "2012-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
