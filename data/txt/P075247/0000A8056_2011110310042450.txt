                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The mission rates overall implementation status as satisfactory. This is due to: (i) achievement of the target number of relocations and (ii) evidence of improved productivity and
                         incomes among project beneficiaries. As of November 2010, 15,142 households (compared to the target of 15,000) had relocated on 33,428 hectares. This means that the overall
                         target has been achieved, in terms of both the households relocated and land acquired and provided to the beneficiary households. The project impact evaluation report shows that

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In view of the project completion in September 2011, the mission recommends that Government should ensure close follow-up of all issues required to bring the project to a
                         successful closure, such as completion of all remaining activities, especially those related to the group land titles transfers, land administration capacity building, as well as ensuring
                         that support to the beneficiary groups is properly handed over to the District Assemblies. Furthermore, given the nature of the project, the mission recommends close follow-up on all
                         issues to do with environmental and social safeguards to ensure the sustainability of development outcomes beyond the life of the project.

                         The mission also recommends that all contracts should be processed, and payment vouchers received before the project closing date of September 30, 2011. The Bank will prepare
                         and submit to Government a notice of the four months grace period from October, 2011 to January 31, 2012. During this period the project is expected to clear any outstanding
                         payments, but cannot initiate any new activities.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
