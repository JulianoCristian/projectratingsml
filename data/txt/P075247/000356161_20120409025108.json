Some lessons learned\n            includes: the voluntary community-based approach to land\n            reform prevents social tensions and political interferences\n            but requires time and sound capacity building efforts.\n            Beneficiaries prefer to relocate within or close to their\n            original homes. There is a need for a supportive policy\n            environment and efficient land administration services. Land\n            reform programs should be embedded within broader rural\n            development support."}, "docdt": "2012-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
