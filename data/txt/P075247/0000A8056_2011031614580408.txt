                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The mission noted some delays in the implementation of the activities under the Additional Financing, such as for example, the capacity building in land administration. As such, we
                         recommend that the project implementation (IP) rating should be down-graded to moderately satisfactory.

                         In order to speed up the implementation of the activities under the additional financing, the mission has come up with a Work Program Agreement spanning through May 2011. The
                         Ministry of Lands will be expected to, among other activities: (i) speed-up the capacity building for staff in land administration; (ii) finalize key procurements including surveying and
                         land administration equipment and software, (iii) complete the modernization of the land registries; and (iv) finalize the stakeholder consultations for the Draft Land Bill.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
