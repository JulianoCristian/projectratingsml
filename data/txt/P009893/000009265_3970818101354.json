III\n            Project will encompass two command areas: Jayakwadi (200,000\n            ha) and Majalgaon (100,000 ha). The main components for\n            Jayakwadi will be: (i) completion of irrigation systems on\n            about 45,500 ha; (ii) completion of main drains, link\n            drains, and rural roads on about 153,000 ha; (iii)\n            construction of field channels, drains, and structures on\n            about 68,000 ha and field-channel protection on about\n            102,000 ha; (iv) landshaping of about 128,000 ha; (v)\n            development of three Specially Developed Distributories on\n            about 7,300 ha; and (vi) technical support to farmers. For\n            Majalgaon, the project will include; (i) constructing 116\n            canal regulation structures; (ii) construction of Majalgaon\n            main canal from km 67 to km 100; (iii) construction of the\n            distribution system up to the 1-cusec outlet in an area of\n            about 57,000 ha; (iv) construction of main and secondary\n            drainage and road networks on about 24,000 ha; (v) on-farm\n            developments and landshaping of about 24,000 ha; (vi)\n            development of a Majalgaon SDD on 4,000 ha; and (vii)\n            technical support to farmers. The project will increase\n            agricultural production and farmers' income in the two\n            commands. The project provides for landshaping and for\n            system operation methods which will ensure that all farmers\n            will obtain a reliable water supply."}, "docdt": "1985-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
