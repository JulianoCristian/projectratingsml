The main objective of the\n            original and restructured project was to substantially raise\n            agricultural production and farmers' incomes by\n            improving the use of the poorly drained black cotton soils\n            and the available water in the reservoirs of the\n            subprojects. The performance of the Bank in appraising the\n            project was deficient.   The Borrower performed well in the\n            preparation, including designs, tendering, procurement, and,\n            with the improvement in project management, the\n            restructuring was approved by the Bank. The lessons learned\n            from the project are classified as follows: (a) unless the\n            adequacy of water supply and the proper management of the\n            existing systems is ensured, expansion of irrigation\n            facilities to new areas in the culturable command area (CCA)\n            of the subprojects should not be taken up; (b) no new\n            projects should be considered for financing unless an\n            effective and sustainable Operation and Maintenance  system\n            covering both the construction and operational periods is\n            agreed upon and implemented; (c) The effectiveness of Water\n            Users' Associations should be judged not only in terms\n            of financial and water management, but also in terms of\n            their ability to maintain the structures turned-over to\n            them; (d) Bank should ensure that, in all new projects\n            providing irrigation facilities to traditionally rainfed\n            areas, an agricultural component with a separate budget is\n            included in the project from the outset (e) an Economic\n            Rehabilitation of Project component must be backed by a\n            detailed action plan prior to project implementation; and\n            (f) the review of technical aspects are as important as the\n            other social, economic, and financial aspects."}, "docdt": "1997-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
