 Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Project will achieve the target values for the project outcome indicators by the planned closing date (April 2015). The Basic Municipal Services Project
 includes 22 sub-projects, out of which 19 are already finished,and three are in the last stages of construction. The subprojects are benefiting directly
 173,000 people and 1,115,000 indirectly, exceeding the target of one million beneficiaries for the first Project outcome indicator. The project also
 achieved second Project outcome indicators as 12 out of 21 beneficiary Municipalities show greater NBI (Unmet Basic Needs index) than the average
 provincial NBI, showing the equitable targeting of resources.

 Sub-projects include improvement in water and sewerage services and wastewater treatment plant, construction of sewerage collectors, urban
 drainage and urban and rural roads.

 The Project Implementation Unit is actively working with the Provincial Implementation Units to ensure proper works supervision and make sure all on
 going works will be completed within the lifetime of the project. At the same time, PIU is implementing an action plan to strengthen the Operation and
 Maintenance of the infrastructures to ensure sustainability, a workshop specifically on road maintenance was carried out in October 2014 and a final
 workshop for all subproject is planned for April of 2015.

 From the supervision mission in August 2014 it was possible to detect that subprojects have had an impact on improvement in tourism related
 activities, reduce cost related to the cleaning of septic tanks, water demand control, real state valuation, improvements in road safety measures,
 increase in the collection of taxes, reduction in the cost related to vehicle repairs, and new urban interventions near the project areas, among others.
 These initial impacts would have to be studied in detail but were detected from the visits, the final workshop will provide a space for discussion on the
 impacts of the subprojects directly with the municipalities and/or provinces involved.

 Given that both Project outcome indicators would be met, progress towards achievement of Project Development Objectives is rated Satisfactory.
 Given that all works are expected to finish on time, there are no major implementation problems, and no social and environmental issues have been
 reported, progress in overall project implementation is rated Satisfactory.

               There was no interest from the Provinces and Municipalities in the institutional strengthening component. Nevertheless it is expected to
               assess in the closing workshop wether the project had an impact on the municipalities.

               Although the project faced many difficulties throughout all its implementation, finally it was possible to commit all project funds, and deliver
               the subprojects to more beneficiaries than planned. At the same time, some construction works faced delays for many reasons affecting the
               planning. Nevertheless to date all subprojects are expected to finish before the project closing date.
