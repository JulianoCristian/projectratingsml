                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is progressing well and will achieve the target values for the project outcome indicators by the planned closing date (April 2015). The Basic Municipal
                         Services Project includes 22 sub-projects, out of which 15 are already finished, benefiting directly 180,000 people and indirectly 1,150,000 people - which already exceeds the target
                         number of expected beneficiaries - and 7 sub-projects still under construction, which would benefit directly 114,000 people and 145,000 indirectly. Once all 22 sub-projects are
                         completed, about 1.5 million people would benefit directly and indirectly from the project, exceeding the target of one million beneficiaries for the first Project outcome indicator. The

                                                                                                                                                                                                          Page 1 of 7

                         project will also achieved second Project outcome indicator as 12 out of 21 beneficiary Municipalities show greater NBI (Unmet Basic Needs index) than the average provincial NBI,
                         showing the equitable targeting of resources.

                         Sub-projects include improvement in water and sewerage services and wastewater treatment plant, construction of sewerage collectors, urban drainage and urban and rural roads.

                         The 110 million USD loan proceeds are totally committed. The disbursements have been progressing significantly in the last 24 month, from 38 percent in Sept 2012 to 86 percent in
                         September 2014.

                         The Project Implementation Unit is actively working with the Provincial Implementation Units to ensure proper works supervision and make sure all on going works will be completed
                         within the lifetime of the project. At the same time, PIU is implementing an action plan to strengthen the Operation and Maintenance of the infrastructures to ensure sustainability, a
                         workshop specifically on road maintenance is planned for October 2014 and a second one for water projects is planned for the first months of 2015.

                         From the last supervision mission in August 2014 it was possible to detect that subprojects have had an impact on improvement in tourism related activities, reduce cost related to the
                         cleaning of septic tanks, water demand control, real state valuation, improvements in road safety measures, increase in the collection of taxes, reduction in the cost related to vehicle
                         repairs, and new urbanistic interventions near the project areas, among others. These initial impacts would have to be studied in detail but were detected from the visits.
