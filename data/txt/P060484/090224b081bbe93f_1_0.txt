                         sub-projects under approval and ready to bid 24% of loan allocation. These 22 sub-projects would use the entire project allocation for sub-projects and can be tendered before end of

                         It is expected that the 22 sub-projects, when finished, will make a significant contribution to PDO achievement, (specifically on water and sanitation services coverage). The
                         Government has reiterated its interest and commitment in continuing with Project implementation to its successful completion and making the most use of the available loan amount.
                         To this effect the Government has requested the increase of Bank financing levels to 100% for works categories and a reallocation of funds between categories, which was approved
                         with the last restructuring.
