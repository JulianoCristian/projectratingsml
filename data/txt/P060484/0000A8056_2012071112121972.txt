                         Implementation Status Overview
                         During the last supervision mission in November 2011 where there was an acknowledgment by the Bank about the important advances made by the PIU in the sub-projects
                         preparation, and also the need to restructure the project. Project Restructuring introduced the following changes: (i) Extension of the loan’s closing date for twenty (20) months from
                         March 31, 2012 until November 30, 2013; (ii) Reallocation of loan proceeds to enable funding additional investments on road infrastructure subprojects (rehabilitation and paving); (iii)
                         Increase the percentage of expenditures to be financed by the loan for categories 1 and 2 in the Loan Agreement to up to 100%; and (iv) Update the Project’s Result Framework

                         based on implementation experience. The proposed changes aimed at allowing flexibility to accelerate Project implementation and maximize achievement of Project Development
                         Objective. Project implementation has improved significantly, both in accelerating the disbursement rate, and also in the quality and processing of subprojects.

                         To date, disbursements have increased from 19% in May 2011 to 31% in October 2011 and 42% in May 2012. In addition there has been a considerable effort in the last few months

                         and good advance in the portfolio of eligible sub-projects prepared to acceptable technical standards. The sub-projects that are almost ready to be tendered under a public bidding
                         process by June 2012 amount to US$18.5 million aprox. The sub-projects in the pipeline make a significant contribution to PDO achievement, (specifically on water and sanitation
                         services coverage) and have been prepared to a good technical standard. The Government has reiterated its interest and commitment in continuing with Project implementation to its
                         successful completion and making the most use of the available loan amount. To this effect the Government has requested the increase of Bank financing levels to 100% for works
                         categories and a reallocation of funds between categories, which was approved with the last restructuring.

                         Despite above mentioned progress, full and satisfactory completion of the project by closing date is today the main project challenge. To achieve this it is key to work with the goal of
                         having all remaining subprojects under implementation by end 2012.
