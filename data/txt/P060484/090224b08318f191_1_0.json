satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the decision to\n            structure the projects with a demand driven approach (for\n            flexibility and to respond to a variety of local demands)\n            limited the depth of the technical discussion and decreased\n            the possibility to support sectorial reforms. Although\n            subproject eligibility criteria required detailed economic\n            and technical evaluation of individual investments, it is\n            important to note that individual subprojects in a\n            multi-sector project do not receive the same level of\n            attention as in operations with a more limited scope.\n            Focusing on fewer sectors seems to be a more effective\n            strategy to mitigate this risk and, at the same time, to\n            fully capitalize on economies of scale and the know-how\n            generated by the project. This applies for both physical\n            investments and institutional development. The participating\n            Provinces and Municipalities expressed their appreciation of\n            the internal capacity build through the experience of\n            preparing and executing projects in alignment with\n            international best practices. However, the extent of this\n            capacity building was limited to the execution of one or two\n            subproject in each institution. Efforts should be made to\n            maximize the use of systemic improvements through the\n            implementation of specific measures to improve existing\n            systems at the Provincial and Municipal level, instead of\n            focusing on subproject level compliance with sophisticated\n            requirements. Project implementation arrangements requiring\n            sub-lending at the provincial and municipal level lead to\n            significant delays within Argentina\u2019s institutional framework."}, "docdt": "2015-10-27T22:51:01Z"}
