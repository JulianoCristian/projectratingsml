F. Results Framework Analysis


Project Development Objectives
(From the Loan Agreement) The objective of the Project is to improve the quality of: (a) basic
municipal services, through the provision of water supply and sanitation, urban drainage and roads
infrastructure in an equitable and fiscally sustainable manner within the territorial jurisdiction of
Participating Provinces; and (b) life of the population to be benefited by the provision of said
services.1

1 PDO formulation in the PAD is slightly different: “Improve the quality of life and the quality of basic municipal services
through the provision of water supply and sanitation, urban drainage, and roads infrastructure in an equitable and fiscally
sustainable manner.” As per the ICR guidelines, the PDO from the Loan Agreement will be used as a basis for this
evaluation.

                Target achieved. Necesidades Básicas Insatisfechas (NBI) is an index used by
                the Government of Argentina to measure access to basic needs - crowding,
                housing, sanitation, educational status and related measures. It was envisaged at

                the census tract level, to compare the NBI of the areas covered by the Project
                with the average NBI at the municipal level. During implementation, it became

                World Bank agreed to measure the indicator as the number of subprojects
                implemented in a municipality with an NBI higher than the average NBI of the
                respective province. Based on the 2011 census information from the National
                Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC) (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y
                Censos), 12 out of the 21 participating Municipalities have a higher NBI than the
                Provincial average, representing 55 percent of the sample.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Argentina's recovery in the years following the 2001-02 economic crisis was impressive.
After three years of fast growth (averaging roughly 8.8 percent during 2003-05), at the time of
Project approval in 2006, gross domestic product (GDP) had recovered to pre-crisis levels. A
Country Assistance Strategy for the period 2006-2008 3 was approved in May 2006 with the
objective of supporting Government efforts to transition from crisis recovery to sustained, private
sector-led growth with improved equity and reduced structural poverty. Support to infrastructure
development represented the main lending area in the 06-08 CAS, recognizing the need to rebuild
key infrastructure capacity following several years of decline in infrastructure investment4.

2.       Within Argentina’s federal structure, subnational governments play a key role in service
delivery, although both provincial and municipal governments have remained highly dependent
on transfers from higher levels of governments. Additionally, in spite of a high level of
decentralization from the federal to the provincial level, the municipal sector has remained
underdeveloped in Argentina. Municipalities are dependent on the provinces, which dictate their
organization, taxing powers, and basic service delivery responsibilities. Priorities were identified
at Project appraisal to enhance the municipal sector’s capacity to finance, manage, regulate and
deliver infrastructure services while at the same time improving the efficiency and sustainability of
investment. These included: (a) improving the municipalities financial autonomy, accountability,
and market discipline, (b) improving the use of public funds to leverage access to private capital
investment, and (c) scaling up capacity building activities.

3.       Municipal expenditures have been increasing in the period following the 2001-02 crisis
but have remained a small fraction of overall public expenditure, and financial autonomy at the
municipal level has not improved. Between 1990 and 2005, municipal expenditure fluctuated
between 2 and 2.8% of GDP. Since 2006, municipal expenditures have been increasing, reaching
3.4% of GDP in 20135. However, this increase has taken place in the context of a faster expansion
of overall public expenditure, reducing the share of municipal expenditure in the total public
expenditure from 8.5% in 2006 to 6.7% in 2013. In addition, Fiscal reforms following the 2001-02
crisis have taken the form of greater concentration of revenues and centralization of authority over
debt management. At the time of project preparation, the National Government had introduced two
main instruments of fiscal coordination: the Federal Fiscal Responsibility Law, enacted in 2004
through Law 25917 and the provincial debt authorization mechanism enacted through Resolution
1075/93 issued by the National Ministry of Economy and Production. The latter resolution grants
powers to the Ministry of Economy and Production to authorize all domestic and external
provincial and municipal borrowing operations that are denominated in foreign currency or that
commit, as collateral, resources from the federal revenue sharing system.

4.      The BMSP was designed to contribute to the higher-level objectives of the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) and was included in the lending program of the 2006-2010 CAS. The
Project substantially supported one of the CAS’s three pillars, sustained economic growth with

percent of GDP, placing Argentina at the lower end among Latin American countries .

opportunities to build on an investment partnership to support Government efforts to transition
from crisis recovery to sustained growth with equity and reduced structural poverty. Expanding
access to all segments of Argentine society, in all parts of the country, to basic services was a key
element in meeting these strategic objectives.

5.       The Project was structured around three key investment sectors (Water Supply and
Sanitation, Urban Drainage and Roads, and Capacity Building and Training), which broadly
corresponded to local needs across provinces and which formed the core of emerging civil works
and investment demand from municipalities expected to participate in the Project. Municipal
governments in Argentina are primarily responsible for the provision of basic water and sanitation
services (including solid waste management), local urban transport investment and management,
traditional municipal investments such as drainage and street lighting, and a host of smaller local
services such as parks, cemeteries, and markets.

6.       The provision of basic municipal services in Argentina has been facing several
challenges in key sector issues, including (a) expanding the coverage of basic services; (b)
improving the efficiency by which services are delivered; (c) reducing the cost of services and
making them sustainable by improving the selection process through which infrastructure is
designed and “rightsizing” investment; and (d) putting in place cost recovery mechanisms which,
in the context of the limited fiscal capacity of municipalities to finance investment through general
revenues, address financing needs for operation, maintenance, and depreciation.

7.       Bank’s previous experience in Argentina. The Bank had accumulated over 15 years of
experience supporting the Government through two other previous municipal projects: Municipal
Development (MDPI) and Second Municipal Development (MDPII). With a focus on physical
infrastructure and training, both projects aimed to mobilize resources for municipal investments
and build municipal capacity for investment planning and execution. The Basic Municipal Services
Project (BMSP) built upon that experience and recognized the need to focus and deepen the Bank’s
engagement. The Bank’s engagement and the Government’s approach had been successful in
maintaining financial flows to local governments in the face of the economic crisis and in providing
a source of funds for capital investment. BMSP maintained that trajectory and supported the
Government’s efforts to provide a source of investment resources for fiscally sustainable
municipalities. Finally, the operation aimed to maintain the Bank’s presence in Argentina and to
engage in a medium-term policy dialogue to further address the sector’s reform and development
needs.

8.     Bank’s value added in Subproject design and selection to improve Municipal Capital
Investment Planning. BMSP sought to assist participating municipalities in three fundamental
ways:

    -   First, by focusing investments on a selected set of high-impact basic services sectors,
        namely water and sanitation, roads and urban drainage which, when properly targeted, can
        have significant economic and social benefits.
    -   Second, by enhancing the technical, economic, and financial screening of subprojects and
        of service providers to ensure “rightsizing” of investments and to advance towards service
        sustainability.
    -   Third, by introducing incremental but important changes in the institutional arrangements.
        For instance, by involving sector actors in Project oversight at the provincial and central
        levels, and by embedding local investments within provincial sector plans prepared by each
        province.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9.       Project Development Objective, Loan Agreement 6 : The objective of the Project is to
improve the quality of: (a) basic municipal services, through the provision of water supply and
sanitation, urban drainage and roads infrastructure in an equitable and fiscally sustainable manner
within the territorial jurisdiction of Participating Provinces; and (b) life of the population to be
benefited by the provision of said services.

10.      Key Indicators: (1) One million consumers benefit directly or indirectly from improved
access to reliable and safe water supply and sanitation, urban drainage infrastructure and improved
roads; (2) Beneficiaries in a majority of subprojects for water, sanitation, urban drainage and urban
road have greater NBI7 on average than the municipal average.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

11.     PDO Indicator 1 was reworded during the 2012 restructuring to define the target
beneficiaries as either direct or indirect, and to account for beneficiaries of improvements made in
both new and existing infrastructure. Calculating direct and indirect beneficiaries varies according
to each subproject, but can be differentiated in broad terms. Direct beneficiaries refer to residents
of properties having benefitted from new connections to water, sanitation and sewerage supply
networks, as well as those bordering improved roads. Indirect beneficiaries refer to a wider
population, such as people that live in the area where the subprojects were carried out and who are
also benefitting from the overall economic and social impacts attributed to them. The detailed
descriptions of direct and indirect beneficiaries for each subproject are presented in Annex 2
Outputs of Component 1.

  PDO formulation in the PAD is slightly different: “Improve the quality of life and the quality of basic municipal
services through the provision of water supply and sanitation, urban drainage, and roads infrastructure in an equitable
and fiscally sustainable manner.” The PDO was not formally revised, despite issues with inconsistent wordings. Due to
Argentina’s political situation, the World Bank Board did not discuss any Argentina -related projects for a period of 3.5
years between 2011 and 2014 (see Factors affecting Implementation), during which period no document related to
Argentina (including Level 1 Restructurings) was submitted for approval to the Board of Directors.

  Necesidades Básicas Insatisfechas (NBI) is a measure used by the Government of Argentina to measure
access to basic needs - crowding, sanitation, educational status and related measures.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.      Primary beneficiaries: The project’s primary target groups were the direct and indirect
beneficiaries of the capital investments (water supply and sanitation, urban drainage, and roads
infrastructure), through improvements in their quality of life. In the majority of subprojects, direct
beneficiaries were individuals with homes or other kinds of properties (e.g. farms and businesses)
that gained new access to water supply, sanitation and drainage, or bordered improved roads. In
addition to these direct beneficiaries, subprojects benefitted larger groups within the participating
municipalities. For example, road improvement subprojects brought benefits in terms of traffic
congestion and reduced travel times as well as lower vehicle operation costs. Investments in water
supply systems generated benefits beyond the new connections provided through system-wide
improvements in the quality of service. These benefits were identified through the social and
economical analysis prepared for each subproject during implementation, and the quantification of
indirect beneficiaries was estimated for each subproject on this basis.

13.      Secondary beneficiaries: Eligible beneficiaries include municipalities and basic service
providers, regulators and policymakers in the water and sanitation and roads sectors through
capacity improvements derived from project preparation, implementation and technical assistance
for capital investment planning.


1.5 Original Components (as approved)

14.    Component 1: Municipal Infrastructure (US$ 132.6 million, including US$ 99.4 million
of Bank financing). The component financed investments to improve water supply and sanitation,
urban drainage, and basic transportation access services in participating provinces and
municipalities. Specifically, investments in the following sectors will be included:

    -    Basic Water and Sanitation, including the construction and rehabilitation of production
         infrastructure, primary and secondary water supply networks, sewer network rehabilitation
         and expansion, water treatment plants, construction, rehabilitation and expansion of
         existing wastewater treatment and disposal facilities.
    -    Urban Drainage and Small Retention Works, including the rehabilitation and expansion
         of drainage network and small retention works. Subprojects under this component would
         be relatively small and would complement investments under - where possible - the parallel
         flood protection APL. Typical investments would include main drainage and secondary
         networks, manholes and junctures.
    -    Urban and Productive Roads, including works for the pavement and rehabilitation of
         urban, municipal connector and productive roads in order to both increase access and
         improve traffic flows through paved roads for under-serviced urban neighborhoods and
         rehabilitate priority segments of productive roads that will have an important impact on the
         reduction of logistics costs.

15.     Component 2: Institutional Strengthening of Municipalities and Service Providers
(US$ 5.0 million, including US$ 5.0 million of Bank financing). The component was designed to
finance technical assistance primarily at the municipal level for improved planning, management


participating municipality with that for the specific project area as measured at the level of census tract(s),
the specific methodology for measurement was expected to be developed during implementation.

                                                       4
and operational capacity that aims specifically to improve the quality and coverage of water,
sanitation, sewerage, urban drainage and roads services. Eligible beneficiaries include
municipalities and basic service providers, regulators and policy makers in the water and sanitation
and roads sectors. Subprojects for technical assistance under this component would also be on-lent
to municipal and provincial service providers in a manner similar to Component 1 for works. The
component would finance demand-driven technical assistance including, but not limited to:

      -   Capacity building for technical, economic, financial, social and environmental preparation
          and assessment of subprojects.
      -   Multi-year strategic investment planning and budgeting.
      -   Tariff reviews.
      -   Updating and improving cadaster of users.
      -   Improvements in billing, collection and commercial management.
      -   Technical exchanges, twinning and outreach activities.
      -   Information, communications and education campaigns in key service sectors.
      -   Poverty targeting and monitoring mechanisms as part of investment planning.
      -   Preparation of territorial sector development and urban development plans.
      -   Business and operational planning for service providers.

16.     Component 3: Program Management (US$5.3 million, including US$5.3 million of
Bank financing) to finance the operating expenses associated with program management,
monitoring, evaluation and supervision. The component financed the staffing of the Central
Executing Unit/Unidad Ejecutora Central (UEC) with technical specialists including sanitary
engineers, environmental experts, roads experts and economists to effectively support subproject
development and assessment, as well as procurement and financial management staff. Additional
key activities to be financed under the component through external technical assistance and
consultant services included:

      -   Project preparation assistance.
      -   Monitoring of poverty impacts.
      -   Impact evaluation.
      -   Public opinion monitoring.
      -   Independent technical review of works.
      -   Dissemination and outreach activities, including efforts to promote good practices at the
          local level.

1.6 Revised Components

17.       Not applicable.

1.7 Other significant changes

18.      A total of four Project Restructurings were carried out. The first restructuring (2008)
introduced changes in implementation arrangements, mainly transferring responsibilities from the
Municipal to the Provincial level. The second restructuring (2010) triggered the OP 4.12 on
Involuntary Resettlement for a subproject in Rio Negro, and for any potential resettlements in
existing or future subprojects. The third restructuring (2012) extended the project closing date,
reallocated funds between components and adjusted the Results Framework to reflect demand. The
last restructuring (2013) introduced a second extension of the project closing date. Further details
of each restructuring are presented in section 2.2 Implementation.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.      The project preparation introduced improvements based on the work and outcomes of
previous projects in Argentina. Albeit their successful ratings, past investments responded to a
large variety of municipal needs, all of which did not necessarily focus on achieving economic
growth and poverty reduction. The BMSP sought to focus the menu of subprojects for each
investment type to those that would result in positive economic and social impacts. It did so by
establishing a specific menu of eligible investments identified as key basic municipal services
(water supply and sanitation, roads and drainage), and strengthening the requirements for
subprojects using detailed technical eligibility criteria that was agreed during project preparation.
This was done to ensure the relevance and sustainability of eligible investments. At appraisal a set
of potential subprojects was identified and appraised. In addition, the process of subproject
preparation and screening during implementation also included a systematic economic and
financial analysis of every subproject.

20.     The project design incorporated lessons learned in implementation and on-lending
processes from the Bank’s earlier operations supporting municipal development activities in
Argentina. A three-layered implementation structure (i.e. federal government, provinces and
municipalities) was selected to maintain the sectoral dialogue at the national level, while at the
same time involving provinces and municipalities. The operation relied on the existing structure
for on-lending through public sector budget between federal, provincial and municipal
governments and for repayment along the same lines, instead of using intermediation. The project
did not aim to introduce reforms. To lessen foreign exchange risks, the GoA decided to on-lend to
participating provinces in United States Dollars, which in turn would on-lend to municipalities in
local currency.

21.      The operation reflected the GoA’s preferences on resource allocation, organizational
structure and targeting. The GoA requested to separate the BMSP’s implementation (through the
Ministry of Federal Planning) from that of the Subnational Governments Public Sector
Modernization Project (through the Ministry of the Interior). It was noted at appraisal that, as a
result, the BMSP was nearly a pure investment operation. However, the project was expected to
advance the municipal development agenda through improved transparency in the allocation of
subloans to eligible subprojects and improved focus on well-dimensioned sustainable investments.
The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) also notes that the GoA chose not to restrict the number
or geographical spread of participating provinces. It was recognized that the resulting small
amounts allocated to each participating province would limit the Project’s impact in terms of
leveraging investments to provincial reforms, and the operation was thus presented as a first step
focused on improving sustainability and introducing better project eligibility and management
practices.

22.     Based on previous project experiences, changes were integrated into subproject
proposals. The project incorporated eligibility criteria as a filter for project selection, and to
increase the quality of project proposals and provincial sector strategies (water, sanitation and
transportation) to define an investment plan. Subproject proposals included plans for cost recovery
of project investments. Also, the Project did not allow any expenditures in equipment.



                                                 6
2.2 Implementation

23.      The project experienced delays in signing the Loan and declaring effectiveness. The
project was approved in June 2006, but was not declared effective until June 2007. This delay was
mainly due to the procedures of the GoA that required the signature of a national decree, and which
affected most projects in Argentina. Let alone the processes which had to be completed at the
national and provincial level following the Project’s approval by the WB’s board of executive
director, the Project met the criteria for readiness for implementation at appraisal, and there were
no additional delays in signing the Loan and declaring effectiveness.

24.      Continuous changes in pipeline of subprojects required new projects to be identified and
prepared during implementation, involving a lengthy process and adding further delays. Project
design was overly optimistic when estimating the time length for approval of subprojects. Before
their implementation, subprojects required meeting the following conditions: (i) adoption of
Provincial Debts Laws9 that authorized the Provincial Executive to access project funding; (ii)
preparation of Provincial sector plans; and (iii) Bank approval after fulfilling all the key eligibility
criteria participation. Only after these three conditions were met, a Subsidiary Loan Agreement
(SLA) between the national government and the participating province was processed. Subsidiary
agreements specified the amount of funds each province was receiving from the Project, and the
total amount of funds approved by the Subsidiary Agreements could not exceed the total envelope
of the project. In some cases, the SAs with Provinces were amended because the selected
subprojects, which changed over time, exceeded the initial funding envelope.

25.      Table 2 below illustrates the timeline for local debt laws approval, signing of Subsidiary
Agreements and start of procurement procedures. As of 2008 (two years after the project approval),
only the province of Rio Negro had signed a Subsidiary Agreement 10 . Project implementation
improved after 2008, and by 2010, eight subsidiary agreements had been signed and 100% of
resources had been assigned to subprojects. It is important to note that after the project’s first
restructuring in 2008, which allowed the Provinces to take debt instead of the municipalities, the
project advanced at a faster rate.

26.      The Bank and UEC provided significant support to Municipalities to ensure timely
preparation of subprojects. The Municipalities had limited capacities in project preparation,
especially in meeting requirements related to economic and cost recovery analysis, technical
specifications, procurement procedures and safeguards compliance. Although the Bank and UEC
provided substantial and continuous support, it was not enough to avoid numerous Bank revisions
of project documents and delays in implementation. Project design provided for the financing of
capacity building for preparation of subprojects under Component 2, which would have been
helpful in this case. However, most provinces and municipalities proved unwilling to finance
technical assistance activities with loan proceeds resulting in very limited execution of the activities
identified under Component 2.

  Adoption of Provincial Debt Laws requires authorization by the Ministry of Finance for the Province to
take on more debt, and approval by the local legislative body.

27.      Shifts in the political and financial environments diminished demand for Bank
financing. The circumstances under which the BMSP was designed changed immediately after
project approval and effectiveness. Although it was initially assumed that the demand for Bank
funding from Provinces and Municipalities would be high given the shortage of funds for capital
investments, many other sources of funding later became available. With more options to choose
from, requiring fewer conditions for project approval and execution (e.g. economic evaluations of
subprojects and safeguards requirements), the Bank’s financing became a less attractive source.
Since this development was unforeseen at preparation, most of the original subprojects that were
to be financed by BMSP were dropped. The process to identify new subprojects for which
provinces and/or municipalities were willing and able to borrow took longer than anticipated.
Project implementation was therefore extended by three years. Similarly, even though the
justification to include a Capacity Building Component was initially sound, Project design
overestimated the Municipalities’ demand to finance capacity building activities with debt.

28.     Amendment to the Loan Agreement (Restructuring 1). On June 9, 2008 an amendment to
the loan agreement was approved to allow participating Provinces -upon written delegation by the

                                               8
pertinent Municipalities- to carry out and finance Subprojects instead of the Municipality itself.
Based on low municipal capacity, some Provinces believed that centralizing project
implementation at the provincial level would ensure better quality implementation.

29.      Triggering of OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement (Restructuring 2). On June 22, 2010
the project was restructured (Level one) to trigger the OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement. At the
time of appraisal no resettlement had been anticipated, but in 2009 the Bank was informed that a
subproject in the province of Rio Negro (productive roads in Roca-Allen) involved the demolition
of one house and resettlement of two individuals. The Bank team reviewed the case and concluded
that in spite of proactive efforts of the Central and Provincial executing units, the management of
the case did not fully comply with the Bank’s OP 4.12. Consequently, a Remedial Action Plan was
prepared and approved by the Bank in November 2009, and the second restructuring was approved
in June 2010 to trigger OP 4.12 so that the operation could develop the appropriate mechanisms to
manage and prepare for any resettlement issues that could arise under implementation.

30.      Extension of closing date, reallocation of funds and revision of Results Framework
(Restructuring 3). The third restructuring was approved in March 2012 and included an extension
of the closing date, a reallocation of funds between components and a revision of the Project’s
Results Framework. At the time this third restructuring was approved, the Project had disbursed 30
percent of the financing amount, and the list of subprojects to be financed had been mostly finalized
(albeit with significant differences from the initial list considered at appraisal). The BMSP was
prepared as a Framework Project that included subprojects on a subset of provinces and three
sectors (water and sanitation, urban drainage, roads), as reflected in the PDO. When the Project
was designed, Provinces were consulted and a list of potential subprojects was pre-identified. As
the Project started implementation, demand from the Provinces changed as other sources of federal
funding became available. As a consequence, the final list of subprojects financed by BMSP was
different than the one identified at preparation. The relative importance of sectors changed, namely
with demand concentrated in road projects rather than in water and sanitation.

31.      On March 6, 2012, the project was restructured to reflect the above-mentioned changes in
the following way:

    (i)     The closing date was extended from March 31, 2012 to November 30, 2013.
    (ii)    The percentage to be financed by the Bank for Categories 1 and 2 was increased from
            75% to 100% (dropping co-financing by Municipalities).
    (iii)   Funds were reallocated to better reflect municipalities’ demand. Demand for road
            infrastructure was significantly higher than anticipated while demand for water supply
            and sanitation was lower. Twenty million dollars were transferred from Category 1
            (Water) to Category 2 (Urban Drainage and Roads). Also participating Provinces
            showed little interest in using Category 3 expenditures (Capacity building and
            Training) since other sources of non-reimbursable funding for these kinds of activities
            became available. For this reason, US$4.4 million were reallocated from Category 3
            to Category 2.
    (iv)    The project adjusted the Results Framework to reflect changes in indicators.

32.      The table below summarizes the changes introduced in the Results Framework. While the
PDO remained unchanged, the PDO Indicator 1 was modified to differentiate between direct and
indirect beneficiaries. The target values for intermediate outcome indicators for Component One
were modified to reflect Provinces’ actual demand in each sector (i.e. decreasing target values
under basic water and sanitation and urban drainage subprojects, and increasing target values under
urban and productive roads subprojects).

33.      Second extension of closing date (Restructuring 4). On July 17, 2013 the project’s closing
date was extended from November 30, 2013 to April 30, 2015 (17 months), as requested by the
borrower. This was the second extension of the project’s closing date, accounting for a total of 37
months of extension. This second extension was necessary to allow for additional time to complete
ongoing contracts and new subprojects. The restructuring would also improve the impact of the
project and the likelihood of PDO achievement.

34.     Project implementation had a slow start, but the team was able to adjust to new
conditions through the restructurings, and ultimately disbursed most of the loan proceeds. Of
the seven potential participating provinces identified during appraisal, one did not participate
(Chubut) and three others were added (La Rioja, Salta and Santiago del Estero). Additionally, the
Bariloche subproject was dropped because it required triggering the Natural and Critical Habitats
Safeguard Policy, and no Level One Project restructuring could be carried out due to the freezing
of Board action on Argentina. Despite these changes in the Project’s pipeline, the Bank and
borrower remained committed to identifying new municipalities and subprojects to ensure full
disbursement of the loans and PDO achievement. The task proved challenging and long-delayed
but was successfully accomplished.

35.        The BMSP financed 22 subprojects in 9 provinces with various levels of capacity. As
shown in Table 6, road infrastructure received most of the funding (61%), followed by water and
sanitation (38%). Funding for urban drainage was minimal, with only one project implemented in
this category (1%). The average project amount was US$ 5.3 million. See Tables 6 and 7, and
Annex 2 for a complete list and description of the subprojects.

 36.     Freezing of Board Action on Argentina. Starting in 2011—near the middle of effective
 Project implementation— the Bank’s Board of Directors did not discuss any Argentina-related

                                                         11
projects or project restructurings for a 3-year period (FY12, 13, and 14; the last Board discussion
was on April 2011). For Projects under implementation, like BMSP, this meant that all
restructurings had to be kept at Level 2, where no Board approval was required (no changes to the
PDO could be made). This restriction had important impacts on the Project. The subproject in
Bariloche, despite being fully prepared, needed to be dropped since no Level 1 restructuring could
be carried out. New subprojects needed to be identified to commit the funds made available from
this subproject. Identification of additional subprojects caused project delays and was one of the
main reasons leading to the project’s extension.

37.     Changes in exchange rates. The Argentine Peso/US Dollar exchange rate shifted
dramatically over the Project’s lifetime, from AR$2.9 to 1 US dollar in 2005, to AR$3.05 at
appraisal, to AR$8.55 at Project closing. As a result, since contracts were signed in pesos and
executed during a period of rapid devaluation of the peso, the value in dollars of some works
contracts fell during execution, leading to unexpected under-commitment of loan resources and
some undisbursed funds (7% of loan amount) as of Project closing.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

38.     The M&E Framework was designed to track progress in implementation, measure
intermediate outcomes and measure Project impacts. Responsibility for M&E was divided among
the national level UEC, UEPs and Municipalities. The Project planned for Poverty Impact
Monitoring, an Impact Evaluation and Public Opinion Monitoring, all which were not implemented.
Progress reports were compiled by the UEC using inputs from the provincial and municipal
agencies.

39.     M&E Design. The Results Framework adequately reflected initial project design.
However, the framework was later deemed too ambitious because many indicators were measured
differently, or not measured at all. This led to the need to review some of the indicators.

40.      The Necesidades Básicas Insatisfechas (NBI) (Unmet Basic Needs) index, used by the
Government of Argentina, was included as a PDO indicator with the intent of measuring the extent
to which participating municipalities targeted project investments to areas of greater relative
deprivation. The idea behind using this indicator was to understand if the project was truly targeting
the areas of greatest need within each Municipality. The World Bank and the UEC agreed to change
the indicator after it became clear that the information was very difficult to gather at the census
tract level. Instead, the indicator gathered information comparing Municipal NBI with Provincial
NBI.

41.     The Intermediate Indicators for Component 2 (Technical Assistance) were left blank in the
PAD so they could be designed after demand from Municipalities became more specific regarding
the type of Technical Assistance (TA) the Project would finance. As previously explained, the
Municipalities found it unattractive to request funding for TA, so the component was partially
disbursed and only funded technical studies for the preparation of specific subprojects, and the
unutilized proceeds were reassigned. However, the TA component and indicator were not dropped
during the 2012 restructuring because at that time TA activities were being prepared and ready for
tendering for the Province of Neuquén, even though the Province did not follow through.




                                                 12
42.      M&E Implementation. The PDO and intermediate indicators were adjusted during the
2012 restructuring11 to establish a better link with project activities. Although the matrix’s outcome
indicators proved to be more aligned with the project, the modifications were not sufficient to
completely capture the project’s impacts and outputs. Due to early changes in the Municipalities’
demand for Project financing, the focus of Project implementation efforts has been on the
identification of new subprojects to ensure full commitment of the loan, and subsequent
implementation of the subprojects. As a results, there was limited focus on the results framework
and the need to update and validate it based on the evolution of the portfolio of subprojects. The
Bank regularly monitored the project’s progress through supervision missions. The Project also
organized workshops for subproject implementers to share experiences and provide feedback.
During the project’s closing workshop, implementing agencies presented the subprojects’
additional impacts.

43.      Most of the PDO and intermediate outcome indicators were closely monitored by the
Bank’s supervision team and reported in the ISRs (Implementation Status and Results Reports).
The impact of the subprojects in the Municipalities was greater and more significant than was
reflected in the M&E matrix. In order to obtain a more complete picture of the Project’s impacts,
some implementing agencies gathered other kinds of social indicators (e.g. those related to water-
borne diseases in the case of water and sanitation, and to the productivity of fruit producers in the
case of roads) that helped to better understand the project’s impact on the quality of life. See Section
3.5 for a record of these additional project impacts.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

44.     Application and observance of safeguard policies were adequate throughout Project
implementation. At Project preparation only the Environmental Assessment (4.01) and Cultural
Property (OPN11.3) policies were triggered. The Bank later made adjustments to trigger OP 4.12
on Involuntary Resettlement.

45.     Social Safeguards (Resettlement). The PAD did not trigger OP 4.12 on Involuntary
Resettlement since no resettlement was foreseen at appraisal. However, the Project’s
Environmental and Social Framework included a resettlement plan for adequately addressing any
potential population displacements. Consequently, the Project was restructured in the same year to
trigger OP 4.12, and an Involuntary Resettlement Framework (IRF) and abbreviated IRF were
prepared.

46.      A total of three abbreviated resettlements plans were carried out in Monte Quemado
(Santiago del Estero), Gral. Roca-Allen (Rio Negro) and Rosario (Santa Fe). In Monte Quemado,
six artisanal micro-businesses were relocated, one of which received economic compensation from
the Municipality by reason of engaging in a different remunerative activity. In addition, two
individuals in Gral. Roca-Allen, and one small produce business in Rosario were relocated. The
adopted measures proved to satisfy the safeguards requirements.

ultimately neither required carrying out any resettlements. Godoy Cruz’s Abbreviated Resettlement
Plan was formulated because the Municipality’s subproject involved pushing back house/property
fences (made up of wire and sticks) that invaded public space to make room available for sidewalks.
However, individuals living in these housing units voluntarily adjusted their fences in accordance
with the new construction works. In the case of Guaymallén, an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan
was prepared for three people that needed to adjust perimeter fences to make room available to
build a roundabout at the intersection of the streets Carril Rodriguez and Urquiza. The subproject
was modified and dropped the roundabout construction, so no fencing adjustments were made.

48.      Environmental Safeguards (Natural Habitats). The PAD did not trigger the Natural
Habitats (4.04) policy since no works in natural habitats were foreseen at appraisal. In 2011, the
Bank’s safeguards team realized that the implementation of the Bariloche subproject would require
triggering the Natural and Critical Habitats Safeguard Policy since the subproject was located next
to Lake Nahuel Huapi, within in a protected area (Parque Nacional Nahuel Huapi). Triggering a
new safeguard policy required a Level One Project restructuring, along with the Bank’s Board
approval. The UEC and Bank worked jointly to prepare the policy instrument in the subproject and
also made the needed updates in the Environmental and Social Framework, but the restructuring
was not possible due to the freezing of Board action on Argentina. As a result, this subproject was
dropped, and the Bank offered the option of presenting alternative eligible subprojects, at an
advanced stage of preparedness, recognizing that their completion would require extending the
project’s closing date.

49.      Fiduciary compliance. Despite slow subproject start-up in most Provinces, procurement
processes were overall satisfactory. The Bank had initially observed delays in contracting
procedures; however, continuous supervision and support from the UEC and Bank helped
Municipalities and Provinces become better acquainted with the Bank’s contracting requirements,
resulting in improved subproject procurement processes and more timely disbursements. Standard
Bidding Documents acceptable to the Bank were prepared and amended as necessary to streamline
contracting processes.

50.     Financial Management Implementation. Project financial management (FM) is assessed
as Moderately Satisfactory. Throughout the implementation period, the Project showed adequate
FM arrangements that complied with Bank requirements, and audits did not identify any significant
issues impacting the project. However, there were constant delays in submitting the Interim
Financial Reports and Audited Financial Statements to the Bank by the Auditoría General de la
Nación (up to 9 months overdue), causing the Project’s FM rating to be downgraded to Moderately
Satisfactory. These delays resulted from issues within the Auditoría General de la Nación, and not
from within the UEC. The Project closed on April 30, 2015, reaching 93 percent of disbursements.
The last audit report, covering a 16-month period from January 1, 2014 to April 30, 2015, will be
presented to the Bank on October 31, 2015, and will include disbursements made during the grace
period.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

51.    Investment Cost Recovery. The Project Results Framework called for the recovery of
investment costs from direct beneficiaries for subprojects in roads infrastructure and drainage.
From these, only some roads infrastructure subprojects have implemented cost recovery
mechanisms for investment. Table 8 for subprojects in roads infrastructure shows that General
Pueyrredón, Azul, Rafaela and Rosario are the only four participating Municipalities that will


                                                14
recover 100 percent for investment. Table 9 for drainage subprojects shows that San Martin will
not recover cost for investment.

52.     O&M Plans for Infrastructure. All infrastructure constructions have been entrusted to
the relevant agencies following the works’ commissioning. However, the financial sustainability
of Operations and Maintenance remains an area of concern for all sectors. The financial analyses
of all subprojects identified requirements for O&M recovery and provided specific options to
recover these costs, but the post completion review of the implementation of these costs recovery
mechanisms showed only partial implementation of the cost recovery mechanisms identified during
Project implementation. Tables 8 & 9 present the post-completion assessment of cost recovery
mechanisms for Roads and Drains subproject, based on information collected by the UEC from
provincial and municipal counterparts.

53.     Physical Infrastructure. Project design clearly set out the responsibilities for post
completion maintenance and operation of investments. The large number of physical investment
subprojects financed under the Project are likely to continue to work well and be adequately
maintained as a result of good technical design and supervision of works, as well as the provisions
made for operation and maintenance costs.

54.      Institutional Development. By introducing enhanced capital investment project
preparation practices and sustainable financing mechanisms for municipal investments, the project
has improved municipalities’ technical capacity. This gained capacity has also been used for
preparing projects for other lines of financing, such as the IDB. However, it is less clear how long
the newly acquired skills will remain within Municipalities given successive changes in
government administration, particularly in small and medium-size Municipalities, and in cases
where consultants carried out the technical work. During the interviews conducted as part of the
project’s final evaluation, local officials consistently reported the need for ongoing training in areas
such as subproject preparation and evaluation and bidding procedures to minimize the impact of
staff rotation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

55.     The BMSP was designed to contribute to the higher-level objectives of the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) and was included in the lending program of the 2006-2010 CAS.
The Project substantially supported one of the CAS’s three pillars: sustained economic growth with
equity and social inclusion, and its objectives were fully consistent with those of the CAS: to seek
opportunities to build on an investment partnership to support Government efforts to transition
from crisis recovery to sustained growth with equity and reduced structural poverty.

56.     Strengthening of the municipal sector was at the time of Project preparation and
continues to be today an area of priority. Argentina is a federal country characterized by a
substantially higher degree of decentralization of expenditures than of revenues. In 2011, the own-
source revenue of provinces and municipalities was equivalent to 7.5 percent of GDP but covered
only half of subnational primary government spending. The resulting vertical imbalance is filled
by an automatic revenue-sharing system and by discretionary transfers.13

57.       The Project’s objective continues to be highly relevant for the country for the following
reasons: (i) service delivery at the Municipal level still needs improvement; (ii) the demand for
capital investment financing prevails; and (iii) Municipalities expressed the need to increase
capacity to prepare investment projects. The latest Country Partnership Strategy FY2015-2018 has
shifted the Bank’s engagement towards a more comprehensive approach to urbanization. The first
pillar of the CPS supports employment creation in firms and farms, and within that theme, a specific
objective is to support agglomeration economies reach low-income populations and areas. Findings
from an ongoing analytical work on Agglomeration Economies14 indicates that limited financial
and technical capacity at the municipal level impacts the growth dynamics of Argentina’s cities,
thus hindering their potential to deliver agglomeration economies.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

58.    PDO (Loan Agreement): The objective of the Project is to improve the quality of: (a) basic
municipal services, through the provision of water supply and sanitation, urban drainage and roads

infrastructure in an equitable and fiscally sustainable manner within the territorial jurisdiction of
Participating Provinces; and (b) life of the population to be benefited by the provision of said
services.

59.      The Project’s efficacy in achieving its Development Objectives has been substantial. The
Project was prepared as a framework Project15, and the specific targets changed significantly due
to changes in demand from the Municipalities. The targets were adjusted through the
restructurings and several of the original intermediate indicators were only partially achieved, not
achieved at all, or dropped. The two PDO-level indicators were achieved. However, these two
indicators do not fully capture the achievement of the PDO and the paragraphs below develop the
analysis beyond the PDO-level indicators to assess separately the two parts of the PDO:
      Improve the quality of basic municipal services through the provision of water supply and
         sanitation, urban drainage and roads infrastructure in an equitable and fiscally sustainable
         manner within the territorial jurisdiction of Participating Provinces; and
      Improve the life of the population to be benefited by the provision of said services.

Part 1: Improve the quality of basic municipal services through the provision of water supply
and sanitation, urban drainage and roads infrastructure in an equitable and fiscally sustainable
manner within the territorial jurisdiction of Participating Provinces.
Rating: Substantial

60.      The Project has improved the quality of basic municipal services in the participating
municipalities. As could be expected in projects financing demand-based municipal investment in
basic infrastructure, the initial targets for water supply and sanitation, urban drainage and roads
infrastructure were revised during implementation in response to the actual demand from the
municipalities. As mentioned previously, the share of roads subprojects increased significantly
compared to the estimates made at appraisal. This change in sector focus did not, however,
negatively impact the Project’s contribution in terms of improving the quality of municipal services
in an equitable and fiscally sustainable manner. The Project remained focused on service
improvement by selecting subprojects that had their expected impacts in service improvement
identified and quantified through the required social and economic analyses. The satisfactory
results of the ex-post economic analysis confirm that the Project achieved this objective, and that
the investments in basic municipal infrastructure did result in tangible improvements in terms of
quality of service enjoyed by the Project’s beneficiaries.

61.     The Project’s technical contribution to improvement in the quality of services was high.
High technical standards were satisfactorily applied to the preparation and execution of all
subprojects, as confirmed through technical reviews and field visits carried out by technical experts
hired by the Bank. The technical eligibility criteria and preparation processes used for all
subprojects ensured that the investments were adequately dimensioned and that clear mechanisms
for operations and maintenance were identified. The project conducted timely technical reviews of
subprojects and, once identified and approved, subprojects were implemented as scheduled.
Despite delays in subproject formulation and respective contracting procedures, 93 perccent of
project funds were committed and reached a larger number of beneficiaries than expected. The

   The PAD provides an estimate of project disbursements to participating provinces, however, the document
clarifies that “given the demand-driven ‘framework’ nature of this project, the list is entirely indicative and
will be subject to change during implementation based on the willingness and eligibility of provinces and
municipalities to participate and prepare technically sound and appropriate subprojects. ”

                                                     18
technical reviews, which were prepared by sector specialists hired by the Bank, rated the quality of
subprojects as satisfactory.

62.      The Project’s approach to ensuring fiscal sustainability was substantially applied. To
promote fiscal discipline, investments were limited to Provinces that were in compliance with the
Government’s approach to assessing fiscal sustainability, which includes the Fiscal Responsibility
Law. Similarly, in the cases of subprojects that were financed through sub-lending at the municipal
level, the Project screened municipalities based on the municipalities’ compliance with the
principles and parameters of the Fiscal Responsibility Law that were applicable to them. In addition,
the Project required participating municipalities to develop investment plans and to identify cost
recovery mechanisms for each subproject. A post completion review showed that the cost recovery
mechanisms were only partially implemented in terms of direct recovery of investment costs from
beneficiaries. However, the review indicated that the proposed mechanisms for covering O&M
costs were applied in all cases (Roads and Drainage). It should be noted, however, that the limited
cost recovery observed through the ex-post financial analysis did not directly impact the fiscal
sustainability at the municipal level for two reasons: (i) as assessed in the fiscal analysis prepared
at appraisal, the subproject investments would have had a minimal to moderate impact on municipal
debt stocks, (ii) in the case of the subprojects that did not implement cost recovery mechanisms
from the beneficiaries, the investment was subsidized by the respective province, thus eliminating
any fiscal impact at the provincial level. Although the issue of limited cost recovery at the
subproject level impacts the efficiency rating, it is not considered to impact the Project’s
achievement of ensuring fiscal sustainability as envisaged at appraisal.

63.      The equity of the improvements is assessed as substantial. Although the Project focused
on targeting fiscally sustainable Municipalities, 55 percent of subprojects were executed in
Municipalities with NBIs equal to or above Provincial NBI averages, thereby achieving the second
PDO-level indicator. See Table 10 for differences in NBI percentages between the municipal and
provincial levels. It should be noted that, although the Project aimed for an equitable distribution
of financing, as measured through the PDO level indicator, the Project was not designed as a
poverty-focused intervention. The PAD explicitly mentions that a poverty-focused intervention
was one of the alternatives considered and rejected during preparation, and explains that it was the
Government’s strategy to focus the intervention on supporting investments in basic municipal
services in fiscally responsible provinces and municipalities, while using other transfers and other
non-reimbursable resources for poverty targeting. As explained in the PAD, the Project did,
however, introduce technical eligibility criteria and preparation processes (including social
assessments and economic evaluations) that were explicitly designed to favor pro-poor investments
in service expansion and basic infrastructure.

Part 2: Improve the life of the population to be benefited by the provision of said services.
Rating: High

64.      As measured by the first PDO-level indicator, the Project improved the quality of life of
nearly 1.5 million direct and indirect beneficiaries through the provision of basic services,
surpassing the original goal of 1 million people by 46%. The information gathered for the post-
completion analysis indicates that the subprojects have had significant positive impacts for the
beneficiaries. Benefits derived from water supply subprojects included increased access to water
and improvement in service quality. Households with no access to drinking water became
connected to potable water distribution networks, and homes with existing water connections
benefited from an improved and more efficient network thanks to the installation of water meters
(La Rioja) and system remodeling (Campo Gallo). Beneficiaries in Herrera and Monte Quemado
enjoyed increased water availability from the installation of new treatment plants. Under sewerage
subprojects, beneficiaries enjoyed improved sewerage disposal and treatment services. For example,
households in Chos Malal benefitted from a newly constructed sewer network and home
connections, while households in San Patricio del Chanar benefitted from an expanded and
refurbished network and treatment pond. Roads infrastructure subprojects brought positive
outcomes to beneficiaries related to improved travel conditions and shortened travel times thanks
to road pavement and rehabilitation. In the Province of Rio Negro, for example, beneficiaries in the
municipalities of Roca-Allen and Roca-Cervantes included farmers and fruit transporters whose
produce, to be sold at local or international markets, were at less risk to be damaged thanks to better
road conditions. Lastly, the drainage subproject implemented in San Martin helped reduced the
vulnerability of the area to damages caused by floods and lowered the potential of damage costs to
beneficiaries’ properties. The quantification of beneficiaries from the different subprojects is
detailed in Annex 2 – Outputs of Component 1.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Modest

65.      The Efficiency is rated as modest, based on the positive results of the economic analysis
carried out at completion, mitigated by the limited cost recovery achieved at the subprojects’ level.
The economic analysis carried out at completion confirms that the subprojects executed in the
different sectors brought positive impacts, and the overall Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the

                                                  20
sample evaluated at completion is higher than the ERR of the sample evaluated ex-ante during
appraisal. However, the provisions for cost recovery from the beneficiaries which were developed
for each subprojects were only partially implemented and the financial analysis shows that the
financial sustainability at the subproject level is lower than what was envisaged during appraisal.

66.     An economic and financial analysis was carried out to evaluate the Basic Municipal
Services Project. For this ICR, the evaluation was conducted using cost benefit analysis as used at
appraisal. Each of the subcomponents was evaluated, that is: a) water and sewerage services; b)
drainage; and c) paved roads, both urban and productive roads.

67.      At appraisal the economic evaluation was conducted through cost benefit analysis using
avoided costs. At that time, the evaluation was applied to a sample of 9 subprojects chosen as
representatives of the type of works to be implemented. For the ICR evaluation the same approach
was used selecting a representative sample of 6 subprojects, with investment costs close to 45
percent of total cost. Actual costs and benefits were included in this evaluation. The benefits were
measured using the same approach than at appraisal, namely, averted cost. Benefits of water
interventions were captured through socio-economic surveys conducted in the municipalities
included in the sample. For water, averted costs were equal to savings when no alternative water
sources were needed. For sewerage, averted costs were measured as savings on cleaning septic
tanks or other on-site wastewater disposal system. For drainage, averted costs were measured as:
a) avoided damage cost in properties, and b) savings in maintenance costs of road and public
infrastructure. For roads, averted costs were measured as savings on time and fuel cost. When
evaluating productive roads, benefits of reduced losses on agricultural products impaired during
transportation were added.

68.     Project’s impact on socioeconomic development. The project had a positive impact on the
socio-economic conditions of beneficiary households in participating Municipalities. Results show
that benefits outweighed the costs by more than two-fold, and that the Project achieved returns of
36 percent. These results are explained by the poor conditions of water supply, sanitation, drainage
and roads that were in place before the project, as well as by the high prices households had to pay
to cope with the situation. Actual returns were higher than those expected at appraisal, with only
19 percent of returns originally foreseen for the sample of subprojects. All interventions showed
positive results, except for those in sanitation, which did not quantify the most important health and
environmental benefits due to lack of information.

69.     A financial evaluation of the project included the costs and benefits as they were paid and
received by the agencies in charge of operating the works. To develop financially sustainable works,
a financing plan was designed during preparation, including tariffs, charges of contribución
especial de mejoras, and subsidies from municipal and Provincial Governments.


                                                 21
70.       At appraisal it was foreseen that significant subsidies were needed from public funds, as
some of the Provinces did not have financial mechanisms to cover the associated costs.
Arrangements to find mechanisms for improving cost recovery were discussed. These included a)
tariffs to be adjusted to cover operating costs for water and sewerage subprojects; and b) charges
applied to cover maintenances and operating costs, plus 85 percent of investment costs, for road
and drainage sub-projects. These targets were partially achieved. All sub-projects but water, fully
recovered operating and maintenance costs, and only the road sub-project in the Province of Buenos
Aires achieved investment cost recovery. The resulting financial gap has been covered by
Municipal or Province funds. The Provinces are working on improving their cost recovery policies,
but these policies have yet to be implemented.

71.      Rationale for Public Sector Provision/Financing. The Project improved access to quality
water, sanitation, drainage and road infrastructure in municipalities where services provision was
poor and had low coverage. The Government of Argentina was committed to solve these problems
and offered subsidies to low-income beneficiaries to have access to the services. The operation
was designed containing financial mechanisms to include participation of private financing to
reduce the amount of subsidies provided by the Government. Those mechanisms included: a) tariffs
aimed to cover at least operating costs; b) existing charges such as contribución especial de mejoras
to partially pay for investment; and c) new property tax to farmers to cover a portion of paving
roads. However the financial analysis shows that these mechanisms were not fully implemented.

72.     World Bank Value Added. The Bank has been a strong supporter of the GoA in helping to
improve basic services provision throughout the country. This operation was a continuation of the
long time involvement with the Government in financing municipal development activities. It
helped to strengthen the approach and assistance to participating municipalities in three ways: a)
by focusing investments on high impact basic services sectors; b) by enhancing the technical and
financial screening of subprojects and of service providers, to move towards financial
sustainability; and c) by building municipality capacity for investment planning and execution,
through physical infrastructure and training.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.      Overall Project Outcome is rated as Moderately Satisfactory based on the assessment of
the Project’s relevance (high), efficacy (substantial), and efficiency (modest). The Project
objectives, design and implementation were, and continue to be, highly relevant to Argentina’s
priorities and the Bank’s assistance strategy. Despite the project’s slow start and its extension for
an additional three years, all selected subprojects were finalized and have improved the quality of
service and the quality of life of a large number of beneficiaries, while achieving the stated
objectives of fiscal sustainability and equity. The Project’s main limitation is the limited
implementation of the cost recovery mechanisms, which have been proposed at the subproject level.
This is a major departure from the Project’s initial design and justifies the modest efficiency rating
– in spite of the positive results of the economic evaluation – as well as the MS overall rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

74.     Since the BSMP was structured as a framework project, the M&E matrix was developed
without knowledge of the specific subprojects that were to be financed. Many desirable outcomes
that contributed to quality of life were not included in the M&E matrix, but the implementing

                                                 22
Municipalities gathered other indicators that helped observe the subprojects’ additional impacts on
the beneficiaries’ quality of life. Table 12 below shows some examples of these additional
indicators.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

75.      The final workshop presentation by implementing agencies was very positive about the
capacity gained at the local level for project preparation. Municipalities claimed that future projects
should include more opportunities for training and capacity building and peer learning, especially
at the beginning of the project. The strict subproject preparation requirements served to increase
local capacity for capital investment project preparation beyond the BMSP. Municipalities claimed
that the newly gained capacity could be used to mange other sources of financing.

76.        No other unintended consequences were observed.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

77.        The Project did not commission a beneficiary survey.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

78.      Considering both the nature of the investments made and the next steps envisioned, the risk
to Development Outcome is deemed moderate. The main risk relates to the O&M of works.
Although the Project design was heavy on cost recovery plans, cost recovery mechanisms have not
been implemented in some areas (particularly in the poorest areas, and in the Water and Sanitation
sectors). Operation and Maintenance depends on Provincial subsidies, since fees only cover a very
small portion (sometimes nominal) of the cost. The situation is most extreme in subprojects in
Santiago del Estero, where all three water supply facilities are located in very small towns.
Additionally, one town has very costly operations since water needs are met through desalinization.
But even in this case, the situation has been acknowledged and plans are being made to improve
the sustainability of investments.

79.     This situation is not new, and it was acknowledged at Project design. The financial
evaluation of sample subprojects estimated that all water and sewerage projects would need
subsidies to cover investment costs. Water projects would require subsidies amounting to
approximately 60 percent of investment, while sewerage projects would need subsidies equal to
almost the whole investment cost. Some drainage and road pavement projects are covered by
betterment fees (contribuciones por mejoras), while others require subsidies of between 20 and 60
percent18.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.     Project preparation was solid and included: (i) good quality background studies (e.g. solid
economic analyses of subprojects); (ii) support to the UEC in the preparation of a thorough
Operations Manual including adequate frameworks for project preparation (i.e. Environmental and
Social Frameworks); (iii) stock taking of the two previous MDP projects by reflecting the lessons
learned in the previous engagements in the design of the new project.

81.      The BMSP was conceived as a Framework project and followed a demand-driven approach,
allowing output targets to evolve during project implementation in response to local demand.
However, project implementation was impacted by changes in the country’s environment, which
could not have been anticipated during project appraisal. The provinces’ political and financial
situation changed considerably from preparation to implementation. At entry, provinces had very
limited access to financing for capital investments, but other funding options became available
during project implementation. Demand from provinces diminished, and it took a long time to find
provinces interested in the Bank’s financing. This was reflected in the lengthy period it took to sign
the Subsidiary Agreements and to find suitable and well-prepared subprojects that would fit the
economic/financial and technical eligibility criteria.

82.      Project implementation was impacted by significant changes occurring after project
approval, which according to both the Bank and the Government, could not have been anticipated
at appraisal. Project design at appraisal was adequate given the information available at the time.
However, given the Argentinean context and the demand-based nature of the operation, additional
flexibility could have been introduced in the design to allow managing changes in demand, both
for investment and technical assistance activities at the local level. Specifically, the lack of demand
for TA activities caused some delays in preparation of subprojects. The initial project design had
envisioned both local investments and TA activities to be financed through borrowing based on the
successful implementation of similar arrangements in previous municipal development projects in
Argentina; however, a detailed assessment of the demand for TA activities could have helped to
identify a risk concerning limited demand, and therefore, introducing more flexible financing
options would have had a mitigating measure.

83.     The project was overly optimistic regarding the interest and demand of provinces on
technical assistance to improve provincial capital investment planning and project preparation
capacities. There was no demand for these kinds of activities, as provinces did not want to increase
their debt to finance capacity building.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84.     The Bank’s supervision allowed the Project to disburse 93 percent of the proceeds while
achieving its main objectives in a very adverse situation. The implementation team worked with
the Government to adjust the Project design to respond to changes in local demands – dropping 25
percent of the local co-financing requirement, reassigning proceeds, extending implementation and
adjusting the M&E framework. Important efforts were made to identify and prepare new
subprojects, while ensuring high technical standards for subproject preparation and execution. On

                                                  25
the flip side, the team’s focus on subproject identification, preparation and execution shifted the
attention away from opportunities to strengthen the Project’s M&E framework.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.     Based on the Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry, and in its quality of, the
overall Bank’s performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

86.     In light of significant policy changes affecting project implementation, the Government of
Argentina remained committed to the achievement of project objectives. The Ministry of Finance
continuously expressed to the Bank their interest in moving forward with the project in light of
several challenges.

87.     However, significant delays were experienced in meeting the Project’s conditions for
effectiveness, due to the time taken – both at National and Provincial Level – to complete the
administrative and legal processes required for declaring the loan effective. While such delays were
not specific to this Project, they contribute to the rating of the Government Performance as
Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88.      The UEC did a good job in coordinating all efforts at the national, provincial and municipal
levels during stages of subproject identification, preparation and implementation. It succeeded in
attracting demand to expand the coverage of the Project, and in fully committing the available
financing. Despite the Provinces’ and Municipalities’ decreased demand for the Bank’s financing,
the UEC was very proactive in identifying new Municipalities and subprojects to fund. To avoid
any further delays in project implementation, the UEC decided to select subprojects that were in
the final stages of formulation. The UEC also ensured timely execution of the respective
subprojects, which allowed the Project to achieve its development objectives. The BMSP surpassed
its target of improving access to reliable safe water supply and sanitation, urban drainage and
improved roads to one million consumers, by reaching more than 1.5 million direct and indirect
beneficiaries. In addition to targeting Municipalities that were fiscally sustainable, the majority (55
percent) had NBIs higher than the Provincial average. Finally, the UEC complied with the Bank’s
requirements concerning periodic report deliveries.

89.      Project implementation generated capacity both for the UEC and UEPs, as evidenced by
their increasing procurement capacity over implementation and the quality of the progress reports,
which improved considerably towards the last years - becoming more timely, comprehensive and
disaggregated at the subproject level.

90.     Some of the subprojects were prepared and implemented at the Provincial level, and others
at the local level. Some Provinces considered that it would be more efficient to centralize
implementation since Municipalities sometimes lacked the capacity to implement the Projects. In
the same manner, even though the PAD established that the debt would be transferred to

                                                  26
Municipalities, the Provinces absorbed it in most cases. Buenos Aires and Santa Fe constitute the
exceptions.

91.     In cases where Municipalities implemented the Projects, they expressed that the interaction
with the UEC and the Bank increased their capacity to prepare investment projects. This knowledge
was used to prepare proposals for other sources of funding, such as the IDB and CAF.

92.     In fact, the main limitation in the Implementing Agencies’ performance was the initial low-
level capacity to prepare and execute subprojects following the Project’s procedures. This was
expected, and a TA component was included in the project to finance capacity building for the
technical, economic, financial, social and environmental preparation and assessment of subprojects.
However, Provinces and Municipalities found it unattractive to make use of the financing available
for TA, and ended up “learning by doing” with significant support from the UEC and the Bank
teams, but with significant delays in subproject preparation. This could have been avoided by
providing upfront technical assistance financed by the Project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.      In spite of delays in meeting the Project’s condition of effectiveness and subproject
preparation, the overall borrower performance is deemed moderately satisfactory, given the
continued commitment of the Borrower (GoA) to implement and complete subprojects, as well as
the collaborative performance of the implementing agencies.

6. Lessons Learned

94.     The next paragraphs highlight the main lessons learned.

95.      There is a trade-off between demand driven investment and sector specific approach.
The decision to structure the projects with a demand driven approach (for flexibility and to respond
to a variety of local demands) limited the depth of the technical discussion and decreased the
possibility to support sectorial reforms. Although subproject eligibility criteria required detailed
economic and technical evaluation of individual investments, it is important to note that individual
subprojects in a multi-sector project do not receive the same level of attention as in operations with
a more limited scope. Focusing on fewer sectors seems to be a more effective strategy to mitigate
this risk and, at the same time, to fully capitalize on economies of scale and the know-how
generated by the project. This applies for both physical investments and institutional development.

96.      Demand matters for demand-driven Projects. The Project faced a set of significant
challenges early on that were related to significant changes in the demand for the financing offered.
This not only required the significant efforts from the Government and the Bank to identify a new
pipeline of subprojects; it also reduced the Project’s leverage in terms of capacity building and
sectoral improvements. When preparing demand-based project, special attention should be paid to
potential shifts in the Project’s environment, which can impact the local demand for financing, and
flexible mechanisms for adjustment of the Project’s financing conditions should be considered and
assessed.

97.       Financing conditions should be designed to ensure demand for key technical assistance.
Even though Municipalities may lack technical capacity for project preparation and implementation,
it is key to involve them throughout subproject design and implementation to generate learning and
commitment for future maintenance of the investments. In the case of the BMSP, key technical

                                                 27
assistance activities which could have proved critical in improving the Project’s execution and the
sustainability of sectoral policies was not implemented due to the Provinces and Municipalities’
lack of willingness to fund technical assistance through loan proceeds. Providing technical
assistance and opportunities for peer learning from other Municipalities on attractive financial
terms is a central element to increase that capacity, a point that was expressed numerous times by
implementing agencies.

98.     Finding the right balance between systemic improvements and requirements at the
subproject level is key. The participating Provinces and Municipalities expressed their appreciation
of the internal capacity build through the experience of preparing and executing projects in
alignment with international best practices. However, the extent of this capacity building was
limited to the execution of one or two subproject in each institution. Efforts should be made to
maximize the use of systemic improvements through the implementation of specific measures to
improve existing systems at the Provincial and Municipal level, instead of focusing on subproject
level compliance with sophisticated requirements.

99.     Project implementation arrangements requiring sub-lending at the provincial and
municipal level lead to significant delays within Argentina’s institutional framework. The
administrative and legal processes required for the approval and signing of subsidiary loan
agreements led to significant delays in the Project’s effectiveness. Similar delays have been
affecting similar Projects implemented in Argentina during the same period, such as the Flood
Prevention and Urban Drainage Project (P093491) and the Provincial Roads Infrastructure Project
(P070628). Based on this experience, the Bank and the Government have chosen to adopt different
implementation arrangements for projects financing investments in multiple provinces, with the
debt remaining at the central level, and Project activities executed directly through Central
Execution Units in coordination with technical units at the provincial or municipal level.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The objective of the Project was to improve the quality of: a) basic municipal services
through the provision of water supply and sanitation, urban drainage and roads infrastructure in an
equitable and fiscally sustainable manner within the participating Provinces; and b) life of the
population to be benefited by the provision of said services. On the basic of this objective, this
evaluation aims to analyze whether the interventions implemented under the Project had a positive
impact on the development of the Municipalities’ beneficiaries.

2.      This annex presents the evaluations of each component from two different perspectives:
economic and financial. The economic analysis included the costs expressed in economic terms,
eliminating market distortions caused by subsidies and taxes, among others. The benefits were
expressed, as the population perceived its wellbeing improvement. The financial analysis included
the costs and benefits as they were actually paid and received by Municipalities or the agencies in
charge of implementing or operating the works.

Economic Evaluation

3.       At appraisal the economic evaluation was conducted through a cost benefit analysis using
avoided costs. At that time, the evaluation was applied to a sample of 9 subprojects chosen as
representatives of the type of works to be implemented. For the ICR evaluation the same approach
was used selecting a representative sample of 6 subprojects, with investment costs close to 45
percent of total cost. Actual costs and benefits were included in this evaluation. The benefits were
measured using the same approach as at appraisal, namely, averted cost. Benefits of water
interventions were captured through socio-economic surveys conducted in the municipalities
included in the sample. For water, averted costs were equal to savings when no alternative water
sources were needed. For sewerage, averted costs were measured as savings of not having to clean
septic tanks or other on-site wastewater disposal system. For drainage, averted costs were measured
as: a) avoided damage cost in properties, and b) savings in maintenance costs of road and public
infrastructure. For roads, averted costs were measured as savings on time and fuel cost. When
evaluating productive roads, benefits of reduced losses due to transportation impairments were
added.

4.       The cost benefit analysis calculates the net benefits generated by each component on an
incremental basis. The benefits of the project are equal to the difference between the incremental
benefits and the incremental costs of two scenarios: “with” and “without” the project. The “with”
project scenario considers actual achievements obtained with the interventions. The “without”
project scenario corresponds to business as usual scenario. The activities were appraised measuring
their flow of costs and benefits for the lifetime of the project, estimated at 30 years for water,
sewerage, and drainage works, and 20 years for roads. Operating and maintenance costs were
included to ensure the sustainability of works.
5.       The selected sample consisted of 6 subprojects with an investment cost of US$ 45 million,
which corresponds to 44 percent of total cost of the operation. It included all components of the
project and interventions implemented in five Provinces.

Benefits
6.      Water subprojects. Water services in Campo Gallo and Monte Quemado, two
municipalities in the Province of Santiago del Estero, were improved under the project. Both
subprojects were chosen for the economic evaluation. The interventions not only improved the
service for those households that were already connected to the network, but they also expanded
the service to all households that lacked connection.
7.      In Campo Gallo, coverage was 76 percent, yet water supply was not enough to satisfy
demand. According to the municipality, about half of the population has to find other water sources
to serve their water needs. The quality of treated water was reported as good by the municipality,
yet insufficient to serve its customers. The capacity of production was far below the demand, with
the water treatment plant producing only 48 percent of what population needed. The deficit figures
were higher as physical losses were not included in the calculation. Moreover, some of the water
produced was distributed to rural communities using water trucks, which lowered the amount of
water available for the population of Campo Gallo.
8.      Monte Quemado experienced a similar situation to Campo Gallo in water provision. The
volume of water supplied represented only 43 percent of demand, not including physical losses or
water distributed to rural communities by water trucks. Furthermore, the quality of treated water in
Monte Quemado did not comply with regulation.

9.      A survey conducted during preparation19 yielded the following information: 46 percent of
households in Campo Gallo stored water; 86 percent of interviewees described amount of water
received as insufficient or meager; 43 percent bought bottled water; and 11 percent boiled their
water or added chlorine. In Monte Quemado 99 percent of interviewees perceived quality as poor
or bad; 97 percent said the amount of water received was scant; 49 percent bought bottled water;
and 20 percent boiled water or treated it.
10.     According to the survey, the average price paid for boiling, treating or buying bottled water
in Campo Gallo was Ar$ 0.9 per liter, and the amount bought per day was approximately 3 lt/pp.
In Monte Quemado, the average price was Ar$ 0.5/lt for 2 liters bought on average by one person
per day. These prices were used to estimate the savings that would result from the project.
11.      Sewerage subprojects. The municipality of Chos Malal expanded its sewerage network to
connect around 1,500 households. It is estimated that approximately 50 percent of households had
septic tanks. The benefits from sewerage works were estimated as savings on the price paid for
cleaning the septic tanks, which at time of preparation was Ar$ 200, and the recommended
frequency of cleaning was twice a year. The benefit was partially offset by the cost of adjustment
of in-house connections that were needed to make them suitable to connect to the network. Impacts
on health and the environment, which were the most important benefits attained with this
intervention, were not quantified. As such, the evaluation results only show partial benefits.
12.     Drainage subprojects. The works implemented in San Martin in the Province of Mendoza
improved the drainage system by reducing the vulnerability of the area to damages caused by
floods. Benefits were estimated as a) the averted damage cost in properties, and b) the
Municipality’s savings on maintenance costs of roads, as well as on cleaning and assistance costs
to deal with floods. The costs of damages, maintenance of roads, and others, incurred by the
Municipality, were based on previous events according to the recurrence period.
13.      The Municipality’s records show that the average damage cost to properties caused by
floods from rainfall of a 2-year recurrence period was about Ar$ 1,200 per dwelling. The data also
shows that the cost of maintenance of roads and other aspects related with flood management from
the same recurrence period is about Ar$ 1.3 million per year. These costs increase with intensity of

apples and pears. The fruits are transported and sold in local and international markets. Twenty-
seven percent of pears are sold in local markets and 73 percent are exported, while 45 percent of
apples are sold locally and 55 percent are sold internationally.
15.      Before this intervention, farmers experienced large economic losses when transporting
their fruit on gravel roads, a kind of road that often stirred dust and affected the quality of the fruit.
At appraisal it was estimated that around 15 percent of fruit production was lost due to damages to
fruit. The share of damages caused by this kind of transportation was previously unknown, yet it is
estimated that the newly paved road reduced damages by 50 percent, or 7.5 percent of production.
16.     The intervention has shown benefits beyond the reduction of damage to fruit. The
evaluation highlighted additional benefits such as savings on vehicles maintenance, and savings on
time and fuel costs when travel time diminishes.
17.     The benefits received from farmers were identified based on the estimated production of
pears and apples of 301 farmers registered in the area of influence. The production level of a typical
farm was taken as reference. A 7.5 percent of reduction in losses of production was applied.
Benefits were estimated using prices per kg sold at local markets or sold for exportation.
18.     Savings on maintenance costs of vehicles were estimated by comparing costs per mile on
gravel roads versus costs per mile on paved roads, in terms of savings in time and fuel costs. This
information was based on the figures published by the Dirección Nacional de Viabilidad (National
Directorate of Roads).
19.     Urban roads subprojects. Pavement of urban roads in Mar del Plata benefited about 18,000
people living in residential areas with a low index of unmet needs. The benefits were estimated as
savings on maintenance cost of vehicles crossing the road including savings in time and fuel costs,
based on figures published by the National Directorate of Roads.


Results of Economic Evaluation

20.     The economic evaluation of all subprojects in the sample shows benefits being 2.6 times
higher than costs and returns as high as 35 percent. Urban roads and drainage subprojects show the
highest returns, 53 and 63 percent, respectively.

21.     Results of the sewerage intervention do not show the actual impact on the population. For
instance, due to lack of information, improvements in health and the environment could not be
quantified. The only benefits included in the evaluation were corresponded to savings on septic
tanks cleaning, which as expected, were not enough to pay off the investment and operation costs.

22.     When comparing actual results with those expected at appraisal, all interventions, except
for sewerage, had higher returns than originally projected. This is not surprising given that
candidate projects were better screened, and those that were not feasible needed to be redesigned.
Sanitation subprojects did not yield positive results as benefits included in the evaluation
corresponded to a tiny fraction of actual costs. Impacts on health and the environment were the
important benefits from the sanitation subprojects, but could not be quantified.

Financial Analysis

23.      During appraisal, financial sustainability was addressed. Cost recovery evaluation showed
that the amount of public funds needed to finance operating and investment costs was significant
in some of the sub-projects.

24.     Water and sanitation projects reviewed at appraisal. Two of the water and sewerage
projects –Tupungato in Mendoza and San Patricio in Neuquen– had a tariff so low that it did not
even cover 40 percent of operating costs. The other two –San Jorge in the Province of Santa Fe and
Chos Malal in Neuquen– had tariffs similar to operating costs. There was an additional charge of
contribución especial de mejoras that contributed to financing the investment costs, yet subsidies
from public funds were higher than 50 percent of investment costs in all cases.

                           Sanitation Subprojects Reviewed at Appraisal

25.     Drainage projects reviewed at appraisal. One of the drainage projects, Armstrong in the
Province of Santa Fe, presented full cost recovery through the contribución especial de mejoras
charge. The other one, Palmira in the Province of Mendoza, recovered only 42 percent of costs.

                                                  39
26.      Paved road projects reviewed at appraisal. The Province of Rio Negro had all investment
costs paid by beneficiaries through the contribución especial de mejoras. The other two road
projects –Rawson in the Province of Chubut and Rosario in Santa Fe– needed public funds to pay
for the costs, 21 and 40 percent respectively.

27.     During preparation it was foreseen that none of the projects, with the exception of one
paved road in the Province of Rio Negro, and a drainage project in the Province of Santa Fe, were
financially viable without subsidies from either the municipal or provincial government, or both.
The project included a component to strengthen institutional capacities to improve cost recovery
and attain efficiency improvements.

28.      The financial mechanisms foreseen at appraisal consisted of: a) tariffs high enough to cover
O&M costs in water and sanitation projects; and b) fees charged to beneficiaries to cover operating
costs, plus 85 percent of investment costs, in drainage and roads projects.

29.     Results at the end of Project implementation show that application of cost recovery
mechanisms was not fully achieved and that Municipalities and Provinces subsidized investment
costs in the most of the subprojects. From the sample, only the road subproject implemented in
Province de Buenos Aires fully recovered costs. All sub-projects, except water, charged fees to
fully cover operating costs. Water subprojects needed subsidies to cover both operating and
investment costs. Provincial Governments are working on policies to attain full cost recovery, but
they have yet to be implemented.
