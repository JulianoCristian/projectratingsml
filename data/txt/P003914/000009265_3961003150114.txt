REALTH AND NUTRITION SECTOR ISSUES
AND STRATEGY
A. EALT  Am NuTmON STAU
1.1       Inlonesia has made impressive progress in commnty health ad uition since
the 1960s. Survey data from the 1980s show better ntritional status, with significant Inceas
In aveg caloric intake, and reducdons in the prevaence of moderte and sever manutrion
among young children. Income and nutritional gains, along with feiity decln probbly
account for much of the imp ve decline in the infant morialit rate (IM) from an estmated
124 dets per tousand births in the late 1960s to 105 in th late 1970s and was estimated at
73 in the 1990 census. Conibutory factors to these trends inclade a disciplined, commnity-
boe family planning progrm, improved access to immiz    n and other prenive and
curtve health sevices diough the establishmet of nearly 6,000 hea   ces and linbed
subcontet and village-level posyandu, and a vigorous, hnovative program of nutritionedcatlon
ad monoring.
1.2        Despke thee gis, Indonesia coniues to face seious  mmuny health and
n_utitn chalenges. Ihe results of a recent Demographic and Health Survey as wll a the 1990
Cenu reveal a disturbing stall in the previous rate of decline In tnfimt mortality as wel as
slower   tO    irn covera  of basic provendve progams, padclay imi  of
infants an prant women,     previously anticipated. Most obvious pes, areproblems
rlating to the very bhg levels of maternal mortality and morbidity which, in the contest of the
Iceasing proporton of all ianmt deas that occur in the pernal  period, uggests a need to
mrove the quality and fveness of care during the birh process Itself. Morer, pockets
of low nutrilona status are evide  aross the couty, and micro t defici,
parculaly of iodine and Vitamin A, buttess unaceptably high levels of inbnt and child
mortaity-especially among the poor, and in the Easte  islands.
1.3        Health Status. Income and ntional  ains along with fiity deline probably
account for muh of e impressive fal in the Infat mortality rae. Anohr corbuta y factr
has been hIcrsed coverage of         ztion  against childhood dise.  Access to

duing the 1980s of a network of nearly 6,000 health centers, each staffed by vaiou medical
andparamedical personel, and each servig several subeters and about 40 posyau. Survey
fidings suggest that this system is gaining ce and delivering a growing volume of
servies. Mie 1987 Nadonra Socoeconomic Survey (SUSENAS)  entid  an icrased

to analyze constain  and opporties in the health manpower subsector. Although deftve
scoud await the results of this exercise, four aspect of the  bsector are
relevamt to the gols ad excted outcomes of this project. First, the absence of a central
capacity to anyze nd aculate health manpower plams has led to sevea problems, iding
consderble confusion and overlap concening instiutioal responsibility for halt manpower
poicy, i  Inve--mt in the quality of training programs, and central/provinca tensions
conceing reponibity for staff deployment. Second, the appropriate primary conce  wth
he sk, nube  and disttion of service delivery staff in the last 10 years has resulted in
muIainming for                       rs and andys with skills appropriate for managing
public or private health services. Despite 10 years of investm  in the dwelopme  of Schools
of Public Heal, Nutrition Aademies and other higher level isuions, the quality   d
relevwm of public health ad nutrition research remains wealk Third, as discussed exensively
with Dq%es in the conteD of the Fifth Popation Project the rent decision to train and deploy
village midwives  da dW  Desa), has revealed a mber of critical bsues concernn
ctCaion and Hlem    procedures for health providers, dVployment pctic, and the quait
of pe- and insrvice traing.
1.27       The radonhp of public sector health provider workers to taitonalnd private
sector providers also requires darification and resolution in the near futore. Last, extensive
analyses of the poywdu mov   and performance suggest that the principles of wlwawLrm
that lead to reliance on vlage women (dr) for posyandu promotion and maagement are
unrealistic. More ralc reward and nentive structs wl be necessary to encourag this

placing now burden  on the health systm    In dealng with the shift toward a greater
poportonate burde fom adul and dronic disses, the curt heath system wI need to
uero  ai    adjusmnts  anas sh as the scope of prventive health measures; the
nmbe ad mix of persa ; the oriontatn of medical educaton; the distrbto, scale and
sohitiato  of faii, refera stm,  asd capit  equimen  finig
and the publicrvate divson of rlea. Onoing discusion of a recen sector
rport on Health Insurance and te preprton of a Health IV project provide a context for
revwing these Issue.
2.4        In the nea term, policy dialogue focuses on issues which need to be addresed to
prove the prmary health care system. A first concern is t ensure th  health problems are
deied at the loal level, and receive priorkt ttion at the field level. bis can be done by
s g that those most aware of local condio  and requiements, i.e. k        n and
pu kesmhealth nmage  and workers, have a large role In settiDg prioties and designing
helth niative. Responilble staff also need the managerial and budgetay aority to develop
and implement loc plan. Finally, this approch wil need to draw on regularly updated data
an Icidene, outme and sevice utilition. Ihe capaciy to generte and use such information
will have to be enhanced. Secondly, more and better sdlled human resources wil be required
If the focus on locally derioed   ries is to work. Although many facities and personnel
ae now in place, there remain critical staff vacnies, sk  ddeficiencies, and shortages of drugs
and trnor   hese misspig componen und     program effeciveness, especialy in poorer
ar   wh more severe public heath problems. Personnel policies coverig coditions of
service, houg  options, prwtion possibilities and critea, career developmen, rights
ren         transfer within and betwoee regios, and the use of contacta arrangements may need
hater adjusment and refining as well and are therflbre an important topic for near term policy
dicusion. A fnl major dimension of policy discussion concerns the need to sort health
center level nwove   nwth technical        frsc 1iom units located at the distict, province
and even the cne. A reoientation of the role of Jabed units needs as nmch
n as does the crn effrt to improve capacity and sk   at the provincw and
distict leels.
2.5        Prdct Ex,iee. ImpIntan of the past population and health projects has
been reasonably smooth following some niiaW delays in project cution In most of the
plio. Several los  have bee learned from these projects. The Prvicua Health Project,
te Fist Nution Prject, and the first fDur populaun projects were heavy oriented toward
'bricks and mort  with the Irgest prportion of aU llpe  for buildigp follwed closely
by            for epment,  ture and vehiles. The popuation projects In particular
sistd the BKKBN in establishing dirict and provic  level magement capacity and in the
provo of the materials, qpipmet and veicles needed to suport Its active fmily plning
promotion efrts. TIe Fhrst Nutition project, one of the first in the Bank's nutitin pordblio,
pmvidd aly epeie  in the development of tnques for mntrition education and provided
a base for the deveopment of natonal nutrition policy. While usefl       to basic

bonower aention, to the completion of dbbwmt and proam    plans rher thm to the
_Dt~o afidd ladE reSts.
2.6        I   Scoand Nuriton and Community Health Project (NCH - U, ln 2636-D)
and the Iid Health PoJect (L 30424ND) are e most Immediate predecessors to ti project.

the Ctr for Healt EduI   Thes activities conutd direcy to consumer knowledge

sffered from unfortate dlas In impi        as well as poor fit with develomen  in th

TIlE PROJECT
A. Noi= O,ncVs
3.1        The goal of the project is to elevate inat, dcild and maternal heath stats by
improving the pecificity and efectivees of Safe Motherhood, Chld Suvival and Nuition
progms, iluding health and nfitoneducation,  the provinces of rlan Jaya, Ma , Nus
Teggra Thur (NM ), West Java and Central Java. To achieve these objectives, the project
wil assist these provinces in the preparation and imp -mn of strategies and htevention
progms to address high prority local ommuity heldth and nutrition problems. Lessons
leaned in the initl phases of the project wil inform subsequent steps to expand coverage.
These objectives would be accomplished by (a) building provini capacito pln, implemn
and evualu progms in each of these areas, and (b) by strengthening the capacity of the centr
Mnstry of Healdt, priarily the Direcorate Gneral of Community Health, to sut
povinal efonts. Plnng and budgeting procedures would be modified, building on less
leared in the Tid Health Project, to ensure suficient flexiblity n the maagemt of
resources at cenral, provinl, and kabupam  levels to adieve greater speccity and
e tveness in health programs.
3.2        Targeting those most in need, ddined by economic, epological nd nutinal
crteria, is a key feature of this project. Ther , provincial proposas have been designed to
pase specific kabupaten, based on inicos  of need, through the six years of the project
period, as maized in Table 3.1. TisD approach allows for the devedopmnt and analysis of
new appraches to service delivery and pU               interventions on a smaler scae
in loca settigs, prior to exeion to the provinci level. Adjus        in planns  and
budgetig procedures, and to the reative priority of and apa     to pgram  aluation win
ilae this approach. Targeting criteria and methds will be Improved troug the coure of
the project.

4.10       The procurement responsibilites for the project would be carried ot  by each of
the five Provincial Project Maager offices and the Central Project Manager office. lbe
proceat    gemes are outlioed in Table 4.4.
4.11       Procurement methods for civil works, goods and technical assistance are described
bdow:
(a)   Ciil works tot Aing about US$29.4 million equivalent.  Becuse of the
geogrhical dispersion of project sites and because of the small contrt size, all
contacts for civil work would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding
(LCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank, in which foreign firms would be allowed
to participate. lhe Govenwmentprovidedproof of land acquisitionfor oia sltesfor
new construalon prior to negodations. Contracts for civil works costing less than
US$100,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$500,000 million equivalent, would
be awarded on the basis of three price quotations from qualified contractors.
Contacts for civil works in remote villages, costing less than US$50,000
equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$500,000 may be awarded through
direct c an.
(b)  Equipment, boats and medical suppUes totalling about US$30.5 milion
equivalent, including contingencies, of which US$18.5 million equivalent would
be parallel coffanced by the KfW (Financial Cooperation of the Federal Republic
of Germany), using the Bank Procurement Guidelines of May 1992 for the-
procurement of KfW financed goods. Equipment, boats and medical supplies
would be grouped to the extent practicable to form bid packages costng
US$200,000 or more. These packages would be awarded under Intemational
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Contract packages financed by the Bank and valued less than US$200,000, up to
an aegate limit of US$4.4 million including taxes, would be awarded through
Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contract
packages valued less than US$50,000 or equipment of a specialized nature for
which LCB is not pratical, up to an aggregate limit of US$3.1 million including
taes may be purchased dtugh international or local shopping on the basis of a
minimum of three competitive price quotations.
(c)  Vehicle costs would total about US$7.0 million equivalent. The Government of
Indonesia bans the import of vehicles, therefore vehicle procurement is considered
reserve procurement and Bank financing would not be used to purchase vehicles.
However, at negotiations, assurances were obtained fiom the Govruneat of
Indonesathat the veicles neededfor the project would be procured by 00a wider
a schedule and timetable agreed with the Bank.

IIlc and heat  evet collection cycles of about 90 days provide an adequa  banc

may require much more intsive data collection. For eample to    y   monitor acute
infectio  disease eves In dhdre, twice weeky or weeky surveillance is often requird.
Finally an Impotn  aspect of this sequni data collecton is that it needs to be acdvely linked
over time by use of specificaly designed Individ  Idnifiers.
lhe or3,,wecional data is collected by spec  modules at various times but can be
lied to the lontuodi  data. Typically this data iacords household        such as
socioeco i status, eployment, educational        religion, attitudes to health servces,
heat practices, healt service utiliz    as well as housdehld     riskio. This
