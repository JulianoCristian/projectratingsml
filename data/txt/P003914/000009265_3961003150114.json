This will be\n            accomplished by: (a) building provincial and kabupaten\n            capacity to plan, implement and evaluate safe motherhood,\n            child survival and nutrition interventions; and (b) by\n            strengthening the capacity of the central Ministry of\n            Health. The Provincial Service Delivery and Capacity\n            Development component consists of interventions in safe\n            motherhood, child survival nutrition and health education.\n            Selected kabupaten in each province will implement newly\n            designed approaches to each intervention which will be\n            evaluated by kabupaten and provincial staff prior to\n            expansion to additional kabupaten within each province. A\n            central support services and capacity building component\n            will help the Directorate General for Community Health, the\n            Center for Health Education and the Center for Health Data\n            to build their capacities for policy development, provision\n            of technical assistance to local levels, organization and\n            monitoring of training, and for conducting surveys and\n            operational research."}, "docdt": "1992-12-04T00:00:00Z"}
