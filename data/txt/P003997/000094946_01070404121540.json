Seven\n            important lessons were learned during the project\n            implementation. 1) The Bank carried out a thorough review of\n            the sector which led to the Bank's long term\n            partnership with the telecommunications sector in Indonesia.\n            2) Active participation and commitment of all stakeholders,\n            as well as close coordination among the key players\n            contributed to the success of the project. 3) From a\n            development perspective, in the telecommunications sector\n            where technology advancement is a key driver of change, it\n            is necessary to build flexibility into the project. 4) The\n            provision of adequate technical assistance (TA) at the very\n            beginning to build good project management and\n            implementation capacity in Telekomunikasi Indonesia (TELKOM)\n            greatly contributed to the success and sustainability of the\n            project. 5) Providing necessary TA to build capacity within\n            TELKOM to adequately manage the procurement process and\n            address issues related to the procurement of new technology\n            resulted in a satisfactory procurement process. 6) The\n            project's supervisory budget being supplemented with\n            additional resources enabled Bank staff to provide continued\n            sector policy and regulatory advice. 7) Continuity of\n            competent and committed personnel with the correct skills\n            mix at the Borrower, project entity, and Bank and decisive\n            leadership by the Borrower are critical in creating the\n            trust and understanding."}, "docdt": "2001-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
