3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The Fourth Telecommunications Project is the second in a series of large telecommunications investment
loans to the Government of Indonesia to support the implementation of broad-ranging sector reforms which
had been designed and initiated under the Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2757-IND approved in
October 1986) and the Sector Study (Report No. 7842-IND, 1990).
The project had two main objectives:
1. to improve sector performance by promoting a regulatory regime conducive to competition in the
provision of telecommunication services; and
2. to meet the growing demand for telecommunications services by enhancing the quality of
TELKOM's service, effective utilization of existing facilities, increasing system efficiency and
modernizing and expanding the networks.
The project design and objectives were consistent with the Government's policy for the telecommunications
sector of the time which called for increasing access to modem and efficient telecommunications services;
increasing the commercial orientation and efficiency of the telecommunication sector; and improving
service quality and TELKOM's productivity, among others. In order to effectively implement policy, it
was also necessary to develop the institutional and regulatory framework to increase competition in the
market.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The project was designed to meet the above objectives through two main components: (i) an MTPT
component; and (ii) a TELKOM component.
The MTPT component included:
I. establishment of an environment for the functioning of competitive markets, including support for
MTPT to develop effective transparent regulatory processes, and to train MTPT staff; and
2. strengthening the capacity of the MTPT to design, assess and implement a consistent set of sector
policies including a review of telecommunications tariffs and planning for a second domestic
telecommunications operator.
The TELKOM component included:
1. further institutional capacity building for TELKOM comprising: (i) a management and
professional human resource development program using a cooperative program of academic
training foreign universities and working internships in selected fields at developed
telecommunications entities; (ii) development and implementation of the operational and
managerial decentralization program; (iii) enhancement of TELKOMNs capability in operational
-2 -



performance, project design, engineering, implementation and supervision; (iv) upgrading
accounting and financial policies, systems and procedures and related computerization
requirements; and
2. support for TELEKOM's 1992-1996 investment program in Java, Bali, Nusatenggara, Kalimantan
and Sulawesi comprising: (i) rehabilitation of existing switching equipment, local cable network,
customer distribution network, interchange network, including the provision of spare parts,
modules, tools and test equipment to repair and refurbish them as well as software packages to
improve operational efficiency and enhance traffic handling capacity; (ii) installation of switching
equipment, associated customer distribution network and customer terminal equipment (including
20,000 pay phones) to connect about 600,000 new customers; (iii) installation of fiber optic cable
and microwave transmission facilities to provide interexchange junction facilities in the Jabotabek
area; (iv) installation of terrestrial microwave transmission facilities (a) Java-Bali (phase I), (b)
Bali-Nusatenggara phase II, (c) Trans-Sulawesi phase II and (d) cross Kalimantan phase II to
improve long distance direct-dialing service quality; (v) establishment of a modem network
management system to improve network supervision and to improve traffic monitoring and
management; and (vi) improvement of the directory inquiry system.
3.4 Revised Components:
The above components were not revised.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The project was not reviewed by QAG. At the time of appraisal, Quality at Entry was considered to have
been satisfactory as the project was designed taking into account lessons learned from previous
telecommunications projects implemented in Indonesia. The potential risks identified for the project fell
into two categories: (a) delays in procurement, and (b) shortfall in TELKOM institutional capacity to
implement the project. These risks were identified and actions initiated to minimize their impact.
In order to ensure that procurement delays would not take place, preparatory work such as detailed
engineering and site identification were completed before project launch. Advance procurement action was
also required of TELKOM to ensure timely project implementation. In order to make certain that the
project would be ready for implementation upon effectiveness, the terms of reference for all consultancy
requirements were completed during project preparation to ensure that the appointment of these
consultants, a condition for project effectiveness, was completed in a timely manner.
The shortfall in TELKOM's institutional capacity to implement the project was adequately addressed
through the development of a detailed implementation plan and the establishment within TELKOM of a
nucleus project implementation unit (PIU) prior to appraisal. Adequate technical assistance was provided
to the PIU to support them in project management, project implementation and the procurement process.
Residual risks were addressed through agreed measures during project implementation and supervision,
with corrective actions initiated as necessary.
At the time of appraisal, the 1997 financial crisis and subsequent political turmoil that hit Indonesia were
not foreseen. This was beyond the control of TELKOM and delayed project completion by two years.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
All the objectives and performance targets of the project were either met or surpassed and the overall
outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory. The Indonesian telecommunication sector has undergone an
evolution in that the market structure has become more competitive; separation has taken place between the
operator and policy maker and regulator; and TELKOM has undergone further commercialization and
improved its overall performance.
The project was funded by the World Bank, eight bilateral funding agencies and TELKOM. While the
Bank financed about 30% of the total public sector investment in PT TELKOM, it took the lead and was
effective in securing needed policy reforms and ensuring a balanced investment program by utilizing
bilateral funding for the development of TELKOM's switching and transmission networks.
The project provided adequate technical assistance to both TELKOM and MTPT. The assistance to
TELKOM was utilized to strengthen its financial, operational and technical management. This set the
stage for the partial privatization of TELKOM, which was funded by GOI. The TA also equipped
TELKOM in strengthening its project management capacity, which was key towards the successful
implementation of the project. Technical assistance provided to MTPT was utilized to undertake key
reform activities and for policy and regulatory strengthening. The MTPT (DGPT and DOC) took concrete
measures to establish the necessary separation between regulatory/policy maker and the operator.
TELKOM's Board of Commissioners no longer has any members from MTPT. The project also reinforced
the regulatory framework and more imnportantly provided a framework for opening the sector to private
participation. It set the stage for joint operation schemes (KSOs) between TELKOM and private
operators.
The project was designed taking into account lessons leamed from previous telecommunications projects
implemented in Indonesia and it set the stage for the next level of reforms under the ongoing Telecom
Sector Modernization Project. There was a productive symbiosis between the different projects. The
ongoing project addresses issues such as moving forward towards the establishment of an independent
regulatory body, evolution of a more competitive market structure and greater role for private sector
operators.
Objective]: To improve sector performance by promoting a regulatory regime conducive to competition
in the provision of telecommunication services. This objective was satisfactorily achieved. GOI
demonstrated its commitment to promoting a competitive market structure by licensing seven mobile
cellular operators in the country. Liberalization plans have also been moved forward. The Government
has announced that TELKOM's monopoly on local services will end in 2002, and on domestic long distance
in 2003. Further exclusivity in international services will end in 2003. The project supported the sector
agenda to improve sector performance by promoting a regulatory regime conducive to competition in the
provision of telecommunication services.
The GOI also issued a Blueprint document in July 1999 that represents important progress in articulating
an emerging consensus on important directions for development of the sector; it addresses increased
performance in the telecommunications sector in order to facilitate Indonesia's participation in the global
economy and discusses the transition of the sector from a monopolistic to a competitive environment. It
also outlines options for future KSOs and emphasizes the need to provide more opportunities to small and
medium size entrepreneurs in the telecommunications sector. It promotes increased clarity and
-4 -



transparency within the sector in order to enhance private investmnent in a multi-operator environment.
GOI enacted a new Telecom Law No. 36 in September 1999 which became effective in September 2000.
The new Telecom Law provides a platform for further reform and accelerated development of the
telecommunications sector. It creates opportunity for the formation of an independent regulator; provides
for the end of statutory monopolies; and supports customer choice. While the law does not explicitly
provide for the establishment of an independent regulatory agency, the GOI has signalled its intention to
establish a non-ministerial agency through a Presidential decree. The Telecom Law provides for equal
network access for service providers based on interconnection regulation and supports the concept that the
Indonesian public should have equal access to telecommunication facilities (Universal Service Obligation).
Throughout most of the project implementation period, tariffs have been adequate for TELKOM to meet its
financial covenants, ensure large scale investment in the cellular sector, and ensure interest by major
foreign telecommunication operators to form joint ventures with TELKOM through KSO agreements and
investments in the basic sector. In addition, substantial re-balancing of tariffs took place during the
1994-98 period. The tariff adjustment formula was included in the information memorandum issued for
TELKOM's initial public offering of shares on the New York and Jakarta stock exchanges. This forrnula
was also included in the KSO contracts. Nevertheless, the financial crisis in 1997 and the associated
devaluation of the Rupiah have led to a need to adjust tariffs substantially. There was a delay in obtaining
the required Govemment approval for tariff revision. Despite the recent approval by the Government for
tariff increases of 45% over three years, the tariff has not fully recovered to facilitate large scale
investments in the sector given the high country risk.
Objective 2: To meet the growing demandfor telecommunication services by enhancing the quality of
TELKOM's service, effective utilization of existingfacilities, increasing system efficiency and
modernizing and expanding networks. This objective has been achieved by the addition of 760,000 fixed
access lines to the telecom network, installation of 240,000 payphones, implementation of a computerized
access network system, switching operation and maintenance centres, national network control centre and
the modernization of directory inquiry services systems. TELKOM has experienced phenomenal growth in
its capacity to provide services and today has an advanced network that is fully digitalized. TELKOM has
also made significant progress in reducing unmet demand and improving productivity.
The overall project is rated satisfactory.
4.2 Outputs by components:
The project satisfactorily completed all components as stated in the SAR.
Establishment of an environment for the functioning of competitive markets: The achievement of this
component is rated satisfactory with the issuance of the Blueprint document which establishes the roadmap
for the evolution of a competitive telecom market structure in Indonesia and the enactment of a new
Telecom Law which provides for reform and development of the telecom sector. This has set the stage for
the establishment of an independent regulatory agency, which will improve operator confidence and
encourage a competitive market.
Strengthening the capacity of the MTPT to design, assess and implement a consistent set of sector
policies including a review of telecommunications tariffs and planning for a second domestic
telecommunications operator: The output of this component is rated satisfactory as the technical
-5 -



assistance under the project facilitated DGPT and DOC in strengthening its telecommunications policy and
regulatory capacities and in building awareness among the various stakeholders in the sector. In addition,
staff were provided with fellowships to undergo a variety of post graduate and other training programs. As
a result, their ability to understand important issues was enhanced and this enabled the DOC and DGPT to
make far reaching decisions in the policy arena. Some of these included adjustment of tariffs, promoting
new entry in the sector and issuance of the Blueprint document. A strategy and business plan was also
developed for the introduction of a second domestic telecommunications operator.
Institutional capacity buildingfor TELKOM: The achievement of this component is rated as satisfactory.
On the job and other training mechanisms were used to train over 100 staff, thus enhancing TELKOM's
capability in operational performance, project design, engineering, implementation and supervision. The
accounting and budget management system was also improved under the project. As a result of this
component, staff productivity increased from 87 lines per employee in June 1996 to 173 lines per employee
in September 2000. Further, the technical assistance provided by the project greatly enhanced the project
management capabilities within TELKOM and enabled them to implement the project well.
Support for TELEKOM's 1992-1996 investment program in Java, Bali, Nusatenggara, Kalimantan and
Sulawesi: The output of this component is rated as satisfactory. Over 760,000 line units of digital
telephone switching were installed in about 120 locations which included switches for replacement of
around 2,500 manual lines, 135,000 electromechanical and analog SPC lines. Outside plant facilities and
the junction network were upgraded and expanded. The Java-Bali, cross Kalimantan, trans- Sulawesi and
Nusatenggara long distance networks were expanded and extended and high capacity toll transmission
systems were installed. Transmission systems were also expanded to over 200 remote locations to support
the interconnection of digital exchanges. Operation and Maintenance Centres and a National Network
Control Centre were set up to implement an Integrated Network Management System. The directory
inquiry system was also modemized. As a result, networks with total exchange capacity had grown to
8,401,000 lines by 30 June, 2000 compared to 4,824,000 lines in 30 June, 1995; capacity utilization
increased to 84.4% as of 30 June 2000; 303,217 public telephones were installed as of 30 June, 2000
against the appraisal target of 219,000 payphones; quality of service greatly improved with local and
national call completion ratios at 71.35% and 64.5% respectively on 30 June, 2000 as compared to 55.25%
and 47.56% in 30 June, 1995. Also, network expansion was carried out at a reduced unit network
development cost of US$ 1000 per line in 2000 compared to US$ 1,200 per line in 1994. This unit
network development cost is in line with intemational benchmarks.
These are all indicators of a satisfactory outcome.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Economic benefits from the project are substantial. The project benefited all sectors of the economy
through improved access to telecom facilities and improved service quality. There was increased level of
private participation in the sector through opening of the cellular market to increased competition and
establishment of KSO schemes. New employment opportunities were generated through the development
of new services and the establishment of new service providers in the various market segments.
At appraisal, the economic rate of return (ERR) and financial rate of return (FRR) were calculated at 23%
and 18% respectively, based on overall investments expected to be made by TELKOM. With the
establishment of the KSO scheme in 1996, investments were made by the KSOs and not by TELKOM, in
all regions outside of Jakarta and Surabaya. As a result of this change, comparable calculations of ERR
and FRR are not possible due to lack of KSO's revenue and cost information.
- 6 -



4.4 Financial rate of return:
TELKOM's prudent financial management help minimize negative impact of the financial crisis in
Indonesia on its financial performance since 1997. TELKOM was also shielded from the full impact of
Rupiah devaluation as the KSO's were responsible for expansion and management of the network outside
of Jakarta and Surabaya and TELKOM continued to receive minimum revenues from the KSOs. While
TELKOM's financial returns were affected due to the downturn in the economy, TELKOM has managed to
maintain sound liquidity and financial positions. TELKOM has met both its debt service coverage and
intemal cash generation covenants throughout the project period. TELKOM's financial performance
indicators are provided in Annex 3.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The Institutional development impact of the project was rated satisfactory.
During the initial years of the project, in-country capacity was built to implement and supervise the project
at a local level. This was key to its successful implementation and completion.
MTPT developed the capacity to assess telecommunications policies including network competition,
network development strategies. MTPT, with technical assistance from the Bank was able to successfully
develop an agenda for regulatory activities, assess, recommend and implement regulatory action on priority
matters. MTPT, with the assistance of consultants, was able to review proposals for tariff revisions and
recornmend an appropriate tariff rebalancing mechanism. MTPT also achieved greater independence from
the operator and was able to formulate and implement new regulations.
TELKOM staff were provided on-the-job training to develop in-house capabilities in all aspects of
operations and thus reduce reliance on foreign expertise. Further, the accounting and financial functions
within TELKOM were improved and strengthened. This led to TELKOM's listing on the Jakarta and New
York Stock Exchange, indicating its achievement of commercial discipline and its ability to fully meet the
requirements of the SEC.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Indonesia has recently experienced the worst economic crisis in the last 30 years. TELKOM's results were
remarkably resilient amid Indonesia's recession. The telecommunications sector as a whole exhibited
reduced growth even as most other sectors contracted. Nevertheless, some projects under the loan were
delayed by the economic crisis. The GOI requested that the Bank cancel US$50.0 million and, in order to
complete the on-going projects in a satisfactory manner, the GOI requested that the Bank extend the
original loan closing date of December 31, 1998 to December 31, 1999.
Subsequently, due to the economic and political situation, the GOI again requested the Bank to cancel
US$30.94 million and extend the Loan closing date by one year to December 31, 2000. This extension was
requested to allow for the completion of the two customer access network contracts. A number of factors
contributed to delays in implementation. These included: (a) the political situation which caused several
periods of disruption with staff leaving Jakarta for extended periods of time. Access to work sites was
- 7 -



also difficult on several occasions and at times work was stopped for security reasons; (b) the depreciation
of the Rupiah escalated the costs of locally supplied goods and services. As a result, contractors claimed
escalations in unit costs, considerably in excess of what TELKOM proposed. This was satisfactorily
resolved by the Government in relation with overall price increases in all sectors. The loan cancellations
partly reflected cost savings resulting from technological impacts in the industry globally, as well as
effective planning and improved procurement practices by TELKOM.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Despite the domestic and economic upheavals that took place in Indonesia, it is important to emphasize the
steadfastness, perseverance and consistency of GOI during recent years in preparing and implementing a
phased approach toward both the strengthening of the organization and the capabilities of the main
operator, TELKOM, and in parallel initiating and pursuing the restructuring and reform of the whole
telecommunications sector in Indonesia.
These phases were designed and undertaken in close consultation and discussion with the Bank, to improve
and strengthen the institutional, regulatory and organizational framework of the sector, and gradually
introduce a competitive commercial environment for its operations and development, with increased private
sector participation through joint ventures for basic services or independent corporations for new and value
added services. As a result, Indonesia's telecommunications sector has been transformed from that of a
public sector monopoly to a private/public multi-operator environment with competition in most segments
of the market.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
TELKOM successfully managed the complex and intricate activities related to (i) developing exceptionally
large investment programs; (ii) implementation of these programs by connecting a very large number of
new subscribers, and (iii) simultaneously establishing effective operation and maintenance systems for the
network, thus substantially improving the quality and the efficiency of the services. All this is attributable
to a large extent to the setting-up of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) which functioned efficiently and
effectively in liaison with the project planning and management department. Also, TELKOM employed
consultants for implementation of each project component in liaison with the project planning and
management department. Consultants were employed by TELKOM in particular for: (a) its corporate
planning process; (b) program/project management; (c) construction supervision; (d) technical aspects of
capacity utilization, and (e) twinning arrangements for all managerial, strategic, operational, financial,
commercial, human resources and training activities. All these tasks and activities were satisfactorily
performed and completed. GOI and TELKOM evaluated the performance of consultants as satisfactory.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The total cost of the project was US$ 1,062.16 million as compared to the appraisal estimate of US$ 1,353
million. The Bank financed US$ 288.21 million of the total project cost as compared to original Bank loan
of US$ 375 million. Due to the economic crisis, the Government of Indonesia requested a cancellation of
US$ 81.02 million. In addition, there is a saving of approximately US$ 5.77 million which was cancelled.
The cancellation of the loan amount did not affect financing of the original project components to be
financed by the Bank as substantial savings were achieved due to the following: (i) use of ICB procurement
procedures; (ii) reduction in equipment prices due to advances in technology, and (iii) successful use of
local consultants.

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
The sustainability of the project's achievements are likely. It would have been highly likely in the absence of
the current political and institutional uncertainties.
Sector reform achieved under the project has allowed for the entry of many new operators into the
Indonesian telecommunications market. Private sector participation in the sector is now very substantial
and is expected to increase. As such, reforms are continuing and there is commitment in the Government of
Indonesia to make the market structure more competitive. Competitive pressure has to some degree
reduced the power of the incumbent, while its efficiency has improved. The issuance of the Blueprint
document provides a roadmap for and demonstrates the GOI's commitment for the evolution of a
competitive market structure. These changes and developments assure the sustainability of the reform
process.
TELKOM's ability to effectively operate, maintain and manage its expanded network is evident from the
significant improvements in its performance over the last eight years. The listing of TELKOM's shares in
the New York and Jakarta stock exchanges, ensures its commercial and operational performance and
sustainability, as it contributes towards transparency in financial reporting. All of the above should
continue the progress made under the project to improve the performance of Indonesia's telecom sector.
While much progress was made it must, however, be added that the project was implemented and sector
reforms were undertaken in a very difficult country environment - political, economic and social. There is,
therefore, some risk of the ongoing reforrns getting stalled in the event that there is a political or social
crisis in the country.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
This project has satsifactorily met its objectives. Project activities related to PT TELKOM and DGPT
have been integrated into regular operations. The Telecommunications Sector Modemization Project
which is currently under implementation is providing continuity in dialogue on sector policy and regulatory
issues. Further, the Bank is also providing policy and regulatory advice (AAA) to the Government on the
telecommunications sector.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Active participation and commitment of all stakeholders during project identification, preparation and
appraisal led to successful outcomes in institutional reform. The project team built on the relationship
developed between the Bank and GOI during the previous projects implemented in Indonesia.
From the beginning extensive efforts were made by the Bank to involve the GOI, TELKOM and donors in
an interactive process of sector restructuring and development. This resulted in broad consensus among all
-9-



parties on the main elements of reform and the specifics of implementation. During all stages of the
project, the Bank maintained close dialogue with the GOI and TELKOM to ensure that the project
objectives were directly in line with the client's goals for the sector. The appropriateness of staff mix and
its continuity during preparation, appraisal and supervision were satisfactory.
The loan amount and project execution period was well estimated at the time of appraisal and delays
occurred for reasons that were neither anticipated nor controllable. Several key performance indicators
(Annex 1) were achieved and exceeded.
7.2 Supervision:
GOI and TELKOM have emphasized the extent of the harmonious and fruitful working relationship which
the Bank maintained with all concerned parties under the project. The resulting positive contributions to
sector and institutional developments and TELKOM operations were particularly recognized and
appreciated.
The overall supervision of the project was satisfactory. Regular supervision missions were carried out and
documentation on the project is adequate. Modifications in the project, including extension of closing dates
were processed by Bank staff in an efficient manner in order to respond to the Borrower's needs.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank performance was satisfactory under the project. The closing of this project is a milestone in
thirteen years of cooperation with the GOI in the development of the telecommunications sector in
Indonesia, by far the largest recipient of Bank lending in this sector. As a result, many leading investment
banks and consultant companies have offered their services in telecommunications deregulation and
privatization to the Government. The Bank gave sound advice to GOI on the need to maintain a clear and
consistent sector policy and to follow international best practice in establishing a credible and transparent
regulatory framework.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower participated actively and with commitment in the preparation of the project. This very
positive position on the Borrower's part promoted, from the beginning, consensus on the elements of reform
and the methodology of implementation.
The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within TELKOM, responsible for overall project management, was
identified and appointed prior to appraisal. Prior to negotiation, the Borrower had developed a detailed
project implementation plan. The quality of the borrower's commitment and contributions to the
preparation of the project were notable.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Important steps were taken toward sector reform, institutional improvements and continued evolution
toward sector liberalization. Given the overall progress made on sector reform during the project period
(Blueprint document issued, new Telecom law, separation between regulator and operator) the
Government's performance can be considered satisfactory.
- 10-



7.6 lInplementing Agency:
Drawing upon the best benefits from the technical assistance, consultancy and training services financed
under previous Bank operations and the third and fourth loans, TELKOM managed efficiently the complex
and challenging tasks of both initiating important institutional restructuring of the sector and successfully
planning/implementing its rapid development. TELKOM also maintained accurate and detailed financial
records at the Project Management Unit level and submitted timely, audited corporate and project finance
accounts. The project achieved its institutional, organizational and physical/operational objectives and
targets. The partial opening of TELKOM's ownership to the international capital market provided
additional resources for ongoing and future development.
TELKOM has confronted the same challenges such as privatization, liberalization, new technologies and
services, as other operators world-wide and has undergone vast organizational and cultural transition.
TELKOM has transformed itself from a nonprofit making government agency to a market and customer
driven company responsible to its shareholders.
7.7 Overall Borrowerperformance:
The Government's performances were also satisfactory and their relationship with the Bank were good and
fruitful throughout the implementation of the project. GOI is in compliance with all loan covenants.
Overall Borrower performance and participation in both project preparation and implementation is
satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
Seven important lessons were learned during the implementation of the project.
First, the Bank carried out a thorough review of the sector which led to the Bank's long term partnership
with the telecommunications sector in Indonesia. Accordingly, the Bank supported a well defined and
balanced investment in order to achieve the desired sector and corporate reforms in the telecommunications
sector.
Second, active participation and conmmitment of all stakeholders during project preparation and
implementation, as well as close coordination among the key players contributed to the success of the
project. From the very beginning, extensive and focused efforts were made by the Bank staff to involve
senior government officials, senior staff of TELKOM and donors in an interactive process to reach broad
consensus on the project goals and the specifics of its implementation. With regard to parallel
co-financing, up-front commitments were made by all stake holders and this led to timely implementation of
various components of the project.
Third, from a development perspective, in the telecommunications sector where technology advancement is
a key driver of change, it is necessary to build flexibility into the project. In Indonesia, this allowed for
project realignment when necessary, thus facilitating the redefinition of needs which drove down the unit
cost of providing services.
- 11 -



Fourth, the provision of adequate technical assistance at the very beginning to build good project
management and implementation capacity in TELKOM greatly contributed to the success and
sustainability of the project.
Fifth, providing necessary technical assistance to build capacity within TELKOM to adequately manage
the procurement process and address issues related to the procurement of new technology resulted in a
satisfactory procurement process.
Sixth, the project's supervisory budget was also supplemented with additional resources which enabled
Bank staff to provide continued sector policy and regulatory advice. The continued dialogue maintained
with the Government facilitated the adoption of key sector reform policies.
Finally, continuity of competent and committed personnel with the correct skills mix at the Borrower,
project entity and Bank and decisive leadership by the Borrower are critical in creating the trust and
understanding necessary to resolve many sensitive issues that arise.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrover/implementing agency:
TELKOM has provided the Bank with a completion report for the project. The following is a summary of
this report:
The Project and Loan Agreement for the Telecom IV Project, between Government of Indonesia (GOI) and
World Bank, was signed in July 1992. The corresponding Subsidiary Loan Agreement (SLA) was signed
between GOI and PT TELKOM in August 1992. In the Agreement the closing date for the loan was
December 1998. The loan period was extended, first to December 31, 1999, and then to December 31,
2000. The reason for this was the economical and political situation in Indonesia during 1998-99.
The first objective for the project was to improve the performance of the telecommunications sector by
promoting competition in the provision of telecommunication services. The second objective was to meet
the demands for services by enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS), increasing the system efficiency and
modemizing and expanding the existing network. To achieve the two objectives, the Project was divided in
three parts. One part was administered by the Ministry of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications
(MTPT), and the other two parts by TELKOM.
MTPT was to implement telecommunication sector policies, promote competition in teleconmmunication
services, analyze existing telecommunication tariffs and undertake staff training programs.
TELKOM's first objective was the implementation of an investment program in Bali, Jabotabek, Java,
Kalimantan, Nusatenggara, and Sulawesi. This included rehabilitation of existing and installation of new
switching, transmission and terminal equipment, including junction networks and payphones. It also
included the installation of fiber-optic cable network and microwave transmission equipment and the
implementation of a new telecommunication network management system.
The second objective was the use of technical assistance to upgrade accounting and financial policies,
systems and procedures and strengthen operations, project design, engineering, implementation and
supervision. This included training programs in management, human resource development and
telecommunications and also the introduction of an operational and managerial decentralization prograrn.
The Project was funded by the World Bank and eight bilateral funding agencies. The bilateral cofinanciers
- 12 -



were ABN Amro, Sumitomo Corp., Kreditanstalt fir Wiederbau, Spanish Loan, US Eximbank, Overseas
Economic Co. Fund, Credit Lyonnais and French Protocol.
The Bank funded the Customer Access Network (CAN) component of the project, adding 640,000 Copper
Access Lines and 120,000 Wireless Local Loop lines.
For supervision of the network, a new system (SISKA) was implemented, which manages quality of service
for 3,000,000 customers.
Other sub-projects were the implementation of a National Network Control Center (NNCC), Operations
and Maintenance Centers (OMC), Outside Plant Maintenance Centers (OPMC) in Jakarta and Surabaya
and modernization of the directory system.
Contracts for construction supervision (CS) and construction management (CM) were implemented. The
scope of work was planning, scheduling, design checking, implementation and management.
Consultancy contracts were carried out to support TELKOM's Finance Directorate to improve accounting
and budget management. Other areas included establishment of new processes for maintenance and
network operations, and to guide TELKOM in its transformation to a limited company. Training programs
were also performed in administrative and technical fields and included overseas postgraduate programs.
This has led to an increased percentage of university graduates in TELKOM between 1995 and 2000.
The rapid deployment of connected lines and a net decrease of staff in TELKOM improved its productivity.
Installation of new systems, upgrading of old systems, new operational processes and staff training has
reduced faults, improved service quality and increased the Call Completion Ratios (CCR).
The overall operational experience of the project has been very positive. The operation has run smoothly
with only small impediments in the implementation and without any major interruptions.
With the help of World Bank, TELKOM has successfully managed the procedures of bidding,
procurement, installation, and finalization of different components of the project.
The key conclusion is that all performance goals have been met and the productivity within TELKOM has
improved significantly.
The major lesson learned in this project, is that the implementation of a project of this nature should be
based on an integrated network plan where different components are synchronized. This will lead to
quicker network utilization and a faster return on invested capital.
It can also be mentioned that the support from the World Bank has been appreciated and the initiatives
taken during the missions has been highly regarded. The World Bank and TELKOM's management staff
maintained always a harmonious working relationship throughout implementation of the Project.
