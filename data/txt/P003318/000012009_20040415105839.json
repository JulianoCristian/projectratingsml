This Project Completion Note specifies the reasons\n            for project cancellation as follows. The difficult economic\n            and political crisis in Zimbabwe accelerated, with problems\n            servicing  external debts, and by March 2000, the government\n            defaulted on its loans to the Bank, and other international\n            financial institutions. As a result, the Bank suspended\n            disbursements on all projects in Zimbabwe on May 16,200O.\n            The economic crisis worsened during the past four years, and\n            the country's arrears continue to rise. Zimbabwe has\n            not made any effort to clear its arrears to the Bank. The\n            project was closed, and the undisbursed funds from both the\n            Credit and Grant were cancelled on June 25, 2002 some 25\n            months after the Bank suspended disbursements to Zimbabwe,\n            as a result of the government's inability to service\n            its loans to the Bank. The original closing date was 30\n            September 2005."}, "docdt": "2004-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
