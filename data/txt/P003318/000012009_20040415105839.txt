 Park Rehabilitation and Conservation Project Cr. 3083,ZW and the Associated
               Biodiversity Conservation Project Grant No. TF028967



1       This is the Completion Note for the Park Rehabilitation and Conservation Project
(PRCP) of the Government of Zimbabwe, a project that was approved on June 2, 1998. The
International Development Association (IDA) Credit (Credit No. 3083) dated June 25, 1998
in the amount of SDR 46,300,OOOand the associated Global Environment Facility (GEF)
Trust Fund, (Grant No. TF028967), dated June 25, 1998 in the amount of SDR 3,700,000,
for the PRCP became effective on March 15, 1999. The project was executed by the
Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management (DNPWLM)             in the Ministry of
Environment and Tourism (MET). The project was closed and the undisbursed funds from
both the Credit and Grant were cancelled on June 252002       some 25 months after the Bank
suspendeddisbursements to Zimbabwe as a result of the government's inability to service its
loans to the Bank. The original closing date was 30 September 2005.


Development Objective and Project Description

2       The project's objective was to enhancethe Government's ability to protect wildlife
populations and their habitats and to develop the parks and wildlife sector by rehabilitating
or improving essential elements of infrastructure, and by strengthening the institutional
capacity of the agencies responsible for ensuring the sustainability of investments and for
formulating policy and implementing wildlife programs. The global environmental objective
was to improve biodiversity conservation in Gonarezhou National Park and nearby South
East Lowveld areas.Key features of biodiversity conservation and management would be
protection of adequaterange for mobile wildlife populations in this semi-arid and
periodically drought-prone region, protection of vegetation from destruction by fire and other
human-caused impacts, protection of water resources, re-establishment of migration
corridors, protection of wildlife from illegal killing, and minimization of conflict between
wildlife and agriculture or other land usesoutside the park.


 3.     The project comprised three parts as follows:

            I       Institutional Strengthening: Reinforcing institutional and organizational
            capacity to ensurethe sustainability of investments and the effective management
            of the Parks Estate and wildlife resourcesby (i) supporting organizational
            development and staff training; (ii) improving financial management systems; (iii)


                                                 3

              instituting comprehensive park plannin ; (iv) improving capacity for policy
              development; (v) supporting monitoring programs and applied researchfor
              protected area management and biodiversity conservation;

              II       Infrastructure: Rehabilitating and improving national park infrastructure
              including: (i) rehabilitating infrast~~ture (roads, water supplies, electricity,
              communications) critical for park ~nctioning and tourism access; (ii) providing
              basic plant and equipment for road maintenance; (iii) improving staff housing,
              park administrative facilities (office space) and equipment; (v) providing vehicles
              and other equipment for improved park management and anti-poaching
              operations.

              III      GEF - Gonarezhou National Park: Strengthening biodiversity conservation
              in Gonarezhou National Park and the nearby South East Lowveld, by supporting
              activities both in the park and in nearby areas(pa~icuiarly communal lands),
              including: (i) rehabilitating and improving essential infrastructure in the park, and
              supporting implementation of the park management plan; (ii) establishing a
              consultative processto involve local communities and other relevant stakeholders
              in park planning and management and in promoting conservation opportunities
              outside park boundaries; (iii) supporting community-based sub-projects outside
              the park to promote or develop sustainable wildlife utilization and other forms of
              land use that are compatible with bio-diversity conservation; and, (iv) supporting
              monitoring and applied researchprograms, and interpretive and education
              facilities and programs.

              IV       A fourth component was about to be added following approval by the
              Bank in April 2000 of the government's request to amend the Credit to support
              the rehabilitation of cyclone-damaged infrastructure in the southeastern
              Zimbabwe. However, the amendment was not formalized and therefore did not
              take effect before the general suspension of disbursements.




Financing Plan

 4.      Total Project cost was US$75 million and was to be financed by IDA (US$62.5
         million), GEF Grant (US$5 million), and Government (US$7.5 million)


Implementation

5        At the time of project cancellation, all aspectsof implementation were rated
unsatisfactory. Actual implementation progress at June 30,200O was only 10% compared to
18% in the Project Implementation Plan. Only 3.4% of the credit was disbursed. The disbursed
funds were utilized for vehicle and equipment purchasesas well as salaries and operating
expensesfor the Project Implementation Unit, -while implementation of the major project
activities had not started. Implementation progress was slower than expected due mainly to (i)
management problems in the DNPWLM              as the lack of a substantive Director tended to delay



                                                    4

the decision-making process; (ii) delays in appointing personnel for the project implementation
unit to co-ordinate project activities; and (iii) lack of counte~a~ funds, which resulted in
delays of several procurement activities. Although a draft procedures manual for the GEF out-
of-parks component (Lowveld Biodiversity Project) was prepared, implementation of this
component failed to take off before the Bank suspendeddisbursements, hence no
disbursements were made from the GEF grant.

Reasons for Cancellation

6        Beginning mid-1999, a difficult economic and political crisis was accelerating and
the country started having problems servicing its external debts. By March 2000, the
government had defaulted on its loans to the Bank and other international financial
institutions. As a result of the government's inability to meet its debt obligations to the
Bank, the Bank suspendeddisbursements on all projects in Zimbabwe on May 16,200O.
Zimbabwe was subsequently placed on non-accrual status on October 2,200O and has
remained in this status to this date. As a consequenceof the government's inability to make
current its overdue payments, the Bank closed the project. The undisbursed balances for the
Credit and GEF grant amounting to SDR 44,756,134.5 1 and SDR 3,700,000, respectively
were cancelled on June 25,2002, as neither the Department of National Parks and Wildlife
Management nor the government had own funds to continue with the implementation of
planned project activities.

7        The economic crisis has worsened during the past four years and the country's
arrearscontinue to rise. Zimbabwe has not made any effort to clear its arrearsto the Bank
which are currently at about US$240.6 million, since December 2000. Zimbabwe's total
external arrears continue to mount reaching approximately US$ 1.5 billion as of end-2002.

Lessons Learned

8.       The growing political difficulties, instability and the associated rapid deterioration of
Zimbabwe's economy eventually led to the country defaulting and the consequent
cancellation of all Bank projects. These factors could not have been anticipated at the time
of project approval. However, the project could have made some progress towards achieving
its Development Objective if effectiveness had not been delayed almost 9 months after
Board approval and adequate counterpart funds were available.
