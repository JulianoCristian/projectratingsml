The project has three components.\n            The first component reinforces institutional and\n            organizational capacity to sustain investments and\n            effectively manage the Parks estate and wildlife resources:\n            it supports organizational development, implements Fund\n            financial management and management information systems,\n            institutes comprehensive park planning, improves capacity\n            for policy development, supports monitoring and applied\n            research for protected area management and biodiversity\n            conservation, and provides interpretative and educational\n            materials and programs. The second component improves\n            elements of national park infrastructure needed to manage\n            parks for wildlife and habitat conservation and for\n            sustainable commercial development, including improving\n            infrastructure critical for park functioning and tourism\n            access, providing plant and equipment for road maintenance,\n            improving and adding staff housing, and providing vehicles\n            and other equipment for improved park management and\n            anti-poaching operations. The third component strengthens\n            biodiversity conservation in the national park and nearby\n            areas; implements the park management plan; establishes a\n            consultative process in park planning, management, and\n            conservation; supports community-based sub-projects; and\n            supports educational programs."}, "docdt": "1998-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
