Economic Reform Technical Assistance\n            Project for Sri Lanka aims to stengthen the\n            government's capacity to implement the economic reform\n            agenda. This will be achieved by funding priority technical\n            assistance that will provide government with the executive\n            capacity required to implement its reform agenda. The\n            implementation of the government's economic reforms\n            will in turn expand the role of the private sector in the\n            economy and put the country on the path of higher economic\n            growth and faster poverty reduction. There are four project\n            components. The first component strengthens the\n            government's reform management capacity. The second\n            component privatizes the People's Bank; provides\n            technical assistance for the Asset Management Company;\n            builds the capacity of the non-bank financial regulator;\n            finances the establishment of the Pensions Reform Office,\n            and supports private sector participation in the water\n            sector; finds assistance to the Public Utilities Commission;\n            and finances the regulatory framework for the\n            telecommunications sector. The third component supports the\n            design and implementation of a suitable mass communications\n            strategy. The fourth component establishes and operates the\n            Challenge Fund, which will manage a pool of technical\n            assistance funds that can be flexibly allocated to\n            sub-projects. This Fund will allow the relevant line\n            ministries and government entities to respond flexibly to a\n            dynamic and developing agenda."}, "docdt": "2002-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
