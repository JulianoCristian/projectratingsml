        Technical Assistance Project in Sri Lanka were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned included: the project team\n            took client ownership very seriously, making a real effort\n            to listen to officials and stakeholders and tailoring the\n            project to their needs. In all areas, Sri Lankans called the\n            shots and sought Bank technical advice only when necessary.\n            The project incorporated an unallocated pool of resources,\n            the Challenge Fund. Although initially received with a\n            healthy degree of skepticism, the Challenge Fund has\n            provided space for successive administrations to alter the\n            course of the reforms and still be able to benefit from Bank\n            funding without having to design a new project. It has also\n            helped the Bank respond almost immediately with post-tsunami\n            assistance. Realizing that each administration has a small\n            window of opportunity to push reform initiatives, the Bank\n            committed to a quick turnaround on all Technical Assistance\n            (TA) requests and after initial teething problems was able\n            to come to a two to three day turnaround for all requests.\n            Establishing capacity to handle the procurement and\n            management of more than 100 consultancies in the first two\n            years of operation was critical to success. It also meant\n            that line ministries could focus on management of the reform\n            and leave the administrative aspects to others."}, "docdt": "2008-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
