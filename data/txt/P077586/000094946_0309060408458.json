Economic Reform Technical Assistance\n            Project will strengthen the government's capacity in\n            implementing its reform agenda, which will in turn expand\n            the role of the private sector in the economy, financing and\n            supporting infrastructure development, in the water sector,\n            and communications infrastructure. This would potentially\n            entail wider environmental impacts, associated with both\n            public, and private civil works, and construction. This\n            framework for environmental screening sets the stage to\n            identify environmental problems, and liabilities due to the\n            implementation of the project, to further generate\n            environmental compliance with the national laws. An\n            environmental auditing process - Phase I and II which may be\n            completed concurrently - should finally confirm the presence\n            of specific forms of environmental liability. Phase I\n            identifies site selection, aerial emissions, wastewater\n            discharges, waste storage and disposal, as well as\n            precautions to be taken due to hazardous materials, fire\n            occurrence, and/or occupational health and safety issues.\n            Phase II involve intrusive sampling of environmental issues,\n            such as soils, groundwater and surface waters, and\n            building/insulating materials. While it is anticipated that\n            the auditing process will be sufficient, it is possible\n            however, that significant contamination may occur, in which\n            case a risk assessment may be required. The assessment\n            involves the identification, quantification, and allocation\n            of environmental liabilities. Monitoring criteria will be\n            the responsibility of the implementing agency, based on\n            institutional arrangements for the full compliance with the\n            objectives set within this framework."}, "docdt": "2003-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
