           to provide the Java Grid with 700 MW of peaking capacity.\n            The project will also assist PLN to expand its capabilities\n            in the fields of construction, power market surveys,\n            powersystem planning, and contract management. The project\n            comprises: (a) construction of a storage dam, 97.5 m high,\n            at Saguling on the Citarum River; a 6.5 km long water\n            conductor system comprising tunnels, surgetanks, and\n            penstocks; and a 700 MW powerstation (with 4 generating sets\n            each rated at 175 MW) at Cipanas, with an associated 500 kV\n            step-up substation; (b) provision of the necessary equipment\n            for a PLN construction task force; (c) engineering of the\n            Cirata hydroelectric project including detailed\n            investigations and designs; and (d) consultancy services to\n            assist PLN with: (i) power market surveys; (ii) power system\n            analysis; and (iii) civil works contract management."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
