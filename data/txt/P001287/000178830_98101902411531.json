Project (US$40\n            million, Loan No. 1799-KE of April 25, 1980) are to assure\n            the availability of a firm source of power and energy within\n            the country to meet the growth in demand which could exceed\n            the capacity of the existing facilities in 1984 and, as\n            stated in the Government's Fourth Development Plan\n            1979-1983, to reduce the country's heavy dependence on\n            imported oil. The project is the least costly means of\n            adding to the existing generating facilities to achieve this\n            objective. A further objective is to strengthen the power\n            industry in Kenya by maintaining the power industry's\n            viability through sound institutions and management, and\n            financial powers."}, "docdt": "1983-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
