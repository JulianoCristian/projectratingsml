{"cdata!": "The Second Railway Project consists of\n            two parts: (i) a comprehensive survey of the transport\n            sector in Egypt, and (ii) the further rehabilitation,\n            modernization and increase in capacity of the Egyptian\n            railway system envisaged in the Revised Program for the\n            years 1971/72-1977. The works to be financed under the\n            project consist essentially of continuing improvement of\n            signalling and telecommunications installations, as well as\n            of track relaying on sections of ER's network,\n            acquisition of motive power, rolling stock and road\n            vehicles, the modernization of marshalling yards, workshops\n            and other fixed installations, the reorganization of stores\n            and increase of stocks of essential stores, and of\n            consultancy services and staff training. The items proposed\n            for Bank financing under this project include track\n            materials, and track laying equipment, workshop equipment,\n            signalling and telecommunication equipment and consultancy services."}, "docdt": "1975-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
