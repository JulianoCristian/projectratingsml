"trustfund": "TF026673-PHRD-COLOMBIA: STRUCTURAL\n            FISCAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN (SFAL)", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7092", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The SFAL was designed to support a fiscal\n            reform agenda developed by the Colombian government.\n            Ownership of the reforms was a critical element for the\n            success of the program, ensuring the necessary coordination\n            and long-term commitment to the process. This commitment was\n            even more important given that project implementation\n            spanned two government administrations. The risk that the\n            reform agenda would be marginalized by the new\n            administration was identified in the project document.\n            However, the Uribe administration understood the importance\n            of reform and maintained government commitment to the\n            program. While many of the reforms supported by the SFAL\n            have not been completed during the period of the loan, they\n            have advanced substantially. In the case of the ISS, the\n            SFAL did not fully achieve its goal of developing a\n            sustainable model for the institution. A longer loan period\n            would have provided the on-going support necessary to\n            achieve more progress in this area. Alternatively,\n            subsequent programmatic loans such as the Fiscal\n            Institutional Adjustment Loan (FIAL) I and II could have\n            continued to support reform in this area, but the issue has\n            not been addressed in these subsequent loans. Certain\n            elements of the program were based on quantitative fiscal\n            targets. These targets suffered from two problems given the\n            short-term nature of the loan. Firstly, tranche releases\n            were based on mid-year expenditure figures. As in many\n            countries, spending is back-loaded towards the end of the\n            year, which means that low apparent expenditure at mid-year\n            eventually disappears by year-end. This was the case during\n            the SFAL for Colombia-actual expenditures during the second\n            half of the year were much higher than during the first half\n            of the year. Secondly, conditions in the program used\n            initially budgeted figures rather than actual expenditures.\n            As is often the case, actual expenditures vary considerably\n            when compared with the original budget. Indeed, during the\n            period of the SFAL program there were sizable upward\n            adjustments to initially proposed budgets during the second\n            half of the year."}, "docdt": "2003-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
