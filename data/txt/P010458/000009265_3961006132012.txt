MNMORANDDM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TFE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PtXISTAN
FOR A POWER SECTOR DEVELOQMENT PROJECT
l.        Introduction.  I submit for your approval rhe follow-ing memotandum
and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Islamic Republ±c of Pakastan for
USS230 million equivalent to-help finan.e a Power bectotr Dev}opment, Project.
The loan will be at the Bank's standard variable interez rate with a maturity
of 20 years including five years of grace. Am amount equialent to US$12.0
million wiill be used directly by the Government of Pakistan (G.P1>, ard the
balance equivalent to US$218.0 million, will be onlent to-the water and-Power
Development Authority (WAPDA) at i%t per annum. GOP will bear the foreign
exchange and interest rate risks on the loan.
2.        Sector Backctround.  In the late 1980's, GOP launched a structural
adjustment program to overcome macroeconomic imbalances that had worsened
during the decade, and to improve the country's growth prospects.  Key
objectives of the program are to reduce the fiscal deficti to sustainable
levels, improve the public expenditures allocation and the efficiency of
resource use in various sectors, and increase private seczor participation in
the economic activities. The energy sector is critical to the achievement of
these objectives as it accounts for about 33% ,f public investments. Within
this framework, and in recognition of the need to accelerate the development
of the energy sector, a long-term energy strategy has been formulated. Its
main objectives are to increase energy supply in the country to meet projected
demand at least-cost; increase the efficiency of the energy sector through
demand-side management measures; streamline the sector institutions; and
enhance private sector participation. Since the mid-1980s, energy sector
reforms have been implemented, and progress has been made in each of the areas
mentioned above. In particular, some of the main institutions in the sector
have been restructured, important energy price reforms have been introduced
and the financial performance of the sector has made considerable
improvements.
3.        In spite of these efforts, the development of the energy sector
continues to be constrained by a lack of financial resources and insufficient
implementation capability. As a result, energy supply constraints have
continued, as reflected by the load-shedding (reaching a level of about 25% of
power peak demand in FY93), and gas supply shortages. Recognizing the urgent
need for major changes and to r 3ure that the pace of privatization is
sustained, GOP has decided to complement and reinforce the above approach by
adopting a more comprehensive strategy which aims at further enhancing private
sector involvement in the energy sector, and the restructuring and
privatization program of the main enterprises in the sector.
4.        In line with this strategy, and at the GOP's request; WAPDA
prepared in early 1992, with the assistance of consultants financed by USAID,
a Strategic Plan for the Privatization of the Power Sector. The Strategic
Plan, which was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Privatization on July 18,
1992, outlines the future structure of the power sector in Pakistan in
general, and of WAPDA in particular, and the principal phases for its
implementation.  The approved Strategic Plan envisages that WAPDA would be
corporatized and pa_tially privatized, and that a National Electric Power
Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) would be established. In particular, WAPDA would
retain the major hydropower plants (due primarily to their critical importance
for the operation of the Indus Basin irrigation system). Over time, WAPDA's



2
existir.g thermal plants and distribution system would be sold and, together
with new thermal plants to be built by-the private sector, would create a                 -
-competitive market.  In March 1994, this strategy culminated with the
announcement by GOP of a comprehensive Policy Pramework and Package of
Incentives for Private Sector Power Generation Projects and a Petr1vieum
Policy. The energy policy sets out a vision of areater dependence on market
forces and increased private sector involvement in the sector.  Patti-cular
emphasis is placed on further improving the efticiency of the sectoz through
the implementation of -more aggressive dentand-side maniagement and loss- 
reduction programs; and the introduction of monitorable targets for increasing
the operational efficiency of the main enterprises.  As first critical steps
to the implementation of the policy, an A-mendment to the WAPDA ,Act, to enable
*  AAPDA to be corporatized and partially privatized, was approved by the       -
Parliament on April 27, 1934, and the design of the future NEPRA was approved
by the Cabinet on May 16, 1994.  These important decisions highlight GOP's
commitments to energy sector reform and the privatization process.
5.        The Bank's strategy is to support these initiatives through a
series of lending operations. The proposed Project would further accelerate
the implementation of the restructuring and privatization program in the
sector, particularly WAPDA, and induce the creation of a deregulated market,
whereby public and private sectors compete in the supply and distribution of
electricity. A proposed Private Sector E.nergy Development mund II would
continue supporting private sector power generation projects under limited
recourse financing. This facility will also sustain the implementation of the
Hub Project, which is ciitical to the success of GOP's strategy for private
sector involvement in the energy sector.
6.        Lessons from Previous Bank Operations.  The Bank Group has financed
26 operations in the energy sector Jncluding nine credits/loans to WAPDA. With
regard to the operations with WA?DA, ..ix have been completed and the remaining
three are being imp'smented satisfactorily after initial delays. The Project
Completion Reports for various projects concluded that these projects not only
enhanced the supply of electricity, but also improved all aspects of WfAPDA's
operations including administrative, technical and financial maragement.
However, all the projects have encountered difficulties in the early stages of
their implementation mainly due to delays in GOP's approval of Project Concepc
documents (PCls), slow pace of procurement as well as periodic scarcity of
local funds. Furthermore, despite the efforts developed by WAPDA in itmproving
its operational and managerial performance, progress has been slow, and much
remains to be done. The lessons learned from these operations have had an
important bearing on the design of the proposed Project, particularly as
regards the need to. (a) restructure the power sector to achieve the objective
of increased involvement of the private enterprises in power development; (b)
obtain in a timely manner, GOP's approval of the initial PCls, necessary to
initiate project implementation; (c) accelerate WAPDA's procurement process;
and (d) imaintain WIAPDA's self-financing capability. Furthermore, and based on
lessons learned from Bank operations in other countries, there is a need for a
strong commitment from the Government to the restructuring and privatization
program to ensure its successful implementation. This has also been an
important consideration in the design of the proposed Project.
'1.       Proiect Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed Prcject are to:
(a) set the stage for a gradual and orderly privatization of the power sector
in general and WAPDA in particular through the implementation of the approved



-3-
Strategic Plan; (b) support WAPDA's investment program, wh.ich would minimize
the country's chronic shortage of electricity at least cost, while further
enhancing demand-side management measures; (c) enhance resource mobilization
ax-d the operational efficiency, autonomy and accountability of the power
sector enterprises; and (d) strengthen the environmental assessment and
mitigation capabilities within -tha sector.
S.        Proiect Desbription.  The proposed Profect would include the
following: (a) a restucturia/privatization c*ompone_t involving the
implementation of the Strategic Plar. which includes- inter Llia: Ci) the
reorganization and corporatization of WAPDA into a holding commany witlF
decentralized power generation, transmission and distribution subsidiaries
operating as discrete autonomous profit centers; (ii) the establishment of a
National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRAl to set standards and
regulate a largely'privately-owned and operated power sdector; (iii) the
adoption of a pricing policy which would provide the incentives needed to
support the proposed Project's privatization objectives; (iv) the devo'lopment
of a manpower transition program that would allow the privatization of the
power sector to occur in a manner that provides adequate management
flexibility to the private sector while addressing the concerns of labor; and
(v) the initial offering for sale to the private sector of parts of WAPDA's
assets; (b) an investment component involving the implemnentation of a four
year (1995-1998) time-slice of WAPDA's investment program, while improvir.o .-
reliability of the s:'stem in order to make it more attractive to r-ivate
investors; and (c} a technical assistance component involving co:  .ting
services and training for (a) and (b) above, and for strengthening WAPDA's
environmental assessment capability.
9.        The Bank's loan would be made to GOP which will utilize US$12
million to finance the cost of the technical assistance component for: (a)
management of the privatization program; (b) tne establishment of NEPRA; (c)
the development and adoption of the new pricing policy; (d) the development of
a manpower transition program; and (e) investment banking/financial advisory
services required for the sale of assets. The balance, equivalent to US$218
million, will be onlent to WAPDA at 11% per annum. WAPDA will utilize these
proceeds for financing part of the cost of an agreed sectoral investment
program, namely the expansion of the transmission and distribution network,
and for consultancy services required for establishing existing facilities as
autonomous subsidiaries/profit centers, and strengthening the utility's
environmental capability. Given WAPDA's divestiture program, the facilities
being funded under the proposed Loan could be sold to the private sector. In
this event, proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would either continue to De
utilized by the purchaser under the same terms and conditions (see para 12) or
reallocated to finance other needed transmission and distribution facilities.
10.       Prolect Implementation.  The proposed Project would be implemented
by WAPDA, with the exception of the restructuring and privatization program,
which would be implemented by GOP. A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B.
Expenditures amounting to a maximum of US$5.0 million, which would be incurred
after October 1, 1993, would be eligible for retroactive financing. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report is being distributed separately.
11.       Environmental and Resettlement Aspects.  In addition to
strengthening WAPDA's capability to carry out environmental and resettlement



4-
activities, the proposed Project would also assist the agency in undertaking a
sectoral environmental assessment of all its existing facilities to identify
environmental problems, recommend mitigating measures, and establish
timetables for their implementation.  AS the proceeds from. the proposed Bank
loan would finance only expansion and rehabilitation of WAPDA's transmission
and distribution infrastructure ar-d not generation, no significant nec,aive
imrpact on the environmert and no -invcltantary resettlement issues, are expected.
Accordingly, the proposed Project has been rated -B.
12.       Aqreed Actions.   During negotiati-ons, agreements were reached: (a)
with GOP and WAPDA on: (i) the design and timetable for implementing the
components ot the Strategic Plan withirn the project implementation period;
(ii) annual reviews with the Baik, within the context of the overall
macroeconomic framework, of WAPDA's investment program and related financing
plan, the content of wnich would have to be satisfactory to the Bank, (ii-i)
irclus.on in the proposed Project of the financial covenants related to WAPDA
and agreed under ongoing operations; (iv) a major mid-term review to be
carried out jointly with the Bank, to assess overall progress in the execution
of tie proposed Project, with particular attention to the restructuring anid
privatization component; and (v) Bank's concurrence prior to the sale of any
of WAPDA's assets, as required by the legal agreements under ongoing Bank
projects, and necessary undertakings from the purchaser of WAPDA's divested
assets in a form satisfactory to the Bank to ensure that proceeds of ongoing
Bank loan for such assets shall continue to be utilized under the original
terms and conditions; and (b) with vAPDA to: (i) carry out a distribution
system e-Jagnostic study, and a sectoral environmental assessment study to
identify and recommend various mitigation measures; and (ii) complete the
detailed design of the Project cornpcaents to be funded by the proposed loan in
a timely manner. As conditions for effectiveness: (i) the requiLed
legislation for the establishment of NEPRA will need to have been submitted to
the Parliament; and (ii) the subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOP and WAPDA,
satisfactory to the Bank will need to have been executed.
13.       Country Assistance Stratecy and Rationale for Bank Involvement.
The Country Assistance Strategy, which the Executive Directors discussed on
March 31, 1994, highlights two closely linked development goals as the primary
focus of the Bank's program in Pakistan, namely poverty reduction and reducing
constraints to sustained growth. To address the poverty reduction objective,
the Bank's approach focuses on improving inadequate basic social services and
so improving weak social indicators. To support the growth objective, which
will help with the income-related aspe-cs of poverty reduction, Bank efforts
concentrate on: structural reforms, with an emphasis on public finance issues
and improving the enabling environment for the private sector; strengthening
inadequate basic infrastructure; raducing constraints on agliculture
productivity; and protecting Pakistan's natural resources base.  Also, several
Bank projects, particularly those related to small-scale agricultural
activities. microenterprises, and water supply infrastructure, contribute
directly to addressing poverty problems. The proposed Project supports the
GOP's on-going structural reform program, with particular emphasis on: (a)
rationalizing the development of the energy sector; (b) restructuring and
privatizing WAPDA in an orderly, equitable, and efficient manner; (c)
mobilizing private sector resources and expertise in the sector; and (d)
further promoting energy efficiency and conservation. The proposed Project
bu..lds on long years of Bank involvement with WAPDA and is in line with the
Bank's new energy sector lending policy.  It is a hioh priority project for
the Government as it directly supports two key objectives, namely reducing the
chronic shortage of electricity and initiating the restructuring of WAPDA and
the privatization of most of its operations. The proposed Project directly



supports the private sector development, growth, and infrastructure
strengthening objectives of the Bank's program and is therefore fully
consistent with the Country Assistalice Strategy.
14.       Senefits.   The economic rate of return. (ERRI is basei on the
incremental cost and benefit streams associated wit)' hAPDA's least-cost
investment ptogram for FY'94-99, of whi'h the proposed Project forms an
integral part. Measurable costs-include the capital and operating costs
associated with the investmient program. while measutable benefits are derived
from the incremental sales of electricity which wduld either substitute fbr
other.less-efficiernt fuels or satisfy unmet energy needs.  when WAPDA's          -
tariffs are used as a conservative loroxy for the value of these inrcreinental
sales, -the calculated ERR is about 12%.  However, this understates the. true
economic merit of the program, as the value of electricity service in Pakistan
* is considerably higher than the rateL. at which it is sold. When the
measurable consumer cost of mitigating the power shortages is taken into
account, the ERR is about 32%. In addition, considerable benefits are
expected from the implementation of the restructuring program by way of
increased reliability of supply, reduced amount of unserved energy, improved
operational and managerial efficiency of the power sector in general and WAPDA
in particular, through enhanced managerial autonomy and accountability, the
introduction of a comprehensive and efficient regulatory framework, and reform
of the pricing regime.
15.       Risks.  The principal risks of the proposed Project are delays in
the implementation of the restructuring and privatization program, which could
arise on two accounts: (a) political risks whereby the Government and WAPDA
may be unwilling to proceed with the privatization program as planned; and (b)
market risks wherein the divestiture/sale of parts o£ WAPDA's infrastructure
may not be accomplished successfully because of inadequate response from the
markets to the offer for sale of assets. The Government's commitment to the
proposed reform program (para 4), and the preparatory work already completed
suggests that the former risk has.been reduced to an acceptable level. The
latter is a standard commercial risk associated with all privatization
programs, which has been minimized by the provision in the proposed Project -
for international financial advisory and underwriting services. Nevertheless,
even if the anticipated privatization through divestiture/sale of assets is
not accomplished, the benefits resulting from the restructuring and
corporatization program and the establishment of NEPRA would offset part of
the risks associated with the Government's inability to privatize parts of
WAPDA's infrastructure. Another major risk of the operation would be delays
in the implementation of the investment program and in the mobilization of the
corresponding local financing requirements. stewming from the macroeconomic
uncertainty. The high priority given by GOP to the power sector, the
preparatory work already completed and the agreement on annual reviews of the
iv,vestment program and related financing plans within the context of the
overall macroeconomic framework, are designed to minimize such risk.
16.       Recommendation. 'I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
