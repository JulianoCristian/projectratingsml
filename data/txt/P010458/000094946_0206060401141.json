A number of lessons address\n            issues, both on the restructuring and privatization program,\n            as well as on the investment component. The restructuring\n            and reform program could not have been implemented without\n            the full commitment of the Government, which in the absence\n            of, the management of reforms and the pace of restructuring\n            suffered initially. Specifically, ambitious restructuring,\n            reforms, and privatization, require specialized skills which\n            were lacking; however, the technical assistance component,\n            and local staff willingness to acquire skills contributed to\n            satisfactory outcomes. Conversely, the reform program,\n            should be viewed as an integrated set of policies; however,\n            financial viability and measures to mitigate adversity were\n            not accorded adequate priority, thus resulting in financial\n            repercussions on the utilities, risking also the\n            macroeconomic stabilization program. As for privatization of\n            utilities, the diverse and conflicting objectives of\n            interest groups, require a policymaking Government role,\n            setting priorities, particularly in implementing information\n            dissemination campaigns to build an acceptance privatization\n            program. The absence of it, derived in potential benefits\n            remaining fairly adverse. Finally, the investment component\n            should have ensured compliance with acceptable efficiency,\n            and least cost-criteria, which highlights the importance of\n            realistic assumptions at appraisal, basing estimates in a\n            range of scenarios to accommodate potential risks."}, "docdt": "2002-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
