project was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned are: 1) the same\n            agency should be responsible for planning, implementation,\n            and O&M (operations & maintenance) of infrastructure\n            scheme where possible. 2) Institutional arrangements for\n            O&M of infrastructure systems should be put in place as\n            early as possible, but no later than completion of\n            construction. 3) In order to achieve sustainable\n            institutional development through technical assistance,\n            institutional components should be demand-driven; terms of\n            reference must be prepared by the Borrower; consultant\n            selection should be finalized before credit effectiveness;\n            and specific milestones should be defined for both physical\n            and institutional components of a project. 4) Improving\n            solid waste management must be given high priority. 5)\n            Effective coordination is essential with other agencies as\n            well as non-participating agencies. 6) The project design\n            must be kept simple. 7) Involvement of local\n            consultant/staff is important. 8) Involvement of community\n            and nongovernmental organizations should be sought. 9)\n            Private sector participation should be considered as\n            alternative means of service delivery. 10) Monitoring\n            indicators must be realistic. 11) It is necessary to require\n            stricter audit and procurement practice."}, "docdt": "1998-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
