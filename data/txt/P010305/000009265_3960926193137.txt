MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATION4AL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKLSTAN
FOR A PUNJAB URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit for approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed credit of SDR 65.9 million (US$90.0 million equivalent) to
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on standard IDA terms with 35 years matur-
ity to help finance a Punjab Urban Development Project. The proceeds of
the credit would be passed on to the Government of Punjab (GoPunjab) on
standard IDA terms, and in turn to seven beneficiary agencies at 11% annual
interest for revenue-earning investments, 4% for non revenue-earning
investments, and as grants for training, technical assistance and institu-
tional strengthening measures. The Overseas Development Administration
(ODA) of the United Kingdom is expected to participate through parallel
grant financing of US$19.9 million equivalent, which will be passed on as a
grant to GoPunjab, and by GoPunjab to the Lahore Water and Sanitation
Agency (WASA) on the same terms as the IDA credit.
Ba¢,kgrud
2.       Pakistan's urban population of 31 million (31% of the total) has
been growing at 4.1% annually on average since 1972, which is twice the
rural population growth rate. Urban economic activities are estimated to
contribute over 60% of GDP; value added in urban production has grown at an
estimated 7% annually since 1972. High economic growth has been achieved
without a corresponding increase in public investment and domestic resource
mobilization, resulting in deteriorating and inadequate physical and social
infrastructure. The provision of shelter, urban infrastructure and essen-
tial urban services has not kept pace with the population growth in the
principal cities of Karachi and Lahore and in the smaller but economically
important Punjab cities.  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) has initiated a
policy aiming to achieve sustained economic growth through selective invest-
ment in improved urban infrastructure and shelter-related services for
meeting basic needs, together with strategies for improving urban manage-
ment and resource mobilization.
3.       The Punjab is the most populous of Pakistan's four provinces,
having over 55% of the total urban population; 17 million (30%) of its
56 million inhabitants live in urban areas. GoPunjab has identified and,
with IDA and ODA assistance, prepared an investment program for Lahore and
the other three principal Punjab cities, Gujranwala, Sialkot and Multan,
to improve urban management and services while enhancing municipal revenues.

Rationale for IDA Involvement
4.       The objectives of the Bank's urban assistance strategy in Pakistan
are to: (a) help develop aid support policies for efficient and equitable
urban development; (b) assist in strengthening the framework for economic
development through strengthening urban development institutions and
services, particularly urban infrastructure; (c) improve local resource
mobilization and cost recovery in these institutions; (d) improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of their resource utilization; and (e) allevi-
ate poverty and protect the environment. The achievement cf these objec-
tives requires long-term involvement and support by IDA, for which it
proposes to follow a three-phase strategy. In the first phase, IDA has
established working relationships with sectoral institutions. Through
projects underway in Lahore (Cr. 1348-PAK) and Karachi (Cr. 1652-PAK),
which became effective in 1984 and 1986 respectively, IDA is financing
low-cost approaches to the provision of sites and services and slum upgrad-
ing, urban services infrastructure, and housing finance, and has an ongoing
policy dialogue. In the second Dhase, through the proposed Punjab urban
project, IDA would focus on broader policy questions of cost recovery and
resource mobilization, emphasize institution building and strengthening,
and initiate pilot schemes in intermediate Punjab cities. In the third
phase, IDA would seek .o provide exp4nded support for urban development
through sector lending at the provincial and national levels. The proposed
project would incorporate lessons learned from earlier lending operations.
5.       The project is an integral part of IDA's strategy for providing
infrastructure services essential for industrial and economic growth.
Lahore is Pakistan's second largest city (population about 3.7 million),
and together with the other large cities in the Punjab plavq a central role
in the country's economy. Investments and policy changes .or these cities
would have widespread impact. A lending operation for the cities focusing
on selective investments and supporting policy would contribute to GOP's
development goals. Improving the management of urban institutions, mobiliz-
ing local resources, establishing effective cost recovery systems, and
extending basic services to cities and towns outside the Punjab4s major
metropolitan area will require long-term efforts and sustained support from
both the Federal Government and IDA.
Project Objectives
6.       The overall objective of the project is to assist GoPunjab to pro-
vide Lahore and the three major intermediate Punjab cities with financing
to strengthen their framework for economic growth and development through
improved municipal management and resource mobilization, to improve urban
services and the quality of life and productive capacity of the urban poor
while protecting the urban environment. Specifically the project aims to:
(a) improve the technical, financial and management performance of the key
urban institutions in Lahore, and strengthen local government in the
Punjab; (b) improve local resource mobilization and cost recovery, and
achieve more efficient and effective resource utilization; (c) demonstrate
the value of coordinated area upgrading; (d) meet basic shelter and service
needs of the underprivileged while also contributing to improved urban
environmental management; and (e) prepare the framework for a future Punjab
intermediate cities project.

Project Description
7.       The project will finance priority investments of the GoPunjab
urban development program, and will comprise three groups of components:
(a) for Lahore: (i) upgrading of local urban services and conservation of
cultural assets in 130 ha within the Walled City, and area upgrading of
local urban services in 415 ha of low-rise developments in North East
Lahore, to benefit 250,000 people; (ii) city-wide incremental investments
*          to improve, rehatilitate and extend water supply, sewerage, sewage treat-
ment, stormwater drainage and road maintenance; (iii) traffic, road safety
and bus services improvement and support; (b) for three intermediate Punjab
cities, Gujranwala, Sialkot and Multan, area and Walled City upgrading of
190 ha to benefit 50,000 people, and investment studies; and (c) training
and technical assistance for improvements in the municipal finance and
property tax systems; project management; sector institution training and
strengthening; and preparation of future investments in the Punjab cities.
Equipment and technical assistance for water supply, sewerage and sewage
treatment would be financed by ODA. The project would be implemented over
an eight-year period beginning in FY88. The total project cost is esti-
mated at US$145.2 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$47.1 million.  The anA l project expenditure would represent about 25%
of annual urban development expenditures for Lahore, and an average of 20%
for the other cities. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement, the allocations
of the IDA Credit and ODA financing, and the IDA Credit disbursement sche-
dule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project events and the
stat.s of Bank Group operations in Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map showing the location of the project cities is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report (Report No. 7018-PAK) dated March 11,
1988 is being circulated separately.
Agreed Actions
8.       Agreements were obtained during the credit negotiations with the
Government of Pakistan and GoPunjab that:
(a)    the Lahore Water and Sanitation Agency's (WASA) water and
sewerage tariffs will be adjusted according to an agreed
program such that (i) through anrual tariff increases by
approximately equal annual percentages through FY91, WASA
will achieve in FY91, and subsequently maintain, at least a
3.51 rate of return on revalued fixed assets in operation;
(ii) WASA's capital would be restructured by converting to
equity by end FY88 at least 331 of WASA's long-term debt;
ar.d (iii) from FY92 onwards, the tariffs will on average be
adjusted annually by the amount of the percentage increase
in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) during the previous year
plus a minimum of 7.52, to enable WASA to reach a positive
cash position by FY95, and to contribute from its earnings
at least 10% in FY96 and 20% thereafter of its annual
capital investment requirements;



- 4 -
(b)    GoPunjab will prepare 'nd implement, before end-FY89, a
program to ensure WASA has the proper authority to carry
out day-to-day operations; and
(c)    a dated program satisfactory to the Association to enhance
water and sewerage charges will be implemented in
Gujranwala, Sialkot and Multan when project implementation
is underway which will aim to achieve full cost recovery.
9.       Conditions for effectiveness of the Credit Agreement are: (a) the
signing of Subsidiary Loan Agreemente between Government of Punjab and LDA,
WASA, LMC, MDA, GMC and SMC; and (b) fulfillment of &ll conditions prece-
dent to the effectiveness of the funding agreement with ODA.
Benefits
10.      Quantifiable benefits from investments in infrastructure improve-
metnts and area upgrading will include incremental revenues from water and
sewerage; equivalent rental income, and property tax revenue from area
upgrading; savings in vehicle user costs and time from road rehabilitation,
traffic and transport investments; and savings in property and road main-
tenance costs, vehicle user costs and sewage pumping costs from stormwater
drainage investments. The project investments in road rehabilitation and
traffic engineering will have an economic rate of return of over 50S, in
stormwater drainage 222, in area development 17%, and in water supply and
sewerage about 11. The average project-wide economic rate of return where
quantifiable is 20S.
11.      Non-quantifiable benefits ir.clude more equitable water and sewer
service charges, improvements in property tax management extending local
resource mobilization to groups benefiting from but not now paying for
services and preservation of cultural assets. Area and Walled City
upgrading in Lahore will improve living standards, environmental quality
and productivity for 250,000 peoole. The project investments in the three
intermediate cities will provide GoPunjab with a base from which to
undertake a future province-wide development program, while meeting short
term shelter and industrial infrastructure needs and strengthening city
management. The main beneficiaries of area upgrading investments will be
low income groups, mainly women and children. The project will contribute
to poverty alleviation while enhancing economic growth, and will produce
widespread improvements to the urban environment and quality of life.
Risks
12.      The project's principal risks are the slower than anticipated
buildup of implementation capacity of the executing agencies and their
inability to achieve cost recovery. The project would minimize these risks
by providing (a) technical assistance in preparing and implementing area
upgrading schemes; (b) measures to strengthen and modernize financial



- 5 -
management in the project cities; and (c) measures and resources for
improving technical performance, local resource mobiiization. and cost
recovery of key urban institutions in the project cities. GoPunjab and the
municipal corporations may, for political reasons, be unable or unwilling
to levy increased water supply and sewerage tariffs. Assurances were
obtained that the authorities are committed to making the needed tariff
adjustments; tariff increases of between 30P and 801 have already been
implemented by the Lahore WASA from January 1988 which indicates GoPunjab's
ability and willingness to enforce further phased increeses.
Recommendation
13.      I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association, ant I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
