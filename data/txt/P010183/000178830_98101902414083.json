 are to strengthen the capacity of local institutions in\n            Lahore to prepare and implement integrated urban development\n            programs which will arrest the decay in urban living\n            conditions, improve municipal services and develop\n            strategies to cope with continuing urban growth,\n            particularly the delivery of services and shelter to the\n            urban poor. To achieve these objectives the project would\n            include: (i) integrated physical components including\n            upgrading of existing facilities and provision of sites and\n            services schemes; and (ii) training and technical assistance\n            to strengthen the institutions responsible for planning,\n            implementing, and operating municipal services, to enable\n            them to replicate similar schemes on a larger scale in the future."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
