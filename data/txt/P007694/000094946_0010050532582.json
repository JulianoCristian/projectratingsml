The probability that project benefits will be\n            sustained is high. World Bank and Borrower performances were\n            satisfactory overall. Key lessons learned related to program\n            support, flow of funds, credit lines, and the External\n            Panel. The project supported an on-going program to which\n            the government had demonstrated its commitment at the\n            federal and local levels. This gave considerable assurance\n            that the project would be implemented. Arrangements to\n            provide funds to implementing agencies should have been in\n            place prior to loan signing or Board presentation. Moreover,\n            if the Environmental Trust Fund were provided with a\n            reliable permanent source of funds, it would provide greater\n            assurance that key public environmental investments would be\n            carried out and program benefits would be sustained. Project\n            implementation was delayed by the decision to limit credit\n            line operations to BANOBRAS to finance taxes and minibuses\n            even though the National Finance Institution had begun a\n            program to finance taxis and had developed an extensive\n            group of financial intermediaries through which to channel\n            resources for this purpose. The External Panel was a great\n            success, providing the government and the Bank with expert\n            advice and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2000-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
