for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was highly likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial; and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that the critical\n            strategic question faced by the project was how could the\n            process of reforms be started in a country where the\n            government lacked experience with a market economy? The\n            project responded with a strategy of across-the-board\n            reforms, which necessarily involved complexity in the number\n            of components and implementing agencies. Institutional\n            analysis and strategy should, however, be an essential part\n            of development of an institution-building technical\n            assistance project. In this case the institutional analysis\n            would likely have suggested additional ways to bolster\n            implementation capacity. Institutional analysis should\n            include an examination of whether needed authority resides\n            in the implementation agency to enforce compliance by line\n            ministries. A traditional lesson is that borrower commitment\n            and capability are the critical factors in the success of\n            Technical Assistance (TA) projects. Flexible design in TA\n            projects requires intensive and experienced supervision,\n            because it requires continuous dialogue at high levels of\n            government, inter alia, to convince Borrowers on the value\n            and benefits of technical assistance, anticipate changes\n            needed, and interact on the substantive issues for which the\n            technical assistance is provided. Continuity of project\n            management and of IDA supervision greatly facilitated proper\n            implementation. The Bank maintained one unit and task team\n            leader for the project in its final four years. Continuity\n            in Project Implementation Unit (PIU) management was equally\n            important. Institution building takes substantially longer\n            to effect than commonly assumed. If necessary, it should be\n            supported over a series of projects."}, "docdt": "2004-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
