MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE AZERBAUIAN REPUBLIC
FOR AN INSTITUIMON BUILDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed IDA Credit to Azerbaijan for SDR11.5 million (the equivalent of US$18.0 million) to help
finance institution building activities. The Credit would be on standard IDA terms, repayable over
35 years. This project is consistent with the Association's initial Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
included in the Memorandum of the President for the Petroleum Technical Assistance Project
approved by the Board on April 20, 1995.
2.           Azerbaijan joined the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on
September 18, 1992, and the IDA on March 31, 1995. A Country Economic Memorandum (CEM)
was issued in July 1993. An Energy Sector Review was issued in December 1993.
1. Country Background
Policy Priorities During the Transition
3.           The major task confronting the Government in the immediate future is to stabilize the
economy and to undertake a comprehensive program of structural reforms to create the conditions for
sustainable growth. On the stabilization front, the authorities have reached understandings with the
IMF on a program which could be supported under the IMF's Systemic Transformation Facility. The
main elements of the ambitious stabilization program would be: (a) the unification of the exchange
rate; (b) a fiscal adjustment which would bring the budget deficit down to 4.5 percent of GDP in
1995; and (c) a monetary program compatible with these fiscal objectives. As a result of the
understandings reached with the IMF on an STF program, the Government aims to reduce the
monthly rate of inflation to 5 percent by the middle of the year, and to 2 percent by the end of 1995,
compared with an average increase of 29 percent in 1994.
Structural Reform Program
4.           Price Liberalization: The Government has also begun to take measures to accelerate
structural reforms. It has liberalized all prices including bread, other than energy. Prices of oil and
oil products were raised to 50 percent of world levels in February 1995, and are to be raised further
in March and June 1995 to 66 percent and 100 percent of border prices. Price regulation will be
limited to natural monopolies.
5.           Trade Liberalization: The system of domestic trade has been liberalized through the
abolition of state orders on January 1, 1995. The procurement related to the Government's own
needs is to be carried out at market prices. It has unified the exchange rate and eliminated the
implicit taxation of strategic exports resulting from the differentiated surrender requirements at below



- 2 -
market rates. It removed at the end of March 1995 all quotas and licensing requirements for imports
and exports except for energy products. The export of energy products will be subject to licensing
until July 1995, when it is expected to be abolished. The state dominance in foreign trade will be
significantly reduced, including elimination of government imports of grain. This should help the
private sector to play a vital role in foreign trade.
6.            Privatization: The Government has decided to speed up the privatization of
enterprises. Although the Government adopted a law on privatization in 1993, no program was
adopted to implement the law.
7.            Recognizing the importance of having an appropriate institutional framework to
implement a comprehensive privatization program, the Government decided to strengthen the State
Property Committee and appointed a deputy prime minister responsible for the program. The
Governmnent has prepared a comprehensive new privatization program, which has been discussed
with the Association. It is expected to be submitted to Parliament for approval in June 1995. While
the details of is implementation are still being worked out, the proposal under consideration is
ambitious covering almost all small enterprises and most large and medium enterprises. It would
result in the privatization of approximately two-thirds of state assets in the productive sector in the
first stage of the program (1995-1998).
8.            Private Sector Development: Private sector development is an integral part of the
Government's economic transformation strategy. Given the inefficiencies and precarious financial
difficulties in the state-owned enterprises, the rapid development of the private sector is essential for
arresting the sharp decline in the economy and for the resumption of economic growth. The
development of the private sector will also help absorb the redundant labor currently employed in the
state-owned sector, which is likely to increase significantly with privatization and enterprise
restructuring, thus softening the impact of the transition on the population. In addition, a well-
functioning private sector will create the much needed competition to the state-owned sector.
9.            The Government realizes that the private sector in Azerbaijan has developed slowly,
partly as a result of the general political and economic difficulties in the country, but more
importantly because of the slow pace of privatization, the unequal access to credit and real estate for
private enterprises and the lack of a conducive legal and regulatory framework. To actively promote
private sector development, the Government has already taken a number of initial measures to
increase the resources available to private enterprises and to create a level playing field for the private
commercial banks.
10.          Until now, commercial real estate has been very limited for the private sector, mainly
because most commercial real estate has been in the hands of state-owned enterprises. During the
privatization and corporatization process, state-owned enterprises will be encouraged to spin off real
estate and other assets and provisions will also be made for the sale of individual assets of state-
owned enterprises in the privatization program. The Government is currently drafting the Law on
Land Privatization and will submit it to the Parliament by June 30, 1995. New legislation and
amendments to existing legislation will be introduced which will allow the free transfer and
mortgaging of residential and commercial real estate. The Government will set up a proper system of
titling , property registration and cadastre arrangements by the end of 1995. Also in the future, the
Government will undertake a comprehensive review of the current regulatory framework for private
sector development. Based on the findings, a major deregulation initiative will be launched to remove



the barriers to entry and establish simple, open procedures for registration with a minimum of special
licensing. Legislation will also be introduced to establish effective and independent systems
(including voluntary arbitration) for the resolution of disputes, the enforcement of contracts and the
protection of legal rights.
11.          The Government recognizes that the current system of registration and regulation is
cumbersome and represents a serious obstacle to the rapid development of private enterprises. The
goal of the Government is to create a simplified and streamlined registration system for new
businesses and to establish a simple and transparent regulatory framework. The Government has to
undertake a comprehensive review of the current regulatory framework for private sector
development, to initiate major deregulation to remove the barriers to entry, to establish simple, open
procedures for registration and to establish effective and independent systems for the resolution of
disputes, the enforcement of contracts and the protection of legal rights.
12.          Competition and Anti-Monopoly Policies: The Government also intends to focus its
policy on two equally important aspects: promoting competition and preventing and punishing the
abuse of monopoly power.
13.          The Government has included in the privatization program measures to ensure the
breakup of monopolies, especially administrative ones, in the course of corporatization and
privatization. In the farm and agro-processing sector, the Government will actively promote
competition during the corporatization and privatization process, including discouraging the vertical
integration and cross-ownership of the farms and agro-processing enterprises, which would limit the
freedom of entry and competition.
14.          The role of State Committee on Anti-monopoly Policy and the Support for
Entrepreneurship will be changed from emphasis upon ex ante price regulation to the prevention and
the ex post punishment for the abuse of monopoly power, and to introduce measures for natural
regulation of monopolies, and to govern merges acquisitions and holding companies.
15.          Legal Framework: Although Azerbaijan Republic has taken some steps and enacted
several laws to support a market economy, major gaps and inconsistencies pervade the legal
framework necessary for commercial activities, including privatization, to flourish. The lack of clear
legal rules in many critical areas has emerged as a major constraint to economic development in the
newly independent states of the FSU, including Azerbaijan. To encourage a sound environment for
commercial activities and development of the private sector, the authorities recognize it is crucial that
the legal framework provide clear and predictable rules concerning: (1) commercial law, including
company law, contract law, banking laws, and the related rules governing settlement of commercial
disputes; (2) property rights; (3) market entry and exit; and (4) trade and competition to inhibit
monopolistic practices.
16.          Financial Sector Reform: The financial system in Azerbaijan consists of a central
bank, four large specialized state banks, a large number of commercial banks and insurance
companies. With a view to increasing competition, the banking law initially set a low level of capital
requirement for commercial banks. This resulted in a mushrooming of such banks, which used to be
largely owned by public enterprises, and which acted as conduits for channelling central bank
refinancing at negative real interest rates. The ownership structure of newly established commercial
banks has been diversified recently. The Government recognizes the important role the financial



- 4 -
sector will have to play both in the stabilization efforts and in private sector development, and it has
requested the IDA's assistance in developing a strategy for financial sector reform. That strategy
would include the establishment of accounting and auditing standards, prudential regulations,
strengthening the capacity of the Central Bank to supervise commercial banks and more importantly
restructuring and/or liquidation of some of the state banks.
17.          Social Protection: Azerbaijan inherited the FSU system of social protection
concentrated on low administered prices for main household expenditure items, full employment, free
medical services, child allowances, and allowances for particular events (funerals, child birth,
maternity, sick leave and stay in sanatoria). The authorities recognize that the system is in many
ways incompatible with a market economy (reliance on price controls and full employment) and has
failed to prevent the appearance of poverty during the recession. Particularly the lack of targeting has
undermined the Government's ability to secure minimum benefit levels for those most at risk.
18.          Pending measures to improve the assessment of social safety net needs in Azerbaijan
include a well-defined minimum consumption basket and assess informal sector incomes on the
household level, authorities have few choices but to limit social protection to easily identifiable
vulnerable groups such as non-working pensioners, families with two or more children, the
unemployed, and displaced persons.
19.          In the area of old age security, the Government is faced with the task of restoring
badly eroded income replacement levels for poor, non-working pensioners, but also to reduce payroll
taxes amounting to 35 percent for employers (25 percent in agriculture) plus 1 percent for workers.
Improvements are to be financed through increased collections and tighter benefit rules.
20.          In 1994, only 20 percent of the registered unemployed received unemployment
benefits. The average benefit amounted to only 13 percent of the average wage as benefits were fixed
on the basis of historical incomes and then allowed to erode quickly with inflation until reaching the
floor established by the minimum wage. The central measure intended on the benefit side is the
adjustment of the minimum unemployment benefit to the level of the minimum pension in the second
half of 1995. This involves maintaining unemployment benefits at 30 percent of the average wage.
A particular concern relates to the possible strong increase in long-term unemployment. The need for
further measures will be studied, including possibilities for social assistance or lengthening the period
of eligibility for unemployment compensation beyond the present 6 months.
21.           Imrlementation and Capacity Building:  Azerbaijan's ability to implement a credible
reform program at an accelerated pace and to implement IDA projects is crucially dependent upon
strengthening its institutional capacity to design and implement such a program, and improving the
internal coordination of its economic policy-making units. The Petroleum Technical Assistance Credit
approved by the Board on April 20, 1995 and the proposed Institution Building Technical Assistance
projects are designed to assist the Government with provision of resources aimed at developing such
capacity. Besides these specific technical assistance projects, the IDA will continue to strengthen
management capacity in specific areas in individual projects.
22.           The Government has requested the Association to support its structural reform efforts
through a Rehabilitation Credit. This operation is under preparation. The Institution Building
Technical Assistance Project would assist the Government in the formulation and implementation of
reform measures in the areas to be supported by the proposed Rehabilitation Credit.



II. The Project
Project Objectives
23.           The Association's objectives under the proposed operation are twofold: (a) in the
short term, to provide support to the Government in formulating and implementing reforms to move
to a market-oriented system; and (b) in the medium term, to provide support for institutional building
and domestic capacity to ensure that Azerbaijan has the capability to implement and sustain reforms.
By providing support to the development and implementation of reforms in key areas, this project will
contribute to the acceleration of reforms. Both the Government and the Association view the
technical assistance under this project as a substitute for skill shortages and inadequate local expertise
during a limited period of time while local capacities are being developed. This is in line with the
Association's strategy to assist Azerbaijan in its transition to a market economy.
Project Description
The Project would assist Azerbaijan in the following areas:
A.    Privatization and Enterprise Reforms: Under this component, assistance will
be provided to the State Property Committee to: (a) develop a strategy for, and assist in the
implementation of, privatization of medium and large enterprises, to address public enterprise reform
issues, including corporate governance and information systems design on a long term and short term
basis, and to develop the framework for capital markets; (b) provide equipment and goods to establish
a basic financial data base on enterprises, to facilitate a mass privatization program using vouchers,
and to expedite taking stock of the privatization as it is implemented; (c) assist with training and study
tours that will allow the staff of the State Privatization Committee to become familiar with models of
privatization methods in other countries and to develop their own model appropriate for Azerbaijan;
(d) design and implement information programs to disseminate information about the privatization
program and its features, and to ensure active public support and participation; and (e) develop an
institutional and legal framework for the development of capital markets. The assistance will also
include clarifying environmental liability in privatization of medium and large enterprises.
B.    Strengthening Macro-Economic Management: The proposed assistance will
help: (a) the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to improve its capacity to formulate, monitor and implement
the budget systems in line with the needs of a market-oriented economy. It complements the technical
assistance provided by the IMF to strengthen the treasury operations in the MOF, and will provide
computer equipment to obtain timely information on budget implementation and to control the budget
deficit; (b) the State Tax Administration (STA) in broadening the tax base, capturing especially the
newly emerging private sector, and strengthening the timely assessment and collection of tax revenues
in an inflationary environment. It complements the technical assistance provided by the IMF in
strengthening the tax administration and provides modern equipment to the STA.
C.    Financial Sector Development: This component will assist in helping create
the necessary institutional framework for financial sector development. It includes: (a) the provision
of equipment for the initial phase of the development of the payments system, training and financing
of a feasibility study for the development of a new payments system over the medium term; (b)
assistance to the MOF and the National Bank of Azerbaijan (NBA) (the Central Bank) in the
introduction of modern enterprise accounting and auditing, as well as accounting and auditing



- 6 -
principles for the commercial banks; (c) strengthening the banking supervisory function, and
undertaking financial studies of selected large commercial banks; and (d) training for the National
Bank and commercial bank staff.
D.    Legal and Regulatory Framework: This component will provide assistance to
the Secretariat of the Parliament in issues relating to creating a legal framework suitable for the
development of a market economy, and in coordinating legal technical assistance relating to economic
reform, drafting new laws, decrees, and supporting regulations in the areas of company law,
commercial code and taxation, providing short terms in specialized areas when needed, and training
programs on legal issues in the country's transition to a market economy. Particular emphasis would
be placed on developing commercial law, law on natural monopolies and revision of anti-monopoly
legislation.
24.           The proposed Credit would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs of the
project. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements are shown in Schedule B. Key project processing
events are presented in Schedule C. The status of World Bank Group operations in Azerbaijan is
given in Schedule D. Arrangements regarding accounting and auditing of the project as well as
disbursements are discussed in the Technical Annex. Major contracts to be procured under the
project, and a program matrix, including training arrangements, are also provided in the Technical
Annex (Schedule E). Steps have been taken to coordinate the assistance from other agencies (the
European Union, especially on privatization, and the IMF on banking supervision and macro-
economic management) in relation to components included in the project.
Project Administration
25.          Project implementation will be carried out over a four-year period. The Credit will
be administered by a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) under the overall guidance of a Project
Coordination Committee, headed by the President of the NBA. The PIU will be headed by a project
manager, and will be reporting to the First Deputy President of the NBA on a daily basis. The
participating agencies will have responsibility for the implementation of their related components,
especially in developing and agreeing on the final terms of reference, short lists, bidding process,
negotiating, signing and executing consultants and equipment contracts, in accordance with IDA
procurement guidelines. They have designated individuals within the beneficiary agencies to be
responsible for implementation of the specific components. The PIU will assist the counterpart
agencies, and ensure that the procurement of goods and services conform to IDA Guidelines. It will
be responsible for disbursement. The PIU will also be responsible for project accounting and
auditing, and will provide the IDA with progress reports.
26.          To ensure effective project implementation, after Credit approval the Association will
send a team, including a task manager, procurement, disbursement and some of the component
specialists, who will hold a project launch workshop to ensure that all counterparts fully understand
proper procedures for implementation. This would include Association approval of the terms of
reference of studies and programs financed under the project, the criteria for selection of trainees, and
the short list of consultants. The Association will subsequently conduct a midterm review of all
components, as well as interim reviews as needed. The Borrower and Association would jointly
review the findings of the studies and the results of training programs. Additionally, to provide
flexibility, the Credit provides a reserve which will be used as the need arises.



27.          Since the beneficiary agencies are not familiar with Bank guidelines and requirements
for procurement of goods and services, the PIU would hire an Advisor on Procurement to assist the
PIU in managing procurement and training of Azeri staff. The PIU and the Procurement Advisor will
ensure that procurement complies with IDA Guidelines. Contracts for goods estimated to cost less
than US$300,000 not exceeding an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million, will be procured after
international shopping, by obtaining at least three quotations from two eligible countries. The IDA's
standard bidding documents will be used under the project. All contracts procured through ICB, as
well as the first two contracts procured through international shopping will be subject to prior review
by the Association. The administrative burden placed on the agencies would be minimized by
packaging the procurement into as few contracts as possible. Consultants will be selected in
accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by IDA borrowers and by the IDA as
executing agency.
28.          Lessons learned from Previous IDA Involvement: The Association does not have
project lending experience in Azerbaijan. The first Credit for Petroleum Technical Assistance was
approved on April 20, 1995, and the second Credit for Greater Baku Water Supply Rehabilitation
Project was approved on June 28, 1995. However, the experience so far gained from the
implementation of some Project Preparation Facility advances, project preparation in other areas, and
similar technical assistance projects in other FSU countries has revealed that projects are effective
when developed in the context of the govermnent's institutional development objectives. This lesson
has been an important factor in selecting the priority areas for assistance. Other lessons are the need
for government commitment and ownership, and involvement in the specification of the particular
component, agreement on project coordination, and detailed terms of reference prior to the initiation
of the program. The beneficiary agencies have played an important role in identifying their needs and
the specification of the program as it relates to them. Experience in Azerbaijan has also revealed
significant need for strengthening institutional ability for coordination and implementation, and
intensive supervision/assistance by the Association. Consequently, technical assistance for
procurement management and coordination would also be required, and is proposed.
29.          Rationale for IDA Involvement: The IDA's CAS in the short-term is to support the
Government in its efforts to move towards a market economy. The initial strategy is to help
strengthen institutional capability for designing and implementing the Government reform program,
thereby helping to expedite the reforms. In the short run, the IDA's assistance will help meet the
shortages of skill in articulating a coherent reform program. The long-term objective is to build the
government's institutional capacity to manage a market economy. This project is consistent with
IDA's CAS and project would thus help facilitate the transition towards a market-based economy.
The CAS was approved by the Board on April 20, 1995 in the context of the Petroleum Technical
Assistance project.
30.          Actions Agreed: During negotiations, it was agreed that; (a) the Government would
maintain a PIU headed by a manager and with adequate qualified staff; (b) the Government would
establish an Experts' Group including representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the Legislative and
Law Expertise Department of the Office of the President, the State Property Committee and other
agencies to coordinate the legal technical assistance provided under the project; (c) prior agreement
will be sought from the Association on the content of the training programs and criteria for the
selection of trainees; (d) the Government and the Association would carry out a mid-term review by
April 30, 1997 on the progress of the project, following which the Government would take necessary
measures to ensure efficient project completion, should it be seen as lagging behind. The

appointment of the Project Manager, and a Procurement Advisor to the PIU are conditions of Credit
effectiveness, and the establishment of the Experts' Group is a condition of disbursement for the legal
technical assistance component of the project.
31.          Environmental Aspects: The proposed project is not expected to have any negative
environmental impact. It has therefore been placed in Category C for the purposes of OD 4.01 on
Environmental Assessment. Assistance is proposed, as part of the program for mass privatization, in
clarifying environmental liability in the process of medium and large enterprises privatization.
32.          'he beneficiary agencies (the State Property Committee, the NBA, the ! "OF, the
STA, and the Legal Department of the Parliament) have been actively involved in the identification
and design and content of their respective technical assistance program, and ensured that the
components respond to their immediate needs.
Benefits and Risks
33.          By alleviating the constraints arising from lack of specific skills and institutions that
are impeding the reform process in Azerbaijan, the proposed project would help accelerate the
formulation and implementation of reforms in key areas of privatization, macro-economic
management and financial sector development. It would contribute to enhancing the government's
capacity to articulate and implement reforms, and thereby strengthening the institutional framework
for a market economy.
34.          The major risks concern: (a) political stability and the establishment of a peace
accord over Nagorno-Karabakh. They could significantly affect the Government's focus and speed of
decision-making on reform issues; and (b) project management and potential delays in project
implementation, arising from the lack of knowledge and experience of Bank requirements in regard to
procurement and disbursement. The latter risk would be minimized by the provision of IDA
assistance as part of the Credit for project management and procurement, and intensive supervision.
35.          Reconunendation: I am satisfied that the proposed Credit complies with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.
