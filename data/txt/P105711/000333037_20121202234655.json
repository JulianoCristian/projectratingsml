The reallocation is necessary to dispose of a larger\n            quantity of inventoried obsolete pesticides than currently\n            allocated. Following the supervision mission conducted in\n            May 2012, the Government of Ethiopia requested this\n            reallocation in order to meet the first project development\n            objective (PDO)-level indicator. The request was made to\n            reallocate US$310,000 to the disposal services category, an\n            amount which had originally been allocated for the\n            construction of a pesticides storage warehouse. The proposed\n            extension will extend the closing date of the project from\n            December 31, 2012 to May 31, 2013 which will be the second\n            extension of the project. The first extension was granted on\n            July 21, 2011 and extended the project closing date by 18\n            months from June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2012. With the\n            inclusion of the extension, the cumulative extended period\n            will be 23 months."}, "docdt": "2012-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
