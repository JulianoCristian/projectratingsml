The original project development objective (PDO)\n            implied that all inventoried obsolete pesticides and\n            associated waste will be disposed of through disposal\n            overseas. However, with the discovery of greater than\n            budgeted associated waste, especially contaminated soils as\n            described above, and the consequent increase in the total\n            cost for disposal, it is preferable to adopt a blended\n            approach of disposal overseas and lower-cost safeguarding\n            in-country based on risk profiling of the contaminated\n            waste, i.e. obsolete pesticides and higher risk stocks of\n            heavily contaminated soils will be disposed of overseas\n            while lower risk stocks of associated waste will be\n            safeguarded (and later decontaminated subject to additional\n            funding) in, country. This approach is expected to eliminate\n            the stocks' risk to nearby population and the\n            environment. In addition, the original PDO assumed zero new\n            accumulations of obsolete pesticides during the life of the\n            project, which has been proven difficult to achieve in the\n            context of agricultural intensification resulting in\n            continuous new accumulations. Therefore, it is proposed that\n            the project focus rather on developing a strategy for\n            management and reduction of future accumulations to be\n            endorsed by the Steering Committee."}, "docdt": "2011-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
