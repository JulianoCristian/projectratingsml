                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.     This Restructuring Paper responds to the request of the Government of the
Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and introduces the following changes in the
Africa Stockpiles Program – Project 1 in Ethiopia (ASP, P105711, Grant TF090543):

              Reallocation of proceeds to increase the budget for disposal activities,
               which is critical to meet one of the two Project Development Objective
               (PDO)-level indicators; and
              Extension from December 31, 2012 to May 31, 2013 of the project closing
               date to ensure the disposal of the obsolete pesticides which is being carried
               out by a Joint Venture, Polyeco S.A-Tredi S.A, under a contract in the
               amount Euro 825,343.40 (approximately US$1.049 million).

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.       Though satisfactory achievement was made in the inventory of obsolete pesticides
(OP) at the beginning of the project, significant progress cannot be made until the actual
disposal of the OP takes place. The disposal process began in May 2012; the Ministry of
Agriculture (MoA) signed a contract with an international disposal Joint Venture,
Polyeco S.A-Tredi S.A, for safeguarding and removing of 360 tons of obsolete pesticides.
Additional 90 tons of OP will be included to the same contract thereby removing all 450
tons of inventoried OP in the country. The project has disbursed about US$743,997 as of
November 2, 2012. These disposal and safeguarding activities are crucial for achieving
the first PDO-level indicator (Inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticides and associated
waste disposed of and/or safeguarded by the end of the project) and disbursing 45 percent
of the total project funds (US$2.62 million). Progress has also been made toward
preparing strategies for sustainable pesticide management and reduction of further
accumulation of pesticides. These strategies are expected to be finalized before the
current closing date of December 31, 2012 and are crucial to achieving the second PDO-
level indictor (A strategy for sustainable management of future accumulations adopted by
the Steering Committee by the end of the project).

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

There are two proposed changes:

   Reallocation
3.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to dispose of a larger quantity of
inventoried obsolete pesticides than currently allocated. Following the supervision
mission conducted in May 2012, the Government of Ethiopia requested this reallocation
                                         1
in order to meet the first PDO-level indicator. The request was made to reallocate
US$310,000 to the Disposal Services category, an amount which had originally been
allocated for the construction of a pesticides storage warehouse. Please see specific
details on reallocation between categories in Annex 1.

   Closing Date
4.     The proposed extension will extend the closing date of the project from December
31, 2012 to May 31, 2013 which will be the second extension of the project. The first
extension was granted on July 21, 2011 and extended the project closing date by 18
months from June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2012. With the inclusion of the proposed
extension, the cumulative extended period will be 23 months. Please see specific details
on extension of the closing date in Annex 2.

2.      The MoA signed a contract with an international disposal Joint Venture for
safeguarding and disposing of 360 tons of obsolete pesticides. These activities are crucial
for achieving the first PDO-level indicator (Inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticides
and associated waste disposed of and/or safeguarded by the end of the project) and
disbursing 45 percent of the total project funds (US$2.62 million). The proposed request
for reallocation is to increase the budget for disposal of all project inventoried OPs,
which is critical to meet the first PDO-level indicator. The proposed request is to
reallocate US$310,000 from the construction of pesticides storage warehouse (category 2,
Works) to category 4, Disposal Services. Cancellation of the construction of the pesticide
warehouse will not affect the PDO of the project.

                                Extension of Closing Date

      AFRICA STOCKPILES PROGRAMME – PROJECT 1 IN ETHIOPIA
                            P105711

1.      As per the request from the Government of Ethiopia, it is proposed that the
project’s closing date be extended from December 31, 2012 to May 31, 2013 to allow for
the completion of the disposal contract. This contract, in the amount of Euro 825,343.40
(approximately US$1.049 million) with the Joint Venture, Polyeco S.A–Tredi S.A, is for
the disposal of 360 tons of obsolete pesticides. An extension of the project will allow for
the contractor to complete the shipping and disposal of all stocks, and receive certificates
of disposal from the incineration plants in Sweden and France. This will also ensure that
the Project meets the first PDO-level indicator. Without such an extension, the project
would close with at least 60 percent of the targeted waste in transit, or awaiting final
disposal in the incineration plants in Sweden and France.

2.    This extension will be the second extension of the project’s closing date for a
cumulative period of 23 months.
