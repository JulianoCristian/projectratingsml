                         Implementation Status Overview
                         ASP-Ethiopia will be closed on May 31, 2013. The Level 1 Restructuring of the Project was approved in June 2011 that revised PDO and indicators. The original PDO was, "Assist
                         the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to eliminate inventoried publicly-held obsolete pesticide stockpiles and associated waste, and implement measures to reduce and
                         prevent future related risks." The revised PDO is to "Assist the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to dispose of and/or safeguard inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticide
                         stocks and associated waste, and develop a strategy for sustainable management of future accumulations." The two PDO level indicators are: (i) Inventoried publicly held obsolete

                         pesticides and associated waste disposed of and/or safeguarded by the end of the project (with a footnote: The final inventory consists of 450 tons of obsolete stocks and 850 tons of
                         associated waste); and (ii) A strategy for sustainable management of future accumulations adopted by the Steering Committee by the end of the project.

                         The PDO level indicator targets are expected to be achieved partially by the closing date:

                         - Of the total 450 tons of obsolete pesticides (OP) inventoried, 300 tonnes were transported to Sweden and are being incinerated. It is expected that incineration certificate for all the
                         300 tonnes will be issued before the project closes. At the moment, the remaining 150 tonnes are being transported to France and Sweden for incineration. The incineration certificate
                         for the 150 tonnes of OP is likely to be issued after the project closed.

                         - Of the total 850 tons of associated waste, the project did not have enough budget to safeguard nor to dispose them. Furthermore, the priority was given to full disposal of the OP
                         rather than to the associated waste since the OPs had much higher level of toxicity. Therefore, the client organized a donor meeting last year to generate funding for safeguarding
                         and disposing these associated waste. However, as of project closing, no such funding has been materialized.

                         - Regarding prevention activities, a draft strategy for preventing future accumulation of obsolete pesticides and associated waste was developed and presented to national
                         stakeholders in a workshop. The stakeholder feedback is being incorporated in the document. The final prevention strategy is tabled for the project steering committee's endorsement
                         and expected to be endorsed before the project closing date.

                         - An empty container management strategy was prepared and discussed with relevant stakeholders. The strategy will be used by the MoA for managing empty containers.

                         This is the last ISR for this project. An ICR is being prepared for the overall ASP which will draw lessons from activities implemented in each country. The PDO and overall design of
                         the ASP-Ethiopia was considered ambitious and the project was restructured in June 2011. The indicator targets could have been further realistic considering the cost of disposal and
                         availability of project financing. There were numerous implementation challenges resulting in delays which required extending the project closing date twice with a cumulative
                         extension of 23 months. Since the project was approved prior to ORAF requirement, risk monitoring was not reported in the ISRs.

                         In terms of relevance, the project's objectives, design and implementation remain highly relevant to Ethiopia's development and environmental priorities. The project has been aligned
                         with the principles of Ethiopia's national development strategy, particularly in the areas of agriculture and rural development. At the global level, the project has been strengthening
                         compliance with the Stockholm, Basel, and Rotterdam Convention.

                         In terms of efficiency, a detailed cost analysis had not been done during project preparation. However, based on pesticide disposal operations and their associated costs in Africa
                         between 1990 and 2004, the disposal cost per tonne had been estimated to be US $3,400. Under ASP, Ethiopia disposed 450 tonnes of obsolete pesticides at a slightly lower cost
                         per unit, demonstrating a more cost effective disposal operation than originally estimated.

                         Detailed analysis of design relevance, implementation performances, efficiency and lessons will be presented in the ICR.
