                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following the recent supervision mission conducted in September, 2011, progress in project implementation has been made on key steps for implementation. Most importantly, the
                         Country Environment and Social Assessment (CESA) has been cleared by ASPEN; the bidding document for disposing and safeguarding 450 tonnes of obsolete pesticides has been
                         cleared by the Bank; and the process for tendering has begun. The Environment and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for constructing a pesticide store on the outskirts of Addis
                         Ababa has also been cleared by ASPEN. No objection was given to broadcast educational messages on pesticide use by national TV and Radio.
