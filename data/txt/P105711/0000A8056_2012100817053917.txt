                         Implementation Status Overview
                         An Implementation Support Mission was held between May 7 and 12, 2012. There were few issues that needed additional deliberation and as such several meetings were held
                         between May and August 2012, and the mission aide-memoire was finalized in August 2012. Significant progress has been made towards the removal and safeguarding of obsolete
                         pesticides including: (i) signing of a contract agreement between the Government of Ethiopia and JV Polyeco S.A.- Tredi S.A to supply equipment for safeguarding 450 tonnes of
                         obsolete pesticides and eliminating 360 tonnes of them before the project closes on December 31, 2012; (ii) a site specific Environmental Management Plan was prepared by the

                         of the grant proceeds to increase the budget for disposal of the remaining 90 tonnes of pesticides (it was noted that the cancellation of the construction of the temporary storage will

                         not prevent achievement of the PDO). The PMT has faced difficulty to retain a procurement specialist as the salary rate is low. Procurement activities were covered by the financial
                         manager, the project coordinator and the cross supports of procurement specialists of other Bank projects in the Ministry of Agriculture. .

                         By design, the disposal of absolute pesticide which is the main activity of the project with about 70% of project resources, was planned at the end of the project. As such, the
                         disbursement has been low. However, with the signing of the disposal contract and activities undertaken by the contractor in the last three months, the project is expected to disburse
                         the remaining project resources by the close of project. To expedite the disposal activity, the PMT developed a detailed action plan to remove all the 450 tonnes of obsolete
                         pesticides by the end of November, 2012. Consistent with the action plan, as of August 2012, the contractor has already safeguarded more than 60 tonnes of pesticides. A Technical
                         Adviser for Disposal process and compliance has continued to support the Project Management Team (PMT) on the disposal compliance monitoring. The Bank has also received a
                         request from the GoE to reallocate grant proceeds

                         The safeguarding and disposal activities are crucial for achieving the PDO level indicators and disbursing of 45 per cent of the total project budget.
