                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has met its development objective of improving efficiency, and of reducing pollution by expanding the use of natural gas in the West Java market and by substituting gas
                         for more expensive and more polluting fuels such as diesel, fuel oil and coal. A the outcome targets for gas market expansion and pollution reduction were exceeded. All physical
                         construction is complete including the distribution networks and control systems. The only unfinished activity is the installation of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
                         (SCADA) and telecommunications system.
