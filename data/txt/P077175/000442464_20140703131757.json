  Development Project for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: in implementing a market reform\n            project, the supervision of the project needs to pay as much\n            attention to fundamental policy, regulatory, and pricing\n            reforms as it does to the delivery and commissioning of\n            physical infrastructure and its impacts. A positive benefit\n            arising from improved confidence in the probity and\n            transparency of procurement is that well qualified, genuine\n            bidders will be more likely to submit proposals, thereby\n            increasing the effective level of competition for goods,\n            works, and services. Careful specification of complex market\n            related infrastructure, such as the supervisory control and\n            data acquisition (SCADA) system, needs to take into account\n            how that infrastructure will be used in the evolving market."}, "docdt": "2014-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
