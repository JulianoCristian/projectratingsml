1. Prior Review Threshold: Procurement Decisions subject to Prior Review by
the Bank as stated in Appendix 1 to the Guidelines for Procurement-
Procurement Method    Prior Review Threshold   Comments
1.  ICB (Goods)                     $200,000
2.   NCB (Goods)                    $200,000

5.  ICB (Non-Consultant Services)  -              Not expected
2. Prequalification. Prequalification was planned for all major goods packages
based on 1CB procedures and Supply & Installation arrangements. However,
due to the tight project schedule (some physical investments should be
finished by mid 2006 when Pertamina will supply gas to PGON based on take or
pay arrangement), it has been decided to apply post qualifications based on



-3-
clear   and    adequate      qualification      criteria   to   be   provided      in   the    bidding
documents. Given the small value of the four NCB civil works packages, it has
also been decided to apply post qualification instead of prequalification.
3. Reference to (if any) Project Operational/Procurement Manual: None.
4. Any Other Special Procurement Arrangements: All major goods contracts
will be based on Supply & Installation (or EPC - Engineering, Procurement &
Construction)       arrangements.          In   view    of   the   tight    schedule      for   several
packages (IFBl1, 2 and 3), retroactive financing has been agreed.
5. Procurement Packages with Methods and Time Schedule:
