and is\n            intended to continue to support the Government of Georgia in\n            the implementation of policy reforms in the areas of: (i)\n            strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency, and\n            transparency; (ii) improving electricity and gas sector\n            services; (iii) improving the environment for private sector\n            development; and (iv) improving social protection, education\n            and health care services. PRSO IV will be the last of this\n            PRSO series, although the Georgian authorities have\n            indicated interest in a possible follow-up programmatic\n            development policy credit series. At the beginning of the\n            PRSO series, the then new administration faced enormous\n            challenges, and the primary objective of the PRSO series was\n            to support selected reforms necessary to pull Georgia out of\n            a failing state scenario and to mitigate the risks of\n            derailment in of the reform process. For operational\n            purposes, the program is organized into four pillars: (i)\n            strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency, and\n            transparency; (ii) improving electricity and gas sector\n            services; (iii) improving the environment for private sector\n            development; and (iv) improving social protection, education\n            and health care services."}, "docdt": "2008-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
