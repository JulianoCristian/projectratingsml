          OPERATION III", "versiontyp": "Buff cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Fourth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Operation (PRSO) for Georgia will provide supplemental\n            budget support to the Government to help efforts to sustain\n            implementation of the PRSO program in the face of\n            unanticipated budget constraints associated with the August\n            2008 conflict. The PRSO reform program focuses on four\n            critical reform pillars: (i) strengthening public sector\n            accountability, efficiency, and transparency; (ii) improving\n            electricity and gas sector services; (iii) improving the\n            environment for private sector development; and (iv)\n            improving social protection, education, and health care\n            services. The reforms aim at developing a dynamic and\n            competitive private sector as the main engine of growth,\n            with the state playing a supportive role by providing basic\n            public goods and services. These development strategies,\n            reflected in Georgia's poverty reduction strategy paper\n            (PRSP), have served the country well. Driven by rapidly\n            rising foreign direct investment (FDI) flows of about $1.5\n            billion per year, which translated into domestic investment\n            of 28 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), GDP growth\n            averaged 10.5 percent per year over the last three years and\n            reached 12.4 percent in 2007. During the same period,\n            inflation was on average 8.7 percent per year, though it\n            accelerated to 11 percent in 2007. Private capital inflows\n            financed the large external current account deficit while\n            international reserves increased from $881 million in 2006\n            to $1,361 million in 2007, and to $1,550 million by end-July\n            2008 (or about 2.6 months of imports). At the same time,\n            external debt declined from 46 percent of GDP in 2003 to\n            16.7 percent in 2007."}, "docdt": "2008-09-19T00:00:00Z"}
