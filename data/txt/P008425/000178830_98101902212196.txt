INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOKMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED FOURTli LOAN TO
NATIONAL INVESTMENT BANK FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT S.A. (NIBID)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE HELLEN4IC STATE
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
fourth loan to the National Investment Bank for Industrial Development S.A.
(NIBID), to be guaranteed by the Hellenic State, for the equivalent of
US$15 million to help finance industrial lending. The loan would have a
fixed amortization schedule with a term of 12 years including two years of
grace. The interest rate would be 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Greece" (EMA-49a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 31,
1972, under cover of a memorandum (R-72/73) from the Secretary's Depart-
ment. Country Data are presented in Annex I.
3.        Throughout the 1960's the Greek economy enjoyed rapid economic
growth averaging 7.5% per year. Since 1968, growth has averaged 8.6 percent
per annum and has been characterized by rapid increases in manufacturing out-
put. Agriculture has tended to lag behind. The main stimulus to growth has
been buoyant domestic demand stemming from large increases in private fixed
investment, especially housing, and in public investment, mainly infrastruc-
ture. Private consumption has risen at a rate of 6 percent per annum, and
gross capital formation has grown at about 11.5 percent. Growth has been
associated with relatively stable prices. However, by the end of 1972, the
economy reached almost full employment of capacity and manpower; with emerg-
ing production constraints pressure on domestic prices developed which was
reinforced by the removal of price controls in the middle of 1972. Consumer
prices, which had increased at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent per an-
num in the previous four years, increased by 6.5 percent in 1972 while whole-
sale prices rose 10.5 percent. Inflationary pressures persisted throughout
the first half of 1973.
4.        Although the industrial sector has grown rapidly in the past decade,
agriculture still accounts for 15.8 percent of GDP, about 40 percent of em-
ployment and 41 percent of total exports. The Government's objective is to
raise agricultural productivity, attain diversification and increase the pro-
duction of higher yielding crops. The key problems for agricultural develop-
ment are structural. Farms are small and fragmented, thus making mechanization
difficult and costly. Progress is also hindered by organizational constraints,
particularly the lack of training and extension services. Performance of agri-
culture in 1968-72 has been disappointing; average annual growth was 1.8 per-
cent (against the Plan target of 5.2 percent) and progress in attaining
structural changes slight. However underemployment in agriculture, at one
time pervasive, declined.



5.       Industry has been the most dynamic sector.   Average annual growth
between1 1963 and 1972 was 13.1 percent, and the contribution of manufacturing
to CDP rose from 19.3 percent in 1968 to 23.7 percent in 1972. Gross private
and public industrial investment in the 1963-72 period rose at an annual aver-
age rate of nearly 14 percent. Primarily as a result of the addition of new
capacity in the ferro-nickel, steel and aluminum industries, the share of
manufactured goods in total exports increased sharply from 23 percent in 1968
to 33 percent in 1972. Full utilization of existing capacity led to shortages
and bottlenecks and was an important factor in the Government's decision to
remove price controls in 1972.
6.        Despite rapid growth, Greek industry still suffers from structural
limitations common to countries at a similar stage of development, such as
inappropriate plant size and limited export orientation. In general, manu-
facturing is carried out by small-scale, low productivity, family-owned en-
terprises. According to the 1969 Census of manufacturing and handicraft, enter-
prises employing less than five persons accounted for 41 percent of total in-
dustrial employment. These enterprises concentrate primarily on the domestic
market and lack both the financial resources and the entrepreneurial capacity
required to expand into export markets. Howevezr, there is evidence that the
Association Agreement witlh the EEC is encouraging efficiency and export
orientation, through both improved outlets in the EEC and increased competi-
tion in the home market. As the dismantling of protective tariffs envisaged
in the agreement proceeds, improved productivity will become increasingly
necessary.
7.        The Government encourages investment in industry through incentives
and provision of infrastructure in priority sub-sectors. It is becoming in-
creasingly aware of growing inequality in regional income distribution.    To
divert investment away from the Athens-Piracus area, new tax and credit in-
centives for investment in industry, irinino and tourism have been introduced
and special industrial development areas have been established where infra-
structure requirements will be provided by the Government.
Ž3.       Greece's rapid economic growth has been accompanied by increasing
imports which, during the period 1968-72, rose at an average annual rate of
about 16 percent while exports expanded by an average of only 13 percent.
The trade deficit rose from $784 million in 1963 to $1.6 billion in 1972,
with an increasing share of this deficit being financed by receipts from
invisibles such as workers' remittances, transportation and travel.    As a
result, the current account deficit which reacned $404.5 million in 1970
reTmained at about that level in 1972. Together with increased net capital
inflows, this led to a substantial balance of payments surplus in 1971 and
1972 and brought about an increase in net foreign exchange reserves to $968
mnillion at the end of 1972, equivalent to about five months of imports.
9.        Price increases which took place at the end of 1972 and during the
first half of 1973 ended a period of record growth with price stability.
Partly the result of increased internal demand in a situation of near full
employmenc and partly imported from abroad, they prompted the Government to
take a number of economic measures frorn December 1972 through June 1973.



-3-
These included a reduction in budget expenditures of the central Government
and other public entities, an increase in the reserve requirements of banks,
an upward revision of up to 2 percent in interest rates, a new ceiling on
short-term bank credit as well as other measures to mop up liquidity and
tighten credit, particularly in the booming housing industry.
10.       These measures, together with the Drachma devaluation of February
1973 pari passu with the U.S. dollar, are expected to have a positive impact
on the performance of the Greek economy in the years ahead. The 1973-77 Plan
is being reviewed to reflect these changes.   The preliminary revised draft
Plan includes a GDP growth target of 7.5 percent per annum with agriculture
growing at 3.5 percent and industry at 11.0 percent per annum. Prices are
expected to increase at 3 to 4 percent per year. Although investment in
agriculture, tourism and shipbuilding will be encouraged, one of the fore-
niost objectives of development policy will remain rapid industriajization
aimed at enabling the Greek economy to sustain itself and expand within the
framework of the EEC. As in the previous Plan, economic growth is based
mainly on the private sector; direct intervention by the Government will
remain limited and its role will continue to center on supplying necessary
economic and social infrastructure.
11.       In view of Greece's geographical location, its association with the
EEC and the level of economic development achieved, a rate of growth of GDP
of 7.5 percent per annum for the next few years seems feasible. The associa-
tion with the European Community and the resulting competition for markets
should force the pace of organizational and technological modernization. A
comparatively cheap labor force - by European standards - remains an impor-
tant asset of the Greek economy. However. full utilization of this resource
requires the introduction of effective training and retraining programs. On
the other hand, emigration, which was sizeable in the past, declined markedly
from 73,000 net emigrants in 1969 to 15,800 in 1972 partly as a result of the
increased job opportunities in Greece. Increasing productivity in agricul-
ture, parallel to industrial development, remains an important issue; structu-
ral reform has been initiated but needs to be reinforced.
12.       The balance of payments may become a constraint to further growth
in the medium term. The decision of the Government in 1971 and 1973 to leave
the dollar-drachma rate unchanged has improved the prospects for commodity
exports, particularly to the EEC market, but also increased the cost of most
imports of investment and intermediate goods needed to expand capacity and
improve competitiveness. To utilize the high growth potential of the econ-
omy and at the same time reduce the balance of payments constraint requires
a high level of domestic savings and a further improvement in exports through
new export-oriented production and investment.
13.       Greece's current account deficit reflects her continuing dependence
on foreign capital.   National savings in proportion to GN1' increased from about
16 percent in 1968 to about 20 percent in 1972, but the resource gap was still
29 percent of gross capital formation. Since 1967, Greece has had only limited
access to long-term capital abroad, and the availability of concessionary funds



- 4 -
has been reduced. Consequently, Greece has had to resort to substantial
short and medium-term borrowing and suppliers' credits. The Government con-
tinues efforts to cut dependence on short-tena borrowing, and there have been
signs recently of somewhat easier access to longer term funds. Nevertheless,
shortage of long-term capital remains a constraint on investment plans and
maintenance of a high rate of growth to which the Government is committed.
Public external debt (including guaranteed debt) at the end of 1971 amounted
to $1,186.7 million of which $943.6 million had been disbursed; Bank loans
at that date amounted to $95 million of which $23.5 million had been dis-
bursed. Debt service payments in 1971 amounted to $106.6 million (of which
only $1.8 million for Bank loans) and represented 7.6% of receipts from ex-
port of goods and non-factor services.   No significant change is expected
for the next four or five years in the Bank's share in the country's external
debt.  Considering the favorable prospects for future econoric growth, Greece
continues to be creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUT OPERATIONS IN GREECE
14.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's seventh operation in Greece.
It would bring total Bank lending to $133.9 milLion net of cancellations.
Bank lending to Greece started in 1968 after disputes in connection with
the country's pre-war external debt had been substantially settled. Besides
the three previous loans to NIBID totaling $56.6 million (net of cancellations),
the Bank made a US$25 million loan for a groundwater irrigation project in
1971, and two loans for education in 1970 and 1972 totaling US$37.3 million.
Except for initial difficulties in implementing the first education and
groundwater projects, and in meeting the conditions of effectiveness for
the second education project, the execution of Bank financed projects has
generally been satisfactory.   Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and IFC investments as of August 31, 1973, and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
15.       IFC has made investments totaling USq15.0 million in five Greek
companies. An equity investment in NIBID of $720,000 was made in 1965; an
equity and loan investment of $600,000 in a fertilizer company in 1962 (sold
in 1970); loan and equity investments of $5 million in two cement companies
in 1965 and 1966; and loan and equity investments totalling $8.7 million in
an aluminium company in 1970 and 1972.
16.       Although Greece's economy is approaching a more advanced stage of
development, significant regional and sectoral disparities persist. Further-
more, the economy has to prepare itself to face increasing competition from
EEC imports, particularly in the industrial sector, where tariffs and other
protective barriers are being gradually reduced under the Association Agree-
ment with the European Economic Comm.unity.   Bank assistance to Greece aims
to support the modernization of institutions and introduction of reform
measures in key sectors and the reduction in regional disparities, partic-
ularly in agriculture, goals which the Government seeks to promote. Over
the next four years, Bank lending is expected to continue at about the level



- 5 -
of the recent past, and to concentrate primarily on assisting development in
agriculture and education. Infrastructure projects for highways and sewer-
age are being considered for later years and would have a strong emphasis on
institution building and administrative improvement.
17.       NIBID is assisting Greek industry in becoming more efficient and
competitive with the EEC. Bank lending to NIBID has been instrumental in
building up a sound long-term lending institution which is gaining momentum
but still needs support to consolidate its standing. The proposed loan to
NIBID, which is smaller than the last two loans, would help to serve their
purpose.
18.       In agriculture, the small size and fragmentation of most farm hold-
ings. is a major obstacle to modernization. The Government emphasizes land
consolidation in connection with public investment in agricultural projects
and particularly in irrigation, which is essential to increase crop produc-
tion. Development efforts include training and introduction of new tech-
nology. Bank lending for agriculture will concentrate on land reclamation
and irrigation; two more irrigation projects are contemplated, one of them
now being appraised and the other under preparation. The two previous edu-
cation projects have already assisted the government's efforts to reform
and re-orient the education system. The first (Loan 711-GR), approved in
November, 1970, introduced the concept of multi-disciplinary sub-professional
training in fields such as engineering, agriculture, food processing, business
administration, and health. The second loan of $23 million, approved in
September, 1972, is expected to assist in improving the quality of educa-
tion and stimulating education reform across a broad spectrum of levels and
types of institutions including primary teacher training, a variety of spe-
cialized vocational institutions, and the schools of engineering and science
at the University of Patras. Future lending may include comprehensive or
multilateral secondary schools, technical teacher training, curriculum de-
velopment and education research, agricultural education, and continued sup-
port of university reform with emphasis on scientific and technological fields,
as well as on public administration and business management training. A proj-
ect is presenting being prepared by the UNESCO/IBRD Cooperative Program.
19.       The Bank is acting as executing agency for a UNDP financed highway
reconnaissance and feasibility studies project which may lead to a road
construction project which would also support the Government's on-going
efforts to improve the national highway maintenance system. No new IFC
investments are presently at an advanced stage of preparation.
PART III - TEiE PROJECT
20.       The project was appraised3 in April, and negotiations were held in
Washington in June 1973. The Greek delegation was headed by sir. George
Gondicas, Managing Director of NIBID. An appraisal report on the National
Investment Bank for Industrial Development S.A. (No. 184 GR) dated September 18,
1973, is being distributed separately. A Loan and Project Summary is attached
as Annex III to this Report.



- 6-
Establishment and Resources of NIBID
21.       The National Investment Bank for Industrial Development S.A. (NIBID)
was formed in 1963 by the National Bank of Greece (NBG), the leading commer-
cial bank in Greece, and a number of foreign banks. NIBID's initial share
capital of Dr 300 million (US$10 million equivalent) is fully paid-in; 55
percent is held by NBG, 38 percent by thirteen foreign banks, and 7 percent
by IFC. NIBID's equity base was broadened in 1970 through a Dr 300 million
loan (US$10 million) from the Central Bank sub-ordinated to other loans and
ranking pari-passu with equity in case of liquidation. In 1972 there was a
share capital increase of 50 percent through an offering to shareholders of
Dr 150 million (US$5 million' of non-voting preferred 6 percent dividend stock.
(IFC did not exercise its rights which were offered to the other shareholders).
In agreement with shareholders, 70 percent of the non-voting preferred stock
was sold to the public in July 1973. As of June 30, 1973, NIBID had outstand-
ing long-term Drachma borrowings from NBG of Dr 1,451 million (US$48.3 mil-
lion) and from the Bank of Greece (the Central Bank) Dr 1,235 million (US$41.2
million). The Bank has made three loans to NIBID: US$12.5 million in 1968,
US$20 million in 1970, and US$25 million in 1971. All loans have been vir-
tually fully committed. NIBID's European shareholders also provided a US$2.2
million medium-term loan to the Company in 1970.
Objectives and Role of NIBID
22.       NIBID's Statement of Policies and Procedures defines the objectives
of the Company as: (a) promoting development of private industry through fi-
nancing new productive enterprises and the modernization and expansion of ex-
isting ones, (b) developing the capital market in Greece, (c) facilitating
contacts and joint ventures between Greek and foreign enterprises in order
to induce participation of foreign capital and to introduce technical and
managerial skills into the economy, and (d) providing economic, technical
and organizational advice to enterprises. There are two other industrial
development banks in Greece, the State-owned Hellenic Industrial Development
Bank and the Investment Bank of Greece (owned by the Commercial Bank of Greece).
Commercial banks also provide industrial investment credit, since they are
obliged by law to lend 15 percent of their deposits on a long--term basis.
23.       From its creation in 1963 to the end of 1972, NIBID has approved
340 loans and equity investments amounting to Dr 5,763 million (US$192 mil-
lion). Approvals in 1971 and 1972 accounted for almost hialf of this, grow-
ing at 10 percent in 1971, and about 9 percent in 1972. The current year
is expected to show an increase in approvals of 29 percent. Some 89 percent
of NIBID's operations between 1970 and 1972 were for loans, and the remainder
for equity investments. Most of the loans were made at the legally permissi-
ble maximum terms of 10 years maturity and an interest rate of 8.5 percent up
to July 1973 when the rate was increased to 10.5 percent. As an investment
bank, NIBID is entitled to charge, in addition to the maximum interest rate,
a profit-tied increment up to 1.5 percent, allowing a maximum yield of 12
percent; however, since long-term lending in Greece is competitive, NIBID
rarely charges an increment of more than 0.5 percent.



24.       The low share of equity investments in NIBID's operations is largely
explained by the fact that family-owned companies, which constitute a major
part of the industrial sector, are reluctant to broaden their ownership base.
However, NIBID has been able to increase its equity operations substantially
during the last two years, when its equity investments have been double the
total reached between 1964 and 1970, in terms both of number and volume of
operations.
NIBID's Economic Impact
25.       NIBID plays a prominent role in industrial financing in the coun-
try, being the source of almost a fifth of total term lending to industry.
Industry accounts for only a third of GNP and there is a serious trade def-
icit, caused in particular by the large importation of manufactured goods.
In these circumstances, development banks have an important role to play
in helping the manufacturing sector to modernize in order to be able to
compete with imports and to export. This is particularly significant
since under the Treaty of Athens with the EEC free trade with the Com-
munity for industrial products is to be achieved by 1984. NIBID's biggest
assistance in 1972 went to metal products (26 percent of approvals) and
textile enterprises (21 percent), both of them leading export industries.
The projected increase in sales due to projects financed by NIBID in 1972
was estimated at Dr 5.1 billion (US$2.36 million) of which 43 percent were
exports.
26.       NIBID is predominantly involved in financing medium-sized indus-
tries. Since its inception, its average loan size has been for about $560,000;
in 1972, 35 loans out of 73 were below $333,000. During the last two years,
there has been a marked trend towards financing projects outside the Athens-
Pireus area. At the end of 1971, 55 percent of NIBID's projects were located
in the Athens-Pireus area, while at the end of 1972 the proportion declined
to 45 percent. Two-thirds of the operations approved in 1972 were located
outside the capital area.
27.       In 1971, 1378 jobs were created by projects financed by NIBID, and
2573 jobs in 1972. The average cost per job was $46,000 in 1972. This fig-
ure is high in comparison with DFC's in other countries but it does represent
a decline in real terms from the average cost per job of $39,000 in 1970, if
the two devaluations of the drachma and the 6 percent inflation during the
period are taken into account. Also, in an economy rapidly achieving full
employment, the most urgent need for industry is now to modernize and to
increase efficiency in order to become more competitive both domestically
and abroad. Most industrial projects financed by NIBID involve moderniza-
tion of plant equipment which is usually capital intensive; increased out-
put per worker and improved cost competitiveness are primary objectives.
28.       Apart from the technical and financial improvement of projects
which are subject to its appraisal, and the promotion of the participation
of foreign capital and know-how in Greek industry, NIBID plays an important
role in the development of the Greek capital market. This is being promoted



- 8 -
by NIBID's bond issues, equity investments and recent mutual fund activities.
In 1971, NIBID, in cooperation with Deutsche Bank and a group of ten Greek
entrepreneurs, established a mutual fund with a share capital of Dr 10 mil-
lion, of which NIBID owns 50 percent. From its start in April 1973 to June
30, the fund sold participations totalling about Dr 265 million, a promising
attempt in broadening industrial ownership and widening small investors' par-
ticipation in companies in which they could not invest directly.
Organization and Procedures
29.       Board of Directors.   NIBID's Board of Directors consists of 20 mem-
bers, 10 designated by NBG (including the Managing Director) and 10 by the
other shareholders. Mr. Christos Achis, Governor of NBG, has been chairman
of NIBID's Board since 1971. IFC is represented by Mr. Harold Linder. Full
meetings are held twice a year. Important decisions, such as appointing the
Managing Director, require a 70 percent majority of the Board. The Board's
responsibilities for project approvals have been delegated to an Executive
Committee of 6 members, 3 representing NBG, one representing IFC and two
the other foreign shareholders. NIBID's Managing Director attends Execu-
tive Committee Meetings without having a vote. The Executive Committee,
in turn, has delegated to members resident in Athens the authority to ap-
prove investments up to Dr 45 million (US$1.5 million). Projects exceeding
this limit are circulated to the Executive Committee for approval by mail.
The Mainaging Director is authorized to approve projects under Dr 15 million.
30.       Management and Staff.   NIBID is well managed.  lr. Gondicas, who
has been managing NIBID since its creation in 1963, has been largely respon-
sible for the steady expansion of the company. NIBID's staff is experienced
and competent. Turnover is low, and the staff shows a high degree of dedica-
tion to its work. The main developments since the last Bank appraisal of the
company are the creation of a new group dealing with tourism projects and the
reorganization and staffing of the Follow-up and Transactions Department.
Also, NIBID is setting up an Economic Department to provide guidance for
the economic analysis of projects and to carry out economic studies to as-
sist NIBID in planning its work.
31.       Procedures.   Despite rapidly expanding operations without concom-
mitant staff increases, NIBID's appraisals, with some exceptions, are con-
sidered to be very good. NIBID's examination of projects is thorough and
results, in many instances, in reshaping projects to achieve better finan-
cial and technical standards. Technical questions are handled by NIBID's
engineering section or outside consultants. Analysis of the economic as-
pects of projects has been weak, in particular the quantification of eco-
nomic benefits of projects, and agreement was reached during negotiations
that NIBID would fully evaluate economic rates of return of its larger proj-
ects. NIBID's supervision and follow-up activities continue to be satisfactory.
Financial Results
32.       NIBID's earnings before provisions and taxes have more than doubled
between 1970 and 1972; they were equivalent to 23 percent of share capital in
1972. NIBID's net profits were Dr. 51.9 million in 1971 and Dr 80.0 million



-9-
in 1972. Net profit as percent of average equity improved from 3.3 percent
in 1970 to 13.7 in 1971 and 15.6 in 1972. A six percent dividend was paid
in 1971 and in 1972, as compared to 5 percent, 4 percent, 3 percent and 2
percent respectively in the four preceding years.
33.       Total assets have grown rapidly from $68.3 million equivalent at
the end of 1970 to $139.6 at the end of 1972. The loan and equity portfolio
is of good quality. Provisions for possible losses are sufficient.
Projected Operations and Resource Requirements
34.       Preparation of the Government's 1973-1977 economic development plan
has not been completed. It is known, however, that the plan will project GNP
growth at 7.5 percent with industry growing at 11 percent. Given NIBID's
standing in industrial circles, as evidenced by a pipeline of projects now
at an advanced stage of preparation of Dr 1.3 billions it is expected that
NIBID will be able to increase its share in total industrial financing in the
next two years.
35.       On the basis of its projected lending volume, NIBID would commit
about $143.2 million equivalent to cover its operations from June 30, 1973 to
June 30, 1975. Over this period, about $46.3 million are expected to be lent
to NIBID by NBG and the Bank of Greece, the same level as in the preceeding
two years; NIBID is also planning its first bond issue to the public in 1974
for an amount of $13.3 million equivalent and is presently discussing a loan
of up to Deutschmark 40 million (about $16 million) with a German bank. This
loan will not be guaranteed by Government, and the foreign exchange risk will
be passed on to NIBID's borrowers. Adding internally generated resources
(about $14.3 million) and uncommitted resources at the beginning of the pe-
riod (about $38.3 million), NIBID's resource gap over the two-year period
would amount to about $15 million, to be covered by the proposed Bank loan.
36.       The projected resource composition reflects significant progress
in NIBID's gradual evolution into a self-sufficient autonomous institution.
The higher interest rate in the Greek market (para. 9) and the recognition
in foreign markets that NIBID is creditworthy now make it easier for NIBID
to borrow on the international capital market. In NIBID's plans, the in-
tended first foreign borrowing of $16 million should be followed by a sec-
ond, probably in 1975. Also, NIBID's preferred shares were sold to the
public in May 1973 and, given the response (9,900 subscribers paid a price
166% above par), NIBID should meet with success when it floats its first
domestic bond issue in 1974. NIBID's association with the Bank will con-
tinue to have a favorable effect upon its efforts to raise new resources
in international and domestic markets. The Bank's proposed fourth loan
($15 million) would represent not only an absolute but a relative decline
in the Bank's assistance to NIBID, constituting 10% of NIBID's resource
needs over the June 30, 1973-June 30, 1975 period. In all, NIBID has good
prospects of establishing its full institutional and financial independence
in the near future.

37.       Earning prospects over the two-year period are good.   Net profits
are projected at about 11.5 percent of net worth and 19.0 percent of share
capital in 1975. The debt/equity ratio should not exceed the 8:1 ratio
specified in the proposed loan agreement at any time during the next five
years.
Terms and Conditions of Proposed Bank Loan
38.       Prior Bank approval would be required for sub-projects requiring
a commitment by NIBID in excess of Dr. 21 million ($700,000).   Under the two
previous agreements the limit was Dr. 15 million ($500,000). The increase is
justified because of NIBID's improved appraisal work. The aggregate free
limit would be $5 million. A further change is proposed in the debt equity
ratio to which NIBID would be restricted, 8:1 instead of 7:1. This is just-
ified in view of the quality of NIBID's performance, its sound portfolio and
large reserves. NIBID will obtain coverage for the foreign exchange risk of
the loan under an arrangement with the Bank of Greece. Since NIBID has
demonstrated that it can handle its affairs soundly, the proposed loan --
as the previous one -- would be repaid according to a fixed amortization
schedule which would mirror the estimated composite repayments expected
from sub-borrowers.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and NIBID, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Hellenic State and the Bank, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft agree-
ments conform to the normal pattern for loans to development finance com-
panies.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Bank's
Articles of Agreement.

PART V - RECOi*MiNDATION
41.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Civil works contractors have been prequalified on interaational

signed in late July. Pre-qualification for international suppliers for 'ur-
niture has taken place and bids were called in early August 1973. Opening of
bids is scheduled for October 1973. Despite early delays of about 10 months,
the project is expected, based on its present status, to be completed by the
Closing Date of December 31, 1975.
Loan No. 754 - Groundwater Development Project (Irrigation): US$25 million
loan of June 21, 1971. Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Implementation of this project has had a slow start becouse of
delays in awarding contracts; changes in designation of project areas prompted
by the on-going consultants' study; and generally poor planning. Although
planning is still weak satistac.tory progress is now made with drilling oper-
ations and disbursements are picking up. The project is now expected to be
completed by the Closing Date.

Closing Date: July 31, 1977.

Unit has been appointed and the Unit is operating. Most of the technical
services-units of the participating agencies have been staffed and are also
in operation. Architectural consultants have been selected for most of the
project components.

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
