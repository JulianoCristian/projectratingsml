APPRAISAL OF
NATIONAL INVESTMENT BANK FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
SUMMARY
i.        The growth of the Greek economy accelerated in 1972, with provisional
data indicating that GNP rose 10.5% at constant prices. The 1972 expansion was
stimulated by domestic demand, fuelled primarily by the boom in construction,
the increase in manufacturing output, the investment of foreign exchange
earnings in the domestic economy, and Government spending in excess of revenues.
Capital investment amounted to 27% of GNP in real terms. Over the 1971-1972
period, agricultural output rose only 3.8%, while industrial growth surged
27.6%. The higher ratio of disposable income, increased prices of imports due
to devaluation of the drachma, and the overheating of certain sectors of the
economy (construction in particular) - led to very strong inflationary pressures
during the last quarter of 1972. To combat inflation the Government instituted
a number of measures at the end of 1972, with further restraints introduced
during the first half of 1973.
ii.       Greece's deficit in its balance of trade is a fundamental problem
which has steadily worsened over the past five years. Since Greece has a high
propensity to import and since its trade barriers vis-a-vis the EEC are being
continually reduced, there is not much scope for curbing imports. Thus, the
problem is how to increase current income from invisibles and exports. Although
tourism and shipping are expected to continue growing at a healthy pace, the
burden of covering the trade gap is being placed on Greece's manufacturing
sector which must increase its ability to export and to compete with imports.
Progress has been made in the export of manufactured goods, which contributed
to almost 50% of export income in 1972. In order to be more competitive
Greece's industrial sector must become more efficient, modern, and capital
intensive.
iii.      There have been no fundamental changes in the financial comnunity
of Greece during the past two years. The National Bank of Greece (NBC), which
is controlled by the Government, continues to dominate the banking scene.  NBG
holds 55% of NIBID's voting share capital; 13 foreign shareholders hold the
remainder, among them IFC which has 7% of the voting shares.  There are three
investment banks in Greece, all competing for customers in the manufacturing
sector.
iv.       NIBID's share of total term lending to industry in Greece has grown
from an estimated 15% in 1970 to 20% in 1972. Excluding a few very large
operations, the average size of NIBID's operations in 1972 was about $400,000,
which means that the magnitude of NIBID's loans and investments is medium-
sized for Greece. Approximately 55% of NIBID's financing is for projects
outside the Athens-Piraeus area, and this proportion is expected to increase
in the future. The majority of projects financed by NIBID have an export
orientation. The greatest need of the industrial sector in Greece is to
modernize plant and equipment in order to meet the competition for both
domestic and foreign markets which has arisen because of association with the



- ii -
EEC. NIBID's operations have focused on modernization and increasing the
efficiency of its customers. Greece has enjoyed full employment during the
past two years so, although job creation results from NIBID's financing, this
is not a paramount objective under current economic conditions. Through
modernization to meet foreign competition, NIBID's financing is in fact
preserving jobs in those firms which would otherwise be in difficulty due
to inefficiency.
v.        In 1972, NIBID's total portfolio grew by 43%, reflecting the rapid
growth of approvals in the last three years. At end 1972, NIBID had loans
and equity investments outstanding totalling $131 million equivalent in 235
companies. The quality of NIBID's loan portfolio is good and provisions
are more than adequate; arrears are minimal and only a few customers are in
difficulty. NIBID's equity portfolio at end 1972 held $10 million in equity
participations in 31 companies. NIBID's profitability, rather low in the
past, improved significantly during the past two years, mainly on account
of capital gains from the equity portfolio and increased leverage on NIBID's
own equity. NIBID has been paying dividends since 1967. From 2% in that
year, the rate increased to 6% in 1971. NIBID is financially strong and an
efficiently managed company.
vi.       In April 1972, NIBID increased its share capital by 50/D rhrough a
Dr. 150 million issue of non-voting, preferred, 6% divided shares sold to its
existing shareholders. In July 1973, 70% of these preferred shares were
offered to the public and 9,900 investors bought them, at a price 160% above
par; this made NIBID one of the most widely held companies in Greece. The
composition of NIBID's Board and Executive Committee and their functions have
not changed significantly. NIBID's professional staff increased from 37 in
1970 to 52 in 1972. If NIBID is to continue its rapid growth and to diversifv
its activities, it must hire additional competent staff, because there is a
constant overload of work. Greece has a dire shortage of managerial talent,
so NIBID has difficulty in finding qualified experienced officers. The
quality of NIBID's appraisals continues to be satisfactory and should further
improve since NIBID's management is now ready to undertake a full-fledged
economic analysis of projects.
vii.      NIBID's relations with the Government are good.  NIBII) has been
gradually able to establish a considerable degree of independence from NBG,
although it still relies on it for a significant portion of its resources.
NIBID is now to a certain extent competing with NBC in term lending, in equity
investments, but the evolution of NIBID as a completely independent entity Is
not yet entirely completed. It seems reasonable to expect that within two or
three years, assuming NIBID succeeds in tapping new sources of capital in the
domestic and international markets, its full independence will be firmly
established.



- iii -
viii.     The growth of Greece's industrial sector, the emergence of export
possibilities, as well as NIBID's momentum and reputation in industrial circles,
indicate that NIBID's business will grow over the next few years at a rate of
about 20% per annum. NIBID's approvals in 1973 should be at a minimum of
about Dr. 1,800 million, an exceptional 29% increase over 1972, partly due to
the slippage into 1973 of a number of projects received late in 1972, NIBID
has forecast its approvals of equity investments to increase from Dr. 200
million in 1973 to Dr. 300 million in 1975. To meet the projected business
volume, NIBID will need to raise altogether Dr. 3,149 million ($109 million
equivalent) over the two-year period starting June 30, 1973. Apart from its
cash generation and sale of equity participations, NIBID plans to tap three
principal sources of funds: (a) NBG and Bank of Greece, (b) the domestic
market, and (c) the international capital market. NBG and Bank of Greece
are expected to continue their annual lending to NIBID at the same level as
in 1972-1973, i.e. by contributing together a total of Dr. 1 billion which
means they will actually be reducing their relative contribution to NIBID's
total resources. NIBID plans to tap the domestic capital market by issuing
Dr. 400 million in bonds, with convertible futures, in 1974. In the inter-
national capital market NIBID is now discussing its first long term loan (for
$16 million) from a foreign private institution. This foreign borrowing has
been made possible because NIBID has now firmly established its creditworthi-
ness to prospective lenders and because the interest rate structure in Greece
has been revised upward.
ix.       NIBID needs to continue its association with the Bank to support
its prospects for broadening its resource base and to establish its full
institutional independence.  NIBID could effectively use a $15 million Bank
loan which is recommended to help finance its operations in the two-year period
July 1973-June 1975.  A loan of this amount would represent both an absolute
and relative decrease in the Bank's involvement in NIBID.  The terms of the
proposed loan should be those normally applied to Bank loans to development
finance companies, including the standard commitment fee. It is recommended
that the free limit be established at $700,000 for the use of Bank funds,
that the aggregate free limit be $5 million, and that the debt limitations
to be observed by NIBID be raised from 7 to 8 times NIBID's equity.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The National Investment Bank for Industrial Development (NIBID)
was established in 1963 by the National Bank of Greece and ten foreign banks.
In 1965 the company's share capital was increased and several new foreign
banks, and IFC, became shareholders. NIBID has already had three Bank loans:
$12.5 million in March 1968, $20 million in April 1970, and $25 million in
December 1971. This report focuses on developments since the previous Bank
loan was made. The most recent report reviewing developments in the economy
of Greece through 1971 was issued on March 22, 1972, entitled "Memorandum
on Current Economic Position and Prospects of Greece" (R72-73).
II. NIBID's ENVIRONMENT
Overall Economic Performance of Greece
2.01      The growth of the Greek economy accelerated in 1972, with provisional
data indicating that GNP rose 10.5% at constant prices. This rate of growth
was the highest attained by Greece over the past ten years. The 1972 expan-
sion was stimulated by domestic demand which was, in turn, fuelled primarily
by the boom in construction, the increase in manufacturing output, the invest-
ment of foreign exchange earnings in the domestic economy, and Government
spending in excess of revenues. Capital investment amounted to 27% of GNP
in real terms. About half of the country's labor force is still employed in
the agricultural sector. Excepting some underemployment in agriculture and
seasonal unemployment in tourism, Greece's labor force was fully employed
during 1972.
2.02      There have been noticeable changes in the economic structure of
Greece during the past three years. Preliminary figures indicate that agricul-
ture's share of GNP at constant prices declined from 18% in 1970 to 15% in 1972;
the manufacturing sector's share increased from 21% to 23% over the same
period; total services remained steady at about 26% of GNP. Over the 1971-1972
period, agricultural output rose only 4%, while manufacturing surged 25%.
Although it is the dynamism of the private sector which is directly responsi-
ble for Greece's overall economic growth rate, it is the Government's invest-
ment incentives and, to a lesser extent, Greece's associate membership in the
EEC which are the underlying causes of the growth in manufacturing.
2.03      The balance of payments has improved significantly:  official
reserves almost doubled, rising from $503 million at end 1971 to $1,004 million
at end 1972 (equivalent to about five months of imports). The balance of trade
nevertheless worsened over the same period, from a deficit of $1,302 million to
a deficit of $1,572 million in 1972. In spite of a sharp increase in income
from invisibles (tourism, shipping and emigrant workers' remittances), the
current account deficit was $374 million. Capital movements, on the other
hand, showed a 77% increase over the previous year with the 1972 net capital
inflow rising to $847 million. External debt service as a percentage of total
exports and net invisible earnings was roughly 7%.



-2-
2.04      The money supply increased by 23% in 1972, with sight deposits rising
more rapidly than currency in circulation. This increase was due primarily to
the accelerated credit expansion from domestic and foreign sources which took
place in the last half of 1972. The higher ratio of disposable income, in-
creased prices of imports due to devaluation of the drachma, and the overheating
of certain sectors of the economy, led to very strong inflationary pressures
during the last quarter of 1972. On an annual basis, the consumer price index
rose by 6.5% in 1972 and the wholesale price index by 10.5%, in spite of the
price controls in effect on many essential items.
2.05      To combat inflation, the Government instituted a number of measures
at the end of 1972. It raised considerably the primary and secondary reserve
requirements for commercial banks, imposed a 4% limit on new short-term credit
extended during the first half of 1973 (export financing and handicrafts
excepted), and suspended almost all categories of credit for housing construc-
tion. None of these measures, however, were aimed at the term financing of
priority sectors, such as industry and tourism. In May 1973, the Government
took further steps aimed at controlling inflation when it increased the
rediscount rate from 6.5% to 7.5% and raised the ceiling on various kinds of
time deposits by as much as 1%. The results of these measures were still not
satisfactory, so in late June the Government increased the rediscount rate to
9%, raised time deposit rates 1-1/2% and some lending rates by 2% or more.
Manufacturing Sector
2.07      With few exceptions, manufacturing industry in Greece remains entirely
private. Based on provisional data, manufacturing accounted for 23% of 1972's
GNP at constant prices and grew at a rate of 13.5%, compared to 11.8% in 1971.
Rubber, electrical machinery, metals, and oil and coal derivatives increased
their output by over 20% in 1972; they were closely followed by chemicals,
beverages, and non-metallic products. The highest manufacturing growth rates
in 1972 were registered not in consumer goods but in the intermediate and
capital goods industries. The ratio of consumer to producer goods is now
about 50:50, compared to a 60:40 split in 1960, but it should be recognized
that the largest single manufacturing categories are still consumer-oriented
(food/beverages/tobacco and textiles). The diversity of manufacturing con-
tributes to the stability of Greece's economy since no single industrial
category contributes to more than 15% of total manufacturing output.
2.07      There are about 127,000 industrial establishments in Greece.  Ac-
cording to the last industrial census (1969), about 87% of the establishments
have less than 5 employees, almost all involved in the production of consumer
goods. Only about 2% of establishments have over 20 employees, and these are
the intermediate and capital goods industries of the country. About 65% of
all manufacturing output comes from just 1,360 incorporated or limited li-
ability companies (see Annex 1) which employ about 40% of all manufacturing
workers. Broadly diversified ownership in many companies, particularly in
consumer goods, is normal in an economy at Greece's stage of growth. However,
the Government recognizes the inefficiencies which come from having 98% of



-3-
the enterprises producing only one-third of the country's manufacturing out-
put. To create greater economies of scale and efficiency, the Government is
phasing out the exemption from the turnover tax (2%) given to small-size
businesses and is granting tax benefits to those enterprises which merge and
those which incorporate.
2.08      Industrial Investment and Incentives.  Gross fixed asset formation
in manufacturing has increased from $200 million in 1970 to $213 million in
1971, and $259 million in 1972. The share of foreign investment in the fore-
going was $50 million, $42 million, and $56 million for the respective years. 1/
The Government offers a broad spectrum of tax and credit incentives for indus-
trial investment. They include tax holidays of up to 10 years, exemption from
import duties, accelerated depreciation, direct subsidization of interest rates
in tourism investment, and export insurance. The incentives are administered
case by case on the basis of each investment's merits. A new element in
incentives has just been introduced. In order to inhibit the further concen-
tration of industry in the Athens/Piraeus area, the Government has revoked
certain key incentives, decreased others, and simultaneously increased those
encouraging investment in other regions. In terms of growth in the manufac-
turing sector, it is apparent that the incentives have been successful. In
fact, it is possible that the incentives are too generous. It is not known
whether, as a result, the most efficient allocation of resources is being
achieved. Many businesses escape income taxes altogether (only 16% of total
Government tax receipts in 1972 came from income taxes of all sources); also,
companies which qualify are awarded reduced rates on other taxes, e.g. turn-
over tax, stamp duties, tax on wage and salaries, etc.
2.09      The above incentives also apply to foreign investors who, in addition,
are eligible for guarantees against expropriation and guaranteed repatriation
of profits. The package of incentives offered to foreign investors is
attractive and competitive with those offered by other mediterranean countries
associated with the EEC. The overall goals of the Government's policy are to
emphasize technology-intensive investments, joint ventures, and export industries.
2.10      Export of Manufactures.  In 1972 approximately 19% of total manufac-
turing output was exported. The exported goods had a value of $334 million
and contributed 38% of Greece's total export earnings. These figures
illustrate the degree to which the manufacturing sector, induced by incentives,
has become export-oriented since 1967 when it contributed to only 18% of total
exports. The largest categories of exported manufactures in 1972 were tex-
tiles ($84 million) and aluminum ($50 million), followed by furs, steel plates,
chemicals, cement, and petroleum products. The impressive growth of Greece's
exports can be largely attributed to (i) a few large projects undertaken by
foreign investors to exploit and process non-ferrous mineral resources, (ii)
1/   The total inflow of foreign private capital into Greece has been much
greater: $324 million in 1972; most of the funds went to real estate
investment, construction loans, and shipping.



- 4 -
the achievement of economies of scale by certain local industries, which
could consequently enter export markets, and (iii) the dropping of trade
barriers to Greek industrial products by the EEC. In 1972 the EEC took 40%
of Greece's exports.
Financial Environment
2.11      There have been no fundamental changes in the financial environment
of Greece during the past two years. The National Bank of Greece (NBG), which
is controlled by the Government, continues to dominate the banking scene.
NBG has about 65% of all the commercial bank assets in the country while the
second largest bank, the Commercial Bank of Greece group (CBG), has approxi-
mately 25%. The other commercial banks, which share the rest of the market,
are the General Hellenic Bank, Credit Bank, and seven branches of foreign
banks. There are applications for branch licenses by more foreign banks, and
it is expected that they will be approved. The Government seems to welcome
increased competition in the banking sector.
2.12      There are a number of specialized credit institutions in Greece:
the Agricultural Bank of Greece, the National Mortgage Bank of Greece, the
Mortgage Bank, the Postal Savings Bank, and the Consignations and Loans Fund.
In addition, there are about 40 general and specialized insurance companies
which have about Drs 4 billion in total assets; the insurance industry is
growing rapidly.
2.13      Investment Banks.  The investment banking field continues to be
composed of NIBID (55% owned by NBG), the Hellenic Industrial Development
Bank-HIDB (100% Government-owned), and the Investment Bank of Greece-IBG (85%
owned by CBG). A comparison of the 1971 year-end figures indicates the
relative importance of each of these institutions in term lending and in-
vestment.
(Million Drachmas)
HIDB        IBG         NIBID
Term Loans and Bonds               11,781        997        2,535
Equity Participations               22 244       143          212
TOTAL FINANCING               14,025     1,140         2,748
Long-Term Borrowings                7,371      1,053        2,281
Capital and Reserves                6,435        184          403
HIDB continues to be the Government's chosen instrument for the implementa-
tion of industrial development policies. It receives the Government's support
not only in the form of equity but also in term borrowings, of which 96% are
provided by the Bank of Greece. As of end 1971, 27% of HIDB's loan portfolio



-5-
was in shipping and represented 78% of all long-term financing to shipping
by Greek banks. HIDB is also the biggest lender for hotel construction,
followed by the two mortgage banks. In equity investments HIDB held stock
in 48 companies, of which 18 were full subsidiaries. NIBID and IBG do not
compete directly with HIDB for resources, since each investment bank has its
respective founding shareholders to rely on for funds. NIBD and IBG also
do not compete with HIDB in the financing of shipping or in term lending to
hotels, since HIDB is in charge of extending the Government's incentives
in both fields. The three investment banks compete directly in the manufac-
turing sector. As of end 1971 it is estimated that NIBID had supplied 19%
of the outstanding term financing to industry, HIDB about 28% and IBG about
8%; the rest of the term financing to industry was supplied by commercial banks
who are obliged to lend 15% of their deposits on a long term basis.
2.14      Interest Rates.  Deposit rates are regulated according to two scales,
one for foreign exchange and another for drachma. Maximum rates payable on
deposits in drachma are 0.75% on sight deposits, 7-7.5% on savings accounts,
and 8-9% on time deposits. The rates payable on time deposits from Greek
shipping companies and persons residing abroad are not controlled, so Greek
banks are able to bid freely for these funds. One result of having uncontrolled
rates for foreign exchange deposits has been that the inflow of such deposits
to Greek banks rose from $344 million in 1970 to $571 million in 1972.
2.15      The cost of credit is regulated by the Government and a key element
in economic development policy. For example, the maximum rate on export
financing and tobacco trade is 8.5% whereas imports and domestic trade credit
have a maximum rate of 14%; loans for hotel construction are heavily subsi-
dized, and agriculture is also favored with lower rates. For the industrial
sector, working capital loans can bear a maximum rate of 11%. The maximum
charge for term loans to industry is 10.5%; in addition, banks may charge
up to 1.5% profit-tied increment, bringing the possible total charge to
12%.
2.16      As noted earlier, the Government has raised interest rates twice
during the second quarter of 1973 in order to combat inflation. It is too
soon to determine with any certainty the effectiveness of these cumulative
increases, i.e. raising the rediscount rate by 2-1/2%, the deposit rates by
2-1/2%, and selected loan categories by 2-2 1/2%. In any case, this upward
revision of the interest rate structure is long over-due and welcome, since
it more accurately reflects the real cost of capital. The Government is
giving the inflationary situation its close scrutiny and has it under constant
review. In August, 1973 it was reported that the credit squeeze by the
commercial banks was beginning to have some effect.
2.17      Stock Exchange.  The Athens Stock Exchange showed a phenomenal
growth in activity during 1972. Trading volume was Drs. 7.4 billion, compared
to Drs. 2.6 billion in 1971 and Drs. 1.4 billion in 1970. Trading in bank-
insurance shares accounted for 45% of the 1972 volume, with industrials having
39% and bonds 16% of the volume. As for corporate stocks listed at end 1972



-6-
compared to 1971, the number increased from 79 to 89 (10 banks, 15 commercial,
and 64 industrials). The market value of these stocks rose from Drs. 40.6
billion in 1971 to Drs 107.2 billion for the same years. The share price index
(1964 = 100) more than doubled, from 481 at end 1971 to 1,196 for 1972. In
some cases shares were selling at price earnings ratios of over 1000:1.
2.18      The boom in the Stock Market was clearly caused by excess liquidity,
increased prosperity, restrictions on the outflow of investment capital, and
the desire of Greek investors to offset inflation by getting more than the
5-7% return available on bank deposits during 1972 (before bank rates rose).
Share prices rose drastically, simply because the market was too thin to
absorb the buyers' demand. The Government finally intervened in late December,
1972, warned about speculation and then dumped blocks of listed shares onto
the market from the investment portfolios of public enterprises, with the
result that prices dropped 40%. Share prices were then more or less frozen
at existing levels, with controls applied to the margin of price movement
allowed each day. Trade now takes place only when there is a matching of
bids and offers. The activities of the 32 brokers on the exchange are closely
watched by authorities. The Government ordered each bank or bank-controlled
enterprise to divest itself during 1973 of 45% of its shareholdings in other
banks and bank-controlled enterprises, but this measure was invalidated by
the courts. Over a two-year period, pressure to go public is being put on
the larger Greek enterprises by requiring them to increase their equity to 30%
of total borrowings. Finally, the Government permitted the establishment of
two mutual funds and an investment company in order to further the development
of the capital market (see paras. 4.14 to 4.20).
Problems
2.19      Greece's deficit in its balance of trade is a fundamental problem
which has steadily worsened over the past five years. In 1972 the cost of
imports ($2.4 billion) was only one-third covered by exports ($835 million),
and the net income from invisibles did not fill the gap; consequently, the
current account was also in deficit (-$374 million). Since Greece has a high
propensity to import and since its trade barriers vis-a-vis the EEC are being
continually reduced, there is not much scope for curbing imports. Although
tourism and shipping are expected to continue growing at a healthy pace, the
increase in emigrant remittances cannot be considered a long-term source of
foreign exchange income. Export possibilities for agricultural goods and
raw materials are limited. Therefore, the burden of covering the trade gap
is being placed on Greece's manufacturing sector which must increase its
ability to export and to replace imports.
2.20      To succeed, the Government's strategy of increasing exports and
replacing imports requires Greek industry to become more efficient and, thus,
more competitive. At present, manufacturing is heavily dependent on the
domestic market which absorbs four-fifths of the output; yet, for certain
categories of manufactured goods, the domestic market still relies heavily



-7-
on imports. 1/ Although there are, consequently, branches of industry
with plenty of scope for import substitution, there are also branches where
local demand is inadequate to support even one plant of optimum size. With
unused capacity, some plants tend to over-diversify their production, which
just adds to the misallocation of resources. The most urgent needs in the
manufacturing sector are for better management methods, larger units of pro-
duction, and greater use of technology. Since the supply of labor has become
inelastic (there is a dire shortage of skilled workers and professional
managers), manufacturing must perforce turn to more capital intensive methods
in order to raise production output per man. To summarize, regardless of the
market orientation, export or domestic, Greece's industrial sector must become
more efficient, modern, and capital intensive, and it is on these improvements
that NIBID has worked and still has an important contribution to make.
III. NIBID'S RESOURCES. OPERATIONS, PORTFOLIO, AND FINANCIAL SITUATION
Resources
3.01      As of March 31, 1973 NIBID had, during its lifetime, undertaken
long-term borrowings of approximately $188 million (see Annex 2). Of this
amount, the Bank of Greece has supplied 35%, 2/ NBG 33%, IBRD 31%, and NIBID's
European shareholders 1%. The support of NBG has been essential in order to
get NIBID underway and to sustain it; also, these loans to NIBID helped fill
the obligation which NBC has, as a commercial bank, to loan 15% of its deposits
on a long-term basis. Continuous borrowings from the Bank of Greece have been
an indicator of the Government's support for NIBID's operations. The average
cost of all these Drachma resources is about 5.25%, The IBRD loans to NIBID
have been vital in filling the resource gap which started to open up in 1968
when NIBID's business began picking up momentum.
3.02      NIBID did not try to tap private markets either in Greece or abroad
until 1970 when it borrowed $2.2 million for five years from its European
shareholders. This $2.2 million was obtained at a floating rate which has
turned out to be so high, on occasion, that it has resulted in a negative
spread. For this reason and because adequate funds have been available from
its usual sources at fixed rates permitting an adequate margin, NIBID did not
return to the foreign capital market during 1971 or 1972. This situation has
now changed in view of the upward revision in the interest rate structure in
Greece, and NIBID is undertaking foreign borrowing again (para. 6.11). In
the local private market, NIBID has not tried to float bonds, because the
cost of competing with the Government issues which dominate the market would
have been prohibitive. In order to undertake increased borrowings, NIBID had
to increase its share capital base by 50% in 1972 through an offering of
non-voting preferred stock to its existing shareholders.
1/   In 1972 manufactured consumer goods amounted to 28% of Greece's import
bill and capital goods, 29%.
2/   Borrowings from the Bank of Greece include a Dr 300 million loan,
subordinated to other loans, and ranking pari-passu with share capital
in the event of liquidation.



-8-
3.03      NIBID's resource position as of June 30, 1973 (see Annex 3) showed
total available resources of Dr 5,764 million ($192 million), of which 29%
were Bank funds. The uncommitted balance of funds was Dr 1,148 million, $38
million equivalent, and represented almost entirely the two recent drawings
of Dr. 500 million each from the Bank of Greece and NBG. NIBID expects to
commit this $38 million balance by November, 1973.
Operations
3.04      Loans and Egqity Investments.  NIBID's operations are summarized
in Annex 4. Operations in 1972 followed closely NIBID's previous forecast
in terms of overall volume and grew by about 9% over 1971. The following
table summarizes NIBID's operations since its inception (Dr million):
Loans Approved      Equity Investments Approved    Commitments
No.    Amount          No.           Amount             Amount
1964/68     66      1,092.6         9               71.3               934.0
1969        42        747.6         1                2.5               500.0
1970        66      1,072.1         6               98.5             1,027.0
1971        73      1,253.5         9               31.1             1,025.1
1972        59      1,125.2        21              268.8             1,329.8
5,791.0                       472.2              4,815.9
/1   NIBID's commitments follow approvals with about 2 months delay, based
on average of the last three years. Only very few projects disappear
between approval and commitment.
This table illustrates the growing importance of equity investments. NIBID is
drawing the benefits from its patient and long-term work with clients, who now
consider NIBID a useful partner in ownership, and not just a term lender.
Approvals of equity investments in 1972 represented 114% of NIBID's total
equity approvals since inception, in terms of volume, and 84% in terms of
number of approvals. About 20% of 1972 approvals were equity investments.
This is a good development.
3,05      The apparent decrease of loan approvals in 1972 is misleading.  Due
to the backlog of work and staffing constraints, NIBID was unable to process
the high volume of projects, so many of them were not ready for approval until
1973. As a result, NIBID's pipeline as of April 1973 was extremely large
(about Dr 2.2 billion). Processing capacity continues to be a bottleneck and
more staff is needed.
3.06      Most of NIBID's loans are for ten years terms, the legal maximum
for industry. 1/. This is an adequate period for most of NIBID's clients.
In 1972, 52% of NIBID projects were for expansion and modernization. NIBID's
loans bore interest at the legal maximum of 8.5% up to July, 1973 when the
rate was increased to 10.5%. In addition, investment banks are allowed to
charge a profit tied increment of up to 1.5%, bringing NIBID's total loan yield
1/   Extension beyond this legal maximum must be authorized by the Currency
Committee.



-9-
to a possible 12%. However, in the competitive banking situation currently
prevailing in Greece, NIBID is seldom able to charge a profit tied increment
of more than 0.5%, and sometimes no increment is charged at all.
Evaluation of Loan and Equity Portfolio
3.07      As of March 31, 1973, NIBID had loans and equity investments out-
standing totalling Dr 4,183 million ($139 million equivalent) in 235 companies.
As of April 18, 1973, arrears of principal and interest over three months were
Dr 30.2 million; the loans outstanding from these clients in arrears totalled
Dr 161 million, or 4.2% of the loan portfolio at the same date. This repre-
sents a substantial decrease from the April 30, 1972 figure, which was 6.9%.
A detailed review of NIBID's arrears showed that only six companies, repre-
senting an outstanding amount of Dr. 91.7 million (2.2% of total portfolio)
are experiencing difficulties. All these companies can overcome their problems,
although NIBID might have to reschedule one or two loans. NIBID does not
expect to suffer any losses on its loans to these companies since, in all cases,
NIBID's loans are covered by adequate security. There are no companies which
are in difficulties but not in arrears. NIBID has never been obliged to write
off any loan, and it had to litigate on only one occasion in order to liquidate
assets pledged as security. The quality of NIBID's portfolio forms the basis
for the provision adjustment described in para 3.13.
3.08      NIBID's equity portfolio is shown in Annex 5.  NIBID has Dr 298.4
million in equity participations outstanding in 31 companies. Law 148/67
obliges NIBID to show in its balance sheets any stock dividends received and
to value them at par. As of December 31, 1972, such stock dividends amounted
to Dr 25.3 million. Two large investments, Aluminum de Grece (Dr 56.5 million)
and Titan Cement (Dr 41.3 million) account for 33% of NIBID's share holdings.
Sixteen of the 31 companies have been profitable and have distributed dividends.
Ten companies are starting up, or in pre-operation stage. Five companies are
operating at a loss, but only one (ADL Hellas) has little prospect of becoming
profitable. Only four companies are listed on the Athens Stock Exchange.
3.09      Earnings from NIBID's equity portfolio have greatly improved.
Dividends out of 1971 profits, represented 5.6% of the average 1970-1971
portfolio. Much more important are the capital gains NIBID has been able
to realize: Dr 3.8 million in 1970, 6.9 million in 1971, and then 33.3
million in 1972. Total earnings from equity portfolio thus amounted to Dr
43.4 million in 1972, or 17% of the average 1971-1972 equity portfolio and
14% of gross 1972 income. Potential capital gains on NIBID's equity portfo-
lio are substantial even after the Government's recent measures to curb the
increase of share prices.
3.10      As of December 31, 1972, the aggregate market value for quoted
stocks, the book value for unquoted stocks, and the stock dividends taken at
per amounted to a total value for NIBID's equity portfolio of approximately
125% above its acquisition cost. (See Annex 5) This derives primarily from
the high trading prices on two of the listed stocks in NIBID's portfolio.
Given the scarcity of good securities on the market, as well as the increasing
demand, share prices should not decline in the near future. Even if they were
to decrease, it is very unlikely that NIBID would actually suffer any loss



- 10 -
on its equity portfolio. As for the non-listed shares, their estimated value
is based on the book value of the companies, as of December 31, 1971 since
full 1972 results are not yet available. Most of the companies did not
revalue their assets and thus their book value understates their real value.
Some of these companies, under NIBID's encouragement, are expected to be
listed on the Athens Stock Exchange in the near future.
3.11      NIBID's loan and equity portfolios are sound.  This is due to NIBID's
effective appraisal work and to the satisfactory business climate which has
been prevailing in Greece in the last four years. If this climate were to
deteriorate, some clients of NIBID would undoubtedly experience difficulties;
but NIBID's loans are well secured, usually by mortgages covering about twice
the original amount of the loan, and therefore the likelihood of final losses
is remote. NTIBID's equity portfolio is also relatively liquid since 33% of it
is composed of shares considered to be very marketable. Furthermore, NIBID's
provisions and reserves, at December 31, 1972, stood at 6.3% of total portfo-
lio, a comfortable cushion. During the first half of 1973, according to
unaudited figures, the quality of NIBID's equity portfolio improved and the
proportion of equity investments to total portfolio increased, which is in
accordance with NIBID's evolving role as an investment bank.
Financial Performance and Conditions
3.12      Audit.  NIBID's fiscal year ends on December 31.  The  accounts are
audited by "The Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Greece" and audit
reports submitted to the Bank are satisfactory. Although the auditors give
their opinion within three months in a short report, which is embodied in
NIBID's annual report, they have never been able to submit within three months
the long form report required by the Bank. It was agreed during negotiations
that NIBID would press the auditors to furnish the long form to the Bank
within six months maximum.
3.13      Income Performance.  Annex 6 gives NIBID's audited income statements
for 1968-1972. Under the Greek tax law, investment banks are allowed to
charge against income, every year, up to 2% of average portfolio for provisions
against possible losses. NIBID has taken advantage of the law, but the amount
of provisions thus accumulated substantially exceeds at present a prudent
cover for possible losses. To derive actual net profits and financial position,
the annual provision has been calculated, in the annexes, in such a way that
the year-end accumulative provision is equal to 2% of the year-end portfolio,
an adequate loss cover.  The remainder is considered as earnings and entered
in balance sheets as equity. NIBID's profitability, rather low in the past,
improved significantly during the past two years, mainly on account of capital
gains from the equity portfolio and increased leverage on NIBID's own equity.
The following are significant ratios:

3.14      NIBID operated on a margin of 3.5-3.6%, which has remained stable
during the last three years and should continue under the revised interest
rate structure of Greece. Administrative expenses as a percentage of total
assets continue to decrease and are now about 0.7%, reflecting NIBID's high
productivity. NIBID could well afford to increase its staff, and is in fact
doing so, when suitable candidates are found.
3.15      NIBID has been paying dividends since 1967.  From 2% in that year,
the rate increased to 6% in 1971. The dividend for 1972 is proposed at 6%.
With dividends at that level, the pay-out ratio has been low: 49% in 1970,
35% in 1971, and 34% in 1972. NIBID's management does not propose to raise
the dividend for 1972 above 6% since it considers the capital gains of
Dr 5,000 per share afforded to the existing shareholders in 1973, through
the sale of their preferred NIBID shares to the public, to be a satisfactory
addition to the shareholders' earnings (see para. 4.02).
3.16      NIBID still pays no corporate taxes, since part of its income is
tax-free, and large provision allowances are permitted by law.
3.17      Financial Position.  Annex 7 shows NIBID's audited balance sheets
for 1968-1972, adjusted as explained in para. 3.13. In 1972, NIBID's total
assets increased by 37%, to be compared with a 48% growth in 1971. Total
portfolio grew by 43%, from Dr 2.7 billion ($90 million) to Dr 3.9 billion
($130 million) reflecting the rapid growth of approvals in the last three
years. Following the 1972 share capital increase, NIBID's long-term debt/
equity ratio was 5.5:1 as of December 31, 1972, compared with 6.4:1 as of
December 31, 1971. Agreements with the Bank have limited NIBID's long-term
debt to seven times its equity.
3.18      The book value of NIBID's shares, on December 31, 1972, was 138%
of their par value, compared with 134% in 1971. Book value did not grow as
much as it could have, because the share capital increase of 1972 was made at
par, when NIBID had substantial reserves. Book value is also underestimated
because NIBID has substantial unrealized capital gains coming from its equity
portfolio.
3.19      From the above, it appears that NIBID is financially strong and
an efficiently managed company.
IV. THE COMPANY - INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Policies
4.01      Annex 8 shows NIBID's Statement of Policies and Procedures, and it
is satisfactory to the Bank. There has been one significant change in NIBID's
policies and that concerns the limit on total equity portfolio investments.
Previously, NIBID's overall equity investments were limited to 100% of NIBID's
"unimpaired equity" (paid-in capital and surplus accounts). NIBID requested
in June, 1973 that the definition of "unimpaired equity" be expanded to
include the Dr 300 million subordinated loan from the Bank of Greece, this



- 12 -
enlarged limit to be valid until June 30, 1977 unless extended. The Bank
agreed to this change of policy in view of NIBID's increased opportunities
to contribute to the capitalization of Greek companies and, concomitantly,
to market new shores to the general public. However, the Bank's approval is
conditioned upon NIBID's carefully reviewing its equity portfolio between
January and June of 1976 and, of course, again in 1977 when this expanded
definition of "unimpaired equity" expires unless renewed. The purpose of
the review procedures is to ensure that steps are taken to maintain the equity
portfolio's value, liquidity, and marketability.
Ownership
4.02      Annex 9 shows NIBID's ownership.  NBG continues to hold 55% of the
voting stock, and IFC's share of voting stock remains 7%. In April 1972,
NIBID increased its share capital from Dr 300 million to Dr 450 million
through a Dr 150 million issue of non-voting, preferred (6% dividend) shares
which were sold to its existing shareholders. Except for IFC and Svenska
Handelsbanken, all of NIBID's shareholders exercised their rights. In order
to broaden its ownership base and get its name known in the capital market
for future borrowings, NIBID proposed that these preferred shares be sold to
the public. The existing shareholders agreed to this, so, in July, 1973
approximately 70% of the non-voting preferred shares were sold through the
Athens Stock Exchange at Dr 8,000 each (par value is Dr 3,000). 1/ The issue
was two and one-half times over-subscribed, with 9,900 new shareholders coming
to own 15 shares or less of NIBID. The remaining 30% of the preferred shares
were sold to NIBID's Mutual Fund and to another bank for sale to the general
public.
Board of Directors and Executive Committee
4.03      The composition of NIBID's Board and Executive Committee (Annex 10)
has not changed significantly.  Mr. Christos Achis, Governor of NBG, remains
Chairman of NIBID's Board. Mr. Harold Linder represents IFC on NIBID's
Board and Executive Committee. The Board has delegated all its powers, to The
extent permitted by law, to the Executive Committee which has, in turn,
delegated authority to sanction loans up to Dr 45 million and supplementary
financing of up to 30% to a sub-committee consisting of three of its members
resident in Athens. In addition, NIBID's Managing Director has authority to
approve operations up to Dr 15 million. In Septemiber 1972, the Executive
Committee decided that sales of shares held in NIBID's portfolio will be
governed by the same rules. 2/ In addition, sales of up to 10% of any invest-
ment, regardless of the amount, can be authorized - jointly - by NIBID's
Managing Director and by the Chairman of the Executive Committee.
4.04      Board and Executive Committee meetings are held twice a year, and
deal with general matters. Projects requiring the Executive Committee approval
are circulated by mail for approval. Some of the foreign directors in the
1/   At Dr 8,000 the P:E rates of these preferred shares on the basis of 1972
earnings was 15:1, which is a modest multiple in view of other P:E
ratios of some Greek stocks (see para. 1.17).
2/   The shares to be sold will be valued at acquisition cost.



- 13 -
Executive Committee actively share among themselves comments or questions
raised on projects. NIBID often seeks the advice of its foreign directors on
important matters, before they are formally raised in the Committee.
Management, Staff and Organization
4.05      Mr. George Gondicas, NIBID's Managing Director, continues to provide
strong leadership to the company. His main staff support is Mr. Christodoulou
who looks after the day to day operations. A new group dealing with tourism
projects has been organized under a competent officer, since NIBID's hotel
financing is expected to increase in terms of volume and scope. In addition,
the Follow-up and Transaction Department has been reorganized and properly
staffed. The senior and middle level staff of NIBID is competent, dedicated
and hard working. Annex 11 gives NIBID's organization list.
4.06      NFBID's professional staff increased from 37 in 1970 to 52 in
1972. There are 24 professionals in the three Operations Departments which
handle appraisals, and they are headed by very competent and experienced
officers; together they receive technical support from four engineers. NIBID
has just hired an economist who will set up the new Economic Department, a
development which had been planned for some time.
4.07      Technical aspects of NIBID's work are competently handled by its
engineering section as far as civil works and technically simple projects are
concerned. NIBID uses ADL Hellas, 1/ its subsidiary, to handle the more compli-
cated cases. ADL Hellas has not been a success in Greece, because the economy
is not yet ready to make use of consultants of the ADL type. In any case NIBID
continues to draw upon the services of ADL Brussels through ADL Hellas, and
this arrangement is satisfactory. However, NIBID plans to increase its own
technical staff, particularly at the senior level.
4.08      If NIBID is to continue its rapid growth and to diversify its
activities, it must hire additional competent staff, because there is already
an overload of work. Greece has a dire shortage of managerial talent, so
NIBID has difficulty in finding qualified, experienced officers. The new
officers recruited by NIBID seem promising, but have to be trained for two
to three years in order to become fully effective, as they are generally
fresh graduates from universities. Though such training adds to the burden
on NIBID's senior staff, it is apparently the only long run solution to
broaden NIBID's effective personnel.
Procedures
4.09      Appraisals.  The quality of NIBID's appraisals is, with occasional
lapses, very good compared to other development banks. NIBID's investigations
are thorough and far-reaching. NIBID is also helping its clients particularly
the medium and small ones shape their projects. This role has been economi-
cally efficient and financially rewarding, as evidenced by the numerous
repeat clients in NIBID's portfolio and by the success of NIBID's projects.
1/   A consultant firm, established by Arthur D. Little (ADL) and NIBID.



- 14 -
4.10      NIBID's appraisals will be expanded to include quantification of
the economic merits of projects. The Bank has pressed NIBID to examine in
depth the longer term competitiveness of its projects. In 1972, there was
improvement but more is needed. During negotiations NIBID agreed to
undertake a full-fledged economic rate of return analysis of its larger
projects. The Bank is providing NIBID with guidelines and assistance to
develop its capabilities in this area.
4.11      Procurement and Disbursement.  Procurement for expansion projects
is usually tied to the same suppliers, due-to the requirements of compatibility
in machinery and design. Procurement on new projects always involves compe-
titive bidding, because it is the character of the Greek businessman to bargain
for the best price. NIBID's engineers and follow-up personnel check the
quality and prices of project items during the process of examining documents
against contract requirements. NIBID's disbursement practices are satisfac-
tory. Since the foreign exchange risk on NIBID's borrowings from the Bank
is borne by the Bank of Greece, NIBID has no problems with the kind of curren-
cies the Bank disburses, except for Swiss Francs on which NIBID's borrowers
are required to pay a Swiss 2% transfer tax.
4.12      Follow-up and Transactions Department.  This Department has been
reorganized and strengthened in 1972 by increasing the number of professional
staff to 6 and by appointing as Department Head one of NIBID's experienced
employees. In 1972, 46% of NIBID's clients were covered by follow-up reports,
or appraisals of expansion projects, which constitute a form of supervision.
All clients in arrears or in difficulty were visited. This development is
satisfactory and contrasts with the past when follow-up derived more from
the intimate knowledge of clients by NIBID's top officers and was not ade-
quately formalized. NIBID plans to expand its coverage in the future, a
necessary development in view of its growing number of clients. The follow-up
reports are of good quality, focus on all the important aspects of the company
and compare forecasts and results. They are circulated to the management and
to the appraisal officers who take appropriate action when necessary in order
to assist the client solve the problem identified. The Follaw-up Department
also handles "transactions". From the time a contract is signed, it examines
and handles all documents upon which disbursement is conditioned and then
oversees the fulfillment of the loan contract, including the collection of
arrears and the payment to NIBID of profit participations and dividends.
4.13      Reporting Arrangements.  NIBID's reporting to the Bank on its
activities is satisfactory. Complete quarterly and semi-annual reports are
received both by the Bank and by NIBID's Directors.
Mutual Fund
4.14      Following the 1971 passage of a law regulating portfolio investment
companies, three mutual funds have been established in Greece. The Mutual
Fund associated with NIBID was established in cooperation with DEGAB, a
subsidiary of the Deutsche Bank, and an ad-hoc company established by
ten Greek shipowners. NIBID owns 50% of the 10 million Dr share capital
of the management company and contributed 50% to the initial Dr 50 million
capital of the fund. The National Bank of Greece is the trustee of the fund.



- 15 -
The law provides that the fund can invest in Greek llsted securities, foreign
securities (not more than 20% of the fund's assets), Greek unlisted shares
(not more than 20% of the fund's assets), and short term money market instru-
ments. Regulations have been enacted by the Capital Market Committee as re-
gards the pricing of unlisted shares which are to be calculated by averaging
book value and price earning ratio.
4.15      NIBID's Mutual Fund (DELOS) is managed by a Management Company headed
by Mr. G. Panas, former Governor of HIDB. Investment decisions are taken by
a 75% majority of the Investment Committee, on which the three shareholders
of the Management Company are represented. NIBID and Deutsche Bank are
providing most of the technical support needed by the Management Company for
the time being, but appropriate staffing of this company will come in due
course.
4.16      The mutual fund began selling its units, through NBG's offices,
in April 1973.  With very little publicity, about Dr 265 million in units
were sold by June 30 to 4,000 investors, with a limit of Dr 100,000 for
each unit holder.  This gives an indication of the favorable response of small
and medium investors to this new vehicle Which potentially allows them to
benefit from the growth of companies in which they could not invest directly.
4.17      For the time being, the fund's investment possibilities are e7L~i-ated
at about Dr 1 billion, deriving from equity investments both in listed and
unlisted companies and from the possibility of investing 20% of the fund's
assets in foreign securities. As of June 30 the fund's assets were invested
55% in shares listed on the Athens exchange, 7% in unlisted shares, 21% in
listed boads, with the remaining 17% held in cash. One of the fund's main
goals will be to invest in unlisted companies in Greece, then to spread
ownership of those companies and eventually to get them listed. It takes
time, however, to find the right situations for investment in unlistcd
companies, and this explains why so much of the fund's assets have initial>-
been invested in listed shares.
4.18      Generating new securities will obviously be more difficult than
marketing existing shares, whether listed or unlisted, and will depend moreon
NIBID's own actions than on the fund's. However, due to the development of
the economy, the emergence of a class of industrialists, the regulations
enacted by the Government, and the work of the three development banks in
Greece, it seems that Greek industry is increasingly aware that the capital
market is a useful source of funds. The mutual funds are the first real
attempt to broaden share ownership in Greece.
NIBID's Relations with Government and NBC
4.19      Relations with the Government and the Bank of Greece can be consid-
ered good. As explained above, NIBID's parent company, the National Bank of
Greece, is by far the most important commercial bank in Greece. The Govern-
ment is the largest single shareholder and it controls the selection of NBG's
Governor. Although NBG owns 55% of NIBID's share capital, all important



- 16 -
decisions, such as nomination of NIBID's managing director, require a 70%
majority at the Board. Thus far, NBG has in the main been helpful to NIBID:
it has provided resources and seconded the hard core of NIBID's staff. In
addition, during the first years of NIBID's existence, NBG also directed cus-
tomers to it. However, NIBID has since been able to establish more independ-
ence and, more importantly, its own reputation and financial standing. This
process is not yet entirely completed but it is continuing.
4.20      NIBID has grown very rapidly and is diversifying its activities.  It
is now to a certain extent competing with NBG in term lending and equity
investment. It is important that NIBID's efforts to become a completely inde-
pendent and broadly-owned institution continue to be supported. NIBID's ob-
jective is to broaden its ownership base, to attract increasingly substantial
resources from the domestic capital market and conventional foreign lenders,
and to secure thereby its independence as an autonomous institution. Events
during the remainder of this year and 1974 are expected to demonstrate that
NIBID will succeed in establishing full autonomy. This being so, financiai
assistance from the Bank may be discontinued in later years.
V.  NIBID's ECONOMC IMPACT
5.01      Greek industry needs to become more efficient, capital intensive,
and competitive in order to play the key role it has in overcoming Greece's
serious trade deficit (described in paras. 2.19 and 2.20). NIBID specifically
has played a very useful role in helping the manufacturing sector modernize
so that it can compete with imports and become more export-oriented.
Quantification of Economic Impact
5.02      Since its inception, NIBID has made 340 loans and investments to
235 clients. An analysis of operations from 1964 to 1972 is given in Annex 12.
A review of the characteristics of NIBID's operations illustrates the quanti-
tative impact NIBID has on the manufacturing sector.
(a) Volume of Lending. Total financing by NIBID since its creation
has amounted to $192 million, of which 78% were straight loans,
14% bond loans, and 8% equity. NIBID's share of total term
lending to industry in Greece has grown from an estimated 15%



- 17 -
in 197O to 20% in 1972. This is a significant amount when it is
recognized, first, that the Government's investment bank (HIDB)
holds close to 30% of term debt to the industrial sector and is an
instrument of Government policy for very large projects and
public sector industries. It should also be recognized that
over half of term lending to industry comes from commercial
banks which do it because banking regulations require them to
lend 15% of deposits on a term basis (these term loans are merely
an adjunct to their regular commercial banking business and are
not given the kind of analysis and supervision which a develop-
ment finance company gives to term lending). The only other
major source of term lending to industry is IBG (see para 2.14),
and NIBID is twice as big as IBG and growing faster.
(b) Size of Clients. The average size of all NIBID's operations is
about Dr 17 million. 1/ In 1972 the average was somewhat higher -
Dr 17 million ($633,000). However, 35 projects out of a total
of 73 in 1972 were for loans or equity investments of less than
Dr 10 million ($333,000); only seven operations were above Dr 50
million ($1.6 million) in amount, with the remaining 66 averaging
Dr 12 million. This clearly illustrates that NIBID is very
significantly involved with the smaller and medium-sized industries
in Greece.
(c) Geographical Distribution. The spread of NIBID's financing is
shown by the map in Annex 13. As of end 1972, 45% of NIBID's
financing had been for projects in the Athens-Piraeus area,
compared with 55% as of the end of 1971. In 1972, two-thirds of
the approvals were for projects located outside the Athens-Piraeus
area. Thus, NIBID's operations are in accord with the Bank's
recommendations about distributing industry to other parts of the
country. NIBID can and does bring to the attention of its clients
the financial advantages of establishing their new plants outside
Athens-Piraeus (see para. 2.08).
(d) Sales and Exports. The majority of the projects financed by
NIBID have had an export orientation. The projected increase
in sales due to the projects financed by NIBID in 1972 was
Dr 5.1 billion, of which 43% were exports. In 1972 the leading
sector to receive NIBID's assistance was metal products (26%
of NIBID's approvals), followed by textiles (21%); both of
them are the leading export industries of Greece.
1/ NIBID's financing typically accounts for 30% to 40% of the total cost of
projects. The percentage of NIBID's funds used by the borrowers for
foreign procurement is about 40%. Greek companies can obtain foreign
currencies needed to buy imported equipment and material since the
drachma is convertible for capital goods imports.  As a result,
NIBID has never attempted to cover the full amount of the import
component of the projects it finances.



- 18 -
NIBID's Impact on Employment
5.03      Greece has enjoyed full employment during the past two years and
has not only a serious shortage of trained managers and skilled workers but,
very recently, has had to import some industrial workers on a short-term
basis. Increased employment resulting from NIBID financed projects was 1,378
jobs in 1971 and 2,573 in 1972. The average cost per job created by the
projects in which NIBID was involved was $46,000. This represents a 20%
increase over the 1970 figure of $39,000 per worker but is actually a decline
If inflation and two drachma devaluations are taken into account. As explained
in para. 2.20, the problems of Greece's manufacturing sector can only be
solved by increased efficiency, to come from plant modernization and more
capital intensive production methods. The higher cost of job creation in
NIBID financed projects compared to many other DFC's is an indicator of this
modernization and, therefore, of increased output per employee and greater
price competitiveness in the domestic and foreign markets. NIBID financed
projects have, on occasion, resulted in saving jobs which might otherwise
have been lost because of troubles encountered by the employing firm due to
increased competition; with modernization financed by NIBID, there is thus
the benefit of job preservation.
5.04      Although it is an industrial development bank, NIBID has in fact
contributed to job creation in the one sector of Greece's economy which does
have some underemployment, namely, agriculture. By financing industries
which use agricultural raw materials, NIBID has indirectly fostered greater
employment in rural areas. However, due to the lack of data it is not possi-
ble to estimate accurately the number of farm jobs directly attributable to
NIBID's financing of agricultural processing industries. In any case, NIBID
during the 1969-73 (June) period financed 30 projects in the cotton textile
industry, for a total of Dr 800 million; Greek cotton production increased by
an estimated 28% over the same period. Forestry has been stimulated by NIBID's
investment of Dr 420 million in wood processing and furniture companies. In
the food and beverage industry, NIBID financed 30 projects over the 1969-72
period amounting to Dr 575 million.
NIBID's Influence on Client Operations
5.05      The qualitative benefits of NIBID's relationships with its clients
is recognized by the Greek business community. Manufacturers who come to
NIBID for financing recognize the value and generally welcome the results
of NIBID's appraisals of proposed projects. NIBID is often able to reshape
and improve upon the technical and financial aspects of its clients' under-
takings. In 1972 NIBID in fact turned down a number of prospective deals
because investigation proved that the projects, although financially viable,
were not economically sound. It is the small and medium-sized clients in
particular who benefit most from NIBID's influence.
5.06      Besides subscribing its own funds to the capital of its clients,
NTBID also solicits capital participation from other sources; inside Greece
this usually means that NBG is approached, then HIDB; outside Greece, it means



- 19 -
sources in EEC countries. Because of its extensive European contacts, NIBID
was able during 1972 to draw a half dozen foreign investors into projects,
and not just for their capital contribution but, more significantly, because
of the technology, marketing and management which the foreign investors could
provide.  NIBID also promotes mergers of Greek companies when their operations
are complementary, when efficiency would increase, or when there is prospect
of a synergistic effect.
5.07      Once a project is underway, whether a new enterprise or an expansion,
NIBID continues to provide advice and ass'stance to its clients. For example,
NIBID arranges licensing agreements with foreign firms, obtains export market
information, and, for about 15% of its clients, assists in obtaining consultants
for technical or administrative jobs. Occasionally NIBID has been called to
act as referee in disputes between shareholders.
NIBID's Role in the Capital Market
5.08      The strong growth in NIBID's equity portfolio was illustrated, in
1972, by the great increase in investment approvals and the 17% return on
average equity portfolio. During 1973 between 15-20% of NIBID's financing
will be in the form of equity and quasi-equity investments. NIBID's portfo-
lio, valued at cost, increased by 41% in 1972 over 1971 and future prospects
are for continued growth of this magnitude. Only four out of the 31 companies
in NIBID's equity portfolio are listed on the Athens Stock Exchange, and this
illustrates that NIBID is investing in those second-echelon companies which
need capital but are not yet ready to go public. However, since NIBID's
management makes it a practice of bringing to the attention of its clients
the various advantages (tax reductions, etc.) which come from being listed
on the Athens Stock Exchange, there are prospects that more NIBID clients
will be going public soon. NIBID also makes bond loans which can be sold
on the market, and this technique will be used increasingly in the future.
The initial success of NIBID's Mutual Fund is another important way in which
NIBID is helping build the Greek capital market. Finally, the significance
of NIBID's selling its preferred shares to the public in July, 1973 should be
recognized, because it has made NIBID one of the most widely held companies
in the country.
Conclusions
5.09      The foregoing illustrates that NIBID's activities contribute to the
efficiency, competitiveness, and modernization of its clients' operations.
NIBID has proven that, even in a very competitive environment, in which
commercial banks extend term credit without thorough analysis and at slightly
lower interest rates, rigorous project appraisals can be carried out without
adverse effects on the volume of business. In fact, with more business in
sight than it can presently handle, NIBID is now in the comfortable position
of selecting the more interesting prospective deals, declining others, and
then employing higher standards of appraisal. Proof of the success in
applying quality criteria is the number of repeat clients in the portfolio,
the low level of problem projects, the rising profitability of NIBID, and
the large volume of productive enterprises which NIBID finances.



- 20 -
5.10      There is nevertheless room for NIBID to enhance its contribution by
making use of the economic analysis to be included in its appraisals. Further-
more, as an institution, NIBID also needs to diversify its resources further
and to broaden its ownership base so that it becomes financially self-
sufficient and fully independent in its operations.
VI. NIBID's FUTURE OPERATIONS
Economic Forecast
6.01      Preparation of the 1973-1977 economic development plan has not been
completed, but it is expected that the plan will stress the modernization
of industry and emphasize ship-building, tourism and agriculture as key sectors.
It is now known that the plan will project real growth at 8% p.a., with industry
growing at an 11% rate. The Bank's own projections, made in 1971, indicate
the possibility of GNP growth through 1978 at an annual rate of 7% (constant
1971 prices), GNP per capita at 6.3% p.a., exports at 11% and imports at 8X
p.a.; by 1978 the debt service ratio would be about 10%. In tourism it is
definitely known that the Government would like hotel bed capacity to increase
by 190% in order to handle estimated tourist arrivals of 6 million in 1977, a
target which seems realistic in light of current trends. Economic growth
during 1973 and perhaps early 1974 will in all likelihood be below the high
1972 rate (10.5%) because of the Government's policy of combating inflation
(see para. 2.05).
6.02      Sources of 'strength in the economy over the next five years are,
first, foreign exchange income which should continue to mount from shipping
and tourism, although emigrant remittances will probably level off. The very
attractive incentives to invest in industry and the opportunities for duty-
free industrial exports to the EEC should continue to support the rising trend
in exports of manufactured goods and foreign investment in Greece. There is
still plenty of scope for efficient import substitution. Soft spots in the
economy are the shortages of trained management and skilled labor, and the
vulnerability to fluctuations in world market prices for imported raw materials
and the export of semi-finished metals; also increased competition in domestic
and foreign markets will take some toll among the less efficient Greek
enterprises. Greece's economy is becoming closely linked to the EEC, Germany
in particular, and this inter-relatior wiLl strongly influence the future
growth rate.
NIBID*s Forecast of Cperations
6.03      NTBID's forecast of ov'erations  wver the period 1973-1977 is
shown in Annex 14.  One year ago, N.BID) txtected the volume of its operattons
to level o£, because NIIID tno_.ght it rnac reached what could ce its normal
share of iong term busiless it- Greece, an6 that this share could not be
substantially increased.  nowever, the strong growth oA Greece"s industrial
sector, the emergence of export possibilities and NIBID's momentum and
reputation in industrial circles have changed the picture, and it appears



- 21 -
that NIBID's business will continue to grow. This situation is illustrated
by the large pipeline of projects NIBID had at June 30, 1973, which totalled
Dr 1.6 billion ($73 million equivalent), for projects which were all almost
firm.
6.04      A review of this pipeline was made, keeping in mind NIBID's process-
ing capacity which is its main constraint. NIBID's approvals in 1973 should
be at a minimum of about Dr 1,800 million, a 29% increase over 1972; this
large increase is the result of a number of projects received late in 1972
which slipped into 1973. For 1974 and 1975, NIBID has projected an annual
growth of about 20% a year, on the grounds that Greek industry is compelled
to invest in order to strengthen and increase its competitiveness vis-a-vis
Europe and to exploit the fast growing domestic market for consumer goods
as well as for capital goods. The rate of growth of industrial investment
should continue, barring any unforeseen reversal of the general economic
situation. NIBID's ambitious targets for the 1973-75 period seem attainable
given the overall economic climate. To obtain them, NIBID must expand its
processing capacity, as it plans to do.
6.05      Equity Investments.  NIBID has forecast its approvals of equity
investments to increase from Dr 200 million in 1973 to Dr 300 million in
1975. This is a conservative forecast since NIBID has now made its mark in
the equity investment field and is regarded by investors as a desirable
partner; also, NIBID plans to increase its equity investments in hotels.
Given the impressive increase of NIBID's investment activities in 1972 and
the expected expansion of the capital market in Greece, NIBID's projections
on its equity portfolio growth could well be exceeded, which is the reason
why NIBID's policy limit on the size of its equity portfolio has been expanded
(para. 4.01).
Projected Commitments and Resources over the next two years
6.06      Commitments.  The process of approvals - commitments-disbursements
in NIBID's operations is, naturally, subject to the swings of the annual
business cycle in Greece. For example, only about one-fourth of NIBID's
approvals and commitments for 1973 were made during the first six months of
the year. For all of 1973 NIBID is projecting commitments of Dr 2.15 billion.
Since the commitments up to June 30 were Dr 528 million, this meant Dr. 1,622
million in commitments would occur during the last half of 1973. As of June
30 NIBID's resources available for commitments were Dr. 1,148 million, i.e.
Dr 424 million less than the remaining 1973 pipeline. These resources for
commitment will be exhausted by November, while actual funds to cover disburse-
ments would be exhausted during 1974. An assessment of NIBID's resource needs
over the two-year period, June 30, 1973-June 30, 1975, is as follows: 1/
1/   As in the past, 40% of NIBID's commitments will be used to finance
imports.



-22-
(in Dr million)
Commitments July 1, 1973-December 31, 1973          1,622
Commitments 1974                                    2,050
Commitments January 1975-June 30, 1975                625
Total Commitments -           4,297
6.07      Thus, with resources of Dr 1,148 million on hand as of June 30, NIBID
will need to raise Dr 3,149 million ($105 million equivalent) in new resources
over the two-year period starting June 30, 1973 in order to cover the estimated
commitments of Dr 4,297 million. Apart from its cash generation and sale of
equity participations, NIBID plans to tap three principal sources of funds:
(a) NBG and the Bank of Greece, (b) the domestic capital market and (c) the
international capital market.
6.08      Borrowings from NBG and Bank of Greece.  In the past, NIBID has
been relying on these two institutions for about two-thirds of its borrowed
resources, for the reasons described in para. 3.01. NBC is expected to
continue its lending to NIBID, at least for the next two years, at the same
level as in 1972-1973, i.e. Dr 500 million per year. NBG is not being relied
upon to increase its lending to NIBID, because this would be contrary to NIBID's
aim of diversifying its resources and decreasing its reliance on NBG, and
because NBG itself is facing a tightening up on its projected resources.
6.09      The Bank of Greece will probably, as it did in the past, keep its
lending volume to that of NBC, and it is plausible to assume an annual level
of Dr 500 million. Thus, the Bank of Greece and NBG, by contributing
together a total of Dr 1 billion in both 1974 and 1975, will actually
be reducing their relative contribution to NIBID's future resources.
6.10      Domestic market.  NIBID is planning its first bond issue to the
public in 1974, for an amount of Dr 400 million, to include conversion
features. The reason why NIBID is waiting until 1974 is a matter of appro-
priate timing, since the sale of its preferred shares to the public took
place in July of 1973. As for further bond issues, their timing will be
governed by NIBID's needs, the attitude of the monetary authorities and,
above all, the response of the Greek market to NIBID's first bond issue in
1974. Given NIBID's recent success in selling its preferred shares, the
prospects for success in issuing bonds with convertible features is presumed
good.
6.11      International market.  As explained in para. 3.02, in the past
NIBID did not borrow on the international capital market.  But now that NIBID's
profitability has increased and its reputation and creditworthiness have been
established, prospective foreign lenders have become interested in making
long term loans to it. Because of the very small and even negative spread
which would have been incurred on the use of foreign borrowings during 1971
and 1972, NIBID did not contract any such loans. In July, 1973 the interest
rate structure in Greece was revised upward, with the result that NIBID can
charge its borrowers 10-1/2%, instead of 8-1/2% as in the past. This 2%
increase in NIBID's lending rate now makes the cost of borroving on foreign



- 23 -
capital markets more geasible. NIBID applied for and received permission
from the monetary authorities in August 1973 to tap the international capital
market. There will be no Government guaranty and no central bank coverage
of NIBID's foreign exchange risk (the Government provides both in the case of
IBRD loans to NIBID). This means NIBID will have to pass the foreign exchange
risk of foreign borrowings on to its customers; the volume of foreign borrow-
ings is therefore limited by the amount of foreign exchange risk NIBID's
customers are willing to assume. NIBID's first long term borrowing for about
$16 million will be from a European bank and is under discussion; its second
borrowing in the European capital market may be necessary sometime in 1975
if NIBID's internal cash generation proves to be inadequate or operations
surpass the forecast. IFC may be approached to advise and assist NIBID
in its future efforts to tap the international capital market.
6.12      Summary of resources.  Over the period from June 30, 1973 to June 30,
1975 NIBID anticipates raising resources as follows:
(in Dr million)
(a)  Uncommitted resources as of June 30, 1973                 1,148
(b)  NBG-BG for 1974                                           1,000
(c)  NBG-BG for first half of 1975                               390
(d)  Bond issue                                                  400
(e)  Foreign borrowing                                           480
(f) Internal cash generation, plus increased (d) or (e)
if needed        429
Total Resources    3,847
Since NIBID's overall needs for commitment resources is projected at Dr 4,297
million (para. 6.06), the financial gap is Dr 450 million, or $15 million,
which is the amount NIBID has asked the Bank to provide. A $15 million Bank
loan would be equivalent to 14% of the new resources ($105 million) NIBID
needs to raise over the period under review. The overall margin between the
cost of borrowed funds and NIBID's operations is estimated to remain about the
same as in the past since the increase in NIBID's loan rate by 2% will be
offset by the corresponding increase in cost of funds borrowed from NBG, BG,
and the domestic capital market; the rate on the Bank loan will, in turn, be
averaged upward by the higher rate on NIBID's borrowings in the international
capital market.
Financial Projections
6.13      Projections rest on the expectation that the level of business will
be carried out and that NIBID will obtain the necessary resources. Projected
income statements for the years 1973-77 appear in Annex 15, and financial ratios
in Annex 16. NIBID's net profits are forecast to almost double from 1973 to
1977, reflecting the growth of its operations. As a percentage of average
total assets, net profits will remain stable at about 1.6%, after a decrease
from 1.8% in 1973. This decline derives from the more expensive sources of



- 24 -
funds NIBID plans to tap (foreign loans, bond issues, and share capital
increase). It is likely that the forecast earnings are understated, in that
the average yield forecast on NIBID's equity portfolio is only 5% and capital
gains are not included.
6.14      Net profit 1/ as a percentage of average equity will be about 14% in
1973-1974. It will decrease to about 11% in 1975-76-77, due to the increase
of share capital on account of the possible conversion of bonds, and of NIBID's
policy of retaining earnings. Dividends are forecast to increase to 10%, and
the pay-out ratio to remain between 35% and 40%. This would leave room for
higher dividends, if need be, although 10% would certainly be enough to make
NIBID's shares attractive in the stock market.
6.15      Projected sources and uses of funds appear in Annex 17.  Debt service
coverage declines during the period; 1.6:1 in 1973 to 1.2:1 in 1977, and NIBID
will have to keep this under control. Annual interest coverage remains at
1.5:1. Projected balance sheets appear in Annex 18. NIBID's total assets
will more than double from 1973 to 1977. This ambitious growth seems feasible
given NIBID's past achievements and the growth prospects in Greece's industrial
sector.
6.16      Debt equity limit.  Existing Bank Loan Agreements limit NIBID's
long-term debt to 7 times its equity. NIBID has asked the Bank to relax
somewhat this limit. In reconsidering the debt/equity covenant, account has
to be taken that the quality of NIBID's portfolio is good and provisions
largely exceed the portfolio affected by arrears of over three months.
Secondly, NIBID's equity portfolio contains substantial unrealized capital
gains. As of December 1972, they were conservatively estimated at about 60%
of NIBID's equity, and will undoubtedly continue to increase, given NIBID's
plan for equity investments. Under these circumstances it is reasonable
from the Bank's point of view as a creditor to allow NIBID's term debt limit
to rise to 8 times equity.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusions
7.01      NIBID is an effective development finance company and a creditworthy
borrower. Because of the constant strengthening of its capabilities it has
clearly made its mark in Greece's manufacturing sector and has become an
important source of long-term loans and a growing source of equity finance.
7.02      Through its equity participations, marketable bond loans, and the
establishment of its Mutual Fund, NIBID is evolving from a long-term lender
into a supplier of securities to the growing capital market of Greece.
NIBID has also made progress as an underwriter in bringing unlisted firms
into the market and in distributing their shares to the Greek public. Finally,
the sale of NIBID's own shares to the general public represents a significant
contribution to the development of the capital market.
1/   Allowing for an annual provision charged against income of 2% of the
portfolio increment.



- 25 -
7.03      NIBID efficiently allocates resources to successful enterprises,
particularly those which are medium-sized. As a result of its thoroughi
appraisals and continuing relationship with clients, NIBID has been able to
help its clients improve their competitiveness. This is evidenced by the
fact that NIBID's clients are among the fastest growing manufacturing compa-
nies in Greece and are prominent in exports. In addition, NIBID is developing
expertise in attracting to Greece substantial amounts of foreign risk capital
for investment in joint ventures. Finally, through the modernization projects
it finances, NIBID preserves jobs in companies which would otherwise come into
difficulties and also creates new jobs in expanding enterprises.
7.04      In order to institute better measures of its clients' resource allo-
cation, NIBID is now ready to undertake more refined project analyses, speci-
fically by employing the economic rate of return calculation; the Bank will
provide guidelines and assistance in this respect.
7.05      i'ith its recognized creditworthiness and with the upward revision
of the interest rate structure in Greece, NIBID is now able to tap more
expensive sources of capital, and thereby to reduce reliance on its three
traditional sources of funds, namely, NBG, the Bank of Greece and the Bank.
This diversification of resources will draw on the domestic capital market
through the issuance of convertible bonds, as well as the listing of NIBID's
preferred shares; it is also to tap the international capital market for
long-term loans from conventional sources for the first time. This diversifi-
cation of resources goes a considerable way in satisfying the Bank's institu-
tional building purposes.
Recommendations
7.06      NIBID's volume of business is forecast to increase steadily.
Although NIBID is starting to diversify its resources, it wil' need the
financial support of the Bank in order to fill the projected resource gap.
Similarly, NIBID needs to continue its association with the Bank to reinforce
its prospects for broadening its resource base, and to establish its full
institutional independence. NIBID could effectively use a $15 million Bank
loan which is recommended to meet the resource gap deriving from its projected
operations in the two-year period July 1973-June 1975. A loan of this amount
would represent both an absolute and relative decrease in the Bank's involve-
ment in NIBID's resources. The proposed loan would be disbursed as shown in
Annex 19.
7.07      The terms of the proposed Bank loan should be those normally applied
to Bank loans to development finance companies, including the standard com.Lit-
ment fee. Because NIBID is a strong and mature institution with a demonstrated
capacity to handle its financial affairs soundly, and because the foreign ex-
clhange risk on the proposed Bank loan, as with past Bank loans, will be covered
by the Bank of Greece, a fixed amortization schedule would apply. The same
applied to the past Bank loan.  Given the fairly narrow range of maturities,
a fixed amortization schedule has been established that would mirror quite
realistically the actual composite repavmenit of fundls by sub-borrowers involved,
namely, a term of 10 years, including a grace period of two years, since this
conforms to NIBID's actual experience.



- 26 -
7.08      Under the last loan, NIBID's free limit was $500,000 (Dr 15 million)
irrespective of the amount of Bank funds involved. This earlier procedure was
justified by the continuous interest in strengthening NIBID's analysis of the
competitive aspects of the projects it finances. Since the quality of NIBID's
appraisals has improved and since the economic rate of return calculation will
become a standard feature in the appraisals submitted to NIBID's Executive
Committee, it is recommended that the free limit be established at $700,000
for the use of Bank funds. The aggregate free limit should be $5 million.
It is recommended that the term debt limitation to be observed by NIBID be
raised from 7 to 8 times NIBID's equity. NIBID has agreed to see to it that
the short form audit report is submitted within three months of the end of
the fiscal year, including the auditor's opinion, and that the long form audit
report is submitted within six months.

NATIONAL INVESTMENT BANK FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT S.A.
Statement of Policies and Procedures
(Adopted by the Board, June 30, 1965 with subsequent modifications)
I.   Objectives of the Bank
(1)  Promotion of industrial and related activities by providing
finance for the establishment of new productive enterprises
as well as for the modernization and expansion of existing
ones, all in the private sector.
(2) Development of the capital market in Greece, by underwriting
and distributing issues of shares and bonds and by distributing
its own investments when they mature.
(3) Facilitating contracts and joint ventures of Greek and foreign
enterpreneurs to promote the participation of foreign capital
and technical and managerial skills in the development of the
Greek economy.
(4) Supply of economic, technical and organizational advice to
enterprises.
The Bank intends in carrying out its objective to adhere to the
following broad policies.
II. Scope and Nature of Operation
A.   Eligible Enterprises and Projects
(1) Financing is made available only for projects which will
contribute to the economic growth of the country.
(2) Financing is restricted to private enterprises. The
existence of a minority governmental or semi-governmental
participation will not necessarily preclude an enterprise
from being assisted by the Bank provided such participa-
tion does not result in effective control of such enter-
prise.
(3) Financing will be provided for the establishment of new
enterprises, as well as for the expansion and improve-
ment of existing ones.
(4) Eligible for assistance are productive enterprises
engaged in industry, mining, shipping, tourism, and
related activities.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
B.   Investment Policy
(1) Projects of the enterprises requesting financing will
be considered on the basis of their economic, tech-
nical and financial merits and on the soundness of the
management.
(2) Projects to be financed will refer to needs of capital
for fixed assets and working capital of a permanent
nature. The Bank will not finance working capital by
means of short-term loans.
(3) The Bank provides finance according to the suitability
of each project in the form of:
(a) direct long-term or medium-term loans with a
duration not less than 5 years;
(b) loans participating in profits and loans with
equity features;
(c) direct equity investments;
(d) guarantees;
(e) underwriting of public issues.
(4)  In examining projects the Bank will consider whether the
size of its financing constitutes a reasonable proportion
of the total financing requirement of the project and
whether the form of the financing from all sources will
result in a sound capital structure of the enterprise.
(5) Since the Bank is a financial institution, its object is
to finance productive enterprises, not to manage them.
However, when the Bank considers it necessary, it may be
represented in the Board of Directors of the enterprise
concerned.
(6) The Bank is not seeking a controlling interest with any
enterprise it finances but will leave the management
and control in the hands of the entrepreneurs, except
in special circumstances as those connected with an
underwriting or the necessity of safeguarding an invest-
ment already made.
C.   Development of the Capital Market
(1) The Bank will try to rotate its investment portfolio
to a reasonable extent.



AYNEX 8
Page 3
Aiming at the development of the capital market in
Greece and as a means of broadening direct participa-
tion of private savings in economic development the
Bank will underwrite and distribute issues of shares
and bonds of its clients and sell its own investments
wholly or certain percentages of it, to other private
investors whenever it can do so on satisfactory terms,
having due regard not only to its own interest but
also to the interest of other participants in the
investment sold, as well as to the steady and sound
growth of the Stock Exchange.
(2) The Bank, in its endeavor to expand the domestic
capital market, will promote public participation in
investment through the issuing of its own bonds.
III. Other Assistance to the Enterprises
(1) The operation of the Bank will not be limited exclusively to
the granting of financial assistance. It will also advise its
clients, when necessary, on the solution of their economic and
financial problems, thus increasing its contribution to the
Greek economy and safeguarding recovery of its own investments.
(2) In connection with the above, the Bank will supply technical,
financial and organizational assistance to enterprises of any
nature for the establishment, organization and operation thereof.
IV. Financial Prudence
A.   Security for Loans and Guarantees
(1) The Bank, in making financings through loans or guarantees,
will, where necessary, seek adequate security or guar-
antees. However, recognizing the limitations of conven-
tional security as a safeguard in industrial investment
and recognizing also that the prestige of the Bank and
its shareholders are bound up in the success of the
venture, the Bank will place primary emphasis in reaching
its judgments, not on the adequacy of the security avail-
able, but on the prospective profitability of the enter-
prise to cover repayments and making profits.
B.   Diversification of Risks - Limits
(1) Financing will be diversified as far as possible regarding
the types of industries and their ownership.



ANNEX 8
Page 4
(2) Commitments for equity participation to any single enter-
prise will be limited to a sum not exceeding 20% of the
Bank's share capital and surplus accounts. Total commit-
ments to any single enterprise will not exceed 20% of
the Bank's share capital and surplus accounts. For the
purpose of this paragraph, the Dr 300,000,000 Bank of
Greece loan to NIBID subordinated to other debts and
ranking pari-passu with the Bank's equity shall be deemed
to be part of the Bank's share capital. This revision
in the Policy Statement is to be ratified in October, 1972.
(3)  (a)  Overall equity investments of the Bank will be
limited to 100% of its unimpaired equity (paid-up
capital and surplus accounts). For the purpose
of this paragraph the Drs 300 million Bank of
Greece loan to NIBID subordinated to other debts
and ranking pari-passu with the bank's equity
shall be deemed to be part of the Bank's un-
impaired equity.
(b) Para. (a) shall be in force until 31.6.77 except
if extended.
(4) In case that, by incurring external debt, the Bank must
assume a foreign exchange risk, it will pass the risk
on to its ultimate borrowers or find other suitable
means to cover it.
C.  Borrowing by the Bank
(1) The Bank, whenever it considers it necessary to broaden
its own facilities for operations, will accept term
deposits or obtain funds locally or abroad by the issue
of bond loans and by entering into loan agreements.
In this connection, the Bank will follow a prudent
policy as far as debt acquisition is concerned. Total
debt will not exceed seven times the amount of the Bank's
capital and surplus accounts (including reserve provi-
sions for bad debts exceeding 2% of portfolio). For
the purpose of this paragraph the maturities of the
Dr 300,000,000 Bank of Greece loan to the Bank, subor-
dinated to other debts and ranking pari-passu with the
Bank's equity, that mature after the last maturity of
any loan obtained by the Bank from the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, shall be deemed
to be part of the Bank's capital.
(2) The Bank will arrange its borrowings so as to maintain
proper relationship between the duration of its liabil-
ities and the duration of its assets, in order to
safeguard its liquidity.



ANNEX 8
Page 5
D.   Profitability of Operations
(1) Operating costs of the Bank will be left to a minimum
consistent with its purpose and the scope of its
operations.
(2) The Bank will levy charges for its financings and serv-
ices sufficient to earn profits which yield a satis-
factory return on its investment and will provide for
reserves consistent with sound financial practice.
In providing assistance to enterprises requiring
advice in the formation, execution and operation of
their projects, the Bank may charge its customers with
the cost of such services.
E. Reserves and Dividend Policy
(1) In determining its dividends the Bank will give prece-
dence to the establishment of adequate reserves, fol-
lowing a prudent reserve policy.
F.   Audit
(1) The accounting supervision of the Bank's operations will
be the responsibility of the official Auditors appointed
at the Ordinary General Meeting. The annual audit of
the Bank's accounts will be made by qualified and inde-
pendent auditors.
V.   Procedures and Organization
(1) The Bank will endeavor to have an efficient and balanced internal
organization and staff which should be adequate to make the
necessary appraisal of investment proposals, to assist its
clients in the formulation and conduct of their projects and
to follow closely the operations of the enterprises it finances,
in order thereby to safeguard its own investments and to protect
the interest of outside investors.
(2) When it is more economical to do so, the Bank will use the serv-
ices of outside organizations rather than build up an expensive
staff of specialists and technical personnel.
(3) The General Manager will prepare periodically for its Board of
Directors brief reports covering the progress of the Bank's
activities and its financial position.
