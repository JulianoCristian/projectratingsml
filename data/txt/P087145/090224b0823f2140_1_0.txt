                         of the VOs were also active with increased activities of the producer groups in strategic partnership with the private sector. 87% of VSCOs were reported to be making profits while
                         their portfolio quality improved significantly. A total of 4712 Phase I sub projects have been completed which is 99.8% of total approved projects. However, out of the targeted 4,591
                         infrastructure sub projects under phase II, 2189 are completed and the rest are ongoing but expected to be completed by September 30, 2014. It is critical that with the short time
                         frame to project closure, these activities are accelerated with increased emphasis on operation and maintenance. The biggest risk faced by the project is retaining key technical staff

                         to facilitate project completion as they seek other opportunities to transition before the project closes and it is likely that contract hiring will be even more challenging given the short
                         time period. 172 contract staff and 27 staff on assignment basis left the project in the last 6 months. The PMU needs to be proactive in hiring short terms consultants that could cover
                         man-power gaps arising during the implementation period. As part of its human resource strategy for long term sustainability of project outcomes, there is need to progressively
                         engage Economic Development Officers (EDOs) to begin providing more focused facilitation support to communities at the village level. In parallel, it is equally important to retain a
                         number of highly skilled community mobilizers to provide handholding support to EDOs through this transition period and minimize the risk of losing momentum in implementation.

                         The compliance to environmental and social safeguards of the project has improved significantly since the last mission. There is timely preparation of Environmental Management
                         Plans (EMPs), their implementation in the field and monitoring and awareness of EMPs is being done accordingly. A lot of ground work has been done on the implementation of the
                         Pest Management Plan and compliance mechanisms with regard to environmental management. With respect to social safeguard, the database on all types of land transactions
                         including voluntary land donations has been prepared at PMU level. Field level staff have also taken adequate measures to prepare sub-project level socials safeguards checklists
                         and brief screening reports detailing social impacts of each intervention. Gender mainstreaming is visible throughout project interventions (village organizations, livelihood loans and
                         credit utilization, community resource persons and skill development trainings etc.). In addition, project has made considerable effort to uplift socioeconomic standards of poorer and
                         vulnerable households through onetime grants, which has in turn elevated them to be creditworthy and economically active individuals.
