                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Implementation progress is based on Mid Term Review mission which was carried during April 22 -May 3 2013. The MTR was also carried out to review all issues for project
                         restructuring and prepare Restructuring paper for the Board approval.

                         Overall progress towards achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Implementation Progress are rated to be moderately satisfactory. Significant efforts were made
                         by the project to speed up implementation and accelerate disbursement. As at time of MTR, the project had established 2,044 village organizations (VOs) – with 1,034 created under
                         Phase 1 and 1,010 in Phase 2. Out of these, 2,015 VOs have accessed Village Development Fund (VDF) to undertake investments in social, economic and community infrastructure.
                         However, only 1,738 VOs were reported to be active.

                         The project has promoted 1,990 VSCOs comprising 38,707 Small Groups (SGs), managing own savings of US$ 3.68 million and Livelihood Support Fund (LSF) of US$ 14.07 million.
                         The project team has also increased its technical assistance to the Inter connectivity programs, Producer Groups and provided linkages with technical departments of government
                         agencies and the private sector. Work on the M&E and MIS has also gained traction with a new staff team in place, with improvements in capture and reporting of project data. But
                         while there was a marked improvement in a good number of performance indicators, many were just being updated due to lack of significant implementation progress over the past 2
                         years.
                         Owing to the changing institutional environment in which SCDLIP was operating during the second half of 2012, and the exigencies of responding to GOSL policy changes, the MTR
                         reviewed all the proposed changes and prepare the Restructuring Paper identifying all areas for changes.
                         Specifically, most of the changes proposed relate to new policy environment in Sri Lanka on poverty alleviation programmes. GOSL intends to implement a uniform, homogenized
                         and centralized governance architecture with direct control and oversight for all rural poverty reduction programs in the country. As such, Gemi Diriya Foundation which hitherto had
                         served as an autonomous implementation structure of the project became dysfunctional and was proposed by GoSL to be mainstreamed into the structure of its ministries for
                         effective oversight. This necessitated changes in the governance and implementation structure of the project as the policy related performance triggers necessary for phase III of the
                         APL are unlikely to be achieved. These performance triggers which involve horizontal scaling up and policy change were built around the functioning of the federation of the village
                         institutions. But the federations are no longer considered viable and transformational in the context of rural development strategy of the GoSL. Therefore, the latter has decided to
                         develop a converged service delivery approach at the village level incorporating its other rural development initiatives such as Samrudhi and Divineguma programs. This institutional
                         change and policy orientation entail risk to the achievement of the project development objectives as envisaged in the APL unless some structural changes are made in the project.
                         So it is proposed to change the credit instrument from APL to Investment Lending (IL) as the policy triggers are no longer relevant and achievable. The Results Framework was also
                         revised accordingly. There is also reallocating funds across components. As Government wants to mainstream the program through Ministry of Economic Development, the
                         restructuring also proposed a change in the Institutional arrangements from Gemi Diriya Foundation (already defunct) to a Project Management Unit within Ministry.
