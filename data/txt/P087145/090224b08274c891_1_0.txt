                         from community infrastructure sub-projects and the project has made substantial effort to ensure that ongoing sub-projects are completed by September 30, 2014. At present, 4,245
                         sub-projects out of a total targeted 4,683 have been completed representing 91% progress. 438 sub-projects are ongoing and given the project’s average monthly completion rate of
                         223 sub-projects, there is reasonable assurance that all intra-village sub-projects will be completed by the end of the project for communities to begin fully utilizing these services

                         There are 11 Padeshiya Sabhas (100%) that are currently implementing inter-connectivity sub-projects and so far, 36 infrastructure sub-projects, including pilot phase, have been
                         completed out of a targeted 64 indicating 56% progress. The remaining 28 sub-projects have all surpassed critical construction phases out of which, 12 are expected to be completed
                         by August 31, 2014.. The inter-connectivity sub-projects completed so far have benefitted about 83% of VOs. There are 6 sub-projects that have been categorized as high risk with
                         possibility of not being completed in time and will require very close monitoring and technical support to ensure full completion by project end. All PSs have established O&M Units
                         and have allocated on average 10% of their annual budget towards funding maintenance activities. Furthermore, 82% of PSs have conducted participatory budgeting and planning
                         involving communities where 40% of communities’ priorities have been taken up for implementation. As part of the sustainability strategy, the project is actively working to link VOs
                         with other government institutions including private sector partners and intensifying support to weaker villages to improve their functioning. As at July 31, 2014, overall disbursement
                         has reached 96% (US$74.4 million).
