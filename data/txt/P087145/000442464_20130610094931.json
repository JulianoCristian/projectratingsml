   is to enhance incomes and quality of life of the poor\n            households in the poorest divisions in the country while\n            building capacity of government agencies, local governments\n            and community organizations for downward accountability and\n            overall project implementation. The restructuring will bring\n            the following changes: (1) the Project Development Objective\n            (PDO) will be changed; (2) the hitherto Gemidiriya\n            foundation will be replaced by a Project Management Unit\n            (PMU); (3) implementation modalities in some of the\n            components will be revised to remove identified constraints\n            on disbursements and to allow for impact; (4) funds will be\n            re-allocated across components to accelerate implementation\n            of infrastructure sub projects which have been constrained\n            by inadequate funds for implementation and engagement of\n            technical service providers for long term supervision; and\n            (5) the financing agreement of the project will be modified\n            to accommodate all the changes and will form the basis for\n            the implementation of the restructured project."}, "docdt": "2013-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
