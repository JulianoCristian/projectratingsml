﻿SECOND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND LIVELIHOOD IMPROVEMENT
PROJECT
RESTRUCTURING PAPER
A. SUMMARY
The Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) through the Ministry of Finance and Planning
requested for a restructuring of the Second Community Development and Livelihood
Improvement Project, Credit Number IDA 4613-CE (dated November 28,2012). The original
credit proposed to the Board in March 30, 2004 envisaged a three phase Adaptable Program
Loan (APL). The first phase APL achieved and exceeded most triggers while the second
phase APL presented to the Board on September 10, 2009 also started well. However in
2010, the policy environment as envisaged in the APL changed with the government deciding
to implement a uniform, homogenized and centralized governance architecture with direct
control and oversight for all rural poverty reduction programs in the country. As such, Gemi
Diriya Foundation which hitherto had served as an autonomous implementation structure of
the project became dysfunctional and was proposed by GoSL to be mainstreamed into the
structure of its ministries for effective oversight. This necessitates changes in the governance
and implementation structure of the project as the policy related performance triggers
necessary for phase III of the APL are unlikely to be achieved. These performance triggers
which involve horizontal scaling up and policy change were built around the functioning of
the federation of the village institutions. But the federations are no longer considered viable
and transformational in the context of rural development strategy of the GoSL. Therefore, the
latter has decided to develop a converged service delivery approach at the village level
incorporating its other rural development initiatives such as Samrudhi and Divineguma
programs. This institutional change and policy orientation entail risk to the achievement of
the project development objectives as envisaged in the APL unless some structural changes
are made in the project. Series of institutional and program assessments were conducted by
the Bank team through its field visits and supervision missions and based on these findings, it
is proposed to restructure the project (Level 1)
There will be a slight change in the Project Development Objective of the project. Another
change proposed is the conversion of the credit instrument from an APL to Investment
Lending (IL) as the policy triggers are no longer relevant. Moreover, a focus on consolidation
of project achievements and providing backward and forward linkages for the community
managed activities, in the next one year, will lead to achievement of the project development
objectives and ensure sustainability of the interventions made in the project. (Summary of
project achievement to date is attached as Annex 1).  As the project progress has been
hampered over last year and there are changes in the implementation arrangements and
components, it is proposed to change the results framework of the project. The other key
changes proposed are described below.
i.  Institutional and Implementation arrangements: The hitherto Gemidiriya Foundation
responsible for the day to day implementation of the project will cease to exist. It will
1


﻿be replaced by a Project Management Unit (PMU). This will be housed in the
Ministry of Economic Development (MED).
ii.  Federations of Community Institutions: The project will discontinue with the proposed
second tier of institutions such as district, federation of Village Organizations(VO),
Community Professionals(CPs), Community Professional Learning and Training
Centres (CPLTC) etc. The project will focus on establishing viable producer groups
and providing them with backward and forward linkages in order to take advantage of
economies of scale. An exit strategy has been developed for the Community
Professionals and there will be increased emphasis on capacity building in order to
further enhance the sustainability of the Village Organizations.
iii.  Component Changes: Based on the experiences of last three years, implementation
modalities in some of the components will be revised to remove identified constraints
on disbursements and to allow for impact. Details of such changes are provided in the
section under the proposed changes.
iv.  Safeguard Changes: As part of restructuring, the project will trigger following
policies; OP/BP 4.04-Natural Habitats, OP/BP 4.09- Pest Management, and OP/BP
4.12- Involuntary Resettlement.  As such, pest management and abbreviated
resettlement plans (A-RAP) for subprojects have been prepared while the current
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Integrated
Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS) were updated and disclosed on April 17, 2013.
v.   Funds Re-allocation: Funds will be re-allocated across components to accelerate
implementation of infrastructure sub projects which have been constrained by
inadequate funds for implementation and engagement of technical service providers
for long term supervision. Also provision will be made to strengthen the Operation and
Maintenance (O&M ) unit established at PS and the M&E / MIS system. The Budget
will also be streamlined and focused on achieving the objectives of the various
components.
vi.  Legal Covenant/ Financial Agreement: The Financing Agreement of the project will
be modified to accommodate all the above changes and will form the basis for the
implementation of the restructured project.
The changes envisaged in the project are summarized in Annex 2.
B. PROJECT STATUS
GoSL has a long term strategic objective of accelerating rural development, increasing growth
opportunities and reducing poverty in the poorest regions of the country. The World Bank has
supported this approach through a 12 year Adaptable Program Loan (APL). Phase 1 of the
APL (US$51Mn) focused on building and strengthening community level organizations and
developing institutional mechanisms for direct funding to community organizations. The first
phase was completed successfully in March 2010 by establishing 1034 Village Organizations
(VOs) and delivering benefits to over 200,000 households in 7 districts. The Implementation
2


﻿completion report of Phase I has shown that it exceeded most results as envisaged and
complied with the five performance triggers.
The implementation of Phase 2 with IDA credit of US$75 Mn, started well in December 2009.
However, from April 2010, there were changes in government orientation towards community
development programs with direct control and guidance by government agencies. This
rendered the implementation and design of the APL instrument inappropriate as envisaged in
the original design. The Gemidiriya Foundation as constituted and the proposed second level
federated institutions were not considered appropriate to achieve the objective of rural
development as part of the new policy of GoSL. This rendered the policy triggers of the APL
irrelevant. These changes also slowed down project activities and the functioning of the
existing institutions. Since then, there have been several World Bank implementation support
missions that reviewed the implementation progress, resolved some identified issues and
reached agreements with GoSL on critical areas for adjustment and restructuring in order to
move the project forward to enable achievement of development outcomes. As a result, there
has been significant progress and the project is rated moderately satisfactory on the
achievement of PDOs and the overall implementation progress. There was accelerated
physical progress for the implementation of community infrastructure and inter- connectivity
projects. A total of 4,619 sub projects were completed out of a total of 4,744 started during
phase 1 indicating a completion rate of 97.0%. Under phase II, the project embarked on 3,554
infrastructure sub projects and 1,513 are completed. Many positive steps were also taken to
support producer groups in piloting Village Development Plans (VDP 2) and ongoing
technical support activities. The micro finance component of the project has helped in
establishment of Village Savings and Credit Organizations (VSCOs). The project has
promoted 1,990 VSCOs comprising 60,997 small groups managing own savings of US$ 3.68
million and Livelihood Support Fund (LSF) of US$ 14.07 million. These organizations have
so far provided financial support through loans to their members for livelihood development
to extent of $38.21 million. It was however observed that the proportion of VSCOs, with
Portfolio at Risk PAR of more than 5%, has marginally increased from 60% to 63%. The
project restructuring will evolve a mechanism to improve the repayment rate.
With increasing support of the Bank, the project has now developed effective linkages with
line ministries in order to extend their services to project beneficiaries on a continuous basis.
(see summary of project achievement in annex 1)
Although the project has made significant progress in program management, there is one risk of poor
organizational management and motivation of the staff members which has been accentuated in last one year.
This relates to top down management style, high staff turnover and absence of a grievance handling system for
staff. This risk needs to be addressed so that implementation progress is not hampered and there is high
likelihood of achieving development objectives. The specific mitigation measures proposed are as follows: The
Bank has requested the project to provide a quarterly report of staff turnover beginning March 31, 2013 in order
to forestall the possibility of deliberate retrenchment of staff. The project is furthermore mandated to retain most
of the current staff for the remaining duration of the project to enable the restructured project to achieve
development objectives and be implemented smoothly. The Bank has also worked with the project team to
develop a grievance redress mechanism to support the implementation of the project.

﻿C. PROPOSED CHANGES
(i) Project's Development Objectives
The PDO will be modified slightly to reflect the new emphasis and is as indicated
below:
Original PDO
*  The project development objective of Phase 2 is to enhance incomes and quality of life of the
poor households in the poorest divisions in the country while building capacity of government
agencies, local governments and community organizations for downward accountability and
overall project implementation.
Proposed PDO
*  The project development objective is to enhance incomes and quality of life of the poor
households in the poorest divisions in the country while building capacity of government
agencies, local governments and community organizations for service delivery and overall
project implementation.
(ii) Results/indicators
Please see Annex 3 for the revised Project Result Framework and Indicators.
(iii) Components
Component A: Intra-Village Development
*  The project has promoted a total of 2,044 Village Organizations (VOs) in phase I
and II. These VOs were originally registered as "peoples companies" but with
changes in company law of Sri Lanka, all the legal provisions applicable to "public
companies" are applicable to VOs, resulting in additional costs and compliance
efforts on the part of the communities. The VO's mode of registration will be
changed according to government act on Divineguma or as societies. However,
VOs that intend to continue as Village companies will be allowed to exist as
companies and given appropriate technical support.
*  The current level of capitalization of VSCOs is enough to provide financial access
to about 40 % of poor households in the area and the credit demand from their
members is growing with increasing emphasis on producer groups and other
livelihoods initiatives. Therefore VSCOs will help their members' access
additional resources by leveraging loans with Samurdhi, other community
financing agencies and commercial banks. VSCO-Bank linkage will also help
them achieve long term sustainability and mainstream them with the formal
financial sector by transferring their risks to the well regulated commercial banks,
even while retaining their local character.
*  The second-generation community institutions - Village institutional federations,
Community professional centres, etc. will be discontinued. The VOs will be
restructured to align with the project objectives of enhanced livelihood and market
linkage for Producer Groups.
*  The focus of the village infrastructure sub component will still be on simple and
affordable infrastructure which can be operated and maintained by the
communities. However, this has been reduced to a maximum of 4 sub projects for
each VO while contribution is also reduced to 20% for the first village
4


﻿infrastructure and 10% for subsequent ones. The contribution of estate
communities is made notional and reduced to 5%, all of which include labour, cash
and materials.
Component B: Inter-village Connectivity Development
*  The change proposed in this component is to limit the number of infrastructure sub
projects in the targeted Pradeshiya Sabhas (PS) and provide some funds to facilitate
the establishment and strengthening of an Operation and maintenance (O&M) unit in
each PS. This unit will be responsible for maintenance activities of interconnectivity
projects in collaboration with the communities. The interconnectivity projects will also
be reduced to ensure that only such investments are made which have sound
implementation and maintenance plan and can be completed within the project life.
The community cash contributions will be reduced to zero but in- kind contribution of
the communities will be retained to ensure their participation. The project will also
allow for central procurement where materials are scarce or there is advantage of
economies of scale for the communities, and direct contracting for complex projects in
difficult terrains. However, these are to be carried out in agreement with the
communities who must also participate in the operation and maintenance of the
infrastructure.
*  Component B3 will be refocused to de-emphasize vertical network of Federation and
livelihood activities. As such, VO federation, VSCO federation and Producer group
federation will be discouraged in favor of emergence of organic producer groups that
will be assisted technically and technologically for linkage to organized private sector,
banks and government agencies for services. Funds from this Component will partly
provide for the establishment and strengthening of the O&M units in PS, and partly for
a new sub component under Component C, focusing on supporting Producer Groups.
Component C: Public, Private and People Sector Partnership
*  There will be increased focus on Producer groups and forging an effective backward and
forward linkage with government and private sector agencies for value chain based
partnerships for technical support and marketing.
*  The component will support Development Marketplace type events for identifying
alternative livelihood models and innovations. Funds will be allocated to support
organizing the Development Marketplace and productive partnerships for organizing
producers and linking them with public, private and SME sectors engaged in farm
research, technology extension, input supply service provisioning, processing, retail value
chains and exports.
*  The component will also support strategic partnerships with commercial banks for
fostering VSCO-Bank Linkages. Funds will be provided to set up dedicated 'Divineguma
Cells' in partner commercial banks, training and exposure of commercial bank staff,
establishing help desks at bank branches, etc.
Component D: Project Management and Monitoring
* This component will be reorganized to support a strategic unit for project management
that will link the district level staff with a strict time bound appraisal and for providing the
required programme oversight and technical support, improving performance of VSCOs,
5


﻿assisting VOs to prepare livelihood plans, facilitating promotion of producer groups,
promoting convergence with government programs and coordinating with banks and other
market linkages.
*  Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and Management Information System (MIS)-- Original
design objectives remain relevant. But given the lack of progress in process monitoring,
system development and utilization, this subcomponent will refocus on internal learning
as well as enhancing information linkages across the project and at community levels.
Besides making critical improvements to the existing web-enabled MIS, it will provide
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and system development support to
microfinance and livelihood development units of the project and assist VSCOs and
Producer Groups forge information and technical linkages with commercial banks and
other development partners and services.
Component E: Convergence and Policy Support
*  Considerable investments have been made across the nation through various new and old
programs in the area of community development and rural livelihoods. The government is
also implementing similar livelihood programs and safety net products such as Samurdhi,
Divineguma etc to target the poor. This component will mainstream the project into
government established Divineguma and Sarmurdhi programmes. The component will
support government to develop policies, rules and procedures to harmonize livelihood
programs effectively. Technical assistance will be provided in order to develop a model
and formulate an effective institutional arrangement; train village level officers of project,
Samurdhi and other departments, to assist village empowerment and livelihood activities.
*  Given the shift of focus from federated institutions, the future emphasis of the project will
be on sustainability and ensuring that its Village Organizations, VSCO, and Producer
groups are self-sustaining and are effective agents to promote sustainable livelihoods of
the various communities.
*  In addition to above, this component will focus on facilitating project beneficiaries to get
access for supports from line ministries to improve their livelihood activities through
technical assistance and their ongoing programs.
*  It will allocate funds for training and capacity building of project staff which will enable
them to play high quality facilitation role.
(iv) Safeguards
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) of the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) stipulates all the required procedures and tools to ensure safeguard
compliance in project related infrastructure interventions. However, with restructuring,
investments on inter-village connectivity subprojects may trigger OP/BP 4.0 (Natural
Habitats), OP/BP 4.09 (Pest Management), and to some extent OP/BP 4.12 (Resettlement).
Therefore, pest management plan and abbreviated resettlement plans (A-RAP) for subprojects
have been prepared while the current ESMF and ISDS have also been updated. All the
instruments have been disclosed in country on April 17, 2013 and at Infoshop. Technical
assistance/training will be provided to the staff to enhance their knowledge/skills to prepare
pest management plans and abbreviated resettlement plans.
6


﻿(v). Institutional arrangements
The design of the project established Gemidiriya Foundation as the implementation
agency with the envisaged gradual transfer of some of its function to government agencies.
However the current policy orientation of the GoSL plans for a centralized governance
structure with direct control and oversight for all rural poverty reduction programs across the
nation. In this context, the independent Foundation established in APL1 was made
dysfunctional. The Foundation will cease to exist and its role and functions transferred to a
Project Management Unit (PMU) under the Ministry of Economic Development (MED). The
oversight function will be performed by the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) and
the PMU will have an advisory committee made up of multi stakeholders from different
sectors of the economy in order to leverage effective linkage with the private sector and
generate ideas that can sustain the income generating setting of the VOs.
(vi) Governance and Accountability
The Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) of the project has been
updated in line with the envisaged risks of the restructured project. The governance
framework tools developed under Gemidiriya Foundation will also continue to be applied and
adapted to the new institutional framework proposed. Community Operational Manual
(COM); Village Grading System; Community Assessment Process (CAP); Appraisal and
Monitoring Teams; and Internal and External Auditors, are all tools and procedures that will
continue to be used to hold community based organizations accountable. Given the increased
number of complaints from the public and project staff, strong emphasis will be placed on
ensuring that an efficient and effective Grievance Redress Mechanism is developed and made
fully functional. Records of public complaints will be properly collected, maintained and data
on complaints/grievances publicly disclosed to include actions taken. A conflict resolution
and grievance handling system for project staff will be anchored by the Human Resource
Department of the PMU, who will develop a clear set of guidelines and procedures to be
followed by staff in the event of any form of grievance. The procedures and guidelines will
form part of the Staff Code of Conduct to be fully disseminated and internalized by all project
staff.
(vii) Project Risk
A major risk to the restructured project is the uncertainty about the future
implementation modalities of the Divineguma bill that has just been passed by the parliament
of GoSL. The new law intends to mobilize rural people into national development process at
community level by establishing Divineguma department, Divineguma community based
organizations, a coordinating network at district and national level and establishment of
community based banks and banking societies. All these processes and the operations of the
organizations will be controlled and monitored centrally at the national level. This might
change the status of community empowerment from being organic and community governed,
to government controlled and administered. It may also be counterproductive and
disempowering if all community based organizations are forced to register as Divineguma
societies or the registration is used as the basis for access to government services. This will
have implication for the autonomy of the established 2,044 VOs under the project and the

﻿VSCOs that are managing their microcredit operations. Although the GoSL through the
Ministry of Economic Development (MED) has assured the Bank that the passage of the Bill
and its implementation will not affect the independence of the VOs, and that VSCO will be
allowed to operate unhindered, the Bank team is already putting measures in place to prepare
for any eventuality. Pro-actively, the restructured project has emphasized the enhancement
and economic empowerment through increasing scale of the livelihood activities of the VOs
and enhancing the capacity building/ linkages of the producer groups to private organizations.
This will ensure the sustainability of existing activities. The exit strategy of the VOs has been
developed and is being operationalized and piloted among the phase I villages. The project is
also currently assisting the Divineguma unit on capacity building of its staff, rolling out its
GIS and computerized MIS and is collaborating effectively with its new staff on community
sensitization and mobilization. Other measures include the allocation of more resources into
the alignment of the project operations to the demands of Divineguma department and efforts
are being made to link the VSCOs with commercial banks and community oriented financial
agencies. Finally, the legal agreement will indicate the continuous autonomy and non-
interference with VSCO activity and funds as a safeguard for continuous operation of VSCO.
Other envisaged risks of this operation and their mitigation are indicated in ORAF Annex 4.

﻿(ix) Financing Plan
The financial arrangements remain the same and the same funds flow pattern will be
followed. However, a new funding ratio is proposed for IDA, GoSL and Community to
support Development and Operation activities. It is proposed to change the ratios of IDA
to 80% and 70% respectively for Development and operating cost instead of the original
75%  and 65%. This is done so as to accommodate the reduction in community
contribution. Delay in payment of community contribution resulting from increasing
cost burden on the communities has been identified as a major implementation
constraint on the project.

No changes in the disbursement arrangements

*The team is recommending a change in funding ratio in order to accommodate the reduction in community contribution.
Low ability to pay community contribution was identified as a factor slowing down the pace of implementation.
Financial management
The PMU which replaces the Gemidiriya Foundation will have the overall responsibility for
FM activities. It is envisaged that the existing FM staff of GF and other institutions would
continue to function in managing the FM arrangements. At the village level, the services of
CRPs would be critical to manage the FM arrangements of VOs. Hence, the capacity building
programs targeted for CRPs will include FM related training as well. Broad FM arrangements
would remain the same such as fund flow, disbursement arrangements, financial reporting,
accounting, internal auditing and external auditing. However, Foundation which becomes a
PMU, and VO's in the project would cease to be governed under Company law, but would be
primarily operated under prevailing GoSL structures, regulations and relevant procedures as
applicable under the new institutional framework proposed.

﻿Procurement
There will be no change in the procurement arrangement.
C2. Closing date
The closing date for the project will not be extended and remain March 31, 2014. Currently,
there are no overdue audit reports for the project.

Convergence with other government programs: Project is supporting implementing Divineguma
program in project villages, by providing planting material, coordinating training programs, and
supporting selection beneficiaries. In addition, project is working as the vehicle for bringing other
line ministries and private agencies support for project beneficiaries and providing flat form to
conduct their program in the village
