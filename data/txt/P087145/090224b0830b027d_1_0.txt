1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
At appraisal, Sri Lanka had just emerged from almost 30 years of armed conflict with
increased optimism about future prospects for economic growth and poverty reduction in
the country. The country was faced with an immediate challenge of managing transition
arrangements for about 300,000 internally displaced persons as well as a fragile macro-
economic situation exacerbated by the global financial crisis that negatively impacted
much of South Asia. There were considerable regional disparities in terms of per capita
income levels, poverty rates and structure of various provincial economies, which
heightened concerns that failure to bring lower-income provinces into the country’s
economic development framework could potentially deepen income disparities and add to
social tensions creating obstacles for Sri Lanka’s future growth potential.

Poverty in the country was on a rapid decline largely on account of strong economic
growth, with the poorest area, the Southern Province, halving its poverty from 28 percent
to 14 percent in 2006/7. Economic growth had been strong since 2003, averaging 6.3
percent per annum, however, poverty incidence in the rural areas remained very high,
nearly double that of urban areas. The urban poor accounted for 7 percent of the nation’s
poor, the rural poor for 82 percent and the estate poor for 11 percent. Un-even growth
outcomes were associated with uneven poverty outcomes. The vast majority of the poor
lived in rural areas and depended on agriculture for their food and livelihoods. Lack of
connectivity to markets was identified as a major constraint with many small-holder
farmers disconnected from the market, unaware of the changing opportunities and largely
ignored by agribusinesses as sources of raw materials. Income growth was further
hampered by poor road linkages, limited storage facilities and absence of wholesale
markets to take advantage of economies of scale. Similarly, unemployment rates reflected
the same regional disparities, and were higher in the rural sector, for youth generally and
young women in particular. Poverty and unemployment rates were especially high on
estates where average monthly incomes of households were the lowest in the country. At
the same time, it was critical for Sri Lanka to continue its poverty reduction efforts
throughout the country, and not lose momentum gained in achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs).

In 2003, the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) was faced with a similar poverty and equity
challenge, recognized the need for innovative solutions to address rural poverty and took a
policy decision to adopt and implement the Community Driven Development (CDD)
approach through the Gemi Diriya Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The approach enabled
the development of policies, rules, systems, procedures and institutional arrangements that
permitted the Government to transfer funds directly to communities and provide them with
technical and other support on a demand driven basis. The selection of the APL instrument
was recognition that sustainable community development was a process and outcomes of
sustainable poverty reduction could not be achieved quickly and required a gradual process
of scaling up. IDA committed support for 12 years with a phased approach of progressive
geographic expansion and policy deepening. Phase I focused on empowering communities,

                                            1
developing accountable and demand-responsive local governments and community
federations and networks for market linkages. An independent evaluation of the first phase
of the project showed that: 90 percent of community members reported feeling empowered
and having a sense of ownership over the project; 98 percent repaid loans with their savings
and made new investments and about 50 percent households indicated an improvement in
their economic and living conditions. The approach proved extremely successful in
transferring control over decision-making and financial resources to rural communities,
and building community institutions that empowered and enabled negotiation with
government and private sector on an equal footing. The Gemi Diriya model filled a void
created by an absence of local government system below the Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) level
for achieving the major rural development goals of the government. Phase II was expected
to focus on support for the national poverty reduction program of the Government by
testing a model of local area development in about 10 PSs to provide efficient services
aimed at addressing issues of accessibility and connectivity that hampered sustainable
livelihoods in lagging regions. It was also expected to provide technical support to existing
local level agencies – Divisional Secretary, Samurdhi officials and other local level
officials – to implement the national program using the successful CDD approach adopted
from Phase I. Phase III would have fully institutionalized appropriate mechanisms
developed in Phase I and II at the national level in other government programs. The APL
program envisaged that phases II and III would be initiated independently of the previous
phase and each phase would begin when the readiness criteria for expansion were satisfied.
In the case of Phase I, compliance with all five performance triggers1 to move to Phase II
had already been met or exceeded by the government. At the end of the 12 year period, the
program was expected to leverage overall impact of expected public resources towards
poverty reduction; and further assist communities to access rural financial institutions,
increase transparency and link communities directly to markets. The three phases of the
APL taken together were expected to ensure that processes and institutions continued
beyond the life and scope of the project, when external support would have gradually been
phased out.

For its part, GoSL’s poverty response was anchored in the Mahinda Chintana (MC) 10 year
development framework (2006) that emphasized achievement of equitable growth and
reduction of regional disparities. It was followed up with the launch of an additional
flagship program called Gamaneguma whose objective centered on the development of the
village as part of an integrated total village development program. GoSL planned to

  The five performance triggers were: (1) At least 60% of VOs in the first two years of Phase I have
accessed funds and completed at least one sub-project; (2) At least 30% of women participate in decision
making by holding management positions in the first two years of Phase I; (3) At least 50% of community
members have contributed 20% or more toward capital cost of community infrastructure activities; (4) At
least 50% of members of project villages covered during the first two years of Phase I have benefitted from
project interventions; and at least 60% of these beneficiaries belong to the poorest households; and (5) At
least 25% of the Divisions covered in the first two years of Phase I have established participatory sub-
committees and the local government level with 30% elected representatives and 70% representatives of
community organizations.


                                                     2
mainstream the CDD approach country-wide through its national flagship Gamaneguma
program.

In response to the Government’s request to replicate the model in additional geographical
areas of the country that strengthened local government and other national level agencies
such as Samurdhi Authority in line with the goals of Gamaneguma, the Bank committed to
support the scale up of what was already proven a highly successful community-led model.
The Bank approved a second phase that was aimed at consolidating achievements of Phase
1 and applying lessons to the Gamaneguma program through a specific project component
for this purpose. The Bank brought unique accumulated cross-country and cross-regional
experience in aggregating livelihood activities and federating of producer groups to ensure
scale and quality that were required for sustainability of investments and institutions. Phase
II expected IDA support to play an additional role of developing capacity of local
institutions, in particular, Pradeshiya Sabhas, as key partners in the local development
process, catalyzing support to consolidate the participatory and transparent resource
allocation at the local government level. Total investment was US$75 million and the
project was consistent with the 2008 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) that re-framed
IDA’s assistance in alignment with MC, wherein the three pillars were equitable
development, accelerated growth and strengthening of public service delivery.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The objective of the APL was to enhance incomes and quality of life of poor households
in the poorest divisions in the territory of the Recipient through: (i) empowering the poor
and developing and strengthening institutions of the poor; (ii) improving access of the poor
to basic infrastructure and social services and providing support for productive activities;
and (iii) developing policies, rules, systems, procedures and institutional arrangements to
enable the Recipient to transfer funds directly to communities and local governments.

The key PDO indicators were:
 
    (i)     At least 30 % increase in incremental income against base year for 50 % of
            targeted households by the end of project.
    (ii)    At least 70 % of households benefiting from improved social community
            infrastructure and social services sub-projects.
    (iii)   At least 70% of Pradeshiya Sabhas have implemented intra- and inter-
            connectivity sub-projects in accordance with the agreed rules and in a demand-
            driven way.
    (iv)    At least 70% of Pradeshiya Sabhas have developed participatory process and
            social accountability mechanism including positive score cards as included in
            the Institutional Strengthening Plan.
    (v)     At least 50% of Project villages benefit from linkages with other government
            program such as nutrition, youth, agriculture, environment, Samurdhi
            livelihood and disability.



                                              3
   (vi)   At least 50% of Village Organization Federations and Village Savings and
          Credit Organization federations are rated as A and/or B, and are providing the
          services for livelihood promotion to their members.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The PDO was revised, along with the PDO indicators, during the May 2013 Level 1
restructuring. A number of intermediate outcome indicators were revised both during the
May 2013 restructuring and the February 2014 restructuring.

The revised PDO was to enhance incomes and quality of life of the poor households in the
poorest divisions in the country while building capacity of government agencies, local
governments and community organizations for service delivery and overall project
implementation.

The revised key PDO indicators were:

   (i)    At least average 20% incremental increase in income against base year for 50 %
          of targeted households by the end of project;
   (ii)   At least 70 % of targeted households utilizing improved community intra-
          village infrastructure and social services for intended purposes;
   (iii) At least 70 % of PS have implemented inter-connectivity sub-projects in
          accordance with the agreed rules;
   (iv)   At least 60% of villages (VOs) are utilizing inter-connectivity infrastructure for
          intended purpose;
   (v)    Establish O&M Unit and O&M fund in 60% project PS;
   (vi)   At least 70% of PS have developed participatory process (CAP) and downward
          accountability mechanism (GAAP) including score cards as included in the
          Institutional Strengthening Plan;
   (vii) At least 50% of project villages benefit from linkages with other government
          program including infrastructure; and
   (viii) At least 75 % of Phase I and Phase II VOs are rated as A or B.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The project planned to reach 220,000 households (780,000 persons) in Phase II, and
425,000 households (205,000 households from Phase I) in aggregate, comprising
approximately 1.7 million persons. At the end of the project, approximately 220,000
households (872,000 persons) in Phase II, and approximately 420,000 households (1.72
million persons) benefitted from project activities in both phases.

The primary intended beneficiaries can be categorized into 4 groups. (a) Poor and
vulnerable households including women, youth and extremely poor individuals who were
to benefit through access to” affordable credit to take up income generating activities;
productive and social infrastructure for market access and social empowerment; skills
development loans for youth for increased employment opportunities; and one time grants
                                            4
for the most vulnerable to initiate productive activities and encourage participation in
savings and credit groups. (b) Select estate communities, considered to be amongst the
most vulnerable groups in the country, were to benefit from rehabilitation and construction
of new infrastructure that would improve their living situations. (c) Small and marginal
farmers that formed Producer Groups (PGs) were to benefit through linkages to line
agencies, agro-processors and private sector and access inputs, technical services and
markets for high productivity and prices. (d) Pradeshiya Sabhas and some federated
institutions (that were dropped during the May 2013 restructuring) were expected to benefit
through institutional strengthening and support to sustain completed infrastructure sub-
projects and private related goods generated through savings and credit activities
respectively.

Secondary beneficiaries included project staff as well as government employees of the
Samurdhi department who were to receive training in the implementation of the CDD
approach to rural development.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project consisted of five components as follows: (a) Intra-village Development; (b)
Inter-village Connectivity Development; (c) Public, People and Private Sector
Partnerships; (d) Project Management and Monitoring; and (e) Convergence and Policy
Support.

Component A: Intra-Village Development (US$59.40 million): This component was
expected to build institutional capacity of pro-poor local institutions, and fund village
development and livelihood-related investments at the village level. It had two sub-
components: (a) Development and Strengthening of Village Organizations and Estate
Communities (VO), to help develop and strengthen self-reliant and self-managed people’s
organizations, including sub-project planning and implementation support; and (b) Village
Development Fund, with bulk of the funds getting transferred to the VOs as sub-grants to
finance capacity building, community infrastructure and social services, and livelihood
support activity sub-projects. Roughly 60 percent of the Village Development Fund was to
be utilized for community infrastructure sub-projects such as roads, drinking water, and
multi-purpose building (which were to have community contribution of 30 percent of the
sub-project cost); 10 percent for capacity building sub-projects, and the remaining 30
percent for livelihood support sub-projects through Village Savings and Credit
Organizations (VSCO).

Component B: Inter-village Connectivity Development (US$30.0 million): This
component was expected to promote inter-village development to consolidate and sustain
investments generated at the village level; and consisted of three sub-components: (a)
Strengthening of Pradeshiya Sabha Institutions – to plan, implement and manage their
inter-village and cluster development investments; (b) Establishing the Pradeshiya Sabha
Inter-village Connectivity Fund to finance inter-village infrastructure and social service
subprojects, and for PS capacity building through Institutional Strengthening Plans.
Roughly 95 percent of the fund would be utilized for infrastructure activities; and (c)

                                            5
Developing the inter-village federation and community resource center which consisted of
strengthening of village organizations vertically as federations (VO federations, VSCO
federations, and economic activity federations) and financing livelihood and productive
infrastructure activities through the federated institutions.

Component C: Public, People and Private Sector Partnerships (US$4.40 million): This
component was expected to: (a) support and strengthen the project teams, public sector
agencies and other stakeholders at the national, provincial, district, divisional and cluster
level in operationalizing the CDD approach to respond to the needs of the poor; and (b)
provide livelihood and business support for: (i) strengthening the capacity of the
federations to market their products and services and to form linkages with the private
sector through provision of technical assistance, training and the undertaking studies; and
(ii) pilot innovative ideas which needed experimentation, learning, and incubation and had
potential for scale-up and replication. This also involved the development of new economic
activities with value-added products for livelihood improvement, and the provision of
access to information technology and communications to rural communities.

Component D: Project Management and Monitoring (US$7.8 million): This
component was expected to facilitate overall coordination, planning, implementation,
compliance check and quality, learning and monitoring of the project at the national,
provincial level and district level.

Component E: Convergence and Policy Support (US$3.40 million): This component
was expected to provide technical assistance to Gamaneguma and Samurdhi programs to
adopt the CDD approach; and improve pro-poor orientation and fund the Village
Development Plans of demonstration villages. 

1.6 Revised Components

At the time of May 2013 Level 1 restructuring, project components were revised as follows:

Component A: Intra-Village Development (US$61.44 million): Three specific changes
were made to this component (the revised Financing Agreement retained the language of
the original Financing Agreement as it was deemed sufficiently broad): (a) Village
Organizations were restructured to focus more on enhanced livelihood and market linkage
for PGs; (b) More emphasis was placed on leveraging additional financial resources
through formal bank linkages to supplement limitations in financial lending capacity of the
VCSOs; and (c) The number of village infrastructure sub-projects and community
contribution were reduced. Sub-projects were reduced to a maximum of 4 sub-projects per
VO while contribution was reduced to 20% for the first village infrastructure and 10% for
subsequent ones. Contribution for estate communities was made notional and reduced to
5%, all of which encompassed labor, cash and materials.

Component B: Inter-village Connectivity Development (US$21.94): Three specific
changes were made to this component: (a) The number of inter-village infrastructure sub-
projects in the targeted PSs was reduced to fund only those that could be completed before

                                             6
project closure and community cash contribution was removed in favor of in-kind
contribution; (b) Funds were allocated for establishment of O&M Units in all project
supported PSs and provisions made to allow for central procurement 2 and direct
contracting for complex sub-projects in difficult terrain; and (c) Activities relating to inter-
village federation and community resource center development and financing livelihood
and productive infrastructure activities through the federated institutions were dropped as
second-generation community institutions (federations) were discontinued.

Component C: Public, Private and People Sector Partnership (US$5.5 million): Two
specific changes were made to this component: (a) Activities related to supporting and
strengthening the participating agencies in operationalizing the CDD approach to respond
to the needs of the poor were moved to Component D; and (b) Activities related to the PGs
were scaled up in place of federated entities, which were discontinued Funds were also
allocated for creating productive partnerships with public, private and Small Medium
Enterprise sectors engaged in agricultural research, extension services, input supply
services, processing, retail value chain and export. Support was to be further strengthened
through strategic financial partnerships with commercial banks.

Component D: Project Management and Monitoring (US$10.0 million). This
component was refocused to support a strategic unit for Project Management that
strengthened professional accountability of district level staff to provide required
facilitation to village organizations.

Component E: Convergence and Policy Support (US$6.12 million): Apart from the
transfer of activity from Component C to facilitate community access and support from
line agencies and the improvement of project staff capacity to carry out their functions
effectively, two new activities were added: (a) mainstreaming the project into government
established Divineguma and Samurdhi programs; and (b) Strengthening Village
Organizations on sustainability activities and linking them with government agencies as
part of exit strategies and convergence with government programs for public service
support.

1.7 Other significant changes

The first restructuring approved in May 2013 brought about significant changes that aimed
to align the project with GoSL’s proposed institutional change and policy orientation. The
changes included the following:




2
  This was in cases where materials were scarce or there was an advantage of economies of scale for communities to
select this option.


                                                         7
   The lending instrument was changed from an APL to SIL (now IPF) to account for
    changes in the policy environment as policy related performance triggers3 necessary to
    move to the next phase of the APL were unattainable
   The Gemi Diriya Foundation, which was the responsible agency for project
    implementation, was dissolved and replaced with a Project Management Unit (PMU)
    under the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) in line with Government’s plans
    for a centralized governance structure that would oversee rural development programs
    across the country
   Results Framework: PDO was revised along with outcome and intermediate indicators
    to better articulate the PDO and align with significant changes in component activities
   Additional safeguard policies were triggered4 in anticipation of potential risks related
    to the implementation of inter-connectivity subjects
   Credit proceeds were reallocated across components and disbursement categories to
    reflect changing needs of activities
   The funding ratio was revised upwards to 80% and 70% from 75% and 65% for
    development and operating costs respectively to accommodate the reduction in
    community contribution

The changes to the Company Act (1996) during that period affected the registration status
of Village Organizations, most of which did not have the financial and technical resources
to comply with the new regulations. As a result, the company registration for the majority
of VOs which operated as Village Companies was abolished (with the exception of 14 VOs
that continued to operate as Village Companies) and this left them with no legally
recognized status5

Further changes were made in a Level-2 restructuring that was approved in February
2014 which included the following:

   Funding ratio was further revised to 100% for all categories of expenditure following
    Government’s decision to discontinue counterpart funding for the project


3
  Performance triggers included establishment of Federation of Village Organizations that were functional
and linked to private sector and other partners; issuance of a government order adopting the village level
institutional mechanisms and procedures at the national level. These triggers ran counter to Government’s
policy approach as federations were discontinued for preference towards a more centralized institutional
mechanism that followed a top down approach.

4
 Safeguard policies triggered were OP/BP 4.04-Natural Habitats, OP/BP 4.09- Pest Management, and
OP/BP 4.12- Involuntary Resettlement - World Bank Restructuring Paper Report No. 74372-LK

5
  The Company Act (1996) was amended in 2013 to standardize administrative and reporting requirements
for all firms/companies regardless of size. This escalated transaction costs which could not be met by the
majority of VOs. The 14 VOs that took the decision to continue operating as Village Companies were high
performing communities that were able to cover the high costs. The remaining VOs were registered under
the Ministry of Economic Development, which was not legal form of registration – World Bank
Supervision Reports


                                                     8
   A number of project activities were scaled back and further changes made to the Results
    Framework to revise two intermediate indicator targets6 in line with implementation
    timeline and revised funding ratio.
   Project closing date was extended by six (6) months from March 31, 2014 to September
    30, 2014

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project design built on major lessons and experiences that emerged from the first phase
of the program. It was the continuation of a long term program involving a three-phase
Adaptable Program Loan (APL), each covering a 4 year period, considered to be the most
effective modality in supporting rural development policy and institutional development
for the long term. An APL was the appropriate instrument because it signaled a
commitment to a long term partnership with the Bank especially as systems were still
considered to be fragile and the country was slowly emerging from a conflict situation.
Further, the project’s approach required flexibility in implementation to build on lessons
from subsequent phases, which an APL was well suited for.

As part of preparation, main issues related to the sector where analyzed in depth including
the impact of the global financial crisis on the economy and the state of the Estate Sector.
The Government’s strategies7 to deal with emerging issues were also taken into account in
the design. Key lessons from Phase 1 that enhanced community commitment, scaled up
results through peer-to-peer exchanges, enhanced capacity and empowerment through
simple procedures and guidelines supported by a flexible service delivery approach were




6
  The project had originally planned to support 560 Producer Groups. However, since the funding
constraint affected seasonal activities planned, the number was scaled down to 429. Planned activities for
partnership programs with the private sector were also scaled down due to the funding constraint. In
addition, 427 intra-village sub-projects that had been planned for construction had to be dropped because of
the unlikelihood of completing the projects within the project period. The revision in targets were for: (i)
Intermediate Indicator C-2: At least 60% of PGs meet their operational expenses from regular sources of
cash flows which was revised to 50%, as considerable effort would be required to strengthen producer
groups sufficiently in the short period; (ii) Intermediate Indicator B-1: 70% of planned & approved
Interconnectivity sub- projects within PS have been completed was revised to 60%.

7
  GoSL’s response to rural poverty at the time was based on the Mahinda Chintana (MC) 10-year
Development Framework (2006) which placed particular emphasis on achievement of equitable growth and
reduction of regional disparities. Government’s commitment was further cemented through an additional
flagship program known as Gamaneguma whose overall objective was to develop the village as a center for
national development through an integrated total village development program. (PAD, Page 3)


                                                     9
all incorporated into the design. Lessons were also taken from regional and international
experiences8 of CDD operations in India, Nepal, Indonesia and Brazil.

Government’s interests to mainstream the project’s activities into the national program
(Gamaneguma) were acknowledged at project design and a number of alternative
approaches were considered to facilitate this9. Based on the key lessons that emerged from
Phase 1, it was assessed that governance systems and capacities were too weak and risky
for such an undertaking, and the flexibility, speed and autonomy of the Gemi Diriya
Foundation was what was critically needed to pilot a new infrastructure model, build
capacity of stakeholder agencies and deliver private goods that could generate higher
incomes for poor communities. To align with Government’s long term strategic vision
however, it was agreed that a gradual phase out process for the Foundation would be
implemented in which it would continue to play an implementing agency role during Phase
2 with provisions made to transfer some functions to Government agencies, build capacity
to deliver services efficiently and promote the CDD approach – a transition that was
expected to see the Foundation close down at the end of Phase 210. It was planned that by
the end of year 3 of the second phase, both GoSL and IDA would jointly carry out two
independent evaluations to assess readiness of the Samurdhi Authority and Federation of
VOs to take over implementation of Phase 3. Phase 3 envisaged sufficiently capacitated
Samurdhi Authority and Federation of VOs to provide support services and implement
project activities. Findings from the evaluation were to form the basis of discussion and
agreements with GoSL on implementation arrangements of the project for the remaining
APL period and the kind of role that Gemi Diriya Foundation would play until Government
agencies and community institutions fully graduated to take full responsibility.

The PDO was relevant, appropriate and consistent with the project’s planned activities and
with the Government’s long term rural development strategy. The indicators were both
qualitative and quantitative and made adequate provision to support evidence of impact.



8
  Projects lessons incorporated in project design where from India’s Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty
Alleviation Project, Madhya Pradesh District Poverty Initiatives Project; Nepal Poverty Alleviation Project;
Indonesia KDP Project and Brazil Poverty Alleviation Program.

9
  At design, it was considered to mainstream Gemi Diriya within the Gamaneguma program and transfer
implementation to the line Ministry and Samurdhi Authority, however, integration of the program within
the Ministry of Nation Building/Samurdhi Authority was rejected in the absence of evidence to support
strong governance systems and capacity. It was also considered to implement only intra-village activities
but lessons from the previous phase demonstrated a need to go beyond village level investments and adopt
a comprehensive development approach to ensure sustainability of investments and optimize impact.
Implementation through Pradeshiya Sabhas only was also rejected because earlier lessons showed that they
were not the best mediums for delivering private goods. (PAD, Page 10)

10
  The Government’s interest in scaling up and mainstreaming the project’s approach was to bring
consistency among its 3 main national poverty reduction programs (Gemi Diriya. Gamaneguma and
Samurdhi)and utilize its agencies and manpower to ensure long term sustainability of the Gemi Diriya
Program (PAD, Page 10)


                                                    10
Although, indicators for convergence signaled gradual transition towards Government
systems, the absence of a comprehensive and sequenced transition plan with specific
milestones (including a capacity building plan for government staff expected to take over
project activities as well as Foundation milestones towards handover functions) appears to
have been a shortcoming in the design.

Risk Assessment. The main risks identified at appraisal were linked largely to the addition
of the inter-village connectivity sub-component and the transfer of implementation
responsibilities to Samurdhi Authority which were considered to be substantial. Identified
risks included political interference with CDD and project management; weaknesses in
fiduciary management at the Pradeshiya Sabha level; governance failures at community
level and ineffective grievance handling mechanism at the Foundation level. The project
prepared a Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) and Conflict Analysis
Framework with mitigating measures to address identified risks. The risks that materialized
during implementation were managed appropriately and those that were unanticipated such
as Government’s decision to dissolve the Foundation mid-way through implementation
were also addressed through project restructuring.

Adequacy of participatory processes and Government Commitment: The project was
prepared in a highly participatory manner. Government officials, the Bank, beneficiaries,
and other stakeholders were meeting regularly during project design which resulted in
important project inputs such as the M&E framework and community operational manuals.
GoSL had demonstrated a high level of commitment at the time of project design and a
strong belief in the project’s key principles which had been incorporated in the national
Gamaneguma flagship program. Similarly, Samurdhi (social safety net) program had
adopted participatory targeting methodologies and expanded credit benefits to wider
community members. In addition, the Government had requested IDA support to test the
inter-connectivity model using local government structures that would build capacity of
local officials to implement the rural development programs using CDD approach.

2.2 Implementation

Implementation began well after effectiveness in December 2009, the program was well
received and recognized by many at the national and local levels. The implementation
modalities had been designed during a reform minded period of the country’s history. The
Gemi Diriya Foundation (“GDF” or “Foundation”) served as a facilitation hub that
attracted youth, competitively hired and developed skills that were transferable after the
program ended. GDF was set up as a company with the hope that it could implement its
activities with minimal political interference. This choice of program delivery was a source
of concern especially among government employees who were unhappy about the wages
and per diems paid to GDF staff through the soft loan obtained by GoSL. Although the
Foundation was considered to be effective and was viewed by the Government as a service
delivery model that was desirable, it was also regarded as ultimately unaffordable if the




                                            11
program was to scale up nationally 11 . Following national elections of May 2010, the
Foundation was transferred to the Ministry of Economic Development which replaced the
previous Ministry of Nation Building. The Government was moving towards a more
centralized approach to rural development and was keen to consolidate its victory and end
to civil conflict by minimizing all forms of political dissent. The empowerment model -
the need to increase voice and demand for good governance – associated with the CDD
approach appeared to run counter to government’s goal of centralizing decision making.
There was an expressed Government urgency to accelerate integration of GDF into regular
government apparatus that created uncertainties about timing and process of transition and
thereby negatively affected implementation. Subsequent erosion of GDF functionality and
eventual removal of Project Director only served to further aggravate the situation. Interim
arrangements that brought in Director General of Samurdhi Authority to oversee project
implementation with Samurdhi staff filling up vacant project positions would probably
have been considered adequate had attention been paid to getting the right officers with
required skills and qualifications to handle project activities. The transitional arrangements
were far from smooth, affected staff morale and saw the departure of experienced and well
trained GDF staff. All of these factors led the project implementation to be downgraded to
“Moderately Unsatisfactory”.

At the time of the Mid-Term Review carried out in April-May 2013, the above-mentioned
issues and other concerns were reviewed, including:
 GOSL’s policy changes which rendered the institutional model on which the APL was
    based inoperable
 Policy implications of the Divineguma Act (2013)12 on continued existence of VOs
 Discontinuation of the federation approach aimed at providing the longer term support
    to VOs and VSCOs
 Major risks which needed innovative approaches to make the project work under the
    prevailing situation and as governed by government policies
 Slow progress on the pilot program to support PS and the uncertainty of completing
    project activities within the scheduled times

It was agreed to restructure the project as documented in Sections 1.6 and 1.7. Other factors
that affected implementation were erratic and delayed release of counterpart funding as

12
   The Divineguma Act came into effect on January 11, 2013. The Act was designed to promote
community development through support to community institutions. It built partially on livelihood
development models that have been develped in Sri Lanka over the past years, aimed to integrate
procedures established under Samurdhi, and introduced new structures and procedures. The Divineguma
program had essentially replaced Gamaneguma whose objectives were ‘folded’ into the new Act.


                                                  12
well as the lack of a dedicated Project Director to focus solely on project activities13. The
operation of another CDD approach for the North-East that was fully mainstreamed into
government structures served to fuel negative government perception of the Gemi Diriya
model and further diminished support and commitment14. In hindsight, the project should
have developed a strong communication strategy that would have kept higher authorities
well informed of results and enhanced buy-in to the bottom-up approach.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. The project had a well-developed results-based participatory Monitoring,
Evaluation and Learning (ME&L) system with a strong focus on project processes, results,
impact and outcome in addition to input and output monitoring. The project had also
developed a robust web-based management information system (MIS), to regularly
monitor results and compliance at village, divisional and district level. The PAD provided
for specific project outcome indicators and intermediate outcome indicators to assess
progress in meeting the PDO and implementation targets.

M&E implementation. Data on the indicators developed during project preparation was
collected regularly at VO level by community mobilizers who fed the data into web-based
system. Project level activities were monitored and tracked through a village monitoring
matrix with data collected by community professionals for each village and updated
monthly. The village matrix covered all key indicators that provided an assessment of
overall village performance and was used as a basis for village grading15. Data were closely
monitored by the PMU and the actual figures were compared with the target values. The
PMU was able to generate ministerial progress reports, quarterly progress reports,
supervision mission reports as well as annual reports from MIS database. Adjustments were
made to outcome and intermediate indicators in line with project restructuring carried out
and detailed in sections 1.6 and 1.7.

M&E utilization. Appropriate data collected from the monthly, quarterly, and annual
progress reports was evaluated and used for decision-making regarding certain activities.
The extent of data collection was very detailed but was not fully optimized for decision
making. There were specific examples in which efficiencies were gained in the use of M&E


13
   The project Director for the Gemi Diriya Project was also in charge of 3 other donor funded projects
(including 2 other WB projects) which affected timeliness of decisions to keep progress on track.

14
   It was reported that Ministry of Economic Development had made informal announcement of major
restructuring of the project and amalgamation of Gemi Diriya and Re-Awakening Projects –
Implementation Support Mission Aide Memoire (June 2011)

15
   Village grading system covers key indicators that include; gender and inclusiveness of poorest in
decision making positions; support to one time grantees; capacity building support and livelihood support
to beneficiaries, youth employment and skills development support, infrastructure progress and VSCO
performance. Ratings range from A, B C and D, with the lower two grades (C and D) indicating poor
performance and weak villages.


                                                    13
data such as the Village grading process which became fully automated using data
uploaded into the MIS at the cluster level and verified through random field sampling. This
proved to save time on a process that took longer when physical visits were to be made to
over 2000 villages.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Safeguards. The overall compliance of OP/BP 4.0 (Natural Habitats);
OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment); and OP/BP 4.09 (Pest Management) was
satisfactory. Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for both intra-village and inter-
connectivity sub-projects were well prepared with implementation levels recorded and
included in the MIS. This facilitated documentation and pro-active tracking of
environmental safeguard implementation in the field.

Social Safeguards: The project maintained a very good data base on land acquisitions
from 2009. Most of the lands used for small scale infrastructure development activities
were obtained from government agencies, especially the land released from respective
Divisional Secretariats. The project adopted the popular ‘voluntary land donation’ system
to meet the land requirements for infrastructure projects. In order to ensure due diligence
in social safeguards, a grievance redress mechanism (GRM) was established
and implemented throughout the project period. The GRM system included a number of
institutional structures starting from village level to project level. The observations and
findings of independent reviewers showed that the GRM mechanism was functioning well
at the village level. Overall, there were no serious adverse social impacts or violation of
safeguards principles. The PMU submitted quarterly reports on land donations and
prepared safeguards due diligence reports.

Both environmental and social safeguards compliance was assessed as Satisfactory.

Fiduciary Compliance. The financial management performance rating of the project was
Moderately Satisfactory for much of the project life, with the exception of an upgrade to
Satisfactory during the third supervision mission as it was assessed that financial
management systems at community and project levels were operating satisfactorily.
Financial management information system was in place and reporting, internal controls and
audits were on track with a few identified issues to be improved overtime. IUFRs were
generally received on a timely basis. Annual external audits were unqualified until FY11.
While subsequent audit reports had a qualified opinion, the qualifications reported were
generally not considered to be serious. However, by the fifth supervision mission, the rating
was again downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory due to general weaknesses in financial
record keeping, reporting and internal controls. Deficiencies continued throughout the
remainder of the project period and the rating was further downgraded during the final
supervision mission to Moderately Unsatisfactory, mainly due to allegations that surfaced




                                             14
concerning misuse of project funds in Badulla District from a funds transfer mechanisms
adopted in the later stage of the project16, which were later proven to be true.

Procurement Arrangements. Procurement of all works, goods and technical services
under the project followed the Procurement Guidelines “Procurement under IBRD Loans
and IDA Credits”. There were lapses in procurement carried out by agencies mainly at the
sub-national level. This was mainly due to lack of knowledge and capacity to handle sub-
projects. Post reviews were carried out every year during the project period with no mis-
procurement issues identified during reviews. The overall procurement performance was
Moderately Satisfactory.

Overall, fiduciary compliance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory over project
implementation duration.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The project was originally designed as part of a three phase APL but was restructured during
implementation to conform to Government’s desire for continued support of the rural
development agenda through its own implementation structures. At the time of ICR
discussions, the Divineguma Development Department (DDD) - established by the
Divineguma Act (2013) and housed under then Ministry of Economic Development (MED)
- was envisaged to be the main implementing vehicle for all rural development projects
supported by the Government and donor partners. The department was expected to continue
supporting the VOs through its cadre of Divineguma Development Officers (DDO) recruited
at each GND. An Administrative Order was issued in July 2014 to initiate the process of
registering all Gemi Diriya VOs under the department as part of government’s long term
sustainability strategy to secure community assets. However, the process was subject to the
finalization of the DDD’s own structure, procedures, operational modalities and bye-laws
which remained under preparation. Following the presidential election held in January 2015,
a new Government came into power and ministerial portfolios changed. The MED was
abolished and the DDD moved to the newly established Ministry of Housing and Samurdhi.
Following MED’s dissolution, it remained unclear whether further action was taken to
register the VOs under any legal form, and whether the DDD as a national program was to
remain the Government’s main framework for rural poverty reduction. Still, benefits of the
CDD approach and the achievements of the project were widely acknowledged by the new
Government.




16
   In August 2014, the Bank team carried out a fiduciary review in Badulla district to review fund transfers
that had taken place in light of allegations of misuse of funds. Observations indicated that fund transfers
and the management of such funds in 59% of the sampled VOs were violated in various elements related to
procedures, guidelines, principles and internal controls applicable to the project. An independent audit of
the district carried out by the Government confirmed Bank findings. In April 2015, the Bank declared
ineligible expenditures for transactions amounting to US$ 170,213.76. The request for refund was sent to
the Government and was pending official response – Fiduciary Review Report (September 2014)


                                                    15
The sustainability of VOs is debatable in the current environment of unclear policy direction
regarding rural development. The new Government has only been in power for a few months
and is still in the reorganization process of its administrative setup. At the time of project
closure, 1,842 VOs out of 2044 VOs were functioning while 202 VOs were inactive. There
was urgent concern expressed about funds that were in the Bank accounts of inactive VOs
and the associated risks of misappropriation in the absence of systematic oversight of
activities and lack of support to revive and keep community activities going. The
sustainability concerns also extended to the intra-village infrastructure sub-projects that were
to be maintained by communities. While operations and maintenance funds had been set up
at community level, there was a clear and felt need for sustained technical services beyond
minor issues that seemed to be difficult for the VOs to address. However, with regard to
water supply projects, majority of VOs had registered their schemes with the National Water
Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) for continued technical assistance and support. MoUs
were signed by the majority of VOs.

VOs that maintained registration as Village Companies continued to operate independently
of project and Government support since 2010. Sustainability of these entities was less of an
issue because as legally recognized entities subject to regulations applicable under the
Company Act, they continued to meet their obligations.

The project had made notable effort to support PGs and linked them with line agencies and
private sector agro-processors for technical inputs and support. However, their operations
were still in the nascent stages and required concerted support, particularly in strengthening
their institutional functioning. Their sustainability was not ascertained as there was no clear
strategy for their continued support.

The inter-village connectivity sub-component implemented by local government structures
established O&M Units for each Pradeshiya Sabha along with building facilities and
equipment, provided an O&M fund, and established O&M committees together with an
implementation plan. This was considered very innovative. Capacity building for
strengthening O&M setup was linked with PS institutional programs and the result was
commitment from all participating PSs to allocate a minimum 10% of their annual budgets
towards operation and maintenance activities. Nine out of 11 PSs obtained Provincial
Council approval for the 2014 budget allocation with a minimum of 15% towards operations
and maintenance.

(b) Follow-on project: No follow-on project is planned.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objective. Relevance of the project’s objective remains High. Creating
opportunities for marginalized communities to improve their living conditions and to access
additional services was at the core of the Divineguma Act (2013) and continues to be central
to Sri Lanka’s poverty reduction strategy. The new Government has indicated plans to

                                             16
develop a National Policy Framework that would deal with the critical challenges the country
faces and embark on social and economic reform that would lead to prosperity for all citizens.
Amongst areas identified are support to small holder farmers in terms of access to inputs and
improved pricing systems; support for the non-farm sector; support for women
empowerment and vulnerable groups; youth employment; and support for development and
regulation of micro-finance. The project remains consistent with the current Bank Country
Partnership Strategy CPS (2012 – 2016) which envisions increased support for improving
livelihoods among the disadvantaged groups and agricultural productivity. The PDO
remained highly relevant even at the stage the Level 1 restructuring was approved.

Relevance of Design and Implementation. The design, including significant adjustments
made in the process of implementing the project, served to further embed the program into
government structures. The eventual dissolution of the Gemi Diriya Foundation prior to
project closing and the adoption of the participatory approach in the planning and
implementation of the Samurdhi safety net program and a range of other rural development
programs was a low risk strategy. However, during implementation, the decision of the
government to merge the project’s activities into its own integrated village development
program accelerated the demise of the Foundation. The establishment of a Project
Management Unit under the-then Ministry of Economic Development along with the
creation of Divineguma Development Department under the same ministry were seen as a
natural bridge for CDD knowledge transfer and continued sustainable support to project
communities. The DDD is now a part of the newly established Ministry of Housing and
Samurdhi. The project design of intra- and inter-village social and community
infrastructure development, the creation of VOs, VSCOs, and Producers’ Organizations to
address issues relating to access to inputs, including credit, and markets, was both
innovative and successful. The participatory approach to local level development has been
vindicated under this project and the earlier phase. Although the project design and
implementation arrangements may undergo further changes, the core project principles of
transparency, participation and direct fund transfers to communities which had
substantially underpinned project implementation up to the June 2013 restructuring and
beyond until project closing, and contributed to the main achievements of the project,
would most likely be embedded in any new design or implementation arrangement
proposal. Although there were factors that affected implementation as mentioned in
Section 2.2, the project implementation arrangement was responsive to achieving the
project objective throughout the project implementation period.

Rating: Given these considerations, the relevance of objective, design, and implementation
is rated as Substantial, for both the pre- and post-restructuring phase.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

As the original project objective was formally revised at the time of restructuring in June
2013, the project outcome was assessed against both the original and revised project
objective. Separate outcome ratings (against original and revised project objectives) were
weighted in proportion to the share of actual credit disbursements made in the periods



                                            17
before and after approval of the revision. Based on the two ratings as shown in Annex 10,
the overall achievement of the project is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

I. PDO Achievement before restructuring
The objective of the APL was to enhance incomes and quality of life of poor households
in the poorest divisions in the territory of the Recipient through: (i) empowering the poor
and developing and strengthening institutions of the poor; (ii) improving access of the poor
to basic infrastructure and social services and providing support for productive activities;
and (iii) developing policies, rules, systems, procedures and institutional arrangements to
enable the Recipient to transfer funds directly to communities and local governments.

The project was able to empower the poor, develop and strengthen institutions of the
poor and facilitate access to credit: Prior to level-1 restructuring, the project had formed
1,010 Village Organizations (VOs) under Phase II and continued to support 1,034 VOs
established under Phase I. All Phase I (100%) VOs and 97% of VOs under Phase II had
accessed Village Development funds (VDF) to undertake investments in social, economic
and community infrastructure. Overall the program had supported 1990 Village Savings
and Credit Organizations comprised of about 38,700 small groups that managed savings of
about US$3.2 million and issued loans to the tune of US$38 million. 918 VSCOs
                                               18
established under Phase II made up of about 19,200 small groups (75% female) generated
over US$1 million in savings and issued loans up to US$7.5 million. About 6,600 most
vulnerable members of communities had benefited from one time grants and about 5,700
(86%) had initiated income generating activities. All VSCOs had set up loan security funds
to protect loan portfolio from potential default risks resulting from death or unforeseen
circumstances. This was part of the overall strategy to strengthen community financial
institutions’ asset base and maintain financially viability for the long term. Prior to
restructuring, 60% of VOs met their operational costs from regular cash flows (fees, profits
etc). While the income assessment was to be conducted at the end of the project period,
42% of targeted households were actively participating in VSCO activities and 80% of
these households had taken loans for agricultural purposes while remaining loans had been
distributed for non-farm activities. In addition, a Memorandum of Understanding had been
signed with the Bank of Ceylon to facilitate credit linkages and 95 bank officers/executives
were positioned at various bank branches to provide preferential treatment to project clients.
Bank of Ceylon had also provided bulk loans to 5 VSCOs for on-lending as a pilot measure.
At the time of restructuring, 19% of VO members had obtained credit through this link and
leveraged about US$400,000 in additional loans. Support to VOs for livelihood activities
and strengthening of savings and credit were continued post restructuring.

Federation of Village Organizations were established but limited in function due to
absence of clearly defined mandates and plans. The project supported the development
of second generation institutions called Federation of VOs to further provide technical
services to member VOs. Institutional development funds were released to support
federation activities that covered all VOs under Phase I and were expected to support the
phase out plan by progressively being handed additional responsibilities of facilitation and
technical service support to VOs. Core business activities had been initiated using non-
project funds and concerns had been expressed about how some transactions were carried
out. At restructuring, 40% of VO Federations and VSCO Federations were assessed to be
functioning well (rated A or B) and providing services for livelihood promotion to their
members (PDO – 6, achievement was 80% of target). There was not full understanding
and internalization of the Federation Manual by the project staff and GDF Board.
Additional capacity building for sub-committees was still required. As a result, federations
did not fully evolve to be considered as the critical bridge required to link communities
with lower government tiers. Rather, they were perceived as a parallel entity competing for
resources with local authorities, something that the Government was not keen to continue
promoting.

Emergence of functioning Producer Groups as focus shifted away from Federation of
VOs. In place of Federations, the Government was interested and more receptive to
promoting Producer Groups and providing ongoing support through the Divineguma
Program. The project initiated the formation of 144 Producer groups (PGs) covering over
8600 households and immediately linked 112 groups to government agency line support
services. Through the Divineguma Program, 20 PGs received project funding to implement
business plans and the VSCOs provided additional funding of US$5 million to paddy and
maize producers that resulted in a US$21 million contribution to the national coffers. A
number of linkages between agriculture producers and private and public sector

                                             19
organizations were established that included facilitation of provision of dairy development
packages (materials and technical advice) in seven (7) project districts by the Department
of Animal Production and Health. The project also collaborated with the Department of
Agriculture by introducing improved technology packages for maize production and
facilitation of extension support to small farmers for passion fruit and seed paddy
production. Technical support from the Department of Agriculture led to market linkages
that secured forward sales contracts for tomato farmers, production and marketing
arrangements for ornamental fish export with a private sector company and mechanized
paddy production with a private enterprise. At the time of project restructuring, MIS data
showed that 50% of VOs benefitted from government programs and private sector linkages
(PDO-5, achievement was 100% of target). Support to PGs was continued post
restructuring and additional groups were facilitated and supported.

Community Professional Learning and Training Centers (CPLTCs) were established to
provide facilitation support to VOs through the engagement of Community Professionals
(CPs). The centers were developed as localized sources of technical support for
communities and relied mainly on service charge derived from CP employment to cover
their operational costs. Although the project had invested in training CPs, many of the skills
acquired were not well matched with jobs outside the project and so many were largely
confined to project activities as their sole source of income. This business model proved to
be unsustainable for the Centers as they required a large number of CPs to be deployed to
meet their monthly operational costs. While the decision to discontinue with the Centers
made financial sense, the project still maintained the use of CPs within the VOs as they
had proven to be a valuable resource for sustaining community operations with minimal
project support. At the time of restructuring, 1890 CPs were trained and actively linked to
VOs providing facilitation services. The project continued to support CP facilitation
services in VOs especially those that were considered to be weak performing villages while
more mature and advanced VOs were able to sustain CPs by providing salaries through
funds generated from revolving fund activities. This was considered a more sustainable
approach compared to the prior business model and continued to be supported post
restructuring.

Communities identified and prioritized intra-village infrastructure to expand access to
services and improve quality of life. The project supported the consolidation of village
infrastructure sub-projects under Phase I and expanded construction of sub-projects to new
communities under Phase II. A total of 8,298 intra-village sub-projects over both phases
were initiated and about 74% had been completed. A total of 4,619 sub-projects were
completed out of 4,744 initiated under Phase I representing 97% completion rate for Phase
I. Under Phase II, the project embarked on 3554 infrastructure sub-projects and had handed
over 1,513 (42%) to communities after completion and certification. An additional 676
completed sub-projects were in the final stages of the certification process awaiting official
handover. Sustainability of infrastructure was a source of concern even prior to
restructuring and the project promoted the importance of organized O&M systems to
ensure sustainability. 1381 O&M accounts were established by VOs in seven (7) districts
and work was progressing to cover all VOs before the end of the project. MIS data indicated
that 43% of targeted households were utilizing community infrastructure (PDO-2,

                                             20
achievement was 61% of target). Support for completion of sub-project activities post
restructuring were ongoing.

Pilot activities were initiated with Pradeshiya Sabhas (PSs) to test the inter-connectivity
component. A total of 4 (out of targeted 11 PSs) had initiated 23 sub-projects out of which
18 were completed. The pilot had experienced several delays related to fund curtailments
and poor planning to jumpstart construction works on time. In spite of this, an additional
6 PSs were provided support to implement a proposed 46 sub-projects. Given substantial
delays experienced in the pilot phase, the project decided to fund only 37 inter-connectivity
sub-projects (of which 11 had been appraised, 4 started and 12 were at final design stage).
Funding had been released to all PSs for setup of O&M funds which led to the
establishment of O&M Units under the pilot program. According to MIS data, 36% of PSs
(4 out of 11) had implemented inter-connectivity sub-projects according to agreed rules at
the time of restructuring (PDO- 3, achievement was 51% of target) and support was
continued post restructuring to fully complete all sub-projects.

Institutional development of PSs was quite successful in improving citizen engagement.
The project was particularly successful in capacity building of PSs including refurbishing
and re-arranging of PS internal building spaces, training of staff and allocation of staff for
zonal coordination to work alongside communities on inter-connectivity sub-projects. The
intervention was observed to be stronger in the new PSs compared to PSs that implemented
the pilot activities. The interventions enabled PSs to evolve into service centers for their
communities with better working environments. GIS mapping was being utilized to locate
sub-projects and new initiatives were in place for asset management procedures. The
project established websites and MIS systems for 6 PSs which were being regularly
updated and e-libraries were setup in all PSs providing essential educational services
mainly to school children. Digital weighing machines were introduced for serving vendors
at weekly fairs to promote fair pricing. The success of the intervention led some Provincial
Councils to make provisions within their budgets for replication of the model to cover other
PSs. MIS data showed that about 36% of PSs developed participatory processes and social
accountability mechanisms including positive score cards as included in the Institutional
Strengthening Plan (PDO- 4, achievement was 51% of target). Activities were continued
post restructuring.

The project successfully developed policies, rules, systems and procedures but was not
fully successful in mainstreaming these into the institutional structures that could have
allowed government to transfer funds directly to communities and local governments. At
project design, Samurdhi Authority and Federation of VOs were identified as the vehicles
through which implementation of project activities would be anchored following the phase
out of GDF. The project successfully developed operational manuals and tested systems
and procedures that ensured focused resource allocation and systems of accountability for
the use of resources by communities. Prior to restructuring, Samurdhi Authority was given
jurisdiction over the implementation of CDD approach in a number of pilot and Samurdhi
villages to study the dynamics in facilitation by government officials of the planning units
at the district level and the officials of the Samurdhi Authority. Implementation of project
activities was found to be very slow as government officials had to contend with additional

                                             21
functions from their daily responsibilities alongside project activities. There was no
incentive mechanism in place to prioritize project activities and administrative steps taken
to request officials to facilitate village level activities did not yield the desired result.
Project staff were deployed to pilot and samurdhi villages to work alongside Samurdhi
officials and implement project activities. The collaboration was superficial as project staff
largely facilitated processes and supported communities to implement activities in those
areas. At the time of restructuring, Samurdhi Authority had not integrated CDD approaches
into their operations and were not sufficiently capacitated to carry out similar project
activities.

The ability to fully mainstream CDD approaches into government institutional structures
for direct support to communities was at the core of performance triggers17 meant to move
the project into Phase III of the program. At the time of restructuring, Phase II had only
partially succeeded in its horizontal and vertical expansions. 36% of PSs had managed to
implement at least one inter-village subproject; 40% of VOs had formed network of
federations and were implementing activities; 36% of PSs had received positive scores in
community performance assessment; and 54% of PSs had established MIS systems and
websites that were updated regularly. The remaining triggers related to the operation of
Federations of VOs and adoption of the CDD model at the national level could not
materialize as originally envisioned. The revision of the lending instrument at restructuring
from an APL to a SIL was an indication that the second phase of the Gemi Diriya Program
could not fully achieve the requirements for successful take off of the final phase of the
program. As a result, Phase II fell short of meeting the overall objectives of the three phase
Program.

Rating: Based on these achievements and considerations, project’s DO achievement prior
to restructuring is rated Modest.

II. PDO Achievement after restructuring

   Performance triggers for Phase III were based on achievement of both horizontal and vertical scale up of
activities. Horizontal triggers were: (1) At least 50% of PSs and villages covered during the first two years
of implementation have accessed funds and implemented at least one cluster/village level sub-project as per
agreed rules and procedures; (2) at least 70% of VOs covered under Phase I have formed network of
federations and linked to private sector and/or other partners for value addition/employment activities.
Policy Change/Vertical triggers were: (1) Issuance of a government order adopting the village level
institutional mechanism and procedures as described in the COM at the national level; (2) at least 50% of
PS covered during the first two years are updating and sharing information through web-based MIS on
utilization of public funds maintaining transparency and accountability (as agreed in PS institutional
Strengthening Plan); (3) at least 50% of VOs and PSs covered during the first two years have received
positive scores in community performance assessment.

The details of the project’s major outcomes and achievements are as follows:
Access to credit through Village Savings and Credit Organizations resulted in productive
investments that contributed to increased income for targeted households: VSCO loans
directly supported 80,391 households through livelihood activities and the majority (83%)
of whom were women while 81% were from the poor and poorest categories indicating the
effectiveness of the project’s targeting mechanism. Impact Assessment (IA) conducted by
Resources Development Consultants (PVT) Ltd in 2014 showed similar trends that 82%
of women had accessed loans and at least 77% of borrowers were from the poor and poorest
categories. 60% of loans disbursed were for agriculture activities while 28% went towards
self-employment. According to the IA, VSCO support helped borrowers to diversify
livelihood activities through new investments, reduced credit costs through low interest
rates, low transaction costs, and increased returns to income generating activities due to
timely availability of credit. The additional benefits directly contributed to improving
efficiency and eventually increasing household income levels. The IA showed a 39.9%
incremental increase in income against base year for 50% of targeted households (PDO-1:
target of 20% exceeded). The findings were based on household surveys conducted with
the same sample villages where the baseline survey had been undertaken. The survey
sample covered 2520 randomly selected households (Treatment – 2080; Control – 440) in
all the 9 districts where the project operated and used additional survey tools such as FGD
and KII for qualitative analysis.

Community Infrastructure contributed to improved quality of life through improvement
of access to markets and other services: By the end of the project, 4526 community sub-
projects were completed that included multi-purpose buildings, rural roads, water supply
schemes, minor irrigation works, sanitation and culverts. Project MIS data showed that at
least 76% of targeted households were accessing and making use of the sub-projects (PDO-
2: target of 70% exceeded). Almost 60% of infrastructure sub-projects were road

                                                23
development projects that resolved several issues for communities such as transportation
of products to markets and also provided easy access to fields, schools and health centers.
In terms of cost-effectiveness, the thematic study on infrastructure conducted by the PMU
showed that the cost of construction for 1km of road was 9% cheaper compared to
government engineering department 18 and the quality of construction was found to be
higher. The IA found that the level of satisfaction of households on the infrastructure
development was very high (97% surveyed were satisfied with services provided to them).
FGDs carried out for the IA indicated that main benefits from roads mentioned by
communities included lower transportation costs for outputs and inputs used in crop and
livestock production, time saved in all journeys, safer passage of children to school and
better access to health facilities. New bridges and culverts had “opened” new areas of land
and allowed expansion in planted areas.

Capacity of local governments and community organizations for service delivery
improved: The institutional development fund made available to Pradeshiya Sabhas proved
to contribute positively to their engagement with communities. Capacity development for
both PS staff and the community office bearers were undertaken in eleven PSs, with more
than 380 training programs undertaken on a range of relevant topics of the Community
Operational Manual (including procurement, social audit, infrastructure development,
among others). Six PSs also participated in peer to peer knowledge exchange visits.

All of the PSs were provided with funding to implement inter-connectivity sub-projects
and the IA verified that all (100%) had implemented sub-projects in accordance with the
agreed rules (PDO-3: target of 70% was exceeded). The engagement of support from
Technical Service Providers, while at times challenging due to lack of experience and weak
technical TSP skills, broadened their abilities for expanding collaboration to deliver needed
services to the communities. Coordination efforts also incorporated implementation inputs
from communities that enabled beneficiaries to directly participate in the service delivery
channel and strengthened relationship and trust with local authorities. Thematic study
conducted by the Project Management Unit and MIS data indicated that at least 83% of
villages were utilizing interconnectivity infrastructure (PDO-4: target of 60% was
exceeded) for improved market access as well as improved access to schools and hospitals.

The institutional development fund supported capacity building of PS staff, establishment
of procedures and systems for better service delivery and the establishment of O&M fund
and Unit at each PS (PDO-5: target of 60% was exceeded) in which an average monthly
contribution of Rs 2,500 was deposited into the fund in the beginning. By the end of project,
all the PSs had approved a designated percentage of the annual budget towards O&M fund.
According to the IA, Provincial Councils for all participating Pradeshiya Sabhas approved
an average 13% of PS budget allocation for O&M fund.

The institutional development fund also brought about an improved attitude towards local
development planning. Participating PSs began collecting community proposals as part of
their annual budget preparations and in 2013, allocated substantial amount of financial
resources for prioritized proposals submitted by the respective communities. A
thematic study on PS Institutional Development carried out by the PMU involving all PSs
showed that at least 40% of community inputs/proposals were included for implementation
in the annual budget.

The project team also provided training to 14,000 Economic Development Officers on the
CDD approach as part of the long term sustainability strategy expected through the
Ministry of Economic Development.

Improved efficiency of service delivery: PS Institutional funds contributed to better service
delivery through provision of better equipment and introduction of new systems.
Installation of software packages for accounting, revenue collection, inventory, water-
billing etc., led to an increase in monthly revenue collection by 45% and a reduction in
unpaid water tariff by 30%. Resource mapping using GIS has been integrated for decision
making in selecting priorities for government investments and especially for monitoring of
physical progress of the interconnectivity infrastructure projects. Improved performance
has led to improved ranking for all 11 PSs in the Government’s PS grading system.

MIS data shows that 72% of PSs developed participatory process (CAP) and downward
accountability mechanism (GAAP) (PDO-6: target of 70% was exceeded). Community
score-cards system used in CAP also supported improved service delivery at PS level,
while GAAP was used as a tool to identify governance and corruption related risks. Each
PS established a website that included a grievance redress option and feedback mechanism
to inform public about actions taken for complaints received, measures which contributed
to strengthening governance mechanisms.

Linkages established with Government Programs: Village institutions have not only been
important for productive benefits but also for a number of linkages with other government
social programs. Four MoUs were signed for promoting institutional level convergence
with Government stakeholders prominent in provision of technology packages including
Department of Agriculture (for rice and maize); Department of Export Agriculture (for
pepper and cinnamon); Department of Animal Production and Health (for Dairy) and Tea
Small-Holding Authority (for Tea). 433 producer groups that were funded to support
common interest income generating activities for 44,800 households benefitted from these
linkages. MIS data showed that PGs representing 58% of villages benefitted from both
public and private sector support (PDO-7: target of 50% was exceeded). Notable
contributions were made towards commodities/sectors of national importance such as dairy,
maize, paddy19 and tea. The project also facilitated introduction of value adding farm

   In the 2013 cropping season, farmers invested about US$44,000 of VSCO loans in paddy seed
cultivation and generated a revenue turnover of more than 250 percent.- Source: Thematic Study on

equipment such as paddy transplanters, milking machines, pruning machines for pepper
and multi chopper for compost preparation in collaboration with private companies.
Further, majority of PG members received a higher margin of return by engaging in
collective activities for input purchasing and transportation as well as marketing.
Productivity enhancement programs implemented with support from government and
private sector stakeholders showed great impact on productivity and farmers income20.

Further, the project was able to leverage public sector funds for building financial capital
that enabled village organizations access additional funds for livelihood activities. A MoU
was signed with the Bank of Ceylon that enabled an additional $2.03 million in capital to
be accessed by VOs thus providing additional credit to communities (Intermediate
Indicator C-3: target of $1 million was exceeded)

Limited success in strengthening Village Organizations for continued support to project
beneficiaries: The project adopted a two-pronged approach of helping build sustainable
economic units along with extending the contribution of ‘Divineguma’ livelihood program
in collaboration with government line agencies. Capacity building activities included
conducting 104 training programs on farm productivity improvement and household
income enhancement for 6200 VO members of which 70% were women. The trainings
involved substantive collaborative arrangements with line ministries and private sector
organizations, covering seasonal crops, fruit production, livestock development and other
rural/ agricultural enterprises. 1,830 Community Resource Persons were supporting VOs
in their respective activities. However, much of the success in terms of achievement of
outcome indicators is linked primarily to the effectiveness of VOs in carrying out their
activities. MIS data showed that only 66% of VOs were graded A or B (PDO-8: target of
75% substantially met) and even a lower percentage (59% according to the impact
assessment) were able to cover their operating costs through VSCOs. According to the IA,
about 70% of VSCOs (Intermediate indicator A-2: target of 80% substantially met) had
an on-time-repayment rate of 95%.

Rating: Based on these achievements, project’s DO rating after restructuring is rated
Substantial.

3.3 Efficiency


20
   One experiment conducted by Department of Census and Statistics with producer groups in Mahiyangana
in 2013 Yala season with 500 maize farmers on the technological package provided by the Dept. of
Agriculture. The target maize yield was 7 MT per ha and achievement of yield was 9.37 MT per ha, which
was 34% higher than the expected yield/ha. When it is compared with the national average of 5 – 6.25 mt per
ha, it was 50% – 80% higher and the average income increase was Rs 84,370 per ha per famer on the basis
of Rs 30/Kg of selling price. With support from Department of Agriculture and University of Wayamba
project was able to introduce some of the crops new geographical areas (passion fruit and pine apple). The
study conducted by the project and the MIS data shows that, 68 ha of new pineapple cultivation and 212 ha
of Passion fruit cultivation were started with project support.




                                                   26
This project achieved substantive outcomes across all components despite loan
restructuring and changes to component design over the implementation period. Estimates
indicate that overall project financial rate of return is nearly 24% over the full life of the
project. Economic returns are lower at 22.4% mainly due to high rates of input subsidy in
cereal crops and internally fixed prices for marketed output. A summary of Internal Rates
of Return and NPVs is given in the table below:

                                ICR Estimation
 Project Analysis     NPV        IRR           PAD
 Financial            5,303.97Mn 23.66%        NA
 Economic             5,000.71Mn 22.39%        NA

Detail of the methodology and approach of this analysis is contained in Annex 3. In
summary, the IRR estimates above were based on conservative assumptions including all
Phase II project costs (including retrospective financing of Phase I elements, mobilization
and management costs), fixed level of returns from investments in livelihoods,
infrastructure, convergence activities and capacity building at 2014 levels. Net tangible
incremental benefits from VSCO loan investments, physical infrastructure such as roads,
bridges, irrigation and health benefits from improved drinking water supply and sanitation.

Net incremental benefits from investments in micro-finance (VSCO funds) are generated
under Component A2: Village Development Fund – Livelihood Support Fund. The table
below summarizes the disbursement profile of funds with an estimated 73% of funds
allocated to crop and livestock enterprises:




Analysis of project MIS, Thematic Studies and field visits established that average
productivity gains from access to VSCO loans were in the region of 20% across various
cropping systems. Farmers also attributed lower unit costs of production to more efficient
and timely acquisition of inputs and better terms of sale independent of informal credit
agreements.


                                             27
The MIS estimates for example that there were over 92,000 loans made to crop enterprises
under Phase two. This analysis builds on the net incremental benefits of these increases in
yield and cost reduction per unit area and multiplies by average farm size and the number
of total beneficiaries. The two example below illustrate how increases in yield of paddy
(the most widely grown staple) and onions (a high value vegetable) in combination with
lower costs, increase returns to family labor.

Paddy rice yields, costs and returns:



                                                                              Intensive
                                                                              irrigated
onion production yields, costs and returns:




The other significant generator of tangible incremental benefits derive from investments
under Components A2: Community and Social Infrastructure Fund and B2: PS Inter-
connectivity Fund.. Investments under A2 consist of small roads that improve access to
villages, farms and social infrastructure, bridges, causeways, rehabilitated irrigation,
drinking water supply and sanitation projects. VO communities with project support
completed over 4,500 sub-projects over the four year implementation period. Incremental
net benefits from roads, bridge sand irrigation are estimated through analyzed improvement
in producer surplus from crop models that predominate in each project District.
Discussions with farmers established that there were economic benefits from reduced post-
harvest losses, lower input costs and better farm gate prices. Benefits from drinking water
and sanitation investments were estimated in terms of physical time saved collecting water
and economic gains from improved healthy days worked. PS Inter-connectivity Funds
were deployed in larger infrastructure projects like wide-span bridges and longer
connecting roads of around 1-2Km. At total of around 260Km of high quality roadways
were installed over the project implementation period. A similar model of productivity,
cost and sales price improvement was applied to PS roads and bridges, once again
correlated with the main crops grown in each project District.

Infrastructure investments delivered under CDD are estimated to be significantly lower
cost that when constructed by Government institutions. The Phase One EFA21identified

saving that averaged 36% while the infrastructure Thematic Study22 states cost reductions
of around 10% in comparative studies. This study uses a conservative estimate of a cost
reduction/saving of 20% of CDD delivered on all infrastructure projects. This benefit is
accounted for as lower cost element equally divided over the first four years of the project..
Field surveys also established that CDD community based infrastructure was better built,
better located, longer lived and has lower O&M costs than Government Agency built
infrastructure. These benefits are not quantified in this analysis and add to the conservative
nature of investment appraisal.

includes the numbers of direct and indirect beneficiaries, project cost and community
contribution: Source: Project MIS and Thematic Study




As the Phase I and II PADs suggest, capturing all financial and economic benefits for
project designs such as these presented difficulties. Many of the benefits are intangible
and may only be captured by detailed social/income surveys over longer time frames.
Significant proportions of project funding have been devoted to capacity building and
training at the VO, PS and project management levels. Much of this activity is captured in
project development objectives and thematic studies that concluded the project. No attempt
is made in this analysis to capture economic benefits of capacity building and training.
However, the implicit value of this investment is in the assumptions regarding
sustainability and longer-term durability of project components to deliver incremental
benefits into the future.

Institutional and Administrative Efficiency: The premature dissolution of Gemi Diriya
Foundation mid-way through project implementation, in favor of a Project Management
Unit setup under the Ministry of Economic Development, resulted in some efficiency
losses as the change process was protracted with slower progress in implementation
activities during that period. As the PMU settled into its implementation role, project
activities accelerated as there were dedicated teams in place to oversee critical aspects. In
spite of administrative procedures being marred by delays in counterpart funding and
Government’s eventual decision to cut out counterpart funding for the remainder of the

project period starting from January 2014, the PMU was responsive to adjusting
expectations to the changing operational landscape.

Rating: Overall, Efficiency is rated as Substantial for the project (both pre- and post-
restructuring phases).

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Based on the above factors, the overall outcome for the pre-restructuring phase is rated as
Moderately Unsatisfactory, primarily due to the low PDO achievement against the original
targets. The outcome for post-restructuring phase is rated as Satisfactory. The split-rating
based on the share of the loan disbursed in the pre- and post-restructuring phase is
Moderately Satisfactory. Details of the calculation are provided in Annex 10.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts. The project contributed to improving livelihoods and reducing poverty
levels amongst beneficiaries. According to results observed in the IA, about 15% of
beneficiaries categorized as poor at baseline have moved up to middle income status, while
50% of households categorized as very poor have moved into the poor category. In terms
of the most vulnerable groups, the Impact Assessment showed that 24% of the One Time
Grantees (OTGs) were able to improve their income generating ability and access VSCO
funds. Many were elderly beneficiaries, others were widowed and still required long term
support through public social safety net programs.

Gender Aspects. The project created a considerable impact on female members in terms of
their participation in the program. Access to VSCO loans has allowed women to engage in
profitable agricultural activities and inculcated an entrepreneurial culture among them. A
high percentage of women (67% against a project target of 50%) had taken up decision
making roles in various committees of the VOs. Their active participation in the project
led to increased confidence levels in promoting unity and being instrumental in the
resolution of conflicts and gender-based violence in their communities.

Social Development. The project’s targeting mechanism was considered to be effective.
The independent impact assessment found that at least 85% of the poorest and poor
beneficiaries were included in project activities. Out of these, approximately 35% of the
poorest were able to occupy decision making positions in community institutions. VSCOs
had minimized dependency on conventional money lenders and the various financial
products offered, served to create a form of social insurance among the poor.

 (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening.
Capacity building fund for village organizations helped to building capacities of village
institution and members. Specifically it contributed to increasing the leadership and

                                            30
financial management skills of women and youth. Capacity of PS staff and the community
office bearers was strengthened through more than 380 training programs undertaken on a
range of relevant topics including procurement, social audit, and infrastructure
development. The placement of Project Facilitators at local level also contributed towards
enhancing participation of PS staff in various programs and interaction with communities.

 (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
 Producer Group interventions led to new crops being cultivated on a commercial level,
     such as pineapple in Polonnaruwa district and passion fruit in Hambantota district.
 Due to communities’ abilities to demonstrate high quality of construction works
     through implementation of intra-village sub-projects, they were contracted by
     Divisional Secretariats to carry out additional construction works. This was a
     supplementary source of income for communities that received contracts.
 Challenges experienced in collaborating with Technical Service Providers, particularly
     delays experienced in release of funds to cover construction costs led to price
     escalations resulting in higher cost for construction of select sub-projects.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

The ICR noted that the independent assessment carried out by RDS was based on a sound
methodology however, more could have been done in deepening discussions around
conclusions of findings. Thematic studies carried out by the PMU supplemented analysis
based on using mixed method of quantitative analysis of MIS data and qualitative analysis
through key informant interviews and focus group discussions of randomly sampled VOs.
While income impacts were obtained through the independent survey, the project had a
good MIS system and reliable collection of data on which the thematic studies provided
good assessments of overall progress towards achievement of the PDO. The main
highlights of the Impact Assessment are presented below:

 71% (as against targeted 50%) of the HH showed average 20% or more incremental
  income compared to the Base Line average. Per capita income increased from Rs 3,669
  to Rs 9,164 in Samurdhi VOs compared to baseline treatment VOs representing 150%
  increase. Same pattern was observed in demo VOs (235%), phase II VOs (133%) and
  phase I VOs (116%). The per capita income change in control areas over the project
  period was lower (106%) between baseline control and end project control in the
  Samurdhi VOs. 76.28% of HHs were utilizing improved community intra-village
  infrastructure and social services for intended purposes which surpassed the target of
  70%. HHs utilizing facilities and services were 92.74% for roads, 87.83% for bridges,
  94% for multi-purpose buildings, 82% for community water supply and 72% for
  sanitary facilities.
 100% of Pradeshiya Sabhas implemented inter-connectivity sub-projects, and about
  90% of them were road development according to the needs of the community.
 The project was able to implement 463 community managed water supply schemes in
  11 districts. Two water schemes in Hoberiyawa (connecting 5 villages) and
  Millaththewa in Polonnaruwa and Badulla districts had especially contributed to
  reducing Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) case load. Almost 695 households in the

                                           31
  project area of the tea estate sector were provided sanitation facilities to improve their
  conditions. 83% of the villages were utilizing inter-connectivity infrastructure for
  intended purposes, compared to the target of 60%
 100% of the project PS established O&M units and setup O&M funds, and 72% of the
  PSs adopted Governance Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) and Community
  Assessment Process (CAP) CAP and GAAP as self-control and self-improvement
  mechanism by implementing action plans.
 A higher percentage of producer groups in every district benefitted from grouping and
   linking with private and public agencies in different ways such as increased
   accessibility to timely quality inputs, better pricing for their products, training
   opportunities and adoption of new technologies which led to increased productivity and
   income and reduced production and marketing costs.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

The risk that achievement of the development outcomes will not be sustained are
considered significant. The main risks to project sustainability stem mainly from policy
implications of the Divineguma Act on the functioning of village organizations and their
institutional and infrastructure sustainability.

Implications of the Divineguma Act (2013): At the time of ICR, the Divineguma Act
remained the official policy orientation for rural development in Sri Lanka. About 15,000
graduate students were employed as Economic Development Officers and a review carried
out by IEG in 2014 observed that their training was inadequate, remuneration was low and
the rotating nature of their services had potential to undermine the approach to support well
informed, pro-poor community assistance 23 . While its design incorporated some CDD
elements, Divineguma primarily followed a supply driven approach in which communities
were end-recipients of services (including financial) as determined through department
structures of DDD. The Act did not define the level of participation at which community
input could be made. The operational modalities and guidelines had still not been clarified
at the time of the ICR. In the absence of well-defined regulatory framework that could
foster effective engagement of communities at critical junctures, there is a risk of limiting
the degree of freedom to which communities would have control over their assets and are
able to manage their own funds. This restriction could jeopardize the key principles of the
project and adversely affect community activities.

Non-regulation of financial services: No Independent Prudential Regulator was provided
for under the Divineguma Act. Section 35 of the Act removed the Divineguma financial
services from the supervision of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka by

stating that the Banking Act and the Finance Business Act would not apply. This was
considered risky for the Village Savings and Credit Organizations (VSCOs) that were
envisaged to promote competitive financial services that could eventually link to the formal
lending system as it limited opportunities for leveraging additional resources.

Lack of legal registration for VOs: VOs were expected to be registered through the DDD.
As institutions with participatory activities involving financial transactions requiring
structured oversight, VOs’ continued lack of legal status left them vulnerable to misuse,
misappropriation of funds and at risk of increased and unmanageable loan defaults. The
situation was even more critical for inactive VOs that had unutilized funds in Bank
accounts where powerful community members could take advantage of the lapse in project
monitoring to syphon funds.

Sustainability of Community Intra-Village Infrastructure: As already mentioned,
maintenance of infrastructure sub-projects implemented through local government
structures were mainstreamed into provincial budgetary provisions of Pradeshiya Sabhas.
However, sustainability of intra-village infrastructure depended largely on the operation
and maintenance (O&M) capacity of responsible communities. Most of the VOs had
established O&M funds although additional funding support was still required for some
technical services. Without systematic linkages to relevant line agencies/departments for
continuous support, long term maintenance of sub-projects could be jeopardized.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was
moderately satisfactory. During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the
adequacy of project design and all major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial,
economic, and institutional, including procurement and financial management. Several
alternatives were considered for the project design. In addition, major risk factors and
lessons learned from Phase 1 as well as international and regional experiences in rural
sector were considered and incorporated into the project design.

Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who provided
the technical skill mix necessary to address sector concerns and a good project design. The
Bank provided adequate resources in terms of staff weeks and funds to ensure quality
preparation and appraisal work. The project was consistent with the CAS and government
priorities in the sector at the time. The Bank had a consistently good working relationship
with the Borrower during preparation and appraisal.

While the team was cognizant of Government’s interests for implementing future rural
development programs through government systems and agreements had been made to

                                            33
phase out GDF at the end of project period, there was no transition plan developed in terms
of how this process would be operationalized. This transition plan along with a clearly
developed communication strategy could have been used as a basis for ensuring consistent
engagement with higher level officials and could have potentially minimized negative
speculation associated with the project. As a result the quality at entry is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during project implementation was moderately satisfactory. The
Bank allocated sufficient budget and staff resources, and the project was adequately
supervised and closely monitored. The task team regularly prepared Aide-Memoires,
alerted the government and MED about issues identified during project execution and
facilitated prompt corrective action. The last nine months of implementation saw more
frequent support missions to assist with the project team’s accelerated completion plan.
While the PMU was appreciative of the collaboration with the Bank, it stated in its PCR
that the Bank Team did not pay adequate attention to developing an exit strategy for VOs,
however, supervision reports indicate that the issue was extensively discussed with the
counterpart and adequate guidance provided to initiate the process but project team did not
follow through on recommendations made. The Implementation Status Reports (ISRs)
realistically rated the performance of the project both in terms of achievement of
development objective and project implementation.

On the other hand, during four years of implementation, Task Team Leader (TTL) of the
project changed four times. However, all TTLs had been core team members and while
their beliefs and styles of managing the project varied, there was consistency in
understanding the issues faced by the project and what was required to address these. The
problems affecting the project surfaced shortly after effectiveness and while there were
efforts made to manage the issues that emerged, action could have been taken much earlier
to restructure the project and create adequate space to negotiate a smoother transition. Thus,
rating for quality of supervision is Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

With a Moderately Satisfactory rating for both quality at entry and for quality of
supervision, overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory


                                             34
The government had shown commitment at the time of project preparation. However, with
the change in the political environment in the country following the May 2010 elections,
government commitment towards the project significantly declined. In the late stage of
implementation, Government took a decision to suspend counterpart funding to the project
prompting a project restructuring to revise funding ratio to 100% IDA financing. Still,
GoSL requested an extension of the closing date so that activities could be completed and
project funds fully exhausted. Delayed approval of project budget, in spite of changes to
the funding ratio, negatively affected many implementation activities such as producer
group activities that were curtailed. There were protracted delays in the decision to dissolve
GDF, which further contributed to delays in restructuring the project. The Government did
attempt to make a final push for a smoother transition and discussed a possible 3 month
extension up to December 31, 2014. This did not materialize and an official request was
not made to the Bank.

Since 2012, supervision reports showed that the Bank made several requests to the
Government to provide legal recognition to VOs through registration, however, the process
was prone to delays and postponement until the Divineguma Act came into effect. Still, the
Divineguma Department had not completed preparation of its bye-laws and guidelines
which left the majority of VOs with no legal status and therefore, vulnerable. At the time
of the ICR, the VOs created under the project did not have any legal standing.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

Major changes happened in the first year of project implementation when the Project
Director changed three times and a number of experienced staff also left the project. Many
vacancies remained unfilled for a long time. The replacement of GDF with Project
Management Unit under MED saw retention of staff from Phase 1 who were familiar with
the CDD model and project management. Overall, the PMU did have dedicated and
qualified staff who collaborated with the Bank team and carried out most aspects of project
management in compliance with Bank procedures and guidelines. Fiduciary ratings
remained conservative due to the nature of the project and level of risk exposure involving
multiple transactions of over 2000 village organizations. PMU’s district project
management unit (DPMU) and PS level structure PIU staff were generally highly
committed and motivated. Their valuable inputs played a major role in the project’s
achievements.

The project did not have a full time project director, as he was also appointed as the project
director for 3 other donor funded projects which created issues with respect to provision of
timely decisions and the need to have focused attention given the tensions that existed with
senior government officials. The project had built on previous experiences of Phase 1 and
had a feedback and communication mechanism that worked well internally but was not
externalized to inform and engage higher officials about project results. In spite of repeated
offers to support the project team to develop a communication strategy that would assist



                                             35
them in effectively engaging higher level officials, the project team did not follow through.
This contributed to the continued negative perception of the project at the high level.

While the fiduciary requirements were largely in compliance and FM and Procurement
were rated MS for a long time, the allegation of misuse of funds that emerged at the tail
end of the project necessitated downgrading the rating to MU as this indicated weaknesses
in internal control systems.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The wane in Government commitment and the slow response in budget approval caused
significant implementation delays. Government was also not able to address the legitimacy
issue of VOs even when requested to consider alternative options while the Divineguma
bye-laws were still under finalization. These deficiencies were overcome by the successful
implementation of the project by the changing project implementing agencies resulting in
substantial realization of the PDO. Given that the overall outcome of the project is rated
as Moderately Satisfactory, the overall Borrower Performance has been rated as
Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

The project went through a cycle of changes during its implementation but emerged with
important lessons that could potentially inform the future design of similar operations in
the country as well as outside. The lessons are given under two broad categories:

Lessons for the Sri Lanka Country Program

Effective implementation of a project that is expected to be integrated into Government
Structures requires a clear implementation plan (prepared at design) to facilitate a
smooth transition: Although it had been agreed at the time of project preparation that the
Gemi Diriya Foundation would be dissolved at the end of Phase 2 operation, there was no
clear strategy and implementation plan of how this process would be undertaken. This plan,
if prepared, could have been used as a basis for keeping higher authorities informed about
the transition process and to allay any concerns on the operations of the Foundation.

Development and implementation of a Communication Strategy could increase
ownership and buy-in from uncertain Stakeholders: The project had done well in
developing internal communications systems particularly at the community level
(Communication tree), however, the project's engagement with senior government officials
was weak and thus, was unable to effectively show its potential for results. It is important
to ensure that good coordination mechanism is in place with the line ministry and political
authorities are well informed about the project objectives and principles from the beginning
to get maximum support from line ministry and political authority.



                                             36
It is important to deepen understanding of institutional and governance analysis for
countries in transition: The May 2010 election brought about political change in Sri Lanka
and with it, critical changes to the design and implementation modalities of the SCDLIP.
The preparation process could have benefitted from a better understanding of the
implications of institutional and governance systems, and could have incorporated this
analysis into the risk assessment and tied it into an effective communication strategy and
transition plans.

The perception of parallel structures can create tensions in the implementation of a CDD
approach: The Gemi Diriya Foundation was felt to be the most suitable agency to continue
supporting communities under the second phase as well as to test out a new approach within
the project. The key term here is flexibility, which is critical in a demand driven approach.
The level of flexibility required is often seen as ill-matched with Government structures
that already exist to carry out similar functions. For future projects, it will be important to
establish a middle ground in which clearly articulated complementarities are well defined
for future convergence.

Long term sustainability of investments requires consistency in approach and long term
commitment from key stakeholders. Weaknesses in ownership of the Gemi Diriya
program adversely affected community enthusiasm and trust in project functions. The
erosion of community trust could create challenges of sustaining long term impacts of
investments made.

Lessons for CDD Operations

Participatory planning, decision making and sense of ownership impacted heavily on
project achievements. The project had a strong participatory approach on planning,
decision making and implementation. The preparation of community manuals through a
participatory process with communities provided clear direction of how to implement
community projects. As sub-projects and community level activities were prioritized with
strong beneficiary participation, community commitment was extremely high. Community
contribution, for the time it remained part of the project design prior to restructuring, was
highly regarded as having contributed to the strong sense of ownership that beneficiaries
had over project investments.

Community Professional (CP) model emerged as a strategy for sustaining village level
activities. The project was successful in building localized capacity at community level to
address many of the immediate challenges faced by VOs regarding guidelines and
procedures of how to implement village activities. CPs were considered to be potential
substitutes for the eventual phase out of project staff facilitation. However, incentives for
CP engagement were directly linked to VOs abilities to pay for services, something which
could only be done through efficiently functioning VSCOs who could provide continuous
source of funding to maintain such services.

The mix of public and private goods in CDD operations is challenging in the absence of
linkages to local authorities and federation of societies to anchor activities related to

                                              37
public and private good service delivery. The decision to combine public and private goods
at design was done with the expectation that the activities would be mainstreamed into two
institutional setups of Samurdhi Authority and Federation of VOs for support of public
goods and private goods services respectively. When the two institutional structures did
not fully mainstream VO activities due to the restructuring, it placed the burden of a dual
responsibility mainly on VOs, which proved to be extremely challenging and unsustainable
for the long term. It is critical that a project of this nature works through these institutional
settings to address these challenges and minimize the inherent risk of funding both types
of activities.

Estate Sector benefitted greatly from infrastructure support but revolving fund system
required a different approach. The Gemi Diriya Project was the only project in the rural
development sector to fully support the Estate Communities. Estate communities had been
largely neglected and support was successful in delivering much needed infrastructure
services that created the appropriate platform for other government services to reach them.
Health specialists began to provide advocacy services once sanitation facilities were
improved as they saw potential for greater impact in creating awareness about hygiene
practices, which was not possible before. This demonstrated scope for estate communities
to be organized to tap into additional government services. However, the revolving fund as
implemented in other non-estate VOs was not as effective in Estate communities because
of the extremely low levels of literacy. A very different approach for revolving fund is
needed for these communities as capacity is insufficient to sustain operations for the long
term.

Governance and Social Accountability tools were successfully mainstreamed into project
activities enabling devolution of power over local resource management to communities
and empowerment to have direct control over resources and decision making. The
project created social capital through local institutions in a participatory, accountable and
responsive manner. Social capital was further promoted through increased transparency in
decision making induced by the project through Community operational Manual, social
audits, Governance and Accountability Action plan (GAAP), Community Assessment
Process (CAP) and grievance redress systems from grass root to project level. These issues
of voice and accountability were critical for deepening participatory processes at rural
village level and ensuring sustainability of project created assets.

Producer Groups were successfully linked to Government supported programs as well
as private sector firms. In place of Federation of VOs, the project refocused support for
small farmers organized around common interest activities and successfully managed to
link them to government programs mainly supporting the livestock sector (dairy) as well
as private sector agro-processors. Small and marginal farmers began to engage in contract
farming, out-grower schemes and were accessing critical technologies and inputs to
improve productivity. However, continuous engagement required mechanisms and support
systems to be in place and functioning to minimize risks of failure. Ideally, Federations of
VOs would have played a facilitative role of long term institutional connection, business
monitoring and sustaining of market and other linkages. If PGs were to fail due to the
absence of institutional support and oversight, the greater burden would fall on VOs and

                                               38
VSCOs capacity to sustain because proper functioning of PGs contributed to a healthier
financial portfolio for VOs. With a possible successor project, more could have been done
to focus on institutional building for these groups to consolidate benefits gained, optimize
income generation and reduce failure risks.

VOs that had implemented both private and public good type of intra-village
infrastructure were better positioned to maintain infrastructure for the longer term.
Implementing infrastructure projects such as water supply schemes along sub-projects such
as roads and culverts, allowed VOs to collect monthly user fees directly from beneficiaries
that supplemented funds collected for maintenance of public goods infrastructure. O&M
fund accounts were significantly larger for VOs that had combined water supply schemes
and public goods infrastructure sub-projects than for VOs that had only implemented
public good type of infrastructure providing the former with more financial flexibility to
address O&M issues as needed.

VO model and approach demonstrated complementary benefits to Government poverty
reduction programs. The VO structure together with various capacity building programs
combined efforts to improve social development as reflected in empowerment, gender
equity, rural leadership, social capital, and social harmony. The government organizations
which were servicing the rural development and poor and youth, had easy access through
VO platforms to provide services thereby creating complementary benefits for rural
development.

CDD approach demonstrated community abilities to find voice, create social capital and
establish institutions that could be used to efficiently target beneficiaries for resource
allocation. VOs emerged and filled a critical gap between communities and the lowest
level of local governance (Pradeshiya Sabhas) and were well placed to become the most
suitable conduit for last mile service delivery. CDD approach through VOs and VSCO
mechanisms put in place thrived because of project oversight, original transparency
mechanisms developed, core principles incorporated and the capacity built. It is essential
for these elements to be in place for institutionalization or scaling up of activities and
equally important, the need to constantly monitor and dialogue with communities and
authorities on the limits of community group independence and allowing downward
accountability. Institutionalization and provision of legal status would have been a great
opportunity to mainstream tried and tested approaches through local government structures.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
 The Borrower expressed concern about the overall rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory.
The ICR noted that the project made substantial achievements in attaining and exceeding
most of the targets set for performance assessment. The achievement was primarily driven
by a very strong project design that successfully developed policies, rules, systems and
procedures that were mainstreamed into overall implementation. While the prevailing
policy environment was not the most conducive, strong commitment from the project
implementing agency compensated for Government shortcomings and contributed to

                                            39
delivering an MS project for achieving the PDOs. Therefore, Government rating is
maintained as Moderately Unsatisfactory. However, the overall Borrower performance is
rated as Moderately Satisfactory based on considerations of the achievement of the PDO.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction

The second phase of the CDLIP was launched with GOSL acceptance of the design and
approach of the project and granted title of Second Community Development and
Livelihood Improvement Project (SCDLIP). The CDD approach remains the primary
vector of intervention with an emphasis on a graduation of autonomy through capacity
building and training from village to local government level with the Pradeshiya Sabha
(PS). Inter village connectivity development with an emphasis on larger infrastructure,
installed operation and maintenance programs and capacity building at PS Zonal level was
included as an enhanced component from March 2010.

Consistent with APL Program goals, the project development objectives of Phase II is to
enhance incomes and quality of life of the poor households in the poorest divisions in the
country while building capacity of government agencies, local governments and
community organizations for downward accountability and overall project implementation.

As with Phase I, no ex-ante estimation of rate of return to the project investments was made
in the PAD. The original justification of this was the demand driven nature of community–
led investment design of the project and the fact that empowerment and strengthening of
communities and institutions targeted by the project was difficult to quantify for cost-
benefit analysis purposes. Section IV Appraisal Summary of the PAD outlines areas of
intervention and anticipates significant economic and social benefits. Annex 11: Economic
and Financial Analysis (EFA) in the PAD focuses on income impacts in a number of
agriculturally based activities but makes no attempt to aggregate these in a cost benefit
analysis. The ICR Phase I Annex 3 EFA provides a detailed analysis of project costs and
benefits based on contributions from productivity gains in agricultural activities funded
through VSCO loans. Financial contributions from infrastructure are based on estimated
cost savings in construction and increased economic life when community based
construction projects are compared with Provincial Roads Development Authority
Estimates. Aggregated benefits are estimated to provide returns of 31.7% and 30.2% for
financial and economic IRRs respectively.

The project has supported intra-village development interventions in about 652 GNDs
(about 942 villages), inter-village development in 10 PS Zones and further strengthened
Phase 1 village organizations. Project activities have benefit approximately 220,000
households (872,000 persons) of Phase II.

Phase II of the CDLIP included the five main project components: (a) Intra-village
Development; (b) Inter-village Connectivity Development; (c) Public, People and Private
Sector Partnerships; (d) Project Management and Monitoring; and (e) Convergence and
Policy Support. The total investment allocated was US$ 105 Mn, which included US$ 18
Mn from GOSL, US$ 75 Mn form IDA and US$ 12 Mn from the communities. However,
after restructuring the project in 2013, the allocation of investment was changed as



                                            45
US$ 77.54 Mn from IDA; US$ 14.84 Mn from GOSL and US$ 7.97 Mn from the
communities and cancelled the proposed third phase of the CDLIP.

Estimation and Methodology
Benefits are quantified by identifying tangible financial and economic impacts in three of
the five project components: Intra-village Development, Inter-Village Connectivity
Development and Public, People and Private Sector Partnerships. The latter focusing on
development of Producer Groups, institutional capacity building, training and
“convergence” with local Government, National institutions and the private sector.

Tangible benefits are analyzed in Intra-Village Development under component A2: Village
Development Fund sub-components Community and Social Infrastructure (roads, bridges,
irrigation, culverts, water distribution and sanitation projects) and Livelihood Support Fund
(One Time Grants, Skill Development Fund and VSCO loans through VOs).

Benefits accruing from Component B: Inter-Village Connectivity Development derive
from sub-component: Infrastructure Sub Projects which includes roads, bridges and some
new irrigation infrastructure.

Benefits accruing from Component C: Public and Private Sector Partnerships are allocated
to Producer Group productivity gains resulting from the disbursement of grants (based on
the number of members per group) typically used for collective investments in buildings,
specialist equipment and in the case of tea, major rehabilitation or replanting. Under-
pinning the assumed productivity gains are significant intangible benefits from training and
collaboration with National institutions and the private sector.

Investment amounts for each sub-component are derived from a combination of project
based COSTAB which estimates total aggregate spending and individual component
spending from Thematic Studies and project MIS. The project underwent two significant
restructuring events during implementation, which have complicated matching aggregate
disbursement with component implementation on the ground. In some cases restructuring
required the switching of funds from component to component and significant delays in
some implementation schedules.

This analysis aims to unify these changes through the allocation of component expenditure
(and hence implementation) on a pro rata percentage of total expenditure on an annual
basis over the implementation period. Similarly, where the total numbers of beneficiaries
are known but need to be allocated over the implementation period, the disbursement
schedule is used to determine annual increases in beneficiary numbers.

Data Sources
The data for this cost benefit analysis was gathered form numerous sources. They include:
Project audited accounts, project MIS database, nine thematic studies compiled by senior
project staff, Project Completion Report (Borrower’s Report) and an externally
commissioned Impact Assessment Report IAR). The latter is the main external
independent perspective of the project and specifically required to assess “impact” in terms

                                             46
of physical delivery and socio-economic changes. The delivered report presented a
statistical analysis of a broad ranging questionnaire but did not provide detailed analysis of
ground level interventions or impacts. Data could not be disaggregated or attributed to
subcomponent investments and was largely unusable for cost benefit analysis. Additional
data was gathered from ICR field trips, secondary agricultural data publications and case
studies used to supplement gaps in the IAR.

Assumptions for EFA
Total project costs are included in Sri Lankan Rupees converted at annual average
exchange rates and total 11,692.249 M Rs. or a revised USD total of $100.35m. Detailed
component breakdown is provided in Annex 1. The conversion of financial to economic
prices was done through the use of parity prices for internationally traded inputs and
outputs and a Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) for non-tradable inputs and outputs with
the exception of labor costs where a SCF of 0.8 was applied.

Project Component Benefits

Village Development Fund (VDF)
The VDF has a total budget allocation of 5,355.8M Rs, which represents 45.84% of total
project expenditure. Of the four sub-components, this analysis focuses on the two elements
that generate significant tangible benefits. These are: the Community and Social
Infrastructure and Livelihood Support Fund.

The Community and Social Infrastructure Fund
This sub-component totals 3,589.91M Rs or 30.7% of total project costs and was disbursed
over the implementation period in stages into a variety of infrastructure categories
determined by committees within Village Organizations (VOs). This analysis focuses on
tangible benefits generated from investments in: Rural Roads, Irrigation, Drinking Water
Projects, and Sanitation. MIS data estimates total expenditure on all community-generated
projects of 2,163.05M Rs of which 31.2% was contributed by communities in cash or in
kind. No attempt is made to disaggregate this contribution in EFA terms. However, the
majority of contributions will be in the form of labor and the likely effect of applying a
SCF of 0.8 to this will be to increase the economic returns of such investments.

Rural Roads
This analysis relies on the project MIS and Infrastructure Thematic Study for main
infrastructure and beneficiary drivers used to derive incremental net benefits of these
investments. A total of 2,771 sub-projects were completed with a total road length of
468Km completed. Total cost is 1,362.09M at an average cost of 2.91M per Km.
Beneficiary Households (HH) are estimated at 128,305 (Direct) and 341,724 (indirect).
There was no clear consensus on how to allocate either costs or benefits to indirect
beneficiaries in discussions with project staff. At the project level there was some
resentment from VO members to outside use of infrastructure that they had contributed
30% of the costs and all of the maintenance. However, there will clearly be economic
benefits generated by indirect beneficiaries that need to be captured. For this analysis it is
assumed that 50% of indirect beneficiaries are included in the aggregate net benefits.

                                             47
Financial and economic benefits are calculated by aggregating total rural road length in
each Project District. To this, a four-crop model made up of the predominant crops
prevailing in each District is applied. The impact of a new or improved road is estimated
by calculating changes in planted area (also a function of land-use intensity), improvements
in productivity, reduction of post-harvest losses and an effective increase in the farm gate
price. The latter is implied in the model where output prices for commodities like paddy
and maize are fixed by National agencies. In this case an increase in the farm-gate price is
a reflection of a reduction in transport coats of marketable crops and inputs. The model
estimates incremental benefits for the road catchment over a 20-year period. Estimated
beneficiaries number 172,154 with an annual incremental benefit of 82.45M Rs.

Irrigation Investments
Project MIS estimates a total of 77 irrigation projects covering 2,087Ha over 5 Project
Districts. It is assumed that the majority of these are rehabilitation of existing infrastructure
and are not additional area. The financial model assumes that four crops (paddy (75%)
maize (10%), onions (10%), and bananas (5%)) are grown over the entire area. It is
assumed that productivity in increased by 30% in terms of yield. Costs associated with
harvesting and processing are also increased to reflect higher yield. Once the full area has
been planted, annual incremental benefits are 176.6M Rs and a total of 4,266 direct and
5,226 indirect beneficiaries or an incremental benefit per beneficiary of 18,674 Rs.

Drinking Water Projects
MIS estimate a total of 84 Drinking Water Projects established over the implementation
period. It is estimated that there are 5,753 direct and 2,523 indirect beneficiaries covered
by the investment. Benefits accruing from water distribution investments accrue from
health improvements, operational and maintenance fees and an estimate of time saved per
beneficiary per day. Improvements in health are estimated using Daily-Adjusted-Life-
Years (DALY), a WHO metric that aims to quantify “one lost year of healthy life” valued
at per capita GDP. In this example DALY data for Diarrheal diseases is taken from the
WHO data set for Sri Lanka. DALYs for diarrhea in Sri Lanka are estimated to be 153 per
100,000 of population. This number is scaled down to a number of project beneficiaries
as a proportion of the total population and multiplies by per capita GDP in Rs. Incremental
benefits are derived by assuming that the incidence of disease is reduced by 70% once
water is treated. Time save per beneficiary is estimated at 1.5 Hrs per day and valued at
800Rps per day as the opportunity cost of labor. Total annual incremental benefits reach
a maximum of 20.1M Rs per year.

Sanitation Projects
MIS records a total of 405 sanitation investments targeting 13,689 direct and 10,466
indirect beneficiaries and investment of 186M Rs. Health benefits are calculated in the
same way as above estimating project DALY values. Annual net benefits are estimated at
around 17M Rs annually.

Cost Savings Under the CDD Approach
Combined analysis from Phase I and Phase II indicates significant cost saving delivered
under CDD project identification and management. Saving originate from better

                                               48
management materials, reduced supervision costs and the use of competitively prices
community labor and in-kind contributions. Average cost savings are assessed at an
average of 20% compared to conventional construction methods managed by local and
National Government Agencies. Savings are aggregated with PS projects under Inter-
Village and summarized below.

Livelihood Support Fund (LSF)
The LSF had a total budget of 1,304M Rs which represents 11.16% of the total project
budget. The fund has three main micro-finance components; Village Savings and Credit
Organizations (VSCOs) One Time Grants (OTG) and Skill Development Loans.

VSCOs
As with the Infrastructure fund, VSCOs are administered through the Village Organization
(VO). VSCO funds are directly allocated out of the VDF with a maximum set at 1M Rs
per village or 25% of the total VDP fund. The number of active VSCO funds corresponds
directly to the number of operational VOs. Phase II of the project resulted in 946 active
VSCOs by September 2014. These VSCOs had by then disbursed 1,066.06M Rs in nine
project Districts. This loan book has expanded to 2,182.59M Rs, which reflects a loan
utilization rate of 204% or a complete recycling of initial funds. Initial loans were limited
to 10,000 Rs per applicant and increased thereafter to a maximum of 50,000 Rs then to an
upper limit of 100,000 Rs per applicant.

VSCO loan products cover four main types: Agriculture, Animal husbandry, small
industries and others. A total of 135,475 loans have been disbursed with 70% allocated
crop agriculture, 4% to livestock, 21% to small industries and 6% to others. This analysis
will focus on the estimated returns from agriculture i.e. crops- Maize, onions, paddy and
banana distributed in area 25%, 12.5%, 50% and 12.5% respectively. Animal husbandry
loans are assumed to go to dairy production exclusively. A lack of detailed data for small
industries and others prevent inclusion in this analysis.

Crop models for each of the four selected crops have been built using data collected from
field visit case studies and published farm management handbooks.

Establishing direct financial benefits exclusively from access to VSCO funds is
problematic. This is because of complex interactions between multiple project
interventions (VO capacity building, community based infrastructure and social cohesion
developed through collective management of funds.) There are however common threads
to VSCO loan member’s response that support an estimated increase in productivity (yield)
of around 20%24. A higher degree of certainty in obtaining credit allows better planning
of farming activities. Once established as a VO and VSCO member, the process of
applying and receiving loans is much easier and quicker than with a commercial bank.
VSCO interest rates are set at 18% - considerably higher than some commercial loans, yet
VSCO prefer to borrow from their own fund. The interest is put back into the fund and

                                                              49
increases the total amount available to borrow on the next occasion. Most crop loans are
used to fund mechanized land preparation, improved seed and fertilizer. Rapid access to
funds allows timely access to these inputs allowing farmers to plant and carry out
operations at critical times. Crop input loans are generally paid back once the crop is
harvested, i.e. over a three – four moth period for each crop in the season so accumulated
interest is not a large proportion of total costs. An alternative to VSCO funds and
commercial banks are traditional moneylenders. Typical interest rates are around 20% per
month and require significant pledges of collateral including title to land. Informal loans
are commonly linked to input suppliers and product buyers with loan recovery in shares of
produce sold. This system of loan recovery in-kind frequently costs more that informal
interest rates. The opportunity cost of this financial alternative is not included in the
analysis but clearly forms an element of cost and risk reduction.

Capacity building and book keeping training has increased financial literacy and instilled
knowledge in financial management and farm budgeting. VSCO loan recipients have a
clear idea of what their costs and revenues are and have adapted crop choices to reflect
higher returns. Crops like vegetables and bananas are more capital intensive and more
risky to grow if planning and marketing are not well planned. The returns are significantly
higher though demonstrating significant returns to growers.

Benefits to VSCO members growing maize




Average farm size for all crop enterprises is assumed to be 0.5 Ha and farmers are assumed
to use hybrid seed in combination with correct levels of fertilizer. Maize farmers typically
do not use herbicides preferring instead to use manual labor ridging rows of crops and high
plant populations to encourage canopy closure as soon as possible. Fertilizer applied to
maize is subsidized by the GOSL effectively halving the real cost. Maize prices are also
fixed at 32 Rs per Kg, which is very close to the import parity price. The subsidy will
increase returns to farmers but lower the overall project EIRR.

Returns to Paddy farmers




Case studied with producers support an estimated 20% increase in yield across seasons.
Fertilizer subsidies effectively reduce the real cost to a sixth of the import parity prices

                                            50
boosting returns to farmers. Sri Lanka is close to self-sufficiency in rice production with
imports limited to specialty varieties from Thailand and India. Paddy prices are fixed by
the Paddy Board at 40 Rs per Kg which is below the implied import parity price including
duty.

Farmer’s incremental income is 42,158 Rs per Ha with costs of production around 13%
lower as unit output rises proportionately more than input costs.

Benefits to Onion Growers




Conversations with vegetable producers during the ICR field visit in October 2014 confirm
the realistic assessment of a 20% increases in yield. Moreover, access to VSCO funds and
training provided an incentive to switch from less profitable crops to high value crops like
onions. Annual per Ha incremental benefits are 119,150 Rs per Ha, returns to family labor
are significantly higher than opportunity costs and unit input costs fall by around 16.6%.
Vegetable crops are more labor and management intensive. Crops require careful
management of water availability under rain-fed conditions and good knowledge of pest
and disease management.

Banana Grower Benefits




Banana growing if done intensively, provides the highest returns to labor and per Ha. It is
however a capital-intensive crop to establish requiring one-year lead-time before yields
delivers cash flow. Investment costs for establishment of over 350,000 Rs per Ha require
financing in excess of VSCO loan limits so savings or access to additional credit will be
required for areas of one Ha and over.

Dairy Producer Benefits
The dairy benefic calculation needs to take into account a transition from a traditional “free-
range” farming system where cattle are allowed to roam and graze what fodder they can
find to a semi-intensive management system that include exotic crossbred types,
specifically grown fodder, bought in feed, careful veterinary management and detailed
record keeping. Producers have used VSCO loans to achieve this transition and increase
productivity considerably. Productivity is measured in milk yield in liters per cow per day,
fat content in milk (milk quality), active economic life span, and number of lactation days

                                              51
per calving, interval between claves and the value of calves sold. Where manure is not
immediately recycled in fodder production, this also has a value. Improved breeds also
require permanent shelter from the elements, access to clean water and continuous
veterinary attendance. Producers also need to invest in milk collection equipment that can
be sterilized to minimize contamination and wastage due to poor storage. The model used
in estimating returns to producers integrates these factors including elements that
depreciate buildings and equipment and allow for cow replacements net of cull cow values.

The GOSL is actively supporting the expansion of dairy production in the country and has
set a base price of 50 Rs per liter of milk. Where farmers are skilled and manage heard
genetics and nutrition, prices are higher due to higher levels of both fat and solids not fat
in the milk. Dairy processors are willing to pay a premium for this and offer higher prices.
GOSL also offers to supply approves crossbred cattle at a maximum purchase price of
30,000 Rs per head. Cattle purchased on the open market but also from approved breeders
can cost over 40,000 Rs per head. Farmers interviewed during the ICR mission said they
would clearly purchase animals under the subsidy if available and through a complicated
approval system. Many simply went to the open market and bought the best quality animals
they could find fully aware that the marginal extra cost would be rapidly recovered through
higher yields and quality.

The model provides for cattle replacements over the-20 year project cycle so net cash flow
varies depending on the regularity of replacement. Over the 20 year estimated cycle,
average incremental net benefits of improved semi-intensive dairy production are 45,618
Rs per animal per year.

Aggregate net benefits from VSCO investments are derived from assuming that 5% of
loans from the fund are allocated to livestock and 70% of this is allotted to dairy production.

One Time Grants
OTGs were designed as a specifically pro-poor micro-finance product allocated by VO
committees out of a specifically allocated fund. Typically the fund was 5% of LSF and
has been distributed to levels approaching 96% across 948 Phase II VOs. Total grants
disbursed during Phase II totaled 151.15M Rs to 7,744 individuals. One of the main
objectives of the intervention was to provide a financial “leg-up” to poorer individuals or
HH and allow them to become credit-worthy and eligible to join VSCO lending groups.
Thematic study estimates suggest 38% of OTG recipients go on to VSCO membership and
progressing on from there to entrepreneurial success. Financial returns to OTGs are very
difficult to model due to lack of detailed data. For this analysis it is assumed that each
OTG invested generates modest additional revenue of 5,000 Rs per year over the 20-year
cycle. This will be an over estimate in some cases but if leveraged against progress to
VSCO access, feasible. Annual cash flows are estimated to reach 38.7M Rs at full
implementation.

Skill Development Loans
SDLs were dispersed through 946 active VOs with a total value of 279.79M Rs to 11,456
recipients. This provides an average loan of around 26,000 Rs per recipient. The majority

                                              52
of loans were taken out for training in driving (40%), IT skills (21%) and dressmaking
(20%). Each loan of just under $200 has limited purchasing power to accumulate
significant technical skills in the semi-rural context and the occupations derived reflect this.
Many of the drivers qualified to operate three wheeler taxis often driving for a “commission”
based wage paid by the owner of the vehicle. As with OTGs, if the loans are able to
leverage even modest increases in daily wages, the returns can be significant when
extrapolated over the life of the project. In this analysis the hypothesis is that daily wages
are increased by 50 Rs per day. When this is aggregated to an annual incitement (22,500
Rs) and multiplied by total recipients less the loan repayment, annual net cash flows reach
44.5M Rs per year.

Inter Village Connectivity Projects: Roads
The analysis of PS investments follows the same methodology as for investment through
Community and Social Investment fund. In this component 11 significant road investments
were undertaken providing 258 Km roads. Bridges and culverts were excluded from this
analysis. In the same way, four crop models were allocated to each PS Zone depending on
prevailing cropping patterns in the region. The number of direct and indirect beneficiaries
was used to establish a cropped area or “catchment” served by the road. Productivity
factors were then applied to each crop in the form of yields increases, area increases,
reductions in post-harvest losses and increases in price (or reductions in cost). Aggregates
net incremental benefits for all roads reach 17.81M Rs per year at full implementation.

Combined Cost Saving using CDD management for Intra and Inter village
infrastructure
Comparative analysis of infrastructure construction costs in both Phase One and Phase Two,
estimate reductions of between 10% and 36% under CDD management. This analysis used
a conservative estimate of 20% cost reductions on combined infrastructure investment of
3,420m Rs. This total saving of 684m Rs. spread evenly over the four years of project
implementation averaging 138m Rs per year. Focus groups and field trip discussions also
stated that building quality is significantly higher, physical location more efficient,
management costs lower and longer productive economic life.

Public and Private Sector Partnership – Producer Groups
Funding for PGs evolved out of the first major restructuring in 2011-12 when
implementation methodology moved away from the development of VOs and VSCOs into
wider federations. PGs emerged from component C3 Inter Village Institutional livelihood
Promotion into more specifically supported value chains, training and convergence with
activities and services provided by State institutions and the private sector.

A total of 433 PGs were formed under a budget of 221.3M Rs with an estimated total
beneficiaries of 44,797. Commodity chains include: Dairy, Maize, Paddy, Pepper, Fruit,
Tea, Floriculture and Vegetables. This analysis is based on the predominant commodities
of maize, paddy, vegetables, dairy and tea value chains. Crop models are similar to those
used in the infrastructure and VSCO incremental contribution calculation.




                                              53
The PG concept is based on the success of VSCO in mobilizing motivated group activities,
block grants to initiated intensification, access to appropriate training and active linkage to
other financial institutions, markets, national institutions and private sector participants.
To qualify for PG status, VSCOs needed to be graded either A or B – in other words,
already demonstrating high levels of financial discipline, profitability and sustainability.
PG funds are leveraged by well-organized and motivated groups with established abilities
to manage and lend funds. Each group consists of around 50 individuals who were granted
operational funds on the basis of 6,000 Rs each. This capital has been invested in collective
assets such as pruning and harvesting equipment in tea and pepper groups, communal
marketing buildings and bulking equipment in dairy PGs and mechanized rice transplanting
in paddy groups in cooperation with machinery suppliers. The formation of motivated
groups has provided a focus for commercial marketing activities like milk processors who
cooperated in the provision of bulking equipment, transparent pricing on the basis of milk
quality and regular milk collection activities.

To simplify the analysis and provide a broad estimate of PG contributions to incremental
net benefits, the number of value chains was reduced to five. Data from case studies
contained in the Livelihood Thematic Study25, MIS, ICR field trips and focus groups are
used to establish with/without project yields and revenues. These were then aggregated by
the number of beneficiaries and the disbursement schedule over two years. Because of
restructuring and delays in disbursement PG activities did not start until mid-2012 so there
little in the way of concert physical data to support much of PG activities and the potential
revenues over the project period.

Annual estimates of incremental net benefits from PGs are 112.50M Rs.

B. Rates of Return Analysis

Overall project economic rate of return is 22.39% and project financial rate of return
23.66% over the full 20-year life of the project including all Phase II costs including MIS
and Management. This is based on conservative estimates of static component outputs at
2014 levels.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The objective of the impact assessment was to estimate tangible effects of project
interventions and to evaluate post-project qualitative and quantitative changes delivered by
project components.

Impact on Household Economy
District data used in this report covers all VO batches implemented in Phase I (Batch 0 to
4) and Phase II (batch 5 to 9). The entire analysis and assessment is based on three groups:
Project facilitated VOs, Samurdhi VOs and Demonstration VOs.

       Demographic characteristics of the study population
Project Management Information System (MIS) and Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
state project target populations for Phase I are 870,612 (201,177 HHs) and Phase II 821,094
(200,249 HHs) respectively. Household management by gender varies across project
Phases and management treatment. Male-headed HH represented from 75% to 85% HH
across all project treatments. This compared to 88% in control villages which is non-
significant at 5% confidence intervals. It appears that project interventions targeting
gender re-balancing have not made significant differences under this measure.

        Access for basic services and facilities
Focus Group Discussions (FGD) established that a significant majority of community
members are highly satisfied with infrastructure developed under the project. Survey
results indicate that overall 76% of beneficiaries utilizing infrastructure and services with
utilization rates observed for roads at (92%), bridges (87%), water supply (82%) and
sanitary facilities (72%) respectively. These investments have direct positive influences on
communal livelihoods. The average distance to and time spent reaching rural tarred roads
is reduced by 391m and 3.63 minutes respectively. Similarly, average distance travelled to
reach concrete road is reduced by 272m and by 2.27 minutes. Average distance travelled
to reach carpet road has reduced by 519m and by 6.5 minutes. Control sample estimates
reduced distance and time to improved roads at only 27m and 0.46 minutes which,
accumulatively over the life of improved roads will have significant economic benefits.
These distance and time reduction elements were stated as significant when compared
against the control at a 5% confidence interval.

Improvements in income and wealth ranking are reflected in changes to housing stock in
the project area. Changes were assessed in terms of progressive improvement between
building classifications (slum, semi-permanent, permanent and multi-story) within the
project area and control villages. Upward progression in building quality was found to be
significant at 5% confidence intervals and closely correlated with incremental income
improvements from project activities. Indirect benefits to HH included building and land
asset value appreciation close to improved roads, bridges and infrastructure.

Poverty levels
The IAR adopted an Income and Expenditure approach to poverty line assessment. Survey
results estimate that 24% and 26% of HH were below the National Poverty Line (NPL) in

                                             57
Phase I & II respectively under income analysis. Correspondingly, 28% and 25% of HH
in Phase I & II were below the NPL when classified under the expenditure approach.

Head Count Index (HCI)
The IAR estimates that HCI has fallen from 43% to 26% and from 32% to 29% using
income and expenditure approach respectively when levels are compared to Phase I
baseline data. The control area shows diverging trends with a reduction in HCI from 48%
to 42% under income analysis and an increase in HCI from 33% to 36% using expenditure
parameters. The most significant element of this analysis is a 17% reduction in HCI using
income analysis in project villages over both implementation phases.

Per capita Monthly income and expenditure
Per capita monthly income and expenditure analysis shows highest income in Samurdhi
VOs (Rs 9,164) followed by Demo VOs (Rs 8,437), phase II VOs (Rs 8,288) and Phase I
VOs (Rs 8,211 . Per capita income has increased from Rs 3,669 to Rs 9,164 in Samurdhi
VOs compared to baseline treatment, an increase of 249%. The same pattern is observed
in Demo VOs (235%), Phase II VOs (133%) and Phase I VOs (116%). Per capita income
change in control areas over the project period is somewhat lower at 106% between
baseline control and end project control.

Community Infrastructure Development and Social Services
The expected target for utilizing improved intra village infrastructure at the end of the
project period was 70 % (Result Framework Analysis). IAR survey indicates about 76% of
the target population is benefiting from infrastructure development, 6% above the RFW
target.

Capacity Building
IAR survey results from FGDs highlight high levels of community achievement and
satisfaction with the implementation and management of community funds and
infrastructure. It was found that levels of HH satisfaction with infrastructure development
was very high at about 97%

Construction Management
FGDs confirmed close compliance with Community Operation Manual (COM) at all levels
across all project Districts. FDGs highlighted early stage delays due to poor availability of
construction Technical Service Providers (TSPs). Intervention by senior PMU/DPMU
staff rectified this problem and facilitated the identification of appropriately qualified TSPs.

Progress of infrastructure sub-projects
All together 157 community infrastructure sub- projects were on going as at 30th
September 2014 and the progress of most of them are more than 85% and the project staff
are of the view that these sub projects can be completed within a time frame of two months.

Effectiveness of Operation and Maintenance fund Management.
In most of the water supply projects, O&M committees are functioning well and tariff
collection are providing funds for regular water delivery and O&M. In many villages the

                                              58
Village Committees have signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with NWS&DB
which will enable the VOs to get assistance when necessary.

Major Impacts of Infrastructure Projects:
Rural roads developed under project: Nearly 60% of infrastructure sub-projects are for
road development. Most of the communities have chosen construction of rural roads,
culverts and bridges as their first priority, which includes tarred as well as concrete roads.
All sub-projects have included a variable percentage of community input (between 10 and
20%) in-kind in the form of cash, labor and materials. The main benefits from roads
mentioned by communities include lower transportation costs for outputs and inputs used
in crop and livestock production, times saved in all journeys, safer passage of children to
school and better access to health facilities. New bridges and culverts have “opened” new
areas of land and allowed expansion in planted areas.

Community water Supply schemes: Totally 463 community water supply projects have
been implemented in the project area, all managed by the community themselves. Main
improvements sited are: time saved in collecting water, improved health, higher levels of
community sanitation/cleanliness and time freed for other income generating activities.

Sanitation Projects: Totally 695 sanitation sub projects have been implemented with
extended coverage to the estate sector.

Irrigation Sub projects: The project has implemented 164 irrigation sub-projects
consisting of new/rehabilitation of tanks, agro wells, lift irrigation schemes and
rehabilitation of canal and related structures with 8,340 direct and 12,154 indirect
beneficiaries. Irrigation projects provide water to 200 Ha of new and 1,900 Ha of existing
lands, consisting of paddy, maize, banana and other crops. Many irrigation canals were in
poor condition and rehabilitation has provided assured supplies of water thereby increasing
cropping intensity and yields. Implementation of irrigation sub-projects have helped
communities immensely, farmers as well as non-farmers who are involved in the livestock
production.

One Time Grantees and their economic advancement
Among OTGs nearly 37 % in phase I and 24% in phase II have graduated to VSCO loans
averaging Rs 2,100 and Rs 4,270 respectively. Others were not able to get VSCO loans
due to their inability to comply with compulsory savings in small groups. Among the OTGs,
about 51% are female and 49% male in Phase I and 44% female and 56% male in Phase II.

Among recipients of OTGs about 4% in Phase I and 35% in Phase II hold decision- making
positions in the VOs. This is a remarkable achievement for community members who did
not have any power or economic status prior to the project. Subsequently poorer members
have become engaged in both economically rewarding livelihood activities and the
decision-making process of the community.

Skill development



                                             59
Based on the VOs studied for the IAR survey and FGD, 4,813 unemployed youths were in
the sample. Of these, 950 are in Phase I sample and 3,863 in Phase II sample. A estimated
57% of unemployed youth have obtained SDLs. Out of SDL receivers, 60% females and
40% males in phase I and 64% males and 36% females in phase II VOs. Average SDL has
ranged from Rs 201,850 to Rs 351,527. Repayment rate of SD loans in Phase I is higher
than Phase II as indicated in table 46. Ninety eight percent (98%) of SDL receivers are
directed for Vocational Training. The perception on skill development training is obtained
from HH survey and among the respondents, 78% marked the training as highly useful and
20% rated as useful and 2% mentioned that SD training is not useful.

Formation of Village Savings and Credit Organization (VSCO)
The permanent sub-committee on livelihoods delegates management of Savings and Credit
Fund to the VSCC. The total number of loans disbursed in sample VOs is 18,015. About
Rs 201 Mn worth loans disbursed to 29 VOs in phase I and Rs 340 Mn loans disbursed to
members in 164 VOs in phase II. The average loan amount disbursed by VO in phase I and
phase II is Rs 128,364 and Rs 252,609 respectively. Up to now, Rs 136 million in phase I
VOs and Rs 208 Mn in phase II VOs have been recovered from the loan recipients. It is
important to note that 29 VOs in phase II are able to generate an interest income of Rs 27
Mn and Rs 31 Mn by 164 VO in phase II

Seventy eight percent of loans were disbursed to women in Phase I and 82% in Phase II
and for poor and the poorest, 71% and 4% respectively in phase 1 and 77% and 3%
respectively in Phase II. The total loan amount issued was Rs. 261 Mn. Phase I loans are
used for a variety of livelihood activities including agriculture (76%), self-employment and
micro enterprises (15%) and livestock production (5%). Phase II loans were increased to
self-employment (28%), crop-based agriculture (60%) and the balance to livestock
production. A majority of beneficiaries rated VSCO loan as a useful credit scheme
irrespective of the type of project implementation (project, Samurdhi and demonstration).
Some respondents stated that VSCO interest rates were too high in comparison to
commercial banks (18% c.f. 8%), that loan sizes were too small for commercial
investments and that, requirements that loans be specifically for development rather than
consumption were limiting.

Efficiency of VSCO
The VSCO strategies have helped the members to increase income from numerous ways;
reduce the cost of credit (low interest, low transaction cost, no transport cost), increase
agricultural income due to timely availability of credit, presence of appropriate grace
periods, close credit supervision on IGAs, lower transaction cost, etc. The revenue
generated from loans is invested back into village to fulfill the credit needs. The demand
for VSCO loans continues to increase as this scheme is easily accessible, less cumbersome,
and quick in their delivery and the interest rate being reasonably low when compared to
traditional means of borrowing.

Impact Analysis of Inter-Village Connectivity Development
Infrastructure investments implemented in selected PS Zones using the guiding principles
of participatory planning and CCD have been very successful under SCDLIP. Capacity

                                            60
building activities have empowered communities and PS staff to plan, construct and
maintain significant infrastructure projects that have translated into real economic and
practical gains for communities. Projects under SCDLIP management have provided “Best
Practice” examples that are now being emulated in other PS Zones that were not included
under this project umbrella as models in project management.

Assessment on forward and backward linkages with Public and Private Institutions
(technology, marketing and value addition)
Producer Groups provide a focal point for progressive producers in identified value chains
to link-up with Government Agencies, private service providers and commercial
agricultural companies to exploit greater efficiencies and economies of scale. PGs were
identified from VO graded as A & B with well-managed VSCO loan books. Block grants
were provided on a per capita basis for the acquisition of collective assets for processing,
harvesting and marketing activities. PGs were formed with a focus on existing viable value
chains that could be leveraged by greater coordination, more efficient aggregation and
technological advances. Value chains included paddy rice, maize, fruits, black pepper, tea,
dairy and high value vegetables. Benefits can be broadly classified into gains in higher
market or sales prices, better quality/lower losses, group purchase of inputs, better
coordinated marketing, and tea rehabilitation not possible under VSCO loans alone. In the
same way, these gains in market efficiency allowed by access to block grants, were
leveraged by more efficient use of VSCO funds creating a vitreous cycle of higher margins
and faster re-cycling of loans.

Analysis of Impact on Cross-Cutting Issues

Gender and Institutional Development
Empowerment of women is one of the central tenets of the CDD methodology and was
clearly represented the IAR survey and FGDs. Discussions revealed a steady evolution of
group dynamics and changing attitudes at allowed women an equal role in HH decision-
making, VO Committee management and recipients of VSCO loans. This was confirmed
by the sample survey data. In the majority of VOs, women occupy either all or greater
proportion of the key positions and contribute to decision making regarding village
improvement. RF indicator A7 indicates a score of 67% as opposed to the target of 50%.
In particular, young females play a significant role in decision making over village
development as office bearers. Women also facilitate household livelihood development
through VSCO in which they hold key positions. They obtain loans for agriculture,
livestock and self-employment.

Women are now public figures better known and have improved status in the family and
the society as active partners capable of contributing to and influencing the village
development process. Before the project, they were largely house-bound and had a limited
social space only. The most active female members have been appointed as CRPs or
CCRPs, and are paid by VSCO.

Inclusion of the Poor and Vulnerable



                                            61
Improved socio-economic position of the poor and vulnerable (VO FGDs indicated at least
50% OTGs have emerged out of poverty, RF, higher rate of progress). The poorest of the
poor and the vulnerable families including widows and disabled have been included in the
benefit stream of the VO which allocated 5% of the total VDF for this purpose. This has
contributed in a substantial way to poverty reduction of this particular group.

Convergence: Mainstreaming SCDLIP
At the National level the project has contributed in a positive way to implement the Safety
Home Garden Program initiated by the Ministry of Economic Development. The project
has trained Development Officers (DOs) who can be utilized for scaling up of this approach.
As a result of knowledge level convergence process, Government officers are well aware
of the Community Driven Development (CDD) tool. As such it is evidenced that SCDLIP
has assisted adoption of the CDD approach at the time of Divineguma establishment.
Village level convergence has been made through the linking of village organizations to
public and private agencies in various ways such as input supply, training, marketing, and
new technologies. Around 381 partnerships have been developed by producer groups as a
result of this convergence and today these producer groups are benefitting from those
partnerships. The government has created a conducive environment through institutional
and policy reform in order to sustain project benefits and the objective indicators set under
this component have achieved results exceeding the target.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Introduction: The Community Development and Livelihood Improvement Project
(SCDLIP) functioned directly under the Ministry of Economic Development to assist to
implement the poverty reduction and regional development strategy of the Government of
Sri Lanka (GOSL) within the post-conflict development scenario. It followed Community
Driven Development (CDD) approach with a main focus on economic and social
empowerment of the village communities and to assist them to manage resources and take
decisions prudently. The sustainable livelihood development framework identified to build
five major asset categories or an ‘Asset Pentagon’ (i.e. human, financial, physical, natural,
and social capital) and type of capital (or capital endowments) in VOs to use by the
community within the vulnerability context to achieve the targets in economic and social
development.

Evaluation of Institutional Development – CDLIP: All the VOs have invested the
Capacity Building (CB) Funds (Rs 456.56Mn) on the components of the institutional
development, Office management, VO registration, implementation of village
development activities, and capacity building of VOs for livelihood development.

The members of the executive committee and the permanent sub committees in the VO,
who play leadership roles in the CDLIP programme, have been given in-depth knowledge
on CDLIP principles, methodology, and procedures. The responses from the community
revealed that they were highly satisfied about the various types of knowledge gained
through the entire capacity building programmes conducted during the project period. The
responses generated through FGDs confirmed that, majority of the beneficiaries strongly
accepted that at the end of the IEC campaigns, the village members have taken proper
understanding about the CDD model, its dynamics, and implementation modes of the CDD
model at the village level, community responsibilities and rules of the games.

According to the Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) conducted with the village level officials,
they have explained that this concept was a novel idea for them because it was a bottoms-
up approach of development to transfer funds directly to the VOs. Further, they have
categorized that this was an important concept to change the vicious cycle of dependency
as well as empower the people. The social auditing is an independent and continuous
evaluation of all the activities of the village organizations for ensuring compliance with
project principles and Golden Rules. The FGDs confirmed that the functioning of social
audit committees was highly effective, following the guidelines designed.

Performance of Functioning of VOs: In the CDLIP, community leaders are selected
through the trust and consensus of the community. This is the essence of building
leadership and the social capital among the community members. Women have become
more confident in operationalizing all functions in the VOs through greater empowerment.
As a result, the level of gender based violence has shown a downward trend, according to
the responses received from the FGDs held.




                                             64
Social development concerns itself with promoting the inclusion of poor, vulnerable and
excluded groups (especially youth and women); strengthening social cohesion and the
capacity for collective action towards development; and enhancing the capacities of
communities to hold accountable the institutions that serve them. The project has mobilized
such groups by ensuring the proactive participation to the village level development
activities of VOs. Based on the FGDs, the community members have satisfied with the
inclusions of the poor, women and youth for the development activities and they have been
empowered and benefited from the development process of the VOs. The results from the
FGDs revealed that 63% of VOs are meeting their operational expenses. The role of CRPs
played was strengthened through coordination with other stakeholders. There is a policy
direction to the CDLIP to make the arrangements to integrate with the DDD to functioning
of 1842 VOs and sustain the revolving funds (i.e. VSCO fund, O&M fund, Skill
development fund, sanitation fund and the producer group fund) built among VOs.

One Time Grants (OTGs) to the Poorest of the Poor: The objective of the sub-
component of one time grants under the Livelihood Support Fund was to help increase
income and improve the livelihoods of the community members, some women and men in
the villages are too poor and vulnerable to start up livelihood improvement activities.
Requiring such people (for example, especially poor women, widows, disables, elderly,
landless etc.) the same conditions of contributions would run a risk of making them
indebted and more vulnerable.

The CDLIP allocated Rs 250.77 Mn (Rs 99.62 Mn for the Phase I VOs and Rs 151.15 Mn
for the Phase II VOs) for 1842 active VOs of 11 districts covering 5% as OTGs. In those
villages, LKR 237.52 Mn (95%) was invested among 18,342 OTGs, out of 19,333 number
of beneficiaries. It was reported that 17,178 one time grantees (94%) started the income
generation activities. As key objectives of the CDLIP, all the poorest of the poor and
vulnerable families in the selected VOs have been formed into small groups and linked to
the loan disbursement process of the VSCOs and 38% OTGs were graduated as VSCO
borrowers from the status of OTGs.

Youth and Skill Development: The CDLIP as a regional development project that
adopted holistic development approach, included a skill development (human capital)
component. During the Phase I and II of the project, the project invested LKR 496.75 Mn
as direct funds to implement skill and youth development programs within villages,
benefitting 28,541 number of youth as skill development loan borrowers. Apart from that,
LKR 3.04Mn of project funds invested to organize and implement many youth
development programmes including career guidance programmes, job fairs, and youth
camps, benefitting 11,456 number of youth as participants. Cumulative impact created an
outcome of 33,674 number of youth employment that is 16,634 number of youths though
skill development loan program and 17,040 number of youth through job linking programs.
Village youth development demonstrated excellent inclusion principles. Females, disabled,
and vulnerable community of the village participated in the youth development activities,
overall 38% female youth out of all youth in the village benefitted from the skill
development loan program



                                            65
Micro Finance and Livelihood Development: The VSCOs functioned as a competitive
community managed micro finance entities in project villages with the provision of
required financial capital on easy and concessionary terms, for the poor, and the non-
bankable village communities to implement their income generation activities in profitable
and sustainable manner.

VSCO has achieved a remarkable progress. The membership has increased up to 235,448
and the VSCOs have distributed financial benefits for 202,198 (86%) members. The loan
distribution has become 86%. Also VSCO has efficiently utilized their funds and has
disbursed loans worth of Rs 7718.04Mn. The funds utilization capacity is 251%. The
accumulated revolving fund of VSCOs was maintained with the strength of Rs.4052.4 Mn
to cater to the micro finance needs of the VSCO members in 11 districts.
The financial sustainability of VSCOs is mainly depended upon their profitability levels.
By ensuring its sustainability, the majority of VSCOs (69%) generated profits and
converted them as profit earning centers. In the meantime, VSCO has directed 4208
members through building bank linkages with commercial banks and they have obtained
Rs 261.12mn worth of bank loans for their members to invest further in income generating
ventures either through advancing new technologies or linking with niche markets or
introducing new products or expanding the existing product base of the VOs.

According to analyses made, based on the responses of beneficiaries collected through
FGDs conducted, 77% of members have received new skills through this program and
while the networking capacity has increased by 59% and shifting from subsistence farming
to commercial farming was increased by 77%. In addition, the findings of the economic
analysis conducted for the thematic report on livelihood development, it was convinced
that the majority of VSCO investments have maintained as profitable ventures in agri-
businesses by improving the status for obtaining higher returns (i.e. higher IRR and lower
payback period). Further, the VSCO as an economic entity, it has created IRR as a process
to create economic benefits for the members of the society as a sustainable venture of
building financial capital. In this context, majority of VSCO beneficiaries have responded
that the VSCO has created tremendous benefits for the members and they are highly
satisfied about the functioning and benefits generated by the VSCOs.

Producer Groups and Livelihood Development: There are 433 PGs functioning in the
VOs in 11 project districts, by investing Rs 221.3 Mn. The productivity improvement
technologies and capacity building programmes made created direct and indirect effects on
productivity enhancement and household income. According to the study, the majority of
households (64%) have increased their income through agriculture related investment and
the majority of beneficiary households (235,448) have taken VSCO loans to invest in new
agricultural ventures and activities and to develop existing agricultural activities. Out of
that, 44,797 beneficiary HHs (19%) were engaged in PG activities. The net income changes
were observed in Food Grain Crops, Animal Husbandry, Horticultural Crops, Perennial
Export Crops and Non-Agricultural activities, with a clear planning process implemented.
CRPs need to play a role in linking up with all stakeholders to obtain financial capital,
technology, market links, and promoting value and supply chains for PGs. The line
agencies provided hand holding support to the PGs. Linking PG with the model of

                                            66
Divineguma ensures the review of progress and the coordination part of related line
agencies.
.
Transferring new technologies to the remote villages was one of the most important options
experienced in the project. There were innovations in introducing community based
technologies through the CDLIP. In particular, introduction of ‘Paddy Trans-planters and
motorized weeders’ was an innovation, adopting among farmers in the first time in the
history of Sri Lanka, by the CDLIP through the PGs established. It was observed that the
overall achievements of the three RF indicators, relevant to livelihood development
programmes of the CDLIP were higher than the target. Considering the situation above, at
the final World Bank mission fielded in June-July, 2014, the livelihood development sector
was achieved the ratings of ‘satisfactory’

Finally, the PGs are performing multi-functional tasks in product and market integration
process by promoting PPP initiatives for making a novel approach in livelihood promotion
among VOs in Sri Lanka, through integration with forward and backward linkages. The all
stakeholders should have a paramount responsibility to sustain the entire process by
operationalizing community based approaches to create an environment for improving
investment at VO level. It eventually assists to generate viable investment initiatives for
the community in VOs in particular and generate viable opportunities for improving
regional development based economic growth in the country in general within the post-
conflict development scenario.

Convergence and policy Support: The convergence and policy support component of the
CDLIP assists the GOSL in developing an enabling policy environment and also in
undertaking strategic communication on the CDD model to policy level stakeholders. The
objective of the convergence component is to open up opportunities for the selected
government and the local agencies to develop policies, rules and procedures and
institutional arrangements, allowing to transfer the required funds directly to local
governments and communities to operationalize the CDD model with empowering the
communities and promote beneficiaries as partners in the rural development process.

a) National, Institutional and VO Level Convergence and Knowledge Convergence:
   National level convergence programmes (ie. Home garden campaigns, north-south
   dialog, Training of 14,000 EDOs, participating Deyata Kirula exhibitions etc.),
   institutional level (ie. Technology transfer through state and private stakeholders) and
   VO level (ie. establishing bank linkages) convergence programmes and knowledge
   convergence (ie, best cases, documenting research reports, building business linkages,
   conducting farmer conferences, producing video documentary, and radio programmes)
   assisted to generate new knowledge on CDD approaches and disseminated them
   through various mode of print and electronic media to push the frontier of knowledge.

b) Investment in Samurdhi and Demo VOs and Issues Identified: The CDLIP has
   invested from three different fronts in Samurdhi and Demo VOs, namely capacity
   building, livelihood development and infra structure development. During the first two
   years in operation (2010-2012), utilization of funds was around 14%, which was

                                            67
   increased up to 90% during the second two year period (2013-2014) in operation due
   to changes in structure, introduction of join facilitation of both government and project
   staff in Samurdhi and Demo VOs, and internalizing the VO operations in Samurdhi
   VOs through the nearest PIU. Further, promoting investment in producer groups was
   also activated and increased investment in VOs for building technology for
   enhancement of productivity.

c) Convergence and Policy Support Possibilities with the Divineguma Development
   Department (DDD): The CDD approaches have been operationalized under the
   convergence programme in 102 Samurdhi VOs in 7 districts and 45 Demo VOs in 2
   districts. In these Samurdhi and Demo VOs, building state and private linkages in
   business, marketing, bank, and technology service providers are very vital for
   livelihood development. The rich experience gained through CDD approaches, best
   cases identified, effective facilitation process operationalized and positive results
   generated through the Samurdhi and Demo programmes as show cases need to
   mainstream with the national development progrmmes. In line with the policy
   directives given by the Secretary, Ministry of Economic Development, it is imperative
   to develop appropriate policy and strategic operational options to integrate with the
   DDD to sustain the gains in CDD approaches operationalized in the CDLIP. However,
   102 Samurdhi VOs are already integrated by the DDD.

Financial Management: The Government of Sri Lanka entered into an agreement with
the World Bank to implement Community Development and Livelihood Improvement
Project (CDLIP) –Phase II initially for four and half years with an IDA loan of USD 75
million. The Financial Management arrangements in the CDLIP has established and
institutionalized as per the financial Management (FM) manual. The project has
successfully developed rules and regulations for carrying out operations in financial
management and incorporated them in various manuals such as FM Manual and
Community Operational Manuals (COMs). The required authorities in financial
management were decentralized into the DPMU levels. The levels of controls were
developed and approval limits at various levels were also clearly established.

System of budgetary control and planning is in place, expenditures are tracked against the
budget and variations (if any) properly reported. An efficient appraisal and monitoring
system was implemented. First financing agreement was signed on 22nd.October.2009 for
the SDR 50.4 Mn. (USD 75.0Mn.) and revised financing agreement was signed on
12th.September.2013. The percentage of disbursement of IDA was changed by this revised
agreement and APL was converted as Investment Lending (IL). Accordingly, the CDLIP
was extended by for six months from 31.03.2014 and IDA 100% financing was effective
from 01.01.2014. The expenditures have been classified as two categories and five
components, specified in the agreement. The project planned to invest USD 105 million
and it was changed to USD 100.35 million by the final amended agreement. As at 30th,
September, 2014, a total of USD 96.47 million was invested to project activities and it is
96% achievement of the total. A proper computerized accounting system is placed in the
CDLIP. All annual audits done on time, reports were submitted to the Donor and



                                            68
Government before the due dates. No major incidents of misappropriations or misconduct
in financial dealings at every level of the project.

Government Commitment and Performance: The GOSL was really committed to
achieve the objectives of the CDLIP in line with the ‘Mahinda Chintana – Future vision’
at the time of designing of the CDLIP on poverty alleviation and regional development and
very supportive throughout the period of implementation of the project and restructuring
of the project which was suited to the today’s post-conflict development scenario. The
strategies have been formulated and changed the structure of the CDLIP to function
smoothly. Accordingly, the Gemidiriya Foundation (GDF) has been changed structurally
to a PMU to function the project directly under the Ministry of Economic Development
(MED). For these purposes, the Secretary and Additional Secretaries and other key staff
members of the MED, have assisted in numerous ways at different stages of the project
particularly designing, implementation, monitoring, and progress reviewing. In addition,
Secretary of the Treasury and the Ministry of Finance and Planning and the Director
General, External Resources Department (ERD) and Director General, Department of
Project Management and Monitoring proposed numerous changes to function the project
in line with the CDD approaches.

The District Secretaries, Divisional Secretaries, Director (Planning) and Grama Niladharis
played their role in giving support to organize and facilitate the CDD process for the
District Project Management Units (DPMUs) and district staff of the CDLIP, operating in
districts, in Divisional Secretariat Division areas and in the villages respectively. The
Assistant Directors appointed (by the CDLIP) in each project district maintained very
cordial relationships for coordination & implementation of project components with
respective government officials. The political leadership in each project district has given
the fullest cooperation for implementing the project components. In particular, monthly
progress reviews of the project were regularly conducted at the District Development
Committee (DDC) level and the Divisional Development Committee (DAC) levels. Those
forums were used to guide the project team with strategic options to expedite the
implementation and perform the project functions efficiently
.
a) Performance in Implementing Agencies

   Ministry of Economic Development and its Officials: The CDLIP was operating
    under the MED and its progress was reviewed periodically as part of the Government
    review process. The relationship with the Ministry and its officials is marked as a
    mutually supporting relationship with the required autonomy granted undisturbed. The
    facilities and privileges enjoyed by the project staff as a foreign funded project within
    the management circular No 33, (2007), which is the government approved procedure
    for selection of key posts, payment of salaries and other service conditions, was seen
    compatible with other foreign funded projects. The project was able to create an
    understanding that the dedication and commitment with the capacity of the CDLIP staff
    and the results generated justify the facilities accorded to the staff. The exposure visits
    were arranged for the Ministry officials to the CDLIP project districts and VOs to
    observe and understand the dynamics of these CDD projects. The leadership of the

                                              69
    Secretary of the MED supported by the project staff paved way for the incorporations
    of proven procedures to major policy implementation processes.

   Recognition of the CDLIP and its Staff: The M&E system of the CDLIP was
    recognized and published in the ADB web site in the Asia Pacific Community
    Practitioners of Managing Development Results. The award for the best practice for
    supervision and implementation support won by CDLIP/Gemidiriya Task Team of the
    World Bank among 270 bank projects (2010) and the Gemidiriya winning the national
    Excellence Award in Human Resource Development performance evaluations (2010),
    conducted by the IPM, Colombo. The above evidence is a tribute to the untiring efforts
    and dedication of the professionally recognized, and committed staff at all levels
    oriented with pro poor attitudes and working ethics as a CDLIP Family. The CDLIP
    engaged with estate and private sector stakeholders to provide the necessary services
    for livelihood promotion. In particular, the Department of Agriculture, Department of
    Export Agriculture, Tea Small Holding Development Authority, Department of
    Animal Production of Health, Botanical Garden etc. were closely associated with the
    CDLIP as service providers in terms of provision of new technology packages for
    productivity enhancement in the respective agriculture and livestock sectors.

b) Relationship with the World Bank

    The relationship with the World Bank both its head office and country office in
    Colombo was considered of very cordial and supportive to the CDLIP, especially
    because of the institutional development model followed. The relationship among the
    Bank head Office, country office in Colombo and the CDLIP was seen as a triangle
    with bank and project staff holding hands strongly protecting the shared project
    interests through strong collaboration and commitment in poverty alleviation and pro-
    poor growth.

There was a strong feeling of trust that there is no other agenda other than the common
interests in both parties of the Bank and the project. The very candid and transparent
manner with which the functions were carried out left no room for breakdowns. The
common challenges encountered were boldly and professionally dealt with by all parties
concerned. In addition, during the 10 support missions conducted throughout the project
period, from March 2010 to September, 2014, the Bank teams were able to obtain good
access to the project sites and engage with the communities and stakeholders as well as
information needed to measure and observe the progress of the project.

The intellectual treatment to respond to project assessments by the able leadership of the
task team leaders appointed during the phase II of the CDLIP from the bank side, fostering
the intellectual support from the Bank Board, Senior Vice Presidents, Sector Directors and
Sector Managers who took time to visit the CDLIP sites in project districts and discuss
with the Communities in their villages and stakeholders to identify issues and observe
results generated through project interventions on the ground reflects the source of
inspiration for collaboration.



                                           70
When the CDLIP was designed and operated, three main negative issues were identified,
namely the mode of registration of all VOs as companies for operating by very poor and
disadvantaged groups; No clear-cut strategy for exiting from the project and political
sustainability of the CDD approaches; and mainstreaming the process was not considered,
after completion of the project. Once the CDLIP was initiated and established in 2004, the
World Bank has not paid adequate attention for the above three main issues and likely
effects of mechanisms proposed. As a result, there was a greater vacuum in the CDLIP
process to be filled. Further, maintaining sustainability and mainstreaming of the CDLIP
process is the main issue to be resolved in future.

c) Borrower’s Ratings on the World Bank’s Performance

The performance of the World Bank is reflected in the event of the task team winning the
award for the best practice for supervision and implementation support among 270 bank
funded projects of the Agriculture and Social Development Programme of the World Bank
in 2010. This event marks a culmination of a process of a high degree of collaboration
between the World Bank Team and the GOSL partners which created a series of events of
history in the journey of the CDLIP.

The World Bank has sent 10 support and review missions during the period from March
2010 to end Sept, 2014 to Sri Lanka to facilitate the process and penetrate to sources to
information worth probing in a transparent and trustworthy manner covering larger sample
of VOs and well represented gatherings of community members and staff to review project
performance worked well. The relationship of the three key agencies i.e. the Bank
headquarters, the Country office of the World Bank and the Project Management Unit
(PMU) as a triangle is very important to implement the project agreements, and concepts,
and smooth implementation of programmes and compliance of the conditions laid down.

Lessons Learned with the CDLIP

  Project design as a Paradigm Shift: The phase II of the CDLIP was well designed
   and implemented to achieve the goals of the project. Among the design elements, cost
   sharing, direct transfer of funds to the communities, fixed budget envelope and
   milestone-based disbursement, devolution of O&M to the communities, simple and
   transparent rules of engagement, women empowerment through following the
   inclusion principle and independent & autonomy of the guardians of rules have strong
   positive impacts for smooth implementation of the CDD approaches.
a) Emergence of rural youth leadership through CRPs as Catalysts: The VOs of the
   CDLIP have been able to produce strong, energetic and vibrant youth leaders
   particularly women through appointing them as Community Resource Persons (CRPs)
   in respective VOs as a novel concept in Sri Lanka to become as ‘Catalysts or Change
   Agents’ in community based rural development and livelihood promotion. Their
   practicality and familiarity with the ground realities in community and livelihood
   development is a strong positive factor for coordination of all functions, stakeholders
   and activities in the VOs.



                                           71
b) Demand driven approach in identification of sub projects: The VDP is the central
   document for planning and executing the proposals in VOs where issues, community
   priority-based needs have been identified and solutions have been proposed by the
   community themselves. Accordingly, the demand is created by the community and no
   outsider can influence the decisions. The decisions are taken by the active participation
   of 80% or more of the members at the Maha Sabha. This aspect has been one of the
   key successful lessons learnt in the CDLIP process.
c) Building Strong Social Capital in VOs:The resources available in the rural sector to
   improve the livelihood of people and optimum usage of the available resources are
   constraints due to lack of technical knowhow, absence of peer review, lack of financial
   capital, poor infrastructure, lack of proper organization of communities, absence of
   informed rules of common conduct, etc. The success of the CDLIP is the possibilities
   to eliminate these constraints through the formation of strong community based village
   level organizations (ie. VOs & VSCOs) and providing a hand holding facilitation
   support from the project staff till they become confident about their own capabilities.
d) Empowering the rural poor The VOS structure has promoted the development of
   leadership within the village and it has given more opportunity to share the
   responsibility among a large number of members of the VO. With proper guidance and
   commitment, communities are capable of surmounting any obstacles and reaching their
   goals. The communities who did not have the chance to voice their concerns now have
   greater opportunity to take part in decisions that make their destiny productive and
   lucrative.
e) Governance & participatory democracy Report card and social audit systems
   provide strong social accountability and governance mechanisms that strongly assist in
   village development process and these innovations have provided clear guidance to the
   members of VOs and the staff of the CDLIP. The Community Report Card can be used
   as a powerful monitoring tool through which the village community will collectively
   exert social control on the performance of these teams and alert them for desirable
   changes. Non negotiable principles and ten golden rules play a vital role in
   implementing good governance and democratic principles within the VOs.
f) Possibility of linking with future Rural Development programmes The public
   company model underwent transformation in 2013, consequent to government policy
   changes in favor of establishing voluntary VO model. Accordingly, the Board of
   Directors became as Executive Committee. Although a few VOs opted to remain in the
   company mode, majority of VOs decided to register as village organizations, under the
   MED. Under the company model, the generally stated reasons by the people pointed
   out as the cumbersome procedures needed to follow, the cost incurred in annual audit,
   possibilities to gain benefits for lower taxing in maintenance cost (i.e. Electricity, water
   etc.). Further, the possibility of government channeling development funds to the
   registered VO – backed by certain VOs with similar experiences already – provided
   what seemed a credible incentive to change the organizational mode and compromise
   on organizational autonomy.

g) Convergence with the Sustainable Rural Development There is a need for clarifying
   policy issues at the project formulation stage. The project design did indicate the
   potential value of analyzing the project experience to initiate policy dialogue and

   institutional reforms in favor of autonomous, self-governing local organizations and
   the government creating conducive and effective regulatory framework. It seems such
   developments were foreseen probably on the assumption that Phase II would continue
   to register similar successes as the grant-aid-facilitated pilot project and Phase 1 and
   that it would progress along similar direction even under conditions of government
   officers (Development Officer, Samurdhi Officer) playing the facilitator role similar to
   the project officers
   ’
Recommendations and Policy Implications

a) Village Development Plan: It is needed to design a new considering the balance
   requirement of development needs and activities considering the ‘Asset Pentagon’
   developed in the villages within the holistic development model of the post-conflict
   development scenario. The VDP should include the essential development plans for
   institutional development, infrastructure development, livelihood development, skill
   development and environmental management for the villages. These plans have to be
   submitted to the Divisional Secretary or the DDD and made arrangements to
   periodically review and update.

b) Livelihood development: In considering the Village Development Plan (VDP), it is
   required to develop a possible livelihood development option for each and every
   household in the VO, depending on their resource base, improvement possibilities of
   existing livelihood development programmes, and establishment of new livelihood
   options on their skills and other capacities built. Once the household level preliminary
   planning is done, it is possible to develop a comprehensive VDP, as a demand driven
   livelihood plan for the village.

c) Village Savings and Credit Organization (VSCO): It was observed that some
   VSCOs are functioning profitably by maintaining a healthy income level through
   generating interest income, by covering their monthly expenses. The interest rates of
   formal financial institutions and Samurdhi banks show a downward trend and revision
   of interest rate policy of VSCOs may be required to match with the current trend and
   attractive to borrow loans for promoting investment in livelihood development.

d) Institutional Development: Functioning of Maha Sabah is at a satisfactory level.
   However, size of the village, nature of employment of members and location of
   households act as a barrier of obtaining the minimum 80% of attendance. Innovations
   are needed to cater to location specific needs that support the sustainability of VOs.
   The social accountability approaches introduced by CDLIP play a major role in
   promoting sustainability of VOs and capacities SAC and procurement committees have
   to be further strengthening to deal with various socio- economic backgrounds of the
   communities. Further, training and capacity building of CRPs are prime needs to
   strengthen their services to the VOs. The process adopted to achieve a totally
   independent, self-reliant and politically neutral environment for project
   implementation by CDLIP at village level is innovative and commendable. However,
   strategic changes in the present approach are needed to link with local governments

                                            73
   and other public sector institutions to support project implementation without
   damaging the basic principles of CDLIP.

e) Social Infrastructure Development: The O&M of the recently built infrastructure
   should be maintained to sustain the investment made among VOs. For this purpose, it
   is required to conduct a periodic review and appoint vigilant group for identification of
   any damages within the community for maintaining the infrastructure sustainably. It is
   recommended that identifying the balance needs of infrastructure in VOs and
   incorporate them into the proposed new VDP in the particular village for additional
   funding from the other sources to cater to the village needs of infrastructure.

f) Project Management: The MIS of the CDLIP is fully automated and delivered the
   required outputs/reports for all the stakeholders on time. The data and other information
   should be protected through evolving some mechanisms for sustainability of the MIS
   through the DDD. Otherwise the investment made on MIS will be in vain and the data
   for future use for further planning purposes may not be protected.

g) Sustainability: The CDLIP has generated a wealth of information on CDD approaches
   in rural and livelihood development. However, it is necessary to pass this knowledge
   to the next generation who involve in future community and livelihood development
   and maintain the longer term sustainability. Accordingly, it is required to design a
   programme for transferring the knowledge gained to the wider forum of policy makers,
   development practitioners and other stakeholders through initiating well organized
   advocacy programmes.

   The CDLIP is having a well talented and energetic resource pool for developing and
   practicing CDD models and approaches on mobilizing the communities on rural and
   livelihood development from the project implementation at the grass-root level to the
   Project Management at the national level. Further, it needs to link up with the DDD,
   which is the premier organization established with the objectives to promote CDD
   models and approaches for community development and livelihood promotion.

   The sustainability of VOs could be maintained with introducing a normal and
   simplified structure with an executive committee and the accountability committee and
   with a coordinating support of the CRPs. Once the project intervention is over
   eventually there are 4 main revolving funds are remained in each VO, namely: VSCO
   fund, skill development fund, O&M fund, and sanitation fund to be sustained. The
   maintaining and operating these funds sustainably with facilitation and coordination of
   DDD officials is necessary for creating better use for generating opportunities for
   livelihood promotion for communities.

   In terms of convergence, there should be a forum for documenting and disseminating
   the results, lessons and best cases of convergence among stakeholders of government
   officials to replicate the best lessons and avoid the bottlenecks in future similar kind of
   programs of CDD nature. In addition the expert knowledge developed through the



                                             74
   CDLIP process need to be used for future DDD programs as a sustainability measure
   to practice in the DDD.

Government Comments on Draft ICR

No. ERD/WB/SCDLIP                                                          June 14, 2015

Dear Ms. Clottes,

       Second Community Development and Livelihood Improvement Project
       “Gemidiriya” Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report – Request
       for GoSL views

This refers to your letters dated June 11, 2015 and June 25, 2015 addressed to us along
with the draft Gemidiriya ICR on the above.

It is observed that the project has achieved a higher rate of disbursement of 96 percent of
the commitment. Further, the indicators with respect to the project development objectives
and the intermediate outcomes have closer or exceeded the targets as stipulated in the
results framework, and as a result project’s outcomes have been rated “moderately
satisfactory”.

However, the borrower’s performance has been rated as “moderately unsatisfactory” in the
ICR which seems to be somewhat misleading. The main reason behind this rating, as
indicated in the ICR, was the delay occurred in formalising the village organisations
established under the Gemidiriya project and having them registered under a formal
government authority.

As you are well aware, the then government vision was to streamline all village
organizations which was committed to poverty alleviation under one organization in order
to facilitate national poverty alleviation program in a very effective and sustainable
manner. Accordingly, it was required to have Gemidiriya village organizations registered
under “Divineguma” Act and there were some delays in the transition period and also pre
and post-election period. This was a policy decision taken by the then government and
borrower performance of the aforementioned project should not be based on the
implementation delays of those policy decisions.

Furthermore, it is appreciated if the World Bank will objectively explain the criteria that
they have used with weighted average ratings in the ICR in order to avoid the reader
misleading on the performance of the project.



                                            75
We shall therefore be thankful if you review the ratings given for the
Borrower’s/Government’s performance and rate it as “moderately satisfactory”. It is noted
that the ICR may carry some recommendations in that respect considering the experience
from other countries too.
Your understanding and cooperation in this regard is very much appreciated.
