                         of the VOs were also active with increased activities of the producer groups in strategic partnership with the private sector. 87% of VSCOs were reported to be making profits while
                         their portfolio quality improved significantly. A total of 4712 Phase I sub projects have been completed which is 99.8% of total approved projects. However, out of the targeted 4290
                         infrastructure sub projects under phase II, 2189 are completed and there are delays in the implementation of some inter connectivity projects. There is need to accelerate
                         implementation of these activities with increased emphasis on operation and maintenance. This is critical for the project given that it has less than 9 months for implementation. Staff

                         turnover rate has also reduced and the changes reported are not management induced. But there is concern on retaining key contract staff that may be looking out for better
                         opportunities outside the project. Therefore, short term consultants should be hired to cover any gap during the implementation period.
                         The compliance to environmental and social safeguards of the project has improved significantly since the last mission. There is timely preparation of Environmental Management
                         Plans (EMPs), their implementation in the field and monitoring and awareness of EMPs is being done accordingly. A lot of ground work has been done in terms of the implementation
                         of the Pest Management Plan and compliance mechanisms with regard to environmental management since the previous mission based on field evaluation. On social safeguard, the
                         database on all types of land transactions including voluntary land donations has been prepared at PMU level. The field level staff also has taken adequate measures to prepare sub-
                         project level socials safeguards checklists and brief screening reports detailing social impacts of each intervention. Gender mainstreaming is visible in all types of interventions such
                         as village organizations, livelihood loans and credit utilization, community resource persons and skill development trainings etc. In addition, project has made considerable effort to
                         uplift socioeconomic standards of poorer and vulnerable households through onetime grants and as a result the socially marginalized groups were able to elevate themselves as
                         creditworthy individuals and respected citizens in the community.
