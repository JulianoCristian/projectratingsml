Urban\n            Development Project is to improve urban management in the\n            Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) through a comprehensive\n            approach in which institutional and financial reforms go\n            hand-in-hand with physical improvements. The project will\n            build significant institutional, financial and legislative\n            reforms already underway to strengthen metropolitan agencies\n            and municipal governments and other institutions responsible\n            for urban planning, management and operation. At the same\n            time, the project will substantially increase the\n            availability of urban services, focusing on investments to\n            provide minimum basic needs at affordable prices. Emphasis\n            will be given to alleviate sectoral and spatial investment\n            imbalances between the \"metrocore\" (Calcutta and\n            Howrah) and the remainder of the CMA, to complete and\n            complement earlier investments so that maximum benefits can\n            be derived, and to improve cost recovery and financial\n            management policies."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
