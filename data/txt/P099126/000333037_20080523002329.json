Institutional\n            Capacity Building Project for Procurement aims to improve\n            procurement outcomes as a direct result of progressively\n            establishing an improved national public procurement system\n            in Bhutan. There are three components to the project. The\n            first component is the creation of a people development\n            strategy. It focuses on establishing the benchmarks,\n            standards, and competencies required for a potential body of\n            procurement professionals and to establish a qualifications\n            and training regime to support the future development of the\n            body of procurement professionals. The second component is\n            the implementation of the people development strategy. It\n            focuses on the priorities for delivery of procurement\n            training and education. These include: (i) delivery of\n            training and education opportunities to support in-service\n            development of public servants, delivered jointly by Royal\n            Institute of Management (RIM) and the project consultants;\n            and (ii) development of teaching staff from RIM and Royal\n            University of Bhutan (RUB) by the consultants so that\n            delivery of procurement training and education can be\n            strengthened in Bhutan. Finally, the third component is the\n            mainstreaming of people development strategy: building the\n            \"body of knowledge\". It focuses on embedding and\n            mainstreaming of the people development strategy to\n            Bhutanese partner organizations. Activities will focus on:\n            (a) continued delivery of In-service training and education\n            to stakeholders delivered by RIM; and (b) starting delivery\n            of other procurement education to include pre-service\n            qualifications or modules which are integrated into the\n            RUB/Bhutanese education framework. In this final component,\n            the project will also look to develop the body of knowledge\n            and procurement practice in Bhutan through the creation of\n            networks, communities of practitioners, events, and\n            conferences focusing on key procurement topics and case studies."}, "docdt": "2008-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
