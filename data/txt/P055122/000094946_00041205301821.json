and management, through the\n            provision of training, strengthening teaching capacity, and\n            monitoring internships; 2) support district health services\n            in under-served areas, through the consolidation of health\n            services activities, with those under the Social Development\n            Action, and the Health and Safe Motherhood Projects,\n            allowing expansion of health services, and accessibility to\n            health care. This will reinforce delivery of minimum, and\n            complementary activities, supporting management, and\n            supervisory capacities, and render those currently\n            under-served health districts, operational; 3) Strengthen\n            health financing, and management in support of the\n            decentralization process. The central level capacity will be\n            reinforced, to design sector reforms, translated into\n            project-targeted areas. Community participation will be\n            developed to achieve cost-recovery, and initiate innovative\n            practices; 4) build the institutional capacity of MOPH,\n            specifically, to support the pharmaceutical, and health\n            communications policies. The AIDS control strategy will be\n            strengthened, by supporting mobilization of civil society,\n            and improving the epidemiological surveillance system, to\n            limit HIV transmission risks; and, 5) assist the government\n            in collecting socio-demographic data to improve, and monitor\n            progress in the health, and population sectors. A health,\n            nutrition, and population survey will be conducted by 2002,\n            envisaged to contribute to the 2003 census."}, "docdt": "2000-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
