The lessons\n            learned included: 1) The support of the central ministries\n            is essential for an operation with the ambition of\n            addressing the most pressing issues in a sector; 2)\n            Supervision of a broad-based sector operation should include\n            a review of budget implementation for the sector and\n            agreement on an updated Medium-Term Expenditure Framework\n            (MTEF) on an annual basis. This was not done for the project\n            under review; 3) Heroic efforts to get things done at the\n            micro level do not bring about expected results if the\n            macroeconomic and governance environment becomes\n            increasingly hostile. At the mid-term review, which took\n            place a month after the portfolio review, the Bank team\n            should have come to the conclusion that continued support to\n            the sector was difficult to justify under the unchanging\n            country circumstances; and 4) In such a challenging and\n            difficult country environment fraught with\n            governance-related issues, the design of projects should be\n            simple and well-targeted."}, "docdt": "2007-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
