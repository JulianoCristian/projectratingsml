performance.  The project\n            comprises: (a) an underground investigation program with\n            deep rock borings with corresponding instrumentation,\n            followed by high pressure injection of sealants into the\n            rock mass; (b) impermeabilization of the power plant sump,\n            construction of about 300m of additional drainage galleries\n            to evacuate filtrations by gravity flow, and plugging of the\n            diversion tunnel; (c) installation of additional electrical\n            and mechanical equipment to substantially increase service\n            reliability of the auxiliary electrical system of the power\n            plant; (d) supply and installation of new and complementary\n            instrumentation to monitor foundation pressures and water\n            filtrations; (e) consulting services to:  (i) supervise the\n            impermeabilization works; (ii) carry out a structural and\n            electro-mechanical review of the dam; and (iii) prepare an\n            emergency preparedness and evaluation plan; and (f) training\n            of ENEE staff in underground investigations, pressure\n            sealing of foundations, monitoring of hydrostatic foundation\n            pressures and water leakages in high dams and electrical\n            system stability."}, "docdt": "1992-07-10T00:00:00Z"}
