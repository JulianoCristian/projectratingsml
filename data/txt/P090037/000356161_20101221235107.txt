2.     The Project is solidly on course to achieve its Global Environmental and Project
Development Objectives, and implementation progress is satisfactory. All activities will
be completed before the closing date of December 31, 2010. The Project has disbursed
US$6.33 million (97%) of its grant proceeds as of December 1, 2010, and is expected to
disburse 100% of proceeds by closing.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to carry out a final adjustment of the
disbursement categories to allow for full settlement of outstanding commitments under
the Project. The need for the adjustment has risen as a result of recent exchange rate
fluctuations. The reallocation will allow the Implementing Agency to complete payments
for the following activities:

                                            3
   The clean-up of the 400 kW Vulcanesti transformer station site;
   Additional training to staff of the State Hydrometeo Service chemical lab
   for POPs testing and analyses;
   Additional IT equipment for the POPs sites database and PCB inventory;
   Incremental operating costs, including the project's 2010 audit.
