                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective is to protect the environment and human health by safely managing and disposing of stockpiles of POPs contaminated pesticides
                         and PCBs. The global project objective is sustainable POPs stockpiles management and strengthening of the regulatory and institutional arrangements for long
                         term control of POPs and other toxic substances in line with the requirements of the Stockholm Convention and other related conventions and protocols ratified
                         by Moldova.
