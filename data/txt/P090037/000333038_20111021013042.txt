 Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
 The develoPlllentobjective is to protect the environment and human health by safely
 managing and disposing of stockpiles of POPs contaminated pesticides and PCBs.

   The global project objective is sustainable POPs stockpiles management and
 strengthening of the regulatory and institutional arrangements for long term control of
 POPs and other toxic substances in line with the requirements of the Stockholm
 Convention and other related conventions and protocols ratified by Moldova.

 Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
 and Key Indicators and reasons/Justifications                                       .
 There were no revisions to the GEO.

  Numerical revisions to GEO indicator #1 and intermediate indicators (10) #1 and#2
 were made after site excavations revealed smaller numbers than original estimates.

Persistent Organic Pollut~ts,(POPs)pos¢aPimmediate threat to t;beenvironment and human
health in Moldova. POps .possesstoxicchal'acteristics which 'lU"~perslstent,accumulate in the
fatty tissues of most living organisms, are prone to long-range trartsboundarytransport, and are
likely' to cause significant adverse human health or environmental effects near to, and distant
from; their soUrces.        .      '.' .                           .      '

Due to POPs' persistence and propensity to cross..,bordet movement, countries have sought
multinational cooperation to. address the.challenge. The Stocl$olIIi Convention' on Persistent
Organic Pollutants seeks to eliminate a group of 12 POPs. Under the Convention, which entered
into force on May 17,2004, andwasratifled by Moldova by Law No. 40-XV on February 19,
2004,par1ies .are required to develop implementation pltms to indicate how they will meet their
obligations under the Convention. In 200J, Moldova requested from the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) financial assistance in fulfilling its Stockholm Convention obligations and it
received a $410,000 GEF POPs EnablingA~tivity (EA) grant The Moldova POPs National
IIIiplementationflan (NIP) was one of the -main outp~ts of the project and was approved on
October 20, 2004. The NIP identified the POPs «liemicals of concern in Moldova as being
stockpiles of obsolete pesticjdes and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) contained in electrical
equipment, primarily capacitors.                         '                             .

It is estimated that between the 19SQsand 1990s560;000 tons of pesticides were u$e<ltUn
M~ldovan agriculture including 22,000 tons of organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs).~il
samples taken from 1976-1990 showed pesticide contamination levels exceeding the maxitntlm
allowable concentration (MAC) frqm five times in the Southern zone. to 50 times' in the Central .
2;one of the cOUlltty.Further' tests conchuledthepresence of DDT in 60% of soil samples,
exceeding the MAC, despite DDT's prohibition in .1970. Subsequenttesting:of pesticide residues
in crops(1990-1995) further. Ct)Dfirmed the situation ::.- with residuals found in 56.4% oqomato
samples and 40%' in grapes.      .      .

Stockpiling of now banned and useless Pesticides collectively referred to as "obsolete"pesticides
is a$ignificantPOPs issue. In the abseIl,ce ofan obsolete pesticic.les management strategy, over
the years, significant amounts of obsolet~\pesticides have been stockpiled innumerous
warehouses on an ad hoc basis - with deteriorating . conditions taking their toll on packaging
material. In addition, obsolet¢ pesticides yvere often indiscriroin2ttely mixed resulting in a mixture
of POPs with non~POPS pesticides: Sampling analysis reveale4that the average amQunt of POP
pesticides out ofthe total stopkof obsolete pesticides is about 20 .. 30%. There are approximately
3,000 tOilS of obsolete pesticides stored in warehouses in Moldova. Studies have shown
conclusively that these materials have contaminated the sites and sU1TQuuding.soilsand nearby
surface waters~

In November 2003, the Ministry of Defense (MOD) and the State Department for Emergency
SItuations (SDES) initiateda' consolidation of.obsolete pesticides from 344 warehouses to 37
centralized district storage facilities. one in each of·the administrative c.listricts. This ~ffort was a
necessaryflrshtep; but did n()tad<iress the longer-term solution of disposal;,                       .

The second major source of POPs in Moldova was concentrated in electrical power equipment in
the energy sector - specifically in PCB-containing dielectric oils in capacitors and transformers.
Most of this equipment was out of use but still in place. The main pathways of environmental
pollution were from oil spills and leaks from electrical equipment, including from corroded
capacitors leaking to the soil below the capacitor batteries. Approximately 20,000 PCB-
containing capacitors (with a total weight of 1,060 tons), unused and referred to as "discarded,"
were located in 20 electrical substations throughout the country but most (12,000) were at the
Vu1canesti Power station with two dumps containing approximately 1,000 broken capacitors
each. The total PCB content in the 20,000 capacitors was estimated to be 380 tons. Analysis
determined very high levels of PCB contamination at the capacitor sites primarily at Vu1canesti
where the 10,000 m2 of soil underneath this assemblage, to a depth of 60 cm, was found to be
contaminated with PCBs.

Rationale for Bank involvement

As a GEF Implementing Agency the Bank has a responsibility to help its client countries achieve
the glohal environmental objectives that are supported by the GEF. TheGEF is the interim
financial mechanism of the Stockholm Convention and the Project would contribute significantly
to achieving the objectives of the corresponding GEF Operational Program for Reducing and
Eliminating Releases of Persistent Organic Pollutants (OP 14). At the time of appraisal, the Bank
had been very active in supporting Moldova in improving its environmental management
capabilities and in incorporating environmental and social concerns into its sector operations. The
project's objectives were consistent with the Bank's Environment Strategy and 2005 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Moldova - which focused on improving people's quality of life,
quality of economic growth, 'and quality of regional and global commons. The Bank's technical
knowledge on POPs management and its experience in the design and implementation of GEF
investment projects gave it a comparative advantage among the GEF Implementing Agencies in
providing this assistance.


1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The main development objective was to protect the environment and human health by safely
managing and disposing of stockpiles of POPs contaminated pesticides and PCBs.

The global project objective was sustainable POPs stockpiles management and strengthening of
the regulatory and institutional arrangements for long term control of POPs and other toxic
substances in line with the requirements ·of the Stockholm Convention and other related
conventions and protocols ratified by Moldova.

To track the progress. toward achieving this development objective, the project used four key
results indicators as summarized below:

   (i) Reduced risks of POPs environmental pollution to human health by safely storing and
             disposing of stockpiles of POPS contaminated pesticides and PCBs
   (ii) Destruction of 1,060 tons of PCB-containing capacitors and 1,150 tons of POPs
             containing and contaminated obsolete pesticides
   (iii)Modern regulatory system established within Moldova for the management and control
             of POPs and other toxic and harmful chemicals and wastes
   (iv) Institutional and human capacities for enforcement of the POPs regulatory framework
             arid for sustainable POPs stockpiles management strengthened

1.3 RevisedGEO(as apprt1\1edby tJriginaJ approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/Justification               .

The GEO was n.ot revised.

GEO indicat.or #1 and Intennediate.outc.ome indicat.ors #1 and #2: Only 16,897 capacitors were
destr.oyed since the indicator .of 17,300 was based on estimates. Also, excavations at the
Vulcanesti Power Stati.on revealed .only 1,759 capacitors were buried after the.tw.o expl.osi.ons in
1974 and 1978, which was less than the estimate of 2000 capacitors. Thus the total am.ount of
PCB-c.ontaining equipment was 937.5 t.ons inStead .of the estimate.of 1,060 tons .

.1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The primary beneficiaries identified at appraisal were: .

(i) Local: appr.oximately 150,000 people living in the vicinity of POPs sites and those empl.oyed
    andw.orking in the vicinity .of PCB c.ontaminati.on at powerstati.ons (it sh.ould be als.o n.oted
    that the number . .of pe.ople professi.onally and directly exposed. t.o pesticides at w.ork was
    estimated t.o have fallen from 34,700 in 1993 t.o 8,800 in 2002); als.o farmers, industry
    empl.oyees and th.ose responsible for the disposal and collection of waste;

(ii) Regional and global commons: reduced polluti.on of water supplies; reduced pesticides and
     PCBs entering regi.onal and gl.obalf.ood chain through s.oil c.ontamination; reduced impacts .on
     land, biodiversity, trans..;boundary~aterc.oursesandinternational waters; and

(iii) Government of Moldova: Ministry .of Ecol.ogy and Natural Res.ources (MOE), the State
      EcolDgical InspectDrate (SEI) and natiDnallabDratDries of SEI, Ministry of Health (MOH)
      and the State Hydi'DmeteDrDIDgical Service.                                         .

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1. Management and Destruction of POPS (US$8.23 m, .of which GEF US$3.79
m) This cDmponent was tD identify, manage and ultimately eliminate obsDlete pesticide stDckpiles
and PCB-cDntaining capacitDrs currently posing envirDnmental and human health risks. This
compDnent included 2 sub-compDnents:

(iJ Sub-component 1.1. Destruction of Stockpiles of pOPs Containing and Contaminated·
     Obsolete Pesticides (US$5.37 m, .of which GEF US$1.21 IIi) .This sub-component was to
     finance the incineration of approximately 1,150 t.ons of stockpiled .obsolete pesticides (.out .of
     a tDta13,000 tDns). NATO was tD co-finance this sub-cDmpDnent and would seek additiDnal
     financing to disP.ose .of the remaining DbsDletepesticides (abDut 1,950 tons). Warehouses··
     were pri.oritized in terms of the risk they. w.ould pose to the envirDnment and humans in the
     case .of leakages. The project was to f.ocus on the disposai .of .obsolete pesticides stDckpiles at
     10 sites ranked highest. in terms of risk t.o the environment and human health. It was
    .anticipated that as additi.onalfunds became available, the risk ranking w.ould continue tD be
     used to priDritize stDckpiles f.or disposal (see Annex 4 ofPAD). Local public auth.orities were
     responsible for supervising warehouses containing obSOlete pesticide stockpiles.

          closed containers (approximately III tons); and (iii) destroy 19,300 capacitors and
          up to 50 tons of highly polluted soil (approximately 1,060 tons) by incineration .

       .c. ActivitY 3. Feasibility Study oj Site Clean-up at Vulcanesti Substation (US$0.29 m, of
           whichGEF US$0.24 m) This activity was to finance a study to assess the technical,
           financial and environmental feasibility of different remediation approaches and
           recommend a least cost solution.

Component 2. S~engthening,the R~gulatory Framework and Capacity Building for POPs
Management (US$2.32 m, of which GEFUS$1.27 m) This component was to modernize current
legislation specifically related to the Stockholm Convention and incorporate provisions for
establishing a broader chemical safety approach in the country based on EU directives. Full
transposition of all relevant EU legal acts was to be achieved.

(iJ Sub-component 2.1: Modification of the Regulatory Framework/or POPs Management
   (US$0.74 m. of which GEF USSO.61 m) This sub-component was to provide a legal basis for
   POPs chemical management under Stockholm Convention requirements and set-up an overall
   chemical safety system in Moldova according to the EU regulation and .legislation .related to
   handling of dangerous chemical substances and hazardous waste.·1t was to develop an
   integrated system of POPs management through the following three activities:




                                               4
       a .. Activity 1. Assessment of Existing Legislation Regarding Compliance with EU
            Regulations (US$0.25 m, of which GEF US$0.21m) This activity was to finance a
            gap analysis comparing· EU legislation and Convention requirements with existing
            legislation in Moldova and prepare· a· Table of Concordance in relation to
            international obligations for POPs, hazardous wastes and dangerous substances.

       b. Activity 2. Assistance in Drafting of Relevant Regulations and Instructions (US$0.25
          m, of which GEF US$0.21 m) This activity was to prepare national legislation by:
          strengthening the chemical safety management system in Moldova; clearly defming
          responsibilities; specifically prohibiting production and use of POPS chemicals and
          regUlating theirexportlimport; and providing a legal basis for reduction/elimination
          of unintentional releases from production processes. Legal provisions would cover:
          (i) POPs contaminated site management issues; (ii) responsibility for POPs
          contarninatedsites; (iii) incot:poration of POPs monitoring and reporting; (iv)
          assessment of new chemicals meeting POPs criteria; (v) Best Available Techniques

          US$0.19 m) This activity was to finance thedevelopme.nt of specific implementing
          regulations (by-laws) and instructions. Regulations and instructions would be
          prepared based on EU legislation.

(ii) Sub-component 2.2. Capacity Building (US$1.58 m, of which GEF US$0.66 m) This sub-
   component was to strengthen government and laboratory capacity through the following three
   activities:

       a. Activity 1. Strengthening of Inspectorates for Enforcement of pOPS Regulations and
          Prevention of Further Accumulation of pOPs stockpiles (US$0.25 m, of which GEF
          US$0.19 m) The goal of this activity was to increase the skills of key inspectors in
          government agencies who will be dealing with the enforcement of regulations
          developed under sub-component 2.1.

       b. Activity 2. Upgrading and Strengthening of Existing Laboratories for POPs Analysis
          (US$1.23 m, of which GEF US$0.47 m) This activity was to finance upgrading of the
          laboratories of SEI, Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Hydrometeorological Service
          for POPs detection in different media; and support the regulatory requirements for
          reporting, management and control of POPs at national and intemationallevels. This
          activity was to be co-financed by NATO's "NATO Science for Peace: Development
          of Modem Analytical Approaches for POPs Investigation Project."                  .

      c. Activity 3. Prevention of Accumulation of New Stockpiles of Obsolete Pesticides
         (US$0.11 Q1, of which GEF US$O.OO m) This activity was to address ongoing
         obsolete pesticide issues by promoting best practices in pest management in. crop
         production, including integrated pest management (IPM) - based on careful
         integration of a number of available pest control techniques. The project would
         benefit from two related agricultural extension projects- the World Bank Rural
         Investment and Services Project (RISP) II and theMilieukontakt Oost-Europa (Dutch
         Environmental NGO) Project, "Elimination of acute risks of obsolete pesticides in
         Moldova, Georgia, and Annenia."

        d. Activity 4. POPs Awareness and Educational Activities (US$0.62 m, of which GEF
           US$O.l~ m) This activity was to build on the findings ·of the social assessment (SA)
           conducted during preparation, which revealed a very lowawareness of POPs-related
           issues. The goal of this activity was to create a communications framework for POPs
           and other chemicals and to improve awareness of the Moldovan public regarding
           POPs sources and, effects through awareness building activities,· as well as training
           and education oftarget groups with higher exposure to risks.      .

    the MOE in carrying Qutproject management functions of financial management,
    procurement, auditing, monitoring and evaluating project implementation, and·dissemination
    of project results. The PMT had originally been foooed to support preparation oftheGEF-
    supported NIP. This group ,also helped oversee project preparation with support from Ii GEF
    PDF B Grant. The PMT included a Project Manager, an assistant, a procurement specialist
    and a part-time fmancial'managementldisbursement specialist.·The PMT staff was to remain
    the same under implementation.


1.6 Revised Components

Please refer to Section 1.3 on the revision of destruction targets.

Sub-component 1.2, Activity 2. Destruction of a Stockpile of Obsolete Capacitors. The Proje¥t
planned for the' incineration of approximately 50 tons of contaminated soil from Vulcanesti
station prior'to the clean-up feasibility study for the station. However,the study indicated that the
total quantity of soil contaminated with PCBs above 50 ppm was more than 3,000 tons, far above


                                                  6
    .the plannea'SQ tons. It was decided that the· best· temporary solution was to store the. soil in
     cofferdams built on the territory of the station. Thesqlution was. considered as the most feaSible
     from technical, eco!lomic an~envitOntnental points o/view. The··coffetdams were cQvered with a
     protection layer to avoid any Potential dispersal. The Project applied this solution for two of the
     pits after excavating cap~citors. Moldelectricawas tOIlPplythesame technology to the other two
     remaining pits. The feasibility study also measured PCB pollutiQn levels after the elimination of
     capacitOrs and provided recommendatic:)Os for their Clean-up. 10 this instance,.the Project diverged
     from the original proposal, but adapted to the situation on the ground and identified the best
     feasible solution to solve the soil contamination issue.

    Sub-component 3,1; Institutional Strengthening, Activity 1. POPs Information Management and
    Reporting System and Activity 2.. POPs Monitoring Network. These two activities were modified
    from the original plan of a 'fully-developec:i software and hardware architecture' owing to time
    constraints and recognizing the delicate political situation in the country in 2010.(Le. potent~ally
    leading to delays in implementation). Activities were scaled down to the conceptual development
    of the necessary platform architecture that can subsequently be supported for implefuentation
    with funding from MOE's own resources.

    1.7 Other significant changes

  Canadian Grantfor the Remediation of POP Pesticide Polluted Areas and Clean-Up o/,PCB
· Contaminated Oil in Power Equipment. The. project was catalYtic in leveraging additional
  resources and fostering international cooperation as evidenced through securing, in 2007, a grant
  from the Canadian POPs Trust Fund to implement.capacity building activities for identifying and
  implementing cost-:efficient Best Available Techniques (BATs),for remediation of areas polluted
 with POPs pesticides, and ch:aningof PCB contaminated oU.the total amount of the grant was
 CAD$ 646,25,0 (US$ 642,825): Activities suppoI1ed by the. grant enhanced the development
 impact of the Proje~tby complementing ongoing activities and provided an· opportunity for
 piloting new or alternative technologies. Specifically, the grant supported: (i) the implementation
 of demonstration pilots for .the clean-up of pesticide contaminated sites in three rural areas, under
 different initial conditions, applying bioremediation and coffer-dam isolation; (ii) additional PCB
 sampling; and (iii) awareness and information raising. activities on pesticide clean-up options.

Two minor restructurings (reallocations) were undertaken during the' final year of implementation
- one project extension from May 31, 20J 0 until December 31, 2010 with a reallocation of grant
proceeds and another reallocation of grant proceeds on December 13, 2010:

May 20, 2010: The reallocation was necessary to allow for scaling up of a number of project
activities using existing project savings. Morespecifically, the Government of Moldova requested
the reallocation of proceeds for the following activities:

•      The clean-up of the 400.kV Vulcanesti transformer station site;
•      Expanding POPs communication and awareness raising activiti.es wider Component 3;
•      Additional training for staff of the State Hydrometeorological Service chemical lab for POPs
       testing and analysis;
•      Additional IT equipment for the POPs sites database and PCB inventory; and
•      Incremental operating costs, including the project's 2010 l:!.udit.
                                    . "'
December 13, 2010: The reallocation wa,s necessary. to carry out a final adjustment of the

 2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

 2.1 Project Preparation, De~ign and Quality at Entry

  Project background analysis was generally adequate. Background preparation benefitted from
  previous efforts under the National Implementation Plan (NIP), information from stockpile
  consolidation by the MODIS DES in 2003 and a thorough Environmental Assessment. Together
  this gave a more accurate picture of the extent and severity of the problem and led to the
  prioritization of 10 of the highest risk obsolete pesticide sites among the 37 consolidated
  warehouses (Telenesti, Briceni, Hincesti, Cimislia, Floresti, Riscani, Straseni, Stefan-Voda,
  Nisporeni, and SoIdanesti rayon warehouses). These 10 represented about 30% of the total stock
  of obsolete pesticides. The Bank also drew extensively from international experience in safe
  disposal, transport and mitigation methods of POPs (e.g., Stockholm Convention. and guidelines
  under the ED 'waste Directive), and previous POPs disposal projects such· as those under the well-
  known Africa Stockpiles Programme. For PCB inventorying the Bank modified a UNEP
  Chemicals survey form to be filled out by equipment holders, ·which complemented information
  collected under NIP preparation, leading to a focused capacitor disposal strategy. Participatory
. processes, including those for the EA., ~lsobuilt on the nation-wide information campaign
  initiated urider.the NIP - including several stakeholder workshops in the 32 administrative units
  with discussions on "POPs and Human Health". A public survey was also undertaken, focusing in
  affected areas, which revealed ch~ar support for the proposed cleanup activities.

 The Project retlectedon severallessons·learned to be incorporated into its design:

 Keep the design o/the project simple. The logistics of POPs disposal, from "cradle to grave" was
 complex and thePMT considered keeping many of these responsibilities under one large contract
 to attract the most bidders and to realize potential cost savings. While these predictions largely
 came true, there were some delays in the first year of procurement from the Governnient side due



                                                  8
to the lack of experience in developip.g large, complex Terms of· Reference, e~pecially for
operations in areas that were new to the MOE.

Settingup ofthe project management arrangements. Contrary to the Governments' lack of
experience inlieveloping large. and complex operations, the Project'did benefit from the (re-)use
of PMT staff frotntheNIP' s preparation. The procurement issue appears to have stemmed from a
lack of experience in specialized disposal operations~        .

Early start on regulatory reform process. Previous experience in the region with slow regulatory
refonn led the Bank. team to recommend MOE to fast-track initiatives under Component 2.
Despite this, several reforms remained in draft and were not fully enacted by Project closing.
Partial explanation can be attributed to the three elections in 18 months and three Ministerial
changes in the MOE during Project implementation.

Involvement of local stakeholders. Widespread government and local support for the project was
culminated early on through previous information campaigns under NIP, but also from the
extensive consultations with stakeholders during the Environmental and Social Assessments. The
Project also created localliiitiative Groups in the rayons where repackaging of POPs pesticides
occurred: Stefan-Voda, Hincesti, Cimislia, Orhei (Pelivan), Riscani, Floresti, Soldanesti, Briceni,
Comrat and Dubasari (Cosnita).                                   .

The rationale for Bank intervention was sound. The World Bank was a logical partner in the
project given its relationship with the GEF and previous project experience in POPs management
and destruction (e.g. China, Africa, Belarus, among others). There were also positive synergies
with ongoing World Bank projects in Moldova such as the IDA-funded Energy II project which
supported upgrading of laboratory equipment for identifying PCBs (a completnentary activity
with this project), and the Rural liivestment and Services Project (RISP) which provided credits
for rural advisory services on pesticide use itf agriculture, a.s well as the GEF Agricultural
Pollution Control Project which supported enyironmehtallyfriendly agriculturaipractices by
farmers and agro-:-industry.      .

 Project design was generally sound. Project objectives drew on the best available estimates for
 obsolete pesticide stockpiles from previous MOD. consolidation efforts apd equiptnent
.information from the energy sector. The EA was also used to confinn these estimates and to
 derive further confidence in the numbers finally set. The survey instruments as part of
 Component 1.2 provided further support 'to extent of PCB-containing equipment. These early
 actions also helped ~et geographical and logistical priorities.

A considerable effort was initially given to gauging possible storage and destruction alternatives
(both local. and regional). Storage options received a fairly high discount as it was perceived to'
only avoid an inevitable disposal problem in the future. Further' centralization of POPs was
publically unpopular and· considered environmentally risky in terms of accidental release. Iii
terms of destruction options local initiatives were either too costly or unfeasible due to the lack of
adequate incineration technologies.

The extent of legislative refoi"m anticipated under Component 2 could be considered ambitious
given Moldova's rather vague waste and chemical legislation at the time and in particular the lack
of POPs' mention in any law. This risk was identified during preparation and from previous
lessons learned, however what was not foreseen was' the domino effect these activities would
have on training and institutional capacity building. activities in. the . absence of finally-enacted
legislation (also See assessmentofrisk,s below). This resulted in the project's downgrade in 2009.


                                                 9
TheG()Verh",e1'lt~s comnlilment was. high as demonstrated through its ratification of the
StockholmC:onvention. Further cotnmitment was Shown through the Ministry's (MOE) creation
of the National Coordinating Committee (Nee) in charge of implementing the Stockholm
ConventIon and Natiorial Implementation Plan for POPs and an Evaluation Cominittee
(Ministry's Decision no. 56 from November 5, 2004). The NCC was chaired by the Minister of
MOE and included 10 additional memberS: representatives from Parliament; MOE; Ministries of
Agriculture and Food h1:dustry, Energy, Finance, and Health; the Academy of Science; and
envirorimental NOOs.

Ongoing consolidation efforts. continued under the Ministry of ,Defense (MoD) and the State
DepartmentfofCivil Protection and Emergency Situations (DES). By 2005, more than 1,700 tons.
of ()bsolete pesticide materials were repackaged an9 stored from seven counties (territorial-
administrative entities) out Of a total of 37 counties in Moldova. lri another 14 counties, the
National Army together with DES began repackaging. Thegovemment also committed resources
from the World Bank Energy II project (US$O.2million for activities related to PCBs disposal in
the energy sector).        .         ,

Project~related commitments during Negotiations included the Government of Moldova and
MOE to provide counterpart funding in2007 and 2008 in the 'amount of US$1.6 million,
including US$l.l million from the state budget and US$05 million from the National
Environment Fund (NEF). lri addition, US$0.78 million was cominitte9 for ongoing repackaging
efforts byfheMoD mentioned above~

Most risks were adequately identified and rate.d;mitigation measures were adequate.
Uncertainty of total obsolete pesticide quantities,. rated a "substantial" risk, was' effectively
mitigated by .contracting guaranteed minimumamouhts anq a cost per' ton above the minimum.
Detailed surveillance during the EA also placed greater confidence to the targets set rdative to
the overall scale of the problem. Component 2 risks on legislative reform, rated "substantial", had
adequate mitigation measures in place, but unforeseen was the slow and poor initial
cOllllllunicationbetweenthe c;onsultant hired for the component on legislative reform and the
MOE. Cumulative delays resulted in a partially completed component. .


2.2 Implementation

Project targets under Component 1, Managerrient and Destruction ofPOPs, were achieved by the
Mid-Term Review (MTR) (and exc;eeded in the case of GEOindicator #2 with 1293 tons of
obsolete pesticides destroyed). Attribution can be given to a variety of factors such as the detailed .
design at preparation, but also to the successful coordination between the MOE, MAFI, Ministry
of Defense (MOD), Ministry 'ofHealth (MOH), as well as a number ofother state agencies, 90nor
institutions and NGOs. The project alSo benefitted from the successful coordination by the NCe
as well as the day;.to-9ay projecfmanagement and coordination carried out bythePMT.

Significant delays in the implementation of sub-componeqt 2.1, Modification of the Regulatory
Framework for·POPs Management, led to the project downgrade at the MTR from satisfactory to
moderately unsatisfactory. The situation arose from. divergences between the MOE and its
consultant on the understanding Qf the assignment, and their respective roles in the process. This
was partially explained by the change in MOE's leadership at the time, but alsoiti the allocation
of insufficientMOE staffto the task. Two major activities under this SUb-component were to be
completed by August 2008, but were yet to be drafted by the end of the calen(iar year. More
specifically,.drafi legal and regulatory acts aimed at strengthening the chemical safety
management'system in Moldova - ,mainly' the Law on Dangerous Waste and the Law on
Datlgerous Chemicals ~ underwent.signifwant back-and-forth revisions causing delays in their
submission··to Cabinet ~d ultimately,. Parliament. A similtu"' delay was experienced with draft
instructions and eXplanatory notes .on: (i) the management of abandoned storehouses and
contaminated sites; (ii) the management of district storage' facilities for obsolete pesticides; and
(ii) the management .of landfills/dumpsites to minimize the formation and emissiono.f dioxins and
furans. It was of the MOE's opinion that these instructions did not correspond to Moldovan
legislative standards and requirements and considered' the work incomplete leading to further
rounds of revisions. As a consequence, extensions were necessary to ;complete the work.

Since final legislation served as an input t.o training activities under sub-c.omponent 2.2 and
Component 3, these were similarly jeopardized. Disbursements by the MTR reflected this lag in
iinplementation (PAD disbursement estimates for 2006-2008 were: US$5A million, whereas
actual disbursements as of September 30, 2008 totaled US$4.92 million).

The Bank suggested that the MOE allocate. staff to work directly with the consultant and help
better guide work acceptable to the MOE. An action plan was formulated by the MOE, PMT and
the consultant and found to be acceptable by the Bank.

There were also a fewconcems about counterPart financing from the National Ecological Fund,
however by time .of the MTR, this commitment was honored. Funds were ultimately reallocated
to other activities since the original activity under which these were to be used was completed at
the time of the .MTR (i.e. Component 1). In contrast, partner co-fmancing was received in a
timely manner and works were ongoing by theMTR (Le. NATO, Dutch Government through
Milieukontakt, the WB Energy II project). In 2007, the PMT was also successful in securing
CAD$646,250 from the Canadian. POPs Trust Fund for capacity building activities in the
identification and implementation ·.of cost-efficient BATs for remediation of areas polluted with
POPs pesticides, and cleaning of PCB contaminated oil (see also Section 1.7),

The Project also underwent two restructurings - one extension (May to December, 2010) with a
minor reallocation of grant funds and another final reallocation of grant proceeds in December,
2010. No changes to the PD~ or GEO were made.


2.3 Monitoring ~nd Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The foUr key performance indicators listed in Section 1.2 were adequate in tracking progress
towards achieving the PD~ and GEO. However,. the disaggregated indicators given in the data
sheet and tracked through the Results Framework (PAD, Annex 3) provide more detail on each of
the 4 sunimaryindicators, Those contained in the Results Framework were included in the
Supplemental Letter to the GEF Grant Agreement.     .

Design. The M&E design was well developed in the early stages of preparation, mostly due to the
uncertainty surrounding the estimated amounts of obsolete pesticides and PCB capacitors - and
how results from preliminary studies W.ould feed back into the revision of indicator targets. Data
were to be. collected through two means - the first as part of the private firm c.ontract to work
with Moldelectrica and MAPI in monitoring and supervising the packaging, transport and
ultimate destruction of materials. The second il'lformationsource was the MIS developed to
inventory PCB-containing equipment. It was also intended to monitor Project implementation and
identify areaS for corrective action when needed. The development of the POPs Information
 Management and Reporting System under sUb-component 3.1 was intended to track the life of
 POPs-coniaining substances and equipment after Project completion.

Indicators relating to target values of obsolete pesticides and PCBs under Component 1 were
realistic given existing baseline information; Howeverthe first summary indicator of 'developing
a modern regulatory system', would· have benefitted from more concrete intermediate indicators
before draft regulations and by-laws were delivered to the~OE' - and this could have triggered
red flags in the absence of progress. The final objective of having regulations in draft form may
have been more appropriate and not subject to uncertain political forces (i.e. elections,
government reshuffling, etc).

Implementation. Monitoring activities related to issues under the Stockholm Convention were
provided by the Ministry Of Environment through the National Focal Point (Convention Focal
Point, .CFP), comprising of weekly or monthly progress meetings. .Global issues were discussed
at periodic meetings of the National CoordinationComniittee. Fiduciary (financial and
procurement) activities were conducted by a member of the PMT, Who also inonitoredProject
progress set forth in the Results Agreement (PAD, Annex 3).

A substantial amount of information tracking project progress was generated during
implemenation'-most notably from the repackaging, transport and inventorying work conducted
under Component 1 activities, the regulatory gap analysis under. Component 2 and the nation-
wide public opinion survey raising POPs awareness and knowledge under Component 3. Progress
reports were generated and reviewed every 6 months by the PMT and the Bank.

Utilization. Data utilization, and its feedback into Project implementation, was crucial in
measuring progress towards the PD~ andGEO. For example, the clean-up feasibility study at the
Vulcanestisiterevealed that the total quantity of soil contaminated with PCBs above 50ppm was
more than 3,000 tons - far exceeding the initial estimate of 50 tons planned for incineration.
Alternatives were sought and 350 tons of the. most severely contaminated soil was unearthed and
stored in tWo cofferdams at the suo-station site.

2.4 Safeguard aud Fiduciary Compliance

  Financial Management. Regular financial management reviews confirmed a satisfactory
  financial management system during the Project life and compliance with the financial covenants
  of the Grant Agreement Internal controls and accounting procedures were also found to be
  satisfactory. Minor issues were raised during the 2007 Bank financial management review with
  the C 1 accounting system, which were subsequently resolved by the following supervision
  mission. Annual Project audits were unqualifi·ed (clean), with only 2 recommendations raised in
  the 2006 audit and which were immediately addressed: (i) the need to keep accounting records in
  an accouJiting system rather than in a simple cash book spreadsheet; and (ii) the need to separate
  non-project related funds from the National Ecology Fund by maintaining a separate bank
. account. Agreed counterpart financing was received in a timely fashion' and thus did not affect
  Project implementation.

Pr()curement. The PM! possess~dan experienced procurement specialist; with support from the
FM specialist and an advisor from the RISP II Project. Capacity building and training on World
Bank procurement procedures Was completed by 2005. Dailyprocureinfmt activities were
undertaken by the' project manager's assistant supported .by the procurement specialist..
Offers/proposals were reviewed and evaluated by the Evaluati<?n Committee created by MOE



                                                12
 ordinance no. 56 (Nov 5,2004) and amended by MOE ordinance tlO; 51 (Nov 7, 2008). While
 coordinating procurement issues with the World BaIik,the. ~Mt also made use of the Client
 Connection system- to aid in procurement and disbursement issues. the Procurement Plan was
 revised six times by the time of the MTR (Nov., 2008), reflecting cl;1.anges in contracts for goods
 and consulting services during Project implementation, ~rocurement post-reviews (in 2007,2008,
 2009, and two in 2010) found that procurement processes,and/or contract administration were of
 generally good to high quality, reliability, timeliness, and transparency with only minor corrective
 actions needed by the Bank~

 Disbursement. Di.sbursements were generally on time, with some lag experienced by time of the
 MTR due to delays in implementing activities under Components 2 and 3 (US$4.92 million out
 ofa projected US$5.4million). All funds were fully disbursed by Project closing.

 Environmental Assessment. For Environmental Assessment:(EA) purposes the project was rated
 "category A" due to the risks associated with handling of POPs contaminated pesticides and
 capacitors under Component 1~. Project activities eliminated ·approximately 3()% of the POPs-
 containing and contaminated pesticides held in ten warehouses and approximately 80% of the
 PCB contaminated electrical equipment in the country. These actions resulted in substantial local
 and global environmental and human health benefits. The EAconcluded that the greatest risks to
 environment and human health were the 37 centralized warehouses where obsolete pesticides
 were being stored and the Vulcanesti power substation. Risk assessments wet;e carried out at each
 of the centralized pesticide storage sites and ranked according to overall risk, including: condition
 of storage buildings; proximity to populated areas, agricultural lands, watercourses,. forest and
 pasture; "vulnerability to fl.oods; depth. to grouridwater; amount of pesticides stored; and
 availability of space for storage. An EA workshop presenting the results was held in 2005, with
 participants agreeing that .the most optimal (i.e. cost and risk minimization) solution was for the
 Project to focus on warehouses posing the highest risks and transporting them overseas for ,final
 destruction. PCB-containing capacitors at Vulcanesti were in one location, thus there was no need
 to prioritize. ,The EA also conducted soil and water analyses at the Vulcanesti Power Station and
.confirmed the extent of the contamination.

  An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was developed and attached to the Contract
  Conditions for the international contractor which carried out clean up operations. The EMP
  specified the following main mitigation activities: (i) a comprehensive POPs inventory and risk
  assessment; (ii) application and monitoring of Occupational Health, Safety, Environment (OHSE)
  requirements and international best practices; and (iii) utilization of commercially available and
  intematiomilly acceptable POPs disposal technologies. It also included generic avoidance,
  prevention, minimization, containment and mitigation, environmental due diligence,
  occupational, health safety and emergency preparedness requirements, procedures and protocols.
  An internal EMP and Environmental Management System (EMS) were also developed to ensure
  compliance with· the Project EMP and worker safety. Clean up operations were also subject to
'independent verification by a Supervising Consultant with monthly monitoring and 'compliance
 reviews.

Upon review of the monitoring reports, compliance with OP 4.01 was rated satisfactory
throughout Project implementation. A comprehensive safeguards review was completed during
the MTR (since much of Component I Was complete) and found no environmental or public
health complaints related to the Project.




                                                 13
Social S3feguards. No social safe~ards were triggered by the Project. OP 4.09 Pest
Management was not triggered since 110 Project activities were associated with the financing of
pesticides and the IPM training activities under .Component 3 were considered technical
assistance ..

2.5 Post..completion OperationINext Phase

This section discusses the sustainability and repIicability of Project interventions.

Sustainability. Project activities eliminated approximately 30% (1,293 tons) of obsolete pesticide
stockpiles and 80% of PCBs in Moldova. The Government has been negotiating with the NATO
Management and Supply Agency for the destruction of an additional 1,263 tons of obsolete
pesticides, to be· co-financed by the National Ecological Fund (see also· Annex 2 for further
cleanup activities the Project has spurred). PCB inventorying and testing was completed with
over 33,500 samples taken by Project closing .. Among those with chlorine levels above 50 ppm,
less than· 5% contained PCBs~ The PCB inventory registration system and national database will
continue with country resources. Overall, the elimination of POPs remains high on the
Government's agenda in order to be; fully compliant with its national and international
commitments.

Regulatory reform. Despite the shortfaHof regulations passing through final legislative approval,
by Project closing all 15 draft laws and regulations were complete and awaiting reviews or
submission to Cabinet or Parliament: The MOE indicated they would be hiring a local consultant
to ensure legal processing ofall draft law and regulations.

pops Monitoring and Evaluation. The POPs Pollution Database houses 1,604 geo-referenced
hotspot areas (1.5S8 old! abandoned warehouses, pesticide mixing/preparation sites and 16 PCB
contaminated sites) and can be accessed at http://pops.mediu.gov.md!. Central and local
authorities will monitor and supervise these sites for their environmental and health risks. Data
have been transferred to the MOE, and incorporated into their own IT systems with a proper
a11ocationof human and financial resources for database operation and maintenance. The MOE
confirmed the institutionalization ofthis database after Project closing.

Internalizing the POPs agenda. Continuation of the POPs agenda is imperative for ensuring the
sustainabilityof long-term Project. results; The MOE informed the Bank that· an internal· order
would be circulated, assigningtbe POPs agenda to a division within the MOE. In terms of
additional training, the MOE also indicated that it would be responsible for the repeat training of
environmental inspectors in the finally enacted legislation.


Replicability.The Project was nation-wide, but the lessons and experience leamed from the
elimination of obsolete pesticides can be replicated to address remaining stocks in the country,
and there appears to be sufficient internal momentum to do so(e.g. NATO request). Other more
recent developments also make this an imperative. Nine new POP substances were introduced at
the 4th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention and as a Party to the
Convention, Moldova will ultimately facesimilarcompIiance issues. The MOE would have a
continued agenda of drafting relevant policy documents and action plans for these new
substances, even if future inventorying does not discover presence inthe~nvironment.
                                .                                    .

Approaches in proJect design could also be replicated in other countries. Project dissemination
activities by the MOE andPMT included events vvith an international audience in Moldova,


                                                 14
Belarus, Bulgaria, Romania,Russia, the Netherlands, Ukraine, and Senegal. One notable example
was the 9th International HCH and Pesticides Forum in Chisinau (September, 2007), with
representatives from 35 countries. Project results were also disseminated internally in the World
Bank and GEF through BBLs in September, 2007 and in November, 2010. pOPs projects in the
Ukraine and Belarus are currently following the same model as Moldova's.

Proposed new GEF activity. The MOE requested further Bank support in designing and
implementing a new, possibly midium-sized GEF-finattced Project related to:

1) Develop a management information system for PCB-contarhinated equipment with volumes
greater than 5 liters. This information system would integra~e information flows between the
country's energy companies and regulatory bodies (energy and environment) responsible for the
monitoring and control of PCBs contaminated equipment;

2) Qevelop a PCB Phasy-out Elimination Plan to be in compliance with provisions of the
Stockholm Convention and other relevant international treaties and implement provisions of
Government Decision No. 81 of 02.02.2009 "On Appro-val of Regulation on Polychlorinated
Byphenils"; and

3) Establish an inventory of POPs uhintentional release, including projections and an inventory
quality assessment for implementation of Article 5 of the Stockholm Convention and other
relevant international treaties.

This new Project would be a natural follow-up activity and in line with the requirements of the
Stockholm Convention.


3. Assessment of Out£omes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

 The Project's objectives, design and implementation remain highly relevant to Moldova's
 development and environmental priorities. Pillar II of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
 2009-12 highlights the need to minimize social and environmental risks, such as those associated
 with POPs. Outcome indicator no. 11.4 sets the objective of reducing environmental degradation
and health hazards and the Project demonstrated effective and affordable measures to address
 these issues in line with the PDO and GEO. The Project is also aligned with priorities under
Moldova's National Development Strategy (NDS) which defines development objectives over the
period 2008-2011. One of the main pillars is regional development focusing on the rural poor.
The Strategy seeks to promote the development of small towns as "poles of growth"; enhance the
performance of the agricultural sector; increase investment in rural infrastructure; and improve
the policy framework in the area of the environment and natural resource use. Regulatory reform
under the Project provides a solid and sustainable foundation for chemicals management. At the
global level, the Project contributed to the fulfillment of Moldova in complying with the
Stockholm Convention on POPs, the Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary
Movements of HazardousWastes and Their Disposal, and the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior
Informed Consent Procedures, for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International
Trade and Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM). In addition,as
the GEF is the interim financial mechanism of the Stockholm Convention, the Project contributed




                                              15
to the objectives, of ~e 'OEF Operational Program for Reducing and Eliminating Releases of
Persistent OrganicPolluumts (OPI4).            '


3.2 Achievement ofGJobalEuviroumental Objectives

  A review of Project outputs against key performance indicators reveals that theGEO was
  achieved. A total of937.5 tonsofPCB"'containing capacitors and 1,293 tons ofPOPs-conta.iliing
  and contaminated obsolete pesticides were destroyed. Environmental andhuma.n health
  conditions were impn:>ved by these actions since the risk of, exposure has been significantly
, reduced or eliminated. Improvements to trans-boundary (and global) water quality is also ensured
  through the elImination of these substances and a more sustainable approach to POPs
  management. 'Prior to the p.roject, legislation on chemicals and' hazardous waste was vague,
  sparse or minima.l, with a complete absence of POPs in definition or interpretation. A total of 15
  draft laws and regulations were completed under the Project, Illthough not fully enacted through
  Cabinet or, Parliament. I Despite this, this legislation forms the legal foundation for a modern
  regulatory system for the management and control of POPs and other toxic and harmful,
  chemicals and wastes. As noted in Section 2.5 above, the Government is committed to
  completing this task - and aims to prepare for further work as the Stockholm Convention on
  POPs inGrease~its scope. Finally, ,institutional capacity ;was'Strengthenedthrough training
  activities in draft legislation, POPs monitoring and surveillance systems and analytical capacity
  (lab upgrading) ofthe State Hydrometeorological Service for POPs detection in different media
  (e.g~ soil, water). Prior to the Project no inventory or information system existed and in the case
  oflaboratories, they did not have the ability to test for the presence of POPs.


3.3 Efficiency

An incremental cost analysis (ICA) was conducted at appraisal. At the leR stage, an ex-post leA
and cost.;.effectiveness analysis were conducted (Annex 3),                           .

At appraisal, the Baseline Scenario included ongoing efforts by the MOD to repackage obsolete
pesticides and consolidation jnt037 warehouses. The cost was US$0.82 million. The GEF-
Alternative scenario included 'a more ambitious ,program to repackage 'materials, transport and
incinerate them' in an international location. PeB-containing capacitors wOldd becoilected from
power substations and from eXcavations at the Vulcanesti substation, transported and incinerated.
The Alternative ~lso included a massive overhaul of the regulatory and legislative system for
improved chemicals management, including POPs. Institutional strengthening and. capacity
building initiatives would form a solid knowledge and analytical base for contiul,ledchemicals
management. The cost of the alternative was US$12.6million of which the GEF would :finance
US$6.35 million and the remainder (US$5.44 million) from other (parallel) co-financiers. Further
details are contained in Annex 3.

Ex-post analysis indicates that the GEF-Alternative cost was US$13.41 million, inCluding
US$2.36· million in cash from Government and the National E<;ological Fund (plus US$I.36
millidn through. in-kind transfers for PCB inventorying and 20% VAT exemptions on goods and

I The Regulation on Polychlorinated Biphenyls Was approved by the Government in February 2009. The
National Programme on Sound Chemicals ManagemeIlt was approved in October201O.Three handbooks
(Environmental Sound PCB Management in Electrical Equipment, Theinventory and mapping of POPs
contaminated sites and Guide on remediation of POPs polluted sites) were developed and published.


                                                16
services), US$1.55 inillion from NATO, US$0.84 million frOin Milieukontakt' (Dutch
Environmental NOO), US$0.58 million from the Canadian CIDA POPs Trust Fund, US$0.37
million from other IDA projects (WB Energy II and RISP II), and US$6.35 million from the GEF
Grant. Project costs appear to be higher than the baseline, but many of the Projects'outputs were
scaled up as a consequence of savings early in the Project. For example, savings were redirected
toward further soil excavation at Vulcanesti beyond the revised 350 tons (in conjunction with
Moldelectrica). Thus, Project results were achieved, or exceeded, with relatively similar resources
- and the Project canbe considered efficient.

 The cost of reducing ,one ton of POPs, was approxil1i.ately US$4,183. Although this measure is
 broad and includes all of Component 1 costs (repackaging, inventorying, transport, and '
 incineration costs), when compared to average incineration costs (US$ 1,000-1 ,500Iton), it
 appears to be a cost-effective overall result.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory     ,    .

The PD~ and GEO remain highly rblevant for local and global environmental protection and in
meeting the requirements of international conventions, including the Stockholm Convention. The
PD~ wasacbjeved, and'swpassed in the case of obsolete pesticides, and the GEO was achieved
through strengthening the regulatory and institutional arrangements for the long term control of
POPs and other' toxic suhstances. Overall project costs were lower than anticipated and results
were achieved in a cost-effective manner.

In the Project's final ISR, the, Project GEO was rated satisfactory according to th~ last
implementation mission, but moderately satisfactory according to the GEO at project closin.g on
December 31, 2010 (see C3 in Data Sheet). The Bank submitted this last ISR for management
approval on December 21,2010 and it was cleared through management by December 23,2010.
Unfortunately, the system takes 10 days to post ratings, which occurred on January 2, 2011, past
the ProJect closing date of December 31,2010. Thus ,the rating difference was system-driven and
not reflective of the true status of the ProjectGEO.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts,Gender Aspects, and ~ocial Development

Not applicable.

(b) Institutiollal Change/Strengthening

The Project built and strengthened capacity at several levels. First, capacity was stren~hened at
the MOE in developing regulation and legislation that conforms to the reporting requirements of
the Stockholm COl;l.vention as well as harmonizing, chemical and waste management law with
other 'EU countries. Second" the logistics of hazardous waste disposal has been internalized and
the experience Can be drawn upon for futl,lre operations (important for remaining stocks). Third,
support to the Hydrometeorological Service for POPs detection (both training and equipment) ,
better enables authorities to test and monitor toxic, substances in different media (important for
ongoing PCB inventorying). Fourth, public awareness rose through the 'continuation of media
campaigns on the hazards ofPOPs, especially among those with a high risk of POPs exposure



                                               17
such as farmers, industry employees 'and staff of Moldelectrica (power authority). The Project
also set up a website to be used for subsequent projectS (www.moldovapops.md).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

During the SthConference ofParties of the Stockholm Cmi'vention (April 25-29, 2011) in Geneva,
implementation results over the past ten years were evaluated with the goal to set up objectives
for the next period. At this event, Moldova~s implementation'performance was highly
commended. The Republic of Moldova was able to achieve significant results in this field and
hence won two awards: the POPs Star Award for the implementation of the Convention and the
Award for the elimination of PCBs (2011 PCB Elimination Network (PEN) Award). See
http://chm. popS.intllmplementationlPCBslPCBsEliminationNetworkPEN/2011 PENAwards/tabidi
I 460/Ianguage/en-USlDefault.aspx.

3.6 Summary of Findings 'Of Beneficiary Surveyandlor Stakeholder Workshops

Several national and regional workshops w.ere conducted' during the Project - as part of the
stakeholder consultation process and raising public awareness (see Annex 2 for details). A fmal
project completion conference was held ,.on December 10, 2010, with local and international
participation. Results from the Project were presented and stimulated much outside replication
interest. National interest remainedhigh in the context of Moldova'S environmental pollution
control agenda and that more targeted support is needed to continue clean up and management of
remaining stocks.                "                              '

4. Assess'ment of Risk to Develop,ment Outcome
Rating: Moderate              '

Project outcomes are likely to be sustainable given the near completio~ of regulatory enactments.
The primary risk hindering implementation was mostly internal to the MOE or political (with
three' elections over an 18 month period) leading' to slow progress in drafting regulations. With
the bulk ·of these activities now cotnplete- the MOE will now focus on staffing the new
institutional agency dedicated to chemicals management (anticipated by '2013, after a legal
framework is established). Internal support for this was confirmed with the Minister of
Environment. As stated in Section 2.5, there is also significant interest (and obligation) to address
remaining obsolete pesticide 'stockpiles, and with the PCB' inventory nearing completion disposal
operations can target relatively few, sites.' The State Hydrometeorological, Service continues to test
oil samples for PCB content with over 33,500 samples completed (or full national coverage for
PCB-containing equipment), but State budget resources are required for a continued and
uninterrupted supply, of reagents forlabs.


5. Assessment of lJank ~nd Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory              ,

The Bank id~ntified an area of support that was and remains relevant to the Moldovan
environment, public health, as well as with the global commons (Stockholm Convention on
POPs). Project activities targeted highly priority areas identified in the NIP, and complemented


                                                 18
  ongoingclean..up aotivities by-NATO (obsolete pestioides).Outcomes (supported by a design)
. struck an appropriate balance arilong three key areas: (i) clean-up/ remediation, (ii) improving
  institutional readiness a:fid compliance with EU standards, and (iii) public consultation and
  awareness building.                                  .

 The Bank properly identified regulatory reform as a significant risk at the outset of the Project;
 and emph~ized. an early start (2005) would help mitigate some of the concern about slow
 implementation. Unforeseen political iostability and poor internal communications in the MOE
 ultimately resulted in a Project downgrade to moderately unsatisfactory, not only from slow
 reform, but also due to the inter-linkages betweeo CQmponents 2 and 3. The Bank may have set
 more modest expectation~ in terms of reform, perhaps stopping short of actual legislative
 enactment.

 (b) Quality of Supervision
 (including offiduciary and safeguards policies)
 Rating: Satisfactory           .

The Bank closely supervised Project implementation through semi-annual missions, fiduciary
review and maintained a constructive .dialogue between the PMT, the MOE" and other
stakeholders: Issues raised were addressed in' a timely manner and wete candidly reported in
official documentation. For eXaDlple,during the MTR the Bank specifically identified the
substantial problem areas within Component·2 activities, suggestedwaysthe MOE could resolve
issues including a greater allocation of staff to tasks and worked with thePMT to revise the
implementation schedule. The component was not 100% achieved by Project closing, but still led
to the eventual outcome of a modem regulatory framework for chemicals and waste management.

The Bank maintained focus on the fulfillment of Project objectives. Since the Project involved the
disposal of hazardous materials, constant supervision of safeguard compliance and worker safety
was also necessary. No accidents were reported during the entire Project period. The Bank
revised targets and developed alternative strategies in light of new information that could only be
distilled upon site remediation. For example, site excavations at Vulcanesti revealed much larger
contamination than was estimated (more than 3,000 tons of PCB soil instead of 50 tons) and the
Bank quiokly worked with the PMT to develop an alternative strategy using the knowledge
gained from the coffer.,dam pilots supported by the Canadian POPs Trust Fund (see Section 1.6).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

World Bank support. to the Government of Moldova in preparing and implementing the Project is
rated as satisfactory largely due to its relative responsiveness' to issues and adaptation to
unpredictable circumstances. Closer attention to. the arrangement of Component 2 activities
within the MOE may have miti~ated some of the delay, but ultimately one can only adjust to the
political circumstances one faces.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government strongly supported the Project and its objectives -.many of which \fere aligned
with the Stockholm Convention. For example, the National CoordinatiJig Committee (NCC)
which previously oversaw NIP developm~nt was made available for Project implementation. As

 6. Lessons Learned
Project experience highlighted the fo.lio.Wlng impo.rtance facto.rs fo.r successful and timely
implementatio.n:



                                                   20
 a) Adaptation .(0 loca/conditions: Complex clean-up operations inherently involve a certain
    amount of risk or unc~rtainty, especially in situatioas where data are sc~ce. Maintaining a
    robust set of alternatives/remediation options ~atering to different situations will help
    minimize the cost of ,surprise. The Project was able to benefit from cofferdam technology
    being piloted simultaneously at implementation for the temporary remediation of 3,075 tons
    of PCB-contaminated soil.                                                           .

 b) Promoting a comprehensive approach to POPs: In relatively sJ.l!.all countries like Moldova it
    is more productive to apply a comprehensive approach to POPs management including:
    cleanup; inventorying and monitoring; policy, regulatory and institutional issues; capacity
    building and technical strengthening; and public awareness activities. All of these contributed
    to Moldova's ability in meeting requirements under the Stockholm Convention.

c) Institutionalizing project experience: Significant capacity was built during the development
   of the l'fationallmplementation Plan. (NIP) for POPs ~ and which the GEF wisely continues
   to sponsor in countries preparing POPs projects. By maintaining the original composition of .
   the PMT from the NIP's preparation, and capitalizing on th~ information collected; the
   Project benefitted from this tremendously.                     .

d) Realistic expectations in new areas oJregult;ztion: Proj~~ts in·countries that lack key pieces of
   legislation or embark into new areas currently not covered by existing regulation should set
   realistic objectives in terms of reform. Projects that spaa across electoral dates should take
   this into consideration. Also, it is important to be cognizant of linkages between pl."oject
   components and whether the failure of one will jeopardize others.

e) Local stakeholder involvement remains a key determinant Jor. success: Local stakeholder
   involvement was necessary for receiving feedback on local site conditions and safety issues.

j)     Strong commitment oj national and local stakeholders on POPs agenda as a precondition to
       project successjul implementation: The GoMand local Councils were strongly committed
       and provided relevant resources for the consolidation (and ultimate elimination) of obsolete
       pesticides. Once· the Project identified complementary financial resources it was relatively
     . easy to go ahead with implementation as counterpart commitment and readiness were already .
       present.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by;BorrowerlImpiementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The borrower's contribution to the ICR was shared with the World Bank on March 3, 2011 and is .
reproduced in Annex 7. It provides a summary of Project experience with important assessments
of the relationships and implementing arrangements that both aided and hindered implementation.
Chief among these are the lessons learned that are reflected in the previous section.

The Ministry of Environment has examined the draft Implementation Completion Report
prepared by the Bank team and considers that it reflects fairly large project results in accordance
with the tasks·initially established. The results mentioned and conclusions presented demonstrate
that the project has achieved its objectives. More specifically; the Government's position as a
beneficiary of the project is reflected in Annex 7.

MilieukontaktOost-Europa - Dutch envirorimental NGO (since 2010, - Milieukontakt
International) worked in cooperation With the POPs Project team from the beginning.
CommuniCations were ongoing during the implementation period of Milieukontakt's project on
planning,coord!nation activities, as well asinfortning stakeholders. Milieukontakt's experience
was shared ~nd presented during events conducted by the Project. Milieukontakt's joint
agreements with'the Project were fulfilled and support was provided if needed or requested. The
Project staff was cooperative, open to dis,cussion and willing to find solutions .in different
situations.

Component 1. Management and Destruction of POPS

(i) Sub-component 1.1. Destruction of Stockpiles of pOPs Containing and Contaminated
   Obsolete Pesticides. This sub-component financed the repackaging, transport and incineration
   of. 1,293 tons of stockpiled obsolete pesticides from 13 warehouses in the II rayons of
   Telenesti, Briceni, Hincesti, Cimislia, Floresti, Riscani, Straseni, Stefan-Voda, Nisporeni,
   Soldanesti and Vulcanesti. NA TO and Milieukontakt Oost-Europe (Dutch environmental
   NGO) were co~financiers. Within the NATO Project 'the Ministry of .Defense trained
   military's staff consolidated stockpiled obsolete pesticides in 37 centralwarehouses across
   more than350 sites in the country. In 16 warehouses stockpiled obsolete pesticides were
   packed irtUN-approved drums and ready for final disposaVincineration stage. The total
   NATO Project cost for repackaging of OP waste was in amount of 850,000 Euro. This budget
   was used for purchasing packing materials, cost of services and logistics costs. Under sub-
   component 1.1 Milieukontakt Oost-Europe was responsible for inventory, collection,
   repackaging'and storage of obsolete pesticides from Hincesti rayon and transported by 'an
   international company for final disposal in France within the - GEF financed project.
   Milieukon~akt Oost-Europe used specialized military staff trained in repackaging under the
   superVision of an international consultant experienced in the management of hazardous
   waste.· This experience has been considered further the Ministry of Defense in continuing
  .works of centralization of OP waste from other' districts. Additional to the budget for
   inventory and repackaging of OP waste from Hincesti rayon, Milieukontakt Oost-Europe also
   testedclean~up technologies in one contaminated site in Hincesti rayon which cost 15,000
   Euro.                             .

   The Project's long-term catdlyticresponse:

   In the Framework ·of Development Cooperation between the Czech Republic and the
   Republic of Moldova, inF~bruary 20 II the Czech Development Agency initiated a project
   on the disposal of POPs containing obsolete pesticides. On May 4, 20 II the Memonmdum of
   Understanding between Czech Development Agency and Ministry of Environment of
   Moldova concerning' the implementation of the project "Remediation of EnvirOl;imental
   Burdens Caused by Pesticides in Moldova" was signed. The agreement provides a giant of
   500,000 Euro for the removal. of approximately 200 tOll~ of OPs from four districts of
   Moldova. The works will be Carried out in t~e period of ]une20Il - May 2012.

   Also,in order to expedite OP destruction, the Ministry of Environment has. expressed the
   willingness to co-finance with Euro 500,000 from the National Ecological Fund, in 2011,.
   2012, the evacuation and destruction of OP stockpiles, within the project finance,dNATO
   countries and implemented by the Ministry of Defense. However, given the problems
   occurred in collecting the necessary funds for such works in the NATO project, the Ministry
   of Environment is considering the· possibility to .initiate in June-July 2011 their own project
   with Euro 500,000 from National Ecological Fund for the evacuation .and destruct.ion of 200~
   230 tones of pesticides. The works would be carried out in July 2011 - June 2012.

   As. a result, these two projects would address 400-450 tones of OP from    8~ 1o storages with
   higher risks.

      In 2010 the Ministry of Environment has initiated the eollec~ion and disposal of chemical
      wastes from the' pre-:university institutions, allooating three million Moldovan Lei
      (approximately U$$ 250,000) from tI1e National Ecological Fund under the project
      "Collection, ce~tralized storage and.disposalof obsolete .laboratory chemicals from the pre-
      university institUtions- in Mol,dova". On May 3, 2011 Ministry of Environmentsigned.a
      cOl1tract witJi a German company for the collection and disposal of approximately 50 tons of
      obsolete chemicals and package in the next 10 months.

(U) Sub-component 1.2." Management of PCBs and Destruction of Obsolete Capacitor
    Stockpiles _

a.    Activity 1. Establishing an Invento,ry o/PCB Containing or Contaminated Equipment

      The initial taSk of the project was the inventory of 6,400 units of equipment. This task was
      fully met. During the project implementation this task was extended to about 30,000 units of
      equipment(in orderto cover all energy sector in the country), based on the additional funds
      allocated from National Ecological Fund and by the Canadian CIDA Trust Fund for POPs.

     The country's four energy generating companies (CET-l, CET~2, CET-Nord, HES Costesti)
     completed inventorying and sampling and presented oils to the laboratory for testing.
     Sampling and inventory from consumers of electrical equipment was also completed, Three
     distribution companies and one transportation company (Union Fenosa, RED Nord, RED
     Nord-Vest and Moldelectrica,) continue the inventory w~th funding from sources mobilized
     by' the Project (Canadian POPs Trust Fund and" the National Ecological Fund) and are
     expected to be complete before the end of 20 11. The total number of samples taken will reach
     n~~                                            ,
     Within the generation, transportation and distribution sectors, and large consumers the PCB
     inventory have been undertaken by the companies trained staff based on the provided
     equipment for sampling ,and screening of electrical oil sampled from the electrical equipment
     owned by companies from the energy sector (generation, transportation and distribution). In
     case of small consumers who own electrical equipment the PCB inventory process was
     organized by the Energy Inspectorate and three mobile units paid from the Canadian CIDA
     POPs Trust Fund and equipped with vehicles and sampling equipment procured part from
     National Ecological Fund and part from the CIDA POPs Trust Fund.

     The PCB approach as well as 6,400 units of sampling equipment and one screening unit was
     procured from the GEF sources. Additional to this three more pieces of screening equipment
     and 28,000 sampling kits were procured through CIDA and the National EcologicalFund to
     ensure a national' PCB invent()ry. One screening center is located within SE Moldelectrica
     and is the national comp~y responsible for electricity transmission from the generation
     sector to distribution. The second and third are placed within the distribution sector (one
     covering RED Nord, RED Nord-Vest, CET-Nord,HES Costesti and one covering Red Union
     Fenosa) and the fourth are located in, the State Hydrometeorological Service which is
     responsible for screening of electrical samples tak~rifrbm. consumers and other owners of
     electrical equipment.                                     .

     All 'falserpositive' samples (concentration of chlorine more than 50 ppm have been analyzed
     by a gas chromatograph-mass. spectrometer (GC-MS) method in' order to identify the exact
     content of PCB) have been processed by the State Hydrometeorological Service which was
     equipped with proper equipment purchased within the GEF financed project.


                                               25
     By December 2010, in total 25,193' pieces of electrical equipment were sampled and screen
     tested for Chlorine out 0'£32;170 declared units within the Energy and distribution sectors,
     includirtgconsumers. From the 25,193 screened - 2,280 samples indiCated Chlorine levels of
     JllOi'e than 50 ppm.. From the' 2,280 false positives, 1,177 were analyzed for content of PCB
     using tile GC-MS methOd which indicated that in 181 samples the PCB level shown was over
     the limit of 50 ppm. The difference of 7,577 electrical units are to be sampled and screened
     during 2011 as long as for sampling purposes these transformers could be disconnected in
     line with a National Plan which is coordinated with all Moldovan authorities due to their
                               .                                                        .

     usage in the Energy Sector (the majority are from the transmission sector owned by
     Moldelectrica).                                              '

 b. Activity 2. Destruction of a Stockpile of Obsolete Capacitors The Project objective called for
    the destruction of 1,010 tons of PCB contaminated obsolete capacitors (17,300 from a
    number of selected sub-stations and some 2,000 from two burial pits at the Vulcanest
    substation), and; excavation and shipment for destruction of 50 tons of PCB contaminated
    soil. Activities under the sub-component commenced in October, 2006 and were fuIiy
    completed by October, 2007. The activity resulted in a full removal of PCB contaminated
    capacitors from the project sites, although quantitatively below initial estimates, due to
    smaller de-facto quantities of capacitors at the sites,' All in all, the sub-component effected the
    destruction of 937.5 tons of PCB contaminated capacitors (18,656 units); including 84.5 tons
    (1,759 capacitors) unearthed from four burial pits irtVulcanesti.                           .

'c. Activity 3. Feasibility Study of Site Clean-up at Vulcanesti Substation This activity was to
    finance a study to assess the technical, financial and environmental feasibility of different
    remediation approaches and recommend a least cost solution.                     .

     The original proposal was to unearth, transport and incinerate 50 tons of highly PCB
     contaminated soil. The feasibility study provided by the international consultant and upon
     excavation of capacitors from the 4 pits, the amount of contaminated soil was found'to be
     higher - 350 tons. Therefore the' .international consultant recommended isolating the
     contaminated soil in a cofferdam. These works were completed by the international company,
     after excavating capacitors (two cofferdams). All expenses were covered by the Project

     In the summer of 2010, based on the project savings and other means allocated by
     Moldelectrica, further works were initiated and completed ·i?Y December 20 I 0 .at Vulcanesti
     station, which consisted in the.removal of contaminated soil layer below the capacitors (2;725
     tons from O.9ha area), its isolation in two cofferdams, and a land cover with clean soil and
     planting trees. Together with the 350 tons from 2007, there is now 3,075 tons of PCB-
     contaminated. soil in foUr cofferdams.

 Component 2. Strengthening the Regulatory Framework and Capacity Building for POPs
 Management This component was to modernize current legislation specifically related to the
 Stockholm Convention and incorporate provisions. for establishing a broader chemical safety
 approach in the country based on EU directives. Full transposition of all relevant EU legal acts
 was to be achieved.

 (;J Sub-component 2.1: Modificadonofthe Regulatory Framework for pOPs Management
     This sub-component was to provide a legal basis for POPs chemical management under
     Stockholm Convention ·requirements and set-up an overall chemical safety system in
     Moldova according to the EU regulation and legislation related to handling' of dangerous

   chemical$ubstances andchazardous waste. It was to develop ~ .integrated system of POPs
   managementthrough the following three activides:
                          .,                             ".    ..    .

a. Activity 1. As.sessmentofE~isting Legislation Regarding 'Compliance with EU Regulations
    The Legal. (Tap Analysis Report summarized findings· and· recommendations. for amendments
  . to the existing legislation and/or new legislation,- indicating the scope of such new
    provisions.

   Most significant gaps

   The review of the Moldova chemicals and waste legislation shows that no adequate general
   framework, for chemicals management exists with many legal gaps regarding basic elements
   of chemical life-cycle legislation. The most important shortcomings 'are:

       •   No re~lat01'Y. framework for POPs;
       •   Lack of classification and adequate packaging .and labeling requirements for
           dangerous substances;
       •   Lack of regulatory framework to take decisions, e.g., registration, bans, restrictions;
       •   Gaps in basic asp~cts of waste management, e.g. absence of key definitions and
           principles and no legislation on specific waste streams or specific waste operations.

   Furthermore the distribution of competences among different institutions is confusing and in
   some cases inadequate - nor is there any guarantee that all issues are adequately addressed.
   Moreover; there is no clear allocation of responsibilities on operators .(importer, producer and
   holder). Finally no inter-ministerial coordination mechanism has been established to allow
   cooperation and exchange·· of information between the different institutions .and bodies in
   charge of chemicals management implementation and enforcement. However, inter-
  .ministerial coordination experien<:e exists in pesticides and POPs.

   Proposed changes in legislation

   Develop a framework Law on Dangerous Chemicals and a Law on Hazardous Waste, with a
   view to increase consistency and simplification of the legal framework for hazardous
   chemicals IiUld waste, including POPs management. It was to be supplemented by a limited,
   number of Regulations (Governmental decisions); Some changes in existing instruments were
   also recommended.

   The analysis and recommendations for legislative changes .looked at how amendments to the
   existing Moldovan legislation and new primary legislation should be developed to: '

       •   Ensure compliance with the pOPs related . requirements set out itJ. the four
           international treaties to which Moldova is a Party; and
       •   Transpose those related EO requirements which are relevant and realistic in a
           Moldovan context in order to ensure implementation in practice.

  By the end of November, 2007, the MOE and the consultant completed a gap analysis of
  pertinent national legislation in the run-up to the preparation of a Legal Development Plan. A
  table of concordance was prepared which· put the analysis of Moldovan legislation in the
  context of international legal practices in the field of POPs. A participatory consultative
  prpcess involving key stakeholders was organized to debate 'anq finalize the Legal

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
An incremental cost analysis (lCA) was conducted at appraisal as per GEF requirements. This
Annex reviewstheICA against Project implementation results.

Incremental Cost Analysis

a) ICA at Appraisal

The ICA compared the baseline scenario with the GEF-Alternative scenario. The baseline
included a single activity of repackaging obsolete pesticides - an initiative that the Government
had been pursuing at the time of appraisal through the MOD. Its anticipated cost was U8$0.82
million. The EA confirmed substantial cross contamination of POPs and non-POPs hence the
GEF-Alternative includedre~packaging these contents in specialized containers.

* Including physical and price contingencies.
** The first three activities comprise Component I costs and were summed.

The GEF-Alternative scenario, at an incremental cost of U8$I1.8 million of which the GEF
would finance US$6.35 million, would support:

     1) The repackaging, transport and destruction of 1,150 tons of POPs-containing obsolete
       pesticides held in 16 storage sites (of which the GEF would finance the destruction of
       about 500 tons);
    2) Dismantle 17,300 obsolete capacitors and excavate 2,000 capacitors (about 1,060 tons)
       buried in two pits, package, transport and incinerate along with about 50 tons of highly
       polluted soil from the Vulcanesti substation;
    3) Carry out a feasibility study to determine the least-cost method of decontaminating PCB-
       contaminated soil at the Vulcanesti substation;

        4) Upgrade the regulatory system for POPs management and control as well as for other
           toxic substance according to the Stockholm Convention; inventory all PCB-contaminated
           equipment with the provision of test kits and upgrading laboratories for accurate analysis
           of PCBs;
        5) Strengthen MOE capacity for monitoring and control of POPs with modem MIS
           capabilities linked to other government agencies, private and public enterprises and
           institutes and through the internet for public access; provide training in ministries and
           departments responsible for the monitoring and control of POPs; and
        6) Project management through the PMT in the MOE to meet the fiduciary requirements of
           the GEF/ World Bank.

    Assumptions on the precise amounts in the first two activities were based on surveillance during
    the EA and consolidation activities conducted by the MOD. Final targets were later refined after
    excavation and accurate weighing for transport and incineration.

    b) ICA at Completion

Project results were achieved, and exceeded in some cases; with an incremental cost ofU8$12.63
million including the GEF Grant ofUS$6.35 million. From a cost-efficiency standpoint the
Project can be rated highly satisfactory.

c) Cost-effectiveness Analysis

Although POPs destruction projects have more than a decade of history in implementation, cost
comparisons are problematic due to vastly different transport, storage .and· incineration costs -
especially across different POP substances. However what is more· alanning is the lack of
reporting using some measure of effectiveness such as cost/ton. In this Project, it is also a
challenge to derive such a measure due to: 1) cross contamination of POP and non-POP
pesticides, and 2) separating the PCB weight from the capacitor weight. Crudely speaking, the
cost/ton of POPs eliminated was approximately US$4,183/ton (calculated as: (US$9.33 million
for Component 1)/(1,293 tons of obsolete pesticides +,937.5 tons of PCB-containing capacitors).
This cost includes repackaging, transport, and incineration (plus inventorying). While it is not
possible to benchmark this result with other projects - prices for high temperature incineration of
high-ha10gen solids (e.g. pesticides) using commercially available technologies average
US$I,OOO-1500/metric ton. 2 If approximately one-quarter of total costs is for incineration - this
appears to be cost-effective for a nation-wide program.

1.1       Project Objectives

The main development objective of the project would be to protect the environment and huinan
health by safely managing and disposing of stockpiles of POPs contaminated pesticides and
PCBs.                '             .                                                   '

The global objective of the project is to protect the environment and human health by safely
managing and disposing of stockpiles of POPs contaminated pesticides and PCBs and
strengthening the regulatory and institutional arrangements for the long term control of POPs and
other toxic substances in line with the requirements of the Stockholm Convention and other
related conventions and protocols ratified by Moldova.

To track the progress toward achieving the ,project" development objective, the project had the
following keyexpecteu results:

      (i) Repackaging, transportation and final disposal of about, 1150 tons of POPs contaminated
            obsolete pesticides held in 10 (of the total 37) storage sites in administrative districts
            throughout Moldova; ,
      (ii) Dismantling of 17,300 obsolete capacitors and excavation of 2;000 capacitors buried in , '
            two pits, packing in closed containers, shipment and as well as up to 50 tons of highly
            polluted soil from Vulcanesti substation destruction (approximately 1060 tons of
          , material);                                                                     .
      (iii) Inventory, registration system, and national database for electrical equipment containing
            or contaminated with PCBs above a concentration of 50 ppm;
      (iv) Strengthened institutional capacities for POPs sustainable management.

 1.3     Organiz_tionand implementlltion within the l\1inistry of Environment, local
       , government units and any other stakeholders involved in Project implementation.

The Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (MOE) is the central national environmental
authority which has been designated as the Stockholm Convention competent authority and as
such is responsible for coordinating the POPs related activities 3 among the following government
bodies involved in chemical management issues: the Ministry of Health (MOH), the Ministry of
Agriculture and Food Industry (MAF!), the Ministry of Economy and Trade, the Ministry of
Internal Affairs and its subdivision, the Department for Emergency Situations, the Ministry of'
Defense, and the Customs Service. Local authorities have responsibilities for environmental
protection and mana.gement in the limits of their territory. A National Coordination Committee
(NCC) for the implementation of the Stockholm Convention, bringing together senior officials
from the key ministries and leaded by the MOE, was established in July 2002 to provide overall
guidance and coordination for POPs NIP development.

The MOE was designated as implementing agency for· the project. Daily management of the
project, including monitoring and evaluation of project' implementation, financial management,
procurement, audit, progress reporting, and dissemiriation of project results was carried out by the
Project Management Team (PMT), created under MOE by Ordinance no. 79 from December 27,
2004 and am.ended'by Ordinance 22 frorn'March 22, 2006. During the reporting period the,PMT
implem.ented project activities in compliance with Operational Manual and actions to carry out
measures stipulated in the minutes ofNCC meeting and WB'supervision missions. Other national
and local 'government agencies involved in, the project implenientation are as follows:, the
National, Coordination Committee for implem.entation of the Stockholm Convention; the POPs
Convention Focal Point; the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure; the Ministry of Economy
and Trade; Moldelectrica; the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry; and the Ministry of
Defense; the State Ecological Inspectorate; the State Hydrom.eteorological' Service; , the
Department of Emergency Situati9ns, the State Inspectorate for Plant Protection; local public'
administration; owners of electrical equipment; and environmental NOOs. '                     '

2.      PROJECT DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATIONAND IMPACT

2.1     Assessment of Project Design

The project was conceived and developed as a program of actions to achieve the tasks listed in
the National Implementation Plan (NIP) of Stockholm Convention ,on POPs and to comply' and
enforce the national legal requirements and international obligations related to management of
toxic and hazardous products and substances, especially persistent organic pollutants.

At the national level project a.ctivities supported implementation of the national development
strategies, including the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy and National
Development Strategy, and provided many .local benefits by reducing the impact of POPs on
public health, the environment, and land degradation by preventing further soil pollution by
various POPs.
                                                                       .
Global benefits of the 'project are: (i) reduction of threats to biological diversity - the elimination

of POPss,tockpiles and their sound management decreased both the global pollutant burden and
possible impacts 011 wildlife, domestic aniIilals and ,humans; and (ii) improved trans-boundary
water quality by prevention of future 'contamination and' threats, to the quality of the global
hydrological r¢gime. It also contributed to the objectives of two otherintemational environmental
agreements - the Basel Convention on !he Control of Trails-boundary Movements ofHazardous
Wastes and TbeirDisposal and the Rotterdam COI1ven,tion on the Prior Informed Consent
Procedures for Certain,Haiardous Chemicals.

3.         CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE WORLD BANK,
           GOVERNMENT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

3.1        Assessment of World Bank performance and Government's actions during
           preparation andimplemtmtation:

~     Key decisions that facilitated Project implementation

The project was preceded by the Project on capacity building activities in the sustainable
management of POPs in Moldova through the· implementation of provisions of the Stockholm
Convention on POPs which was signed by the Government on 23 May 2001.

Once ratified the Stockholm Convention became bin4ing, and thus on 20 October .2004 by
Decision no. 1155 the Moldovan Government approved the National Implementation Plan under
the Stockholm Convention in Moldova. Thus the project funded by the Global Envirotunent




                                                  45
Facility through the World Bank focused on the priorities aimed at reducing the impact of POPs
on the environment and human health.

Equally important was the awareness and perception of the problem at the national and local
levels. A constructive cooperation was facilitated between local partners and in particular
government institutions in the territory of the Ecological Inspectorate, the State Energy
Inspectorate, Ministry of Defense, and Ministry of Agriculture as well as the civil society.

No less important was the establishment of an early stage a good cooperation with the World
Bank and World Bank local office as an implementing agency of the Global Environment Fund.
Advantages included greater transparency and better planning of project activities in terms of
finance and· procurement. Procurement and· financial procedures of the World Bank played a
crucial role in the safety and success of project implementation. This relationship fostered further
cooperation in solving POPs issues with other international donors such as the Canadian POPs
Trust Fund.

Implementation also benefitted from MENR's (MOE's) decision in 2004 to establish and
maintain the Project Management Team ~ which continues to work until today. This unit was .
responsible for fiduciary activities of POPs projects and other projects funded by foreign donors,
national public budget and funds. As this Team works. under the MENRIMOE it was granted
permanent technical assistance to the Ministry upon successful implementation of the GEF-
financed project.

Contracting and the selection of qualified consultants both local and internationally facilitated the
successful implementation by transferring knowledge to employees of institutions involved in
project implementation.

- Counterpart funds timely availability

Another important issue which facilitated project implementation was compliance and
contribution of the Government and partners who agreed to support project implementation.
Counterpart financing of US$ 1.14 million from the State Budget and US$ 0.36 million from the
National Ecological Fund contributed to the project in meeting its objectives.

- Key decisions that hindered Project implementation

In terms of decisions that negatively affected project implementation initial planning stage
activities related to review/change the legal framework on POPs should have been grouped into a
single consulting contract instead of smaller contracts and for specific assignments. Tissue was
exacerbated by the inadequate cooperation of the Ministry of Environment's staff with hired
consultants on revising and drafting the legal framework on POPs. Draft laws and regulations
related to POPs failed to be passed through all the necessary procedures and started to be
implemented as planned under project objectives. These activities are priorities for the Ministry
of Environment in 2011-2012.

- Assessment of World Bank supervision

As implementing agency of the Global Environment Fund in accordance with the Grant
Agreement between the Moldovan Government and the World Bank, implementation progress
was assessed every 6 months.



                                                46
                  ·           . '      .          " .
The Project Management Team Prepared and submitted to the Bank for its review 4Uldapproval,
no later than March 31 and September 30 in each ye~ cifRroject implementation (except on
March,3l, 2(08), starting.'September 30, 2006; a bi-aQlluat' report reviewing the progress in
Project implementation during the six (6) monthspteceding the ,report; monitoring indicators and
containing measures proposed to ensure efficient implem.entation of the project and achievement
of project objectives during the period. The bi~annmd reports contained annual work plans, which
were accepted by the Bank for the year following submission of the report; and following the
submission and review of each bi-annual report, the PMT acts promptly and diligently to take any
corrective action agreed with 'the Bank to remedy any Shortcomings identified in project
implementation.

All Batik mission reports have been discussed.and·disclosed to the Government and beneficiary in
order to ensure that the Government will remedy those shortcomings identified in project
implementation.

The cooperation during World Bank supervision ffilSSlons and the, Government were well
prepared and culminated with an agreement with the Government on what should be done in
order to solve those issues which were identified less adequate to project implementation.

   Governmental changes 'ana impact on Project monitoring and implementation

During project implementation from Match 2006 - December 2010 the government reshuffled
three times, including the Minister Of Environment position three times: It is clearly recognized
that these changes influenced project, implementatiop. progress since the National Project
Coordinator is the Minister of Environment. Each incoming Minister needed time to examine and '
understand the purpose and objectives of the project and reforms that took place in Ministries
partners in project implementation. For example, the fusion between the Ministry of Energy and
Ministry of Economy led.to changes in the NCCand its membership several times. Again, the
constituency required additional timti to assess and understand the purpose and objectives of the
project. The latest changes of govemment influenced project progress in a particular way such
that draft laws and regulations on amendments to the legislative framework on POPs was unable
to be promoted on grounds that political instability in the past two years has led to early
parliamentary elections and respectively the change of government.

- Monitoring by Ministry ofEnvironment and PMT

For the purposes of the project, the Ministry of Environment according to the Grant Agreement'
was responsible for overall project implementation and ensured coordination and cooperation
with the appropriate departments of involved ministries and other public entities involved in the
project.

Monitoring was provided thr()ugh the MOE National Focal Point on the Stockholm Convention
as 10flg the project was implemented based on Convention grounds. This work was organized
through weekly or monthly meetings depending on the issue to be resolved. Global problems
were discussed and decided at meetings of the National Steering Committee. Fiduciary activities
were cOflducted by PMT thus. monitoring of financial and procurement activities were made
quarterly by Project Management Team in accordance with Grant Agreement requirements.

- Key lessons learned




                                             47
               ·                  .

One of the lessons learned is keeping thePtoject Management Team in the original composition
significantly contributed to the success of this project and that this team remains involved in the
implementation of other investment ~nvironment projects such as SAICM Project CIDAPOPs
Project 'andfive national projects. Similar experience has been shown in other World Bank
projects. Ft)Ilowing the World Bank's procurement procedures ensure a better transparency;
competition~d quality of services, goods and technical services.

The involvement of Local Stakeholders in project implementation is considered good practice and
in this case all partners had been consulted and involved in crucial decisions which resulted in
project success. As a result the Moldovan experience has been considered and taken as an
example by Ukrainian and Byelorussian governments which follow similar approaches as those
applied in Moldova.

3.2     Assessment of the efficiency and quality oftberelationsbip between the World Bank
        and Government during Project implementation

Successful completion of the GEFIWB .Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Stockpiles
Management and Destruction project is the result of efficient joint communication and
understanding of the problems which were to be solved and how to achieve the project's
objective and scope between the World Bank and Government. High professionalism of the
WorldEank, understanding of political and economic situation in Moldova, competence of local
partners and PMT staff has contributed to successful. project implementation. Also a key factor
was that the Project Task Team Leader was located in the World Bank country office in Moldova;
this. facilitated the communi«ation process' between the World Bank and Government as well as
the resolution of different technical problems.

3.3     Assessment·oftbe pedorlilance of various organizations, firms and technical
        assistance during'Project implementation (costs vs benefits)

Companies' performance depended largely on the technical capabilities and experience in
activities related to contracts· for corisulting services noting that most of international companies
have resorted to hiring consultants who contributed to a better understanding of the problenis of
specific environmental issues. along as well as national. ones.

The same can be said for technical services relating to packing, transportation and destruction of
stockpiles of POPs where the selected international company offered the lowest price (about U.s..
$1 million difference over the second ranked company) but subsequently claimed this difference
during implementation. This created artificial problem, which were ultimately resolved since WB
contract procedures were strictly complied and that the company honor its contract obligations.
Ultimately the contract value should not affect the quality of services (advisory services and
technical) as long as contract terms are not met aDd that the customer is aware ofthe expectations
and anticipated results. Fro,m these considerations the contracts' management should be a
constant beneficiary's concern and that close monitoring of local and international companies
who have an implicit incentive to minimize costs.
