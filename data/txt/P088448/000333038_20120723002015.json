Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            coordination of a regional project is complex and stretches\n            very thinly in terms of both project management and\n            supervision resources. Five set of Ministers of\n            Communications, and Prime Ministers, NTRCs and ECTEL\n            (National Telecommunication Regulatory Commission and\n            Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority) were\n            involved at critical junctures in project implementation.\n            Even with the best intentions, the coordination to obtain\n            signatures from all member countries on any change such as\n            category reallocation or extension of the closing dates was\n            a hard task. As a suggestion for future regional projects,\n            resources to be deployed to project coordination will\n            require to be full-fledged defined. A consideration for\n            other ICT project in small countries it that it could be\n            beneficial to share the fixed costs of ICT development and\n            policy and regulation projects. Normal practice worldwide is\n            for telecommunications policy and regulatory issues to be\n            addressed on a national basis. A regional approach was seen\n            as viable since the telecommunications issues facing each\n            island were similar. A useful tool that could help future\n            projects in countries with little experience in World Bank\n            competitive bidding processes is the organization of\n            business outreach workshops that provide with the knowledge\n            to service providers. These workshops were found\n            particularly helpful when dealing with ICT procurement processes."}, "docdt": "2012-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
