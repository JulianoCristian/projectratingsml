Restructuring Paper 
 
1.  This restructuring paper proposes the extension of the Closing Date of the OECS 
Telecommunications & ICT Development Project (TICT), for: Dominica (Credit No. 
4059-DOM), Grenada (Loan No. 4775-GRD, Credit No. 4056-GRD), Saint Kitts and 
Nevis (Loan No. 4776-SC), Saint Lucia (Loan No. 4777-SLU, Credit No. 4057-
SLU), and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (Loan No. 4778-SV, Credit No. 4058-
SV). The TICT Project was approved by the Board on May 12, 2005 for a total of 
US$ 2.7 million equivalent and became effective on September 30, 2005, with an 
original Closing Date of December 31, 2009. A first 12 month extension of the 
Closing Date was granted on October 27, 2009, and hence the current Closing Date 
for the respective Loan and Credit Agreements is December 31, 2010. The proposed 
new closing date is December 31, 2011. This would be the second extension of the 
Project, with a cumulative extension period of twenty four (24) months from the 
original closing date. 
2. 
The Project’s Development Objective (PDO) is to improve access, quality and use of 
ICT services to achieve socio-economic development in the OECS.  The Project is 
structured along four (4) components: (1) support for legal and regulatory reforms, 
aimed at promoting additional competition in the sector and reduce tariffs; (2) 
Universal Access/Service, aimed at promoting extension of access to ICT services to 
underserved areas through the creation of Universal Service Funds (USF) and 
implementation of sub-projects; (3) ICT pilot projects, aimed at improving growth 
and competitiveness in ICT-enabled services through the use of broadband and 
innovative ICT applications; and (4) support for the management of the Project by 
ECTEL, the regional implementing agency.  
3.  Out of the total loan amount of US$ 2.70 million, to date US$1.57 million has been 
disbursed, which is 58% of the total amount. None of the participant countries are in 
suspension of disbursements.  The project is rated Satisfactory for progress toward its 
development objectives and Moderately Satisfactory for implementation progress. 
4.  The PDO is being successfully met by the main implementing agency, the Eastern 
Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL), as policy and regulatory reforms 
in the sector continue to progress well, and the sector is experiencing substantial 
growth. The contribution of the sector to GDP, along with service revenues and 
penetration, continues to increase in the five Member States, and prices continue to 
Page  3

drop. The telecommunications sector has increased its share of contribution to GDP 
from 10 percent to almost 12 percent, two percentage points above the stated 
objectives. Mobile penetration has now exceeded 100% in most of the Member 
States, and Internet penetration has increased substantially, from 7.6 percent to 13.5 
percent. Monthly rates for domestic leased lines have decreased over 50 percent and 
for international leased lines over 78 percent. Mobile retail rates have decreased by 
almost 70 percent, international rates by almost 30 percent, and internet rates by 
almost 45 percent. Direct employment from the sector has increased by almost 20 
percent, over 10 percentage points above the stated objectives.  
5.  Most of this progress has been due to the regulatory reforms introduced under 
Component 1, which has now been fully implemented. Component 3 is also 
progressing satisfactorily, with three out of five ICT pilot projects now fully 
implemented and the other two, for St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines, at a very advanced stage of implementation, and expected to be fully 
completed ahead of the current closing date. 
6.  However, Component 2 on Universal Service, has not yet been implemented, despite 
the assurances that the Bank received when the first closing date extension was 
granted. The reason for the additional delay in the implementation of the Universal 
Service component is that, in contrast to the other components, it is not managed 
exclusively by ECTEL, a well established regional institution with proven capacity 
managing the implementation of Bank projects
1
,
but
by an 
ad
hoc
 institution in each 
country, the Universal Service Fund (USF) administrator, created exclusively for this 
purpose. This difference in institutional arrangements for component 2, compared to 
the other components, particularly the need to create 
ad
hoc
institutions in each 
country, has delayed the implementation of the Universal Service component more 
than initially anticipated.  
7.  The institutional challenges outlined above led to delays in defining the sub-projects 
for each of the member states. According to the original Project design, the National 
Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions (NTRCs) each were to appoint a USF 
administrator, as a specialized body reporting to but at arms-length from the NTRC. 
Once appointed, the USF administrators, with the support of the NTRCs and ECTEL, 
were to design their proposed universal service sub-projects to be financed under the 
Project. This original Project design, whereby the component was structured as five 
universal service sub-projects, one per ECTEL member state, and expected to be led 
by the NTRCs, was based on the commendable logic that it would serve as a capacity 
building exercise, which would enable the NTRCs to implement in the future other 
universal service projects without having to rely on ECTEL.   
8.  This logic meant that this component could not be implemented until the Universal 
Service administrator of each country had been appointed. The time required to do 
this, in a region where capacity is generally low, was underestimated for what was 
intended as a four year investment project, even though the long term impact of this

(P035730), which was successfully implemented by ECTEL itself. 
Page  4

approach is likely to be high once the capacity has been created in each country. This 
institutional challenge was compounded by the additional coordination efforts 
between ECTEL and the NTRCs to agree on the technical parameters of the universal 
service sub-projects to be implemented under TICT. 
9. An extension by an additional twelve (12) months, to December 31, 2011, is 
requested in order to complete the pending activities in accordance with an agreed 
Action Plan, attached as an Annex to this RP. This extension would permit 
completion of all five universal service sub-projects and avoid any negative impacts 
on achieving the access element of the PDO.   
10. The additional period is estimated to be sufficient to complete all the remaining 
activities under the Project, for the following reasons:  
(i) 
All the USF administrators have been appointed and have been 
working with the NTRC and ECTEL to prepare the respective 
bidding documents. 
(ii) 
As of today, the bidding documents for the Dominica and St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines sub-projects have been submitted to 
the Bank for no objection and are ready to be launched 
immediately.  
(iii) 
The bidding documents for Grenada are also essentially ready, and 
are expected to follow shortly, as per the agreed action plan. 
(iv) 
The bidding documents for St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis are 
still in the process, but ECTEL has confirmed that they will be able 
to send them to the Bank for no objection before the end of 
November 2010.  
(v) 
Hence, all five Universal Service sub-projects should be awarded 
by January 2011, and it is expected that the first two will be able to 
disburse a portion of their respective funds before the end of 2010.   
11. In addition, the Project team notes the following:  
(i) The PDO remains relevant and is judged likely to be met by the end of the 
extension period, as described above, particularly in paragraphs 4 and 11;  
(ii) Country circumstances permit the full achievement of the PDO, now that the 
necessary institutional arrangements are in place in each of the Member 
States.
