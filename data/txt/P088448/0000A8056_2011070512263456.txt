                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall progress on project implementation remains moderately satisfactory. The Project Development Objectives are being successfully met by ECTEL as policy and regulatory
                         reforms in the sector continue to progress well, and the ICT pilot projects component is now essentially complete. While the universal service component has experienced delays,
                         progress is on track for completion by end 2011.
