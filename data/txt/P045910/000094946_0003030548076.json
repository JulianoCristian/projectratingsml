Policies on house demolition, relocation, and\n            compensation of the project are as follows: The compensation\n            standards of all property affected should be fixed in\n            accordance with replacement principles. The compensation\n            should be paid before the requisition of land and property.\n            Project Offices should negotiate with the owners of affected\n            property about the standards of relocation and compensation\n            and resettlement methods. The shops that will be affected by\n            the project and stop doing business due to such construction\n            shall get compensation for loss from suspense of business in\n            accordance with average profit of each shop, the wage of the\n            employees, and the actual cessation period. More attention\n            will be paid to shorten the construction period and reduce\n            the loss from the suspense of business. The affected public\n            infrastructure should be restored and reconstructed. The\n            land compensation and resettlement subsidy for the\n            requisitioned land should be calculated and paid in\n            accordance with Land Administration Law. Agricultural\n            laborers will be offered relocation assistance, training,\n            and employment opportunities. Full compensation for crops\n            and other attached facilities should be calculated based on\n            market prices. Illegal buildings will be compensated."}, "vol_title": "Resettlement action plan for urban\n            environment project of Handan City", "docdt": "1999-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
