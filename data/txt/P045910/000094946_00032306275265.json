They will be\n            mitigated as follows: Construction activities will adopt low\n            noise machinery and night work will be prohibited near\n            residential areas. Sludge will be disposed of at municipal\n            sanitary landfills, if not used as composite fertilizer, and\n            the residue treated with lime before being disposed of.\n            Discarded earth and construction waste will be transported\n            to dump sites (sink pits). Sprinkle water on dust and cover\n            transporting vehicles. To relieve traffic congestion,\n            temporary roads will be paved at heavy traffic sections and\n            materials transported during non-rush hours. A buffer\n            greenbelt will be built to reduce odors from emissions, and\n            trees replanted after construction, particularly along\n            roadsides after road restoration. Use discarded earth and\n            construction waste as backfill earth. Level excavated land,\n            cover it with cultivated soil, and restore vegetation.\n            Discharge wastewater into the sewage system. To prevent\n            chlorine leakage in the pumping station, operational\n            management will be strengthened. Box-net fishing which\n            causes eutrophication will be banned. Strengthen soil\n            conservation to prevent pollution from farmland and village\n            runoff by more efficiently using chemical fertilizers and\n            pesticides, and tightening control of animal excrement, and\n            garbage collection."}, "docdt": "2000-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
