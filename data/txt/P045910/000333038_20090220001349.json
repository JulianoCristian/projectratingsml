satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory.

This was intended to\n            encourage incentives for resource conservation and to create\n            a more reliable income stream; (ii) as an integral part of\n            the project design substantial tariff adjustments were\n            implemented during the preparation stage and prior to\n            negotiation. In addition to that Bank and municipal\n            governments agreed upfront on a schedule for tariff\n            adjustments during the implementation of the project; and\n            (iii) Industrial Pollution Control Action Plan (IPCAP) for\n            each city outlining preliminary actions to reduce the scale\n            of pollution loads from industrial sectors and in turn\n            maximize expected environmental benefits from municipal investments."}, "docdt": "2008-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
