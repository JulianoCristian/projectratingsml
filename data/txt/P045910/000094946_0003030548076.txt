1. Introduction
1.1 Brief Description of Project
Hebei "Urban Environment Project consists of three sub-projects, namely
Urban Environment Project of Tangshan City, Wastewater Treatment Project
of Shijiangzhuang City and Urban Environment Project of Handan City.
Urban Environment Project of Handan City itself includes two parts, West
Wastewater Treatment Project of Handan City (Wastewater Treatment
Project) and Urban Water Supply System Project of Handan City (Water
Supply P'roject).
1.1.1   Brief Description of Wastewater Treatment Project
The project includes:
* West Wastewater Pipe Network Conveyance System
24KLm of new trunk sewage pipeline is to be built with DN300-DN1200
tubes, and 10Km of new branch pipeline will be built using DN300-
DN4 DO tubes.
* North Wastewater Pump Station Reconstruction Project
The pump station covers 1,716Mz of land space, the designed treatment
capacity of the pump station is 60,000m3/day. The reconstructing area is
1,246 M2.
* West Wastewater Treatment Plant Project
The tbeatment capacity of the plant in the near future (to the year of
2000) is 100,000m3/day, and the project covers 253.74 mu of land space
including the land used for the second phase of the project. The



treatment plant is located in the north of Handan City. The plant is
bounded on the east by Tiexi Street, faces the Guoyuan Road on the
south, and lies to the south of Beihuan Road.
* East Wastewater and Sludge Treatment Conveyance System
A new set of sludge treatment system will be added to East Wastewater
Treatment Plant to make the actual treatment capacity of the plant
reach its designed capacity of 100,OOOm3/day. The project does not
involve land acquisition.
Wastewater Treatment Project is to start in June 2000,to be completed in
December 2003 and to go into operation in January 2004.
1.1.2 Brief Description of Water Supply Project
The project is to alleviate the tense situation of insufficient water supply,
and its designed water supply capacity is 100,000m3/day. Yuecheng
Reservoir is the water source of the project. The project mainly includes
three parts:
* Water Delivery Project
The site of water entrance is located in Yuecheng Reservoir. The way of
gravity flow is adopted. The prestressed reinforced concrete pipe is used
for water delivery, and the pipeline amounts to 56Km long.
* Water Purification Plant
It is located in Tiexi Tap Water Plant and equipped with a set of sludge
treatment system. The designed treatment capacity is 100,00Om3/day.
The purification process is as following:
2



Tube Mixing-+Mechanic-chemical Reaction--Precipitating Tank-+V
Fi]tering Unit
* Regional Water Supply Pipe Network Corollary and Reconstruction
Project
Originally, 62Km of pipeline will be laid. However, because Handan
Road and Zhanbei Road have not come into being and because the
anmount of water used in these areas is not large, the Water Supply
Project of the two roads is arranged to be carried out in the future plan.
It has been approved by Urban Environment Project Office of Handan
City, the unit in charge of the construction and Planning Department of
Construction Committee of Handan City. Therefore, 54.28 KM of
pipeline will be laid.
The land acquisition and relocation for the project are to start in April
2000. Water Supply Project is to start in July 2000, to be completed in
December 2003 and to go into operation in January 2004.
1.2 Areas iffected by and benefit from the Project
1.1.2Areas Affected by and benefit from Wastewater Treatment
Project
Wastewater Treatment Project involves 3 counties (districts), 4
townships and 10 villages in Handan City. Totally, 253.74 mu of
land will be requisitioned for the project, while there also will
be 242.Omu land for temporary land use. 4,027.5m2 of houses
will be demolished. 2 enterprises and 2 shops will be affected by
3



the project. The total population adversely affected by the
project is 222.
The area that will benefit from the project, lying to the west of
Jingguang Railway, is located in HIandan City. The area is
bounded on the east by Shuguang Street, faces Qin River on the
north and is situated to the south of Zhaoyang Road. Due to
population growth and economic development, the quantity of
sewage of Handan City has already exceeded the load capacity
of the existing water disposal system. As a result, Fuyang River,
flowing through this region, has been seriously polluted. Thus
does harm to the urban environment and people who living in
this region. In addition, the pollutants carried Fuyang River
will result in great loss in downstream agricultural production
through irrigation. The project is of great importance to the
completion of sewage piping system of the city, improvement of
living conditions and environment quality, adaptation to the
open policy and rapid development of economy of Handan City.
1.2.2 Areas Affected by and benefit from Water Supply Project
Water Supply Project involves 4 counties (districts), 11
townships (towns) and 51 villages in Handan City. Totally, there
will be 1,949.1mu of land for temporary land use, while no, land
will be requisitioned for the project. 5,582.96m2 of houses will
be demolished. 4 enterprises and 25 shops will be affected by
the project. The total population adversely affected by the
project is 2,361.
The areas that will benefit from the project are located in the
4



city center of Handan City. In recent years, with population
growth, development of industry and commerce and
improvement of living conditions, water demand of the city
center is increasing year by year. Thus intensifies the problem
of insufficient water supply. It is predicted that maximum daily
water demand in 2010 will be 480,000M3, and there will be
100,000M3 of water deficiencies according to the present level of
water supply system. Therefore, this project is very important
for economic development of Handan City, meeting the needs of
raising living standard, perfecting urban infrastructure,
reducing the overall recovery of groundwater and improving
investment environment.
1.3 Socioeconomic Background of the Project Area
Handan City is located in the south of Hebei Province and borders upon
three provinces, namely Shandong Province, Shangxi Province and Henan
Province. It is the pivot where four provinces link up with each other
(Shandong Province, Shanxi Province, Henan Province and Hebei Province).
Its geographical coordinates are E114.02'-114.37', N36.21'-37.41'.
Handan City faces North China Plain on the east and lies to the east of
Taihang Mountain. Jingguang Railway runs through the middle part of the
city. The area to the west of Jingguang Railway is hilly land, while
Chajianling Highland with an elevation of 93.10 meters and a terrain slope of
2-3.5% is to the north of Jingguang Railway. Zhaowangcheng Highland with
an elevatfion of 109.6 meters, a terrain slope of 1-2% and a dustpan-like
basin in its center is lies to the south of Jingguang Railway. The area to the
east of Jingguang Railway is plain, and its terrain elevation and average
5



slope from south to north are 58-54 meters and 0.5-1%, separately.
Handan City is a city famous for its history and culture. It is an industrial
city that combines mining with industry, and metallurgic industry, energy
industry, light industry, and construction industry are its leading industries.
At present, Handan City includes 1 cities, 4 districts and 14 counties. Its total
area is 12,070Km2, among which the area of the city proper is 457Km2. In
1997, the total number of population in the city is 8,150,000 including
1,290,000 in the city proper. The GNP of that year is 48.21 billion yuan. The
gross output value of industry and agriculture of Handan City in 1997 ranks
third in Hebei Province.
1.4 Efforts to Minimize Resettlement and its Impact
1.4.1 Site selection
The selection of project site is based on the criteria that minimal
resettlement, cultivated land acquisition and house demolition will take
place.
The location of Wastewater Treatment Plant is in the border district of
city proper, and there is no village around it. Originally, 261.52 mu of
land was to be requisitioned. The designers reduce 7.78 mu of land by
adjusting technology and changing shapes of cisterns. The site is in
vacant lot in city planning area kept for urban construction. Moreover,
the land requisitioned for the plant is wasteland overgrown with weeds
and has not been cultivated for many years due to its soil characteristics
and the effect of wastewater from the chemical plant nearby. Therefore,
few houses need to be demolished.
6



Two sites in the west of the city have been considered for the water
purification plant. The selection of water purification plant location
takes two factors into account. One, it will be convenient to water
distribution. Two, minimal land acquisition and house demolition will
take place. Finally, it is determined that the plant is located in the
southeast corner of the intersection of Qianjin Street and Renming Road.
Since the site is in the city planning area kept for urban construction, no
house needs to be demolished.
1.4.2 Design of pipeline route
The arrangement of pipeline has been optimized in order to avoid
villages, enterprises and institutions and reduce the quantity of
demolition to minimum.
There are only 4,382m2 of houses to be demolished in Wastewater
Treatment Project, and the quantity of demolition in Water Supply
Project is 5,725.17m2.
In addition, the way of demolition by PAPs themselves and
reconstruction by themselves is to be adopted in the implementation of
resettlement according to PAPs' own wishes. The surveys of houses
demolished and compensation for them will be made by UEPO before
tha1. So the PAPs can move into the new houses directly or transition
period can be shorten.
1.4.3 Improvement of construction procedure
The project program should be optimized to reduce the adverse impact to
the residents to minimum.
7



The construction of sewage pipe may interfere with the urban traffic, so
effective measures such as stopping building in peak hours should be taken
to reduce the adverse impacts on traffic.
The construction of water delivery pipeline should be optimized to reduce
the temporary land use, grain loss and economic loss of the PAPs to
minimum. The unit in charge of construction is fully responsible for land
leveling and giving back the temporarily requisitioned land to its owners as
soon as possible when the project is finished.
1.5 Design Procedure of the Project
Led by Foreign Capital Utilization Office of Handan City, Handan Sewage
Treatment Ltd. and Handan Tap Water Company put forward lproject
proposals of the two projects separately in May 1996 and submitted to the
department concerned for examination. The project proposals were
submitted to State Planning Committee for examination and approval in
August 1996.
In November 1996, Urban Construction Bureau of Handan City, Handan
Sewage Treatment Ltd. and Handan Tap Water Company entrusted North
China Municipal Engineering Design & Research Institute with the tasks
such as undertaking the feasibility research of Wastewater Treatment
Project and Water Supply Project, detailed project design and so on. The
institutes completed the general outlines of the pre-feasibility research
reports of two subprojects one after another in December 1996, while the
corresponding reports are finished in October and February 1997,
separately.
8



Entrusited by Handan Sewage Treatment Ltd. and Handan Tap Water
Company, Assessment Center of Environmental Science Institute of China
undertook the work of environmental impact assessment of the projects in
March 1997. It finished the outline of environmental impact assessmenit in
April 1997, while the assessment report is completed in August 1998. The
Project Proposal was approved by State Planning Committee in December
1998.
On September 10, 1999, North China Municipal Engineering Design & Research
Institute finished the compilation of the feasibility report and submitted it for
examination and approval.
1.6 Projeclt Ownership and Organizations
The project is an urban infrastructure construction project managed by Handan
City Government. The construction funds are composed of two parts, domestic
funds and the World Bank loan. The total investment of 37,830,000 USD will be
made in Wastewater Treatment Project including domestic funds of 19,830,000
USD and the World Bank loan of 18,000,000 USD. The total investment of
42,990,000 USD will be made on Water Supply Project including domestic funds
of 22,000,000 USD and the World Bank loan of 20,990,000 USD.
Urban Environment Project Office of Handan City (UEPO) is responsible for
management and coordination of the project. Handan Sewage Treatment Ltd.
and Handan Tap Water Company are responsible for the construction.
Handan Sewage Treatment Ltd. and Handan Tap Water Company are also
responsible foir land acquisition, house demolition and resettlement of the project,
while Land Administration Bureau of Handan City is in charge of the
supervision of land acquisition and house demolition of the project.

1.7 Socioeconomic Survey
1.7.1 Socioeconomic Survey of Wastewater Treatment Project
In November 1996, UEPO and House Demolition Office of Handan
Sewage Treatment Ltd. made a preliminary survey of the land
acquisition and house demolition of the project and found out the scope
of land acquisition and the lands, buildings and attached facilities in the
scope. According the survey, they worked out a tentative resettlement
scheme.
In July 1998, House Demolition Office of Handan Sewage Treatment Ltd.
surveyed the scope of area affected by the project again to get further
details of land acquisition and house demolition for the feasibility study
on the project.
From September 20 to October 29 in 1998, UEPO and Handan Sewage
Treatment Ltd. arranged for people to make a survey of the lands,
buildings and attached facilities once again and made a sampling survey
of the PAPs' opinions (10 households were surveyed) at the same timne.
In August 1999, the staff form UEPO together with the staff from
Handan Sewage Treatment Ltd. organized the cadres in the counties,
districts and towns affected by the projects. They also discussed the
requirements of the World Bank loan for Resettlement. And special
emphasis has been put on public participation.
The quantity of land acquisition and house demolition will be measured
10



and verified on the spot before the implementation of each subproject.
As the area affected by the project is quite small, socioeconomic survey
of the project has been completed by UEPO and Handan Sewage
Treatment Ltd.. The results of the survey,-will be listed in the report.
1.7.2 Socioeconomic Survey of Water Supply Project
In April 1997, UEPO and Handan Tap Water Company made a
preliminary survey of land requisitioned, house and attached facilities
demnolished for the delivery pipeline, water purification plant and
distribution piping. The quantity of land acquisition and house
demolition was gotten based on the survey.
In July 1998, Handan Tap Water Company arranged for personnel to
survey the scope of area affected by the project again to get further
details of land acquisition, temporary land use and the demolition of
houlse and attached facilities for the feasibility study on the project.
From September 20 to October 29 in 1998, UEPO and Handan Tap
Water Company make a survey of the lands, buildings and attached
facilities once again and made a sampling survey of the PAPs' opinions
(10 households were surveyed) at the same time.
In August 1999, the staff from UEPO together with the staff from Water
Supply Company organized the cadres in the counties, districts and
towlls affected by the projects. They also discussed the requirements of
the World Bank loan for Resettlement. And special emphasis has been
put on public participation.
11



The lands affected by the construction of delivery and distribution
piping will only be used temporarily. Moreover, the land for temporary
use is strip-distributed. So the project has little impacts on the relevant
villages. The socioeconomic survey of the project has been conducted by
UEPO and Handan Tap Water Company. The results of the sqrvey will
be listed in the report.
1.8 Preparations made for the RAP
The preparations made for the RAP of the project began in January 1997
and have been listed in the pre-feasibility study report of the project.
According to the needs of the World Bank, the measurement and verification
of the quantity of lands, houses and attached facilities affected by the project
were made in July 1997 and in September to October 1998 separately, and
UEPO discussed the resettlement scheme with land administration
departments at the same time. The report on the RAP (draft) was finished on
December 10, 1998 and submitted to the World Bank.
In September 1999,according to opinions of resettlement experts from the
World Bank, UEPO measured and verified the quantities of land
requisitioned and houses demolished again and negotiated the resettlement
scheme with PAPs representatives. On the base of that, the resettlement plan
was revised.
The report on the RAP was completed by UEPO.
NRCR is responsible for the independent monitoring and evaluation (if the
project.

2.1 Impacts of Wastewater Treatment Project
Wastewater Treatment Project includes four single constructions. They are
West Wastewater Treatment Plant Project, North Wastewater Pump Station
Reconstruction Project, North Wastewater Piphf Network Conveyance
System and East Wastewater Treatment Plant Sludge Treatment Corollary
Equipment Project. The project involves 3 counties (districts), 4 townships
(towns) and 10 villages in Handan City. Totally, 253.74 mu of wasteland will
be requisitioned for the project, while there also will be 242.Omu land needed
for temporary land use. The number of population adversely affected by the
land acquisition and temporary land use is 150. 450m2 of residential houses
with 18 people will be demolished. 2 enterprises and institutions with 39
people and 2 shops with 15 people will be affected by the project.
2.1.1 The Impact of Wastewater Treatment Plant Project
Wastewater Treatment Plant is located in the north of Handan City.
The plant is bounded on the east by Tiexi Street, faces the Guoyuan
Road on the south, and lies to the south of Beihuan Road. According to
the project construction, it is necessary to requisition 253.74 mu of
wasteland of Houhao Village in Haocui Township of Fuxing District,
Wulipu Village in Sucai Township of Congtai District, and Congbei
Village and Congdong Village and Congnan Village in Congzhong
Township of Handan County. The lands have been alkalized by the
wastewater of the chemical plant nearby and are not fit for cultivation
any more. In addition, 2.5mu of wastelands with 50 graves are to be
used temporarily for construction access roads.
The houses and attached facilities affected by the project include:
* 840m2 of 28 collective vacant houses in Congbei Village of
15



Congzhong Township in Handan County (These houses are factory
buildings of a chemical plant built by Congbei Village. The plant
construction was given up half way because its products find no
market);
O A parking lot that is not put into service at present;
0  2,975m2 of enclosure;
40 1 chimney;
4* 1 toilet.
2.1.2 The Impact of North Wastewater Pump Station Reconstruction Project
North Wastewater Pump Station is located at Jia No. 28 on Xinxing
Street and adjacent to Decoration Ltd. of Handan Construction
Engineering Group, and the project will affected the workshops and
some warehouses of Coatings Plant of Decoration Ltd. Since the pump
station covers 2.57mu of state land in Coatings Plant and all the
workshops of the plant will be affected, the plant with 14 workers and
staff members needs to be relocated. After negotiations between
Decoration Ltd. of Handan Construction Engineering Group and
Coating Plant of Decroation Ltd., the workshops of Coatings Plant will
be rebuilt on the site which Decoration Ltd. sets aside for future
development.
2.1.3 The Impact of West Wastewater Pipe Network Conveyance System
13Km of trunk pipeline and 10Km of branch pipeline for wastewater will be laid
in the project. Since part of the new trunk pipeline is to be laid under the existing
roads, the pipe-laying work will only affect the urban traffic, and no houses and
attached facilities will be involved in it. The main impact of the project is land
acquisition and demolition of house and attached facilities in the scope of roads
16



to be built. According to the survey, the impact of the project is as following:
*  239.5mu land with 150 PAPs for temporary land use;
*  Demolition of 450mZ of residential houses with 18 PAPs in rural area;
*   2 restaurants with 15 workers and staff members will be affected;
JO   1 enterprise (Changxiezhuang Cloth Plant)with 25 workers and staff
members will be affected;
*   Attached facilities affected by the project are trees, poles, enclosure, lawns,
etc.
2.1.4 The Impact of East Wastewater Treatment Plant Sludge Treatment
Corollary Equipment Project
Since the construction of the sludge treatment corollary equipment is carried out
in East Wastewater Treatment Plant, the project will not incur any adverse
impacts.
See Table 2-2 for the detailed information on land use. See Table 2-3 for the
detailed information on houses affected. See Table 2-4 for detailed information

2.2 The Impact of Water Supply Project
Water Supply Project includes three single constructions. They are NVater
Purification Plant Project, Water Delivery Pipeline Project and NVater
Distribution Pipeline Project. The project involves 4 counties (districts), 11
townships (towns) and 51 villages in Handan City.
2.2.1 The Impact of Water Purification Plant Project
The plant is located in the southeast corner of the intersection of Qianjin Street
and Renming Road and covers 36 mu of land space. Besides, Tiexi Waterworks
19



built by the first phase of Yinyue Project, the goal of which is to divert water
from Yuecheng Reservoir into Handan City, is also situated in the area. Since the
land to be occupied by the water purification plant, the waterworks to be built by
the second phase of Yinyue Project, has been reserved in the design of Tiexi
Watenvorks, the project will not involve land acquisition and demolition. Thus
the number of affected population is zero.
2.2.2 The :mpact of Water Delivery Pipeline Project
The water delivery pipeline begins at Yuecheng Reservoir and ends at Tiexi
Waterworks via Ci County, Handan County, Hanshan District and Fuxing
District. At present, the beginning part of the pipeline, the designed capacity of
which is 200,000m2/day, is being built, so it is not involved in this project. The
delivery pipeline amounts to 56Km long and runs parallel to the pipeline of the
first phase of Yinyue Project.
1,949.10 mu of land will be used temporarily by the construction of the pipeline,
and 2,125 persons will be affected by the temporary land use. Totally, 5,582.96m2
of houses need to be demolished including 2,131.96m2 of residential buildings in
rural area with 145 villagers affected, 487.7m2 houses of 4 enterprises with 16
persons affected, and 2,963.3m2 houses of 25 shops with 75 persons affected.
See Table 2-6 for the detailed information on land use. See Table 2-7 for the
detailed iniormation on houses affected. See Table 2-8 for detailed information
on shops and enterprises affected. See Table 2-9 for the detailed information on
infrastructure and attached facilities affected.

2.2.3 The Impact of Distribution Pipeline Project
Totally, pipelines in this project amounts to 54,284.9 m long. In Distribution
Pipeline Project, 2 trunk pipelines and 28 branch pipelines are to be built. The
trunk pipelines amount to 5,886.6m long and are to be laid along Renming Road
and Guanghua Road using DN1000 pipes, while the branch pipelines amount to
48,398.3 m long and are to be laid using DN300-DN800 pipes. All the lands to be
used temporarily by the project are state lands. The trunk pipelines will be laid
along the fast lane of the roads, and the branch pipelines will be laid along the
low-vehicle lane. Thus, no residence and infrastructure will be affected by the
construction.. However, there will be quite a little smoke, dust, noise and sanitary
garbage in ithe construction site, and the pipe-laying work will has adverse
impacts on the urban traffic. Measures should be taken to alleviate these adverse
impacts.

4. Implementation Plan for Resettlement and Rehabilitation
4.1 Projeict Impact Analysis
4f-
4.1.1 Impact Analysis of Wastewater Treatment Project
(1) Impact Analysis of Land Acquisition
253.74mu land requisitioned for the wastewater treatment plant is wasteland
overgrown with weeds and has not been cultivated for many years due to its soil
characteristics and the effect of wastewater from the chemical plant nearby.
Therefore, few houses need to be demolished and the work of land acquisition
will not affect the production and living standards of PAPs..
(2) Impact Analysis of Temporary Land Use
part of wastewater pipe network to be built by the project will be laid under the
built roads, and the other part will be laid under the roads to be built according
city planning.
There are mainly 6 built roads affected by the pipe-laying including 3 main roads,
namely Jiailshe Street, Lianfang Road and Xinxing Street. The project
construction will has adverse impact such as traffic block on the urban traffic
since there is heavy traffic on these roads. And the impacts will last until the
project is comnpleted. However, the pipe-laying work will not affect the house and
attachment of residents on the built roads. In addition, there will be quite a little
smoke, dust, noise and sanitary garbage in the construction zone. Measures
should be taken to alleviate these adverse impacts.
36



Since the roads to be built affected by the pipe-laying work are in the reservation
of city planning and it is stipulated by the local government that the construction
of house and other facilities on the reservation is forbidden, little house and
attachment will be affected by the project. At present, the lands are farmlands of
the villages concerned.
There are 242.Omu of land used temporarily by the project including 202.5 mu of
vegetable plots and 39.5 mu of wasteland. 7 villages will be affected by temjporary
land use of the project and the impact degree is 1.0%-8.3%. Specially,
Anzhuangquan Village has no cultivated land at present, the lands in the village
affected by the temporary land use are reclaimed wastelands. The main income
sources of Anzhuangquan Village are non-agricultural activities and house
rentals.
According to the above analyses, it can be seen that the pipe-laying will has little
impact on the PAPs and the impacts will not last long time, the land affected will
be recultivated as soon as the construction is completed.
(3) Analysis of Impact on House and Attached Facilities
The houses and attached facilities affected by the construction of wastewater
treatment plant include:
*  840m2 of 28 collective vacant houses of brick-concrete structures
Congbei Village of Congzhong Township of Tangshan City (These
houses are factory buildings of a chemical plant built by Congbei
Village. The plant construction was given up half way because its
products find no market);
*  A parking lot that is not put into service at present;
*  2,97bm2 of enclosure;
*  1 chimney;
37



* 1 toilet.
450m2 of residence houses in Wulipu Village will be demolished for the
construction of pump station and pipe network, and thus will has little impacts
on the production and living condition of 18 villagers from 3 households
accounting for 1.5% of the total population of the village. Urban residence
houses will not affected by the construction of pipe network, yet 166.5m2 of
simply constructed shed established by individual residents for temporary use
will be demolished. The affected infrastructures and attachments are listed as
followings:
*  9 poles of 380V;
*  96 1rees;
3  4 fruit trees;
*  2,670m2 of enclosures of two plants;
*  630im2 of brick-stone ground;
D  120M2 of cement pavement;
D  800In2 of lawn in Zhaoyuan Park.
The attached facilities except trees can be restored after the project is completed.
(4) Analysis of Impact on Enterprises and Shops
2 enterprises and 2 shops will be affected by the project.
*  Coatings Plant of Decoration Ltd. of Handan Construction Engineering
Group is a state owned enterprise with 14 employees. At present, it is in a
fairly good condition. Because its workshops and warehouses are to be
demolislhed by the project, it will be rebuilt on the site which the Handan
Construction Engineering Group has set aside for the future development
after negotiation with the Construction Engineering Group, the leaders in
Coating Plant and its employees.
* Part of a workshop in Cloth Plant of Changxiezhuang Village which is a
38



collective enterprise with 25 employees will be affected by the pipe-laying
work, yet it will be restored on the original site after the construction of
pipeline is completed.
*  All the houses of Qingfang Restaurant, which lies to the east of north gate of
Zhaoyuan Park, will be demolished by the project. The restaurant is a
private enterprise. Because it is not profitable, the owner hopes to be
compensated in cash.
*   Xi'an Restaurant, which lies in the east of Xixing Street, is a private
enterprise and is managed well. The pipes will be laid in the front of it. So
the business will be affected. But the houses need not be demolished. After
negotiations, the Sewage Treatment Ltd. will compensate the loss.
The detailed information about the impact of Wastewater Treatment Project is
listed in Annex II and Annex IV.
4.1.2 Impact Analysis of Water Supply Project
No land need to be requisitioned for the construction of the water purification
plant of the project, and the construction of the plant will not affect any
residential houses and attachments.
(1) Impact Analysis of Temporary Land Use
1,949.1mu of land from 51 villages will be used temporarily by the project, and
thus involves 2,125 people. The impact degree of the villages is among
0.28%-51.22%. Specially, Pang Village is affected most seriously. Due to the
land acquisition for urban construction in recent years, most of villagers in
Pang Village do not go in for agricultural production and their income mainly
originates in non-agricultural production such as renting out houses.
According to the above analysis, it is can be seen that temporary land use of the
39



project will has little impact on the production and living of PAPs.
(2) Analysis of Impact on Residential Houses and Attached Facilities
No residenice houses in the city proper will be affected by the project, yet there
are 2,131.96m2 of residential houses in rural area will be demolished for the
construction of water delivery pipeline. Majiafen Village of Yuecheng Town in
Ci County is affected most seriously. 748m2 of houses of 13 households in the
village are to be demolished, and thus will affect 59 people that account for
6.5% of the total population of the village. The attached facilities affected are
agricultural film, trees, fruit trees, enclosures and house foundations.
(3) Analysiis of Project Impact on Enterprises and Shops
Water delivery pipeline will be laid along the south of Fuxing Road, and 4
enterprise with 16 people and 25 shops with 75 people will be affected. All
affected enterprises are deficit units, so are most shops affected.
Detailed iin formation about the impact of Water Supply Project is listed in
Annex Mand Annex IV.
4.2 Implemnentation Plan for Resettlement and Rehabilitation
4.2.1 Implementation Plan for Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Wastewater
Treatment Project
(1) All the Lands requisitioned for Wastewater Treatment Project are wastelands,
so land acquisition of the project will not affect the production and living of
the PAPs. Totally, 253.74 mu of land will be requisitioned for the project and
40



should be compensated in accordance with the standard of 65,000 yuan/mu.
The total cost of compensation is 16,493,100 yuan, among which 11,418,000
will be distributed to groups of villages. After negotiation with the cadres and
the mass of affected villages, the money will be deposited in the bank to
increase income of interest annually. Obviously, the income level of PAPs will
be increased instead of decreased.
(2) Temporary Land Use
Temporary land use of the project involves 3 counties (districts), 4 townships and
7 villages. Totally, 242.Omu of land will be used temporarily by the project, and
1,352,000 yuan of compensation cost should be paid for it according to the
compensation standards. The period of temporary land use is 6 months. If the
economic loss from temporary land use is calculated as per annual output value,
the total loss is 943,800 yuan. Obviously, the compensation cost is more than the
economic loss from temporary land use. The compensation for young crop on the
land affected shall be paid directly to PAPs, yet other compensation fee will be
used by village administration committee to re-cultivate lands and restore the
income level of PAPs.
(3) Dwelling House Reconstruction and Infrastructure Restoration
Since the construction of the wastewater treatment plant will affect the collective
vacant houses of Congbei Village, the compensation calculated in accordance
with replacement price shall be paid to the village collective.
Since houses of 3 households in Wulipu Village will be demolished for pipeline
construction, compensation calculated in accordance with replacement price
should be paid to the affected residents directly. The PAPs will rebuild their
houses by themselves after the location and foundation area of new houses are
41



allocated in the village. The original houses shall be demolished after the
completion of house reconstruction.
Affected poles and lawn will be compensated in accordance with market price.
Poles will be displace and restored. Lawn will be restored by its owner when the
construction is completed.
(4) Resettlement and Restoration of Enterprises and Shops
As for the enterprises and shops affected by the construction of pipeline,
different re;settlement and restoration measures will be taken in accordance with
their actual conditions and will of the owners.
Since the imain workshops of Coatings Plant affected are to be demolished, the
plant need to be displaced. After Project Office negotiated with the plant owner,
Decoration Ltd. of Handan Construction Engineering Group, the new site of the
plant is a reserved place of the company and is located to the east of Xinxing
Street and 150m away from the original one. The compensation for the houses to
be demolished is calculated in accordance with replacement price, while the
moving fee is calculated as per market price. Allowance for cessation of
production is calculated according to the production condition of the plant in the
last year. The attachments will be compensated in accordance with market price.
Only one workshop of Changxiezhuang Cloth Plant will be affected by the
project, so it can be rebuilt on the original site after the pipeline construction is
completed. T he compensation calculated in accordance with replacement price
shall be paid for displaced houses. The allowance for cessation of production,
which includes allowance for loss on cessation of production and business and
allowance for loss in staff income, shall be paid as per the standard of 10-20
yuan/m2. The equipment re-installation fee shall be calculated in accordance with
42



market price. The enclosures and other attached facilities of the plant will be
compensated according to market price.
Qingfang Restaurant is quite far from the city proper, and it is a deficit
restaurant. After Project Office negotiated with its owner, the owner is willing to
find the new site of the restaurant by himself (herself) after the houses are
compensated in accordance with replacement price.
Xi'an Restaurant will be affected by the construction of pipeline. Durinag the
construction period , it is inconvenient for customs and the profit will drop. It
can be rebuilt when the pipe-laying is completed. Allowance for cessation of
business should be paid to compensate the loss from cessation of business. The
attached facilities shall be compensated in accordance with market price.
(5) Measures Taken to Avoid, Minimize or Eliminate the Adverse Impact of Pipe
Network Construction on Environment
*D Measures Taken to Minimize Impact on Traffic
Construction of the project will unavoidably affect some roads, and the
excavation work will seriously affect the traffic in the relevant region. The
project developer has already taken these adverse impacts into account
when working out implementation plan. Measures taken to minimize
impacts on traffic include:
*  As for the roads with heavy traffic, temporarily substitute paths are
designed, and the construction is carried out by stages. The work of

() Measures Taken to Alleviating Dust
The clay dug up from the irrigation canals is piled up along the roads, the
dust will be raised by the wind and mechanical force in dry season and
thus will affect the nearby residents and factories. In order to minimize
the impacts of construction on the surrounding environment, it is
necessary to sprinkle the mound with water to avoid dust in the
consltruction when it is fine and windy often. The clay dug up will be
transport elsewhere and disposed in time, while overload during
transportation is forbidden to prevent the arid soil from spilling out of the
vehicles on the way. Moreover, before the vehicles leaves the construction
site, Esoil on the wheels should be clean away in order to avoid the arid soil
spilling out of the vehicles on the way and affect the environment. At the
same time, the construction team should be responsible for the
environment sanitation of the roads near the entrance of the construction
site anid sweep off the spilled soil in time.
( Control of the Construction Site Noise
The construction noise results from the excavation of canals, sound from
the loudspeaker of transport vehicles, sound of engines, noise of concrete
mixer and noise of road roller. In order to minimize the impacts of noise
on the surrounding residents, the construction within the region 200M
away ifrom the residential area should stop from 11 pm to 6 am, and low-
noise construction machinery should be adopted preferentially. If the
construiction site is near the residential area and the construction must
continue at night, measures should be taken to eliminate the noise of
construction machinery. In addition, temporary sounder barrier should
be set up around the construction site or residential area to ensure the
44



environment quality of residential areas.
(a Disposal of In-situ Waste in the Construction Site
The project developer and construction enterprise should contact local
environment sanitation department in time to get rid of the consumer
waste in the construction site and make it clean and tidy.
The living standards and production level of the project PAPs wiill not
decrease due to the rational compensation and well arranged relocation,
and effective measures will be taken to eliminate the adverse impact of
regional pipeline construction on the surrounding environment.
4.2.2 Implementation Plan for Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Water Supply
Project
(1) Temporary Land Use
Temporary land use involves 4 districts (counties), 11 townships (towns) and 51
villages. Totally, 1,949.1mu of land will be used temporarily by the project. If the
economic loss from temporary land use is calculated in accordance with annual
output value of the lands, the annual loss is 3,265,100 yuan. The land affected
will be re-cultivated after 12 months. The relevant compensation standards are
as followings:
* Vegetable plots, 6,077 yuan/mu;
* Irrigated land, 3,708 yuan/mu;
The total cost of compensation is 7,378,200 yuan and more than the economic
loss from temporary land use. Compensation for the young crop on the affiected
land shall be paid directly to the PAPs, while other compensation fee will be used
by village administration committee to re-cultivate lands affected and restore the
income level of PAPs.
45



(2) Resideritial Houses Affected
12 villages and 31 households will be affected by the construction of distribution
pipeline. lTotally, 145 people are to be displaced, while 65.66m2 of storied
buildings of brick-concrete structure and 2,066.3n2 of one-story buildings of
brick-concrete structure will be demolished. These PAP households will get
compensation calculated in accordance with replacement price and rebuild the
houses by themselves after the location and foundation area are allocated in the
village. The way of building while demolishing is to be adpoted.
(3) Shops and Enterprises Affected
25 shops will be affected by the project. Totally, 546m2 of storied buildings of
brick-concrete structure and 2,417.3m2 of one-story buildings of brick-concrete
structure will be demolished, these houses lie to the south of Fuxing Road and
are located on th-e outskirts of the city. The owner of the houses are peasants of
Pengjiazhai and Baijiazhai. Since the houses face the streets, most of them have
been rent out and most renters are peasants in the villages nearby. The renters
are mainly engaged in restaurant, motor repair, yet most shops are in a state of
deficit at present. The owner of the houses will get transition fee and moving fee
as well as house compensation calculated in accordance with replacement price,
while 75 renters will get allowance for cessation of business. The affected shops
can be rebuilt in situ when the construction is completed and their operating
environment will not change, so the turnover of the shops will be restored.
There are 4 enterprises affected by the project, and they are in a state of deficit
at present. TDtally, 487.7m2 of one-story brick-concrete buildings of them are to
be demolished. The owners of the affected enterprises will get transition fee,
moving fee, allowance for cessation of production as well as house compensation
calculated in accordance with replacement price and rebuild them in situ. The
production environment of the enterprises will not change.

(4) Measures Taken to Eliminate the Adverse Impact of Distribution Pipe
Network Construction on Environment
6) Measures Taken to Minimize Impact on Traffic
Construction of the project will unavoidably affect some roads, and the
excavation work will seriously affect the traffic in the relevant region. The
project developer has already taken these adverse impacts into account
when working out implementation plan. Measures taken to minimize
impacts on traffic include:
*  As for the roads with heavy traffic, temporarily substitute paths are
designed, and the construction is carried out by stages. The work of
excavation, pipeline burying and backfill is to be finished as soon as
possible.
3  As for the roads with heavy traffic, the project construction is stopped
in peak hours.
() Measures Taken to Alleviating Dust
The clay dug up from the irrigation canals is piled up along the roads, the
dust will be raised by the wind and mechanical force in dry season and
thus will affect the nearby residents and factories. In order to minimize
the impacts of construction on the surrounding environment, it is
necessary to sprinkle the mound with water to avoid dust in the
construction when it is fine and windy often. The clay dug up will be
transport elsewhere and disposed in time, while overload during
transportation is forbidden to prevent the arid soil from spilling out of the
vehicles on the way. Moreover, before the vehicles leaves the construction
site, soil on the wheels should be clean away in order to avoid the arid soil
47



spilling out of the vehicles on the way and affect the environment. At the
same time, the construction team should be responsible for the
environment sanitation of the roads near the entrance of the construction
site and sweep off the spilled soil in time.
( Control of the Construction Site Noise
The construction noise results from the excavation of canals, sound from
the loudspeaker of transport vehicles, sound of engines, noise of concrete
mixer and noise of road roller. In order to minimize the impacts of noise
on the surrounding residents, the construction within the region 200M

be set up around the construction site or residential area to ensure the
-environment quality of residential areas.
i) Disposal of In-situ Waste in the Construction Site
The piroject developer and construction enterprise should contact local
envirolament sanitation department in time to get rid of the consumer
waste in the construction site and make it clean and tidy.
The living standards and production level of the project PAPs will not
decrease due to the rational compensation and well arranged relocation,
and efiective measures will be taken to eliminate the adverse impact of
regional pipeline construction on the surrounding environment.

determined according to that for project construction in order to dovetail with it.
The basic principles of making the project construction dovetail the progress of
land acquisition, house demolition and PAP relocation are as followings:
*  To fix the schedule for land use of the project in accordance with the date of
pipeline construction and of plant construction.
*  When Land acquisition and house demolition will begins is determined on
the basis of the work of land acquisition, house demolition and PAP
relocation, while it should be completed one month before the start of the
project.
* To resenre enough time for land acquisition, house demolition and PAP
relocation before the start of project.

8. Participation and Consultation
In order to iFormulate relevant policies, work out and compile the RAP, carry out
the RAP efficiently, guarantee the legal advantage of PAPs, alleviate the
grievances and conflicts and regettle the PAPs properly, special attention will be
paid to participation and consultation of the PAPs in the project. During the
formulation of resettlement policies, compilation and implementation of the RAP,
the opinions of PAPs are heard widely.
When feasibility study is carried out during the project preparing phase, UEPO
has solicit opinions of Handan City Government, Government of relevant districts,
the People's Congress of Handan City, the Political Consultative Conference,
mass organizations, and the villages affected on pipeline laying sites, locations of
wastewater treatment plant and water purification plant, land acquisition, house
demolition and resettlement for many times.
In November 1996, UEPO arranged for the units concerned such as STL and
TWC to make a tentative survey of land use condition and socioeconomic
condition iE the land acquisition and demolition area of the project, and
suggestion about project scheme, land acquisition, house demolition and PAP
relocation were raised. All the opinions and suggestions have been considered in
the project design and compilation of the RAP.
OnE January 29,1997, LTEPO sponsored a meeting in Handan Urban Construction
Bureau and discussed with the infrastructure owners the project affected.
Attendants at the meeting include infrastructure owners such as:
* Municipal Facilities Management Section;
* Afforestation Office;
* Electricity Supply Bureau;
*  Agriculture Bureau;
* STL;
* TWC;
73



* Post and Telecommunications Office.
UEPO introduced the project condition and the scope involved, solicited opinions
of house-demolished units on pipeline laying, infrastructure demolition and
compensation. After the meeting, infrastructure owners arranged for personnel to
look up archives and material concerned or, to make on-the-spot survey, and
provided their infrastructure sorts and quantity within the demolition scope and
worked out the scheme of restoration and reconstruction. All suggestions have
been adopted in the RAP.
In July 1997, detailed survey of socioeconomic condition and tangible materials
affected by land acquisition, house demolition of the project was made during the
pre-feasibility research.
From September 20 to October 29 in 1998, UEPO, STL and TWC carried out a
survey of socioeconomic condition, public opinions and psychology and so]licited
the opinions from 20 households affected by or benefit from the project (HARBP).
The result of psychological questionnaires showed:
*  90% of the sampling households think that the urban wastewater or water
deficiency has serious or very serious effect on their work and lives;
3  95% of the sampling households were aware of the project;
*  90% of the sampling households agreed with the project;
*  50% of the sampling households were aware of or partially understood the
policies on land acquisition, house demolition, resettlement and
compensation;
*  90% of the sampling households believe that the project is beneficial lto the
state;
*  90% of the sampling households believe that the project is beneficial ito the
collective;
*  70% of the sampling households believe that the project is beneficial to the
individual;
* 90% of the sampling households knew that they could appeal to the
department concerned if their rights were encroached upon.

UEPO   of Handan, together with Water Supply Company and Sewage
Treatment Company will organize the staff from Land Administration Bureau,
Civil Construction Bureau and Planning Bureau to discuss and decide the scheme
of land acq'iiisition and house demolition two months before the project starts. In
the future, the following measures will be taken to encourage public participation
and consultation.
* PAPs and the villages affected participate in the house demolition and
relocation.
VAC and representatives of PAPs take part in the implementation of detailed
survey on house and attached facilities to be demolished, fixing the
compensation standards, allocation of the location and foundation area for
new house and negotiations of contracts for demolition, compensation and
resettlement. Thus, the PAPs interests and opinions are well reflected, and
justice, rationality and transparency of the resettlement are ensured.
* The PAPs themselves select the form  of house building during the
implementation of RAP.
Assisted by HDO, LABRCD and VAC, the PAPs themselves select their form
of house construction. The resettled households themselves select the location
of new houses in the area with integrated planning, determine the house
structure and overall arrangement and organize the activities of resettlement,
reconstruction and demolition.
* Holding the negotiation meetings
To organize representatives of PAPs, village cadres and woman
representatives (Female representatives should comprise at least 30%/, of all
attendants to protect the interests of the vulnerable groups) to participate in
discussion meetings, introduce the resettlement condition to the attendants
and further hear their opinions and suggestions.
* Holding mass meetings
76



The mass meetings are held before the implementation of RAP in order to
explain the relevant policies, regulations, compensation standards, the
resettlement scheme and so on in detail. Thus, the PAPs can make early
preparations for the resettlement.
*  To propagate the policies on laqd acquisition and house demolition of the
project via mass media.
*  Promulgation of land acquisition announcement
It includes approval of land acquisition by authorities, the purpose, usage,
scope and area of land acquisition, the way of compensation, original owners
of the lInds and the unit which uses the lands. Promulgation can be put on
the walls, broadcast by radio or TV, or printed in the newspapers.
- Village cadres and representatives of PAPs participate in the work of land
acquisitilon and resettlement.
Village cadres and representatives of PAPs should make on-the-spot survey with
the Working staffs of HDO and LABRCD to determine the final quantity of land
acquisition 2Lnd house demolition and negotiate about the plan for compensation
standards and resettlement. Directed by HDO, LABRCD and TTG, the villages
affected determine the resettlement plan for the total population affected and
decide how to allocate the land left after land acquisition on the basis of
democratic consultation.
*    RAP
RAP is an important basis for land acquisition and house demolition and
resettlenment. RAP will be placed at UEPO of Handan and Preparation Group
of Water Supply Project. It can be looked up by the people concerned.
77






9. Grievances and Appeals
Special attention will be paid to the PAPs and the house-demolished units (HDU)
participaticin throughout the process of compilation and implementation of RAP.
To ensure that the PAPs and the PAUs have channels for redressing their
grievances, transparent and efficient grievance redress procedures have been
established for the project to avoid serious grievance problems.
The grievance redress procedures include the following four stages:
*  Stage I
If PAPs or HDUs are not satisfied with the RAP or implementation of RAP,
they can appeal to HDO and LABRCD (Implementation organizations)
orally or in writing. In case of an oral compliant, the two institutions are
required to document the specific grievance on paper, keep it in the archives
and settle the grievance within two weeks.
* Stage I1
If the l'APs and HDUs are not satisfied with the solution of Stage I, they can
then appeal to UEPO after receiving the judgement notice of Stage I. UEPO
shall make a decision on the complaint within two weeks.
*  Stage I[I
If the PAPs and HBUs are still dissatisfied with the settlement, they can
appeal to LAB (The institution in charge of supervision and arbitration of
land acquisition and house demolition) after receiving the decision made by
UEPO and submit the dispute for arbitration. LAB, the arbitration
organization, will make arbitration on the complaint within 3 weeks.
78



*  Stage IV
If the PAPs or HDUs are still dissatisfied with the arbitration, they can
appeal to the Peoples Court in accordance with the Administration
Procedure Law of PRC after receiving the decision of the arbitration
organization. PAPs or HDUs can make an appeal on any issue of the
resettlement plan, including compensation criteria.
The PAPs will be informed of the grievance redress procedures mentionedl above
through meetings and other ways to ensure that they are clear about their rights
of grievance and appeals and can protect their own rights.
79



10. Monitoring
According to Operational Directive 4.30 of the world Bank, implementation of
land acquisition, house demolition and resettlement activities should be monitored
regularly to ensure those actions have proceeded in accordance with th-e
provisions of the RAP. There are two kinds of monitoring mechanisms in this
RAP, the internal monitoring and the independent monitoring that is carried out
by an externLal institution.
Internal Monitoring is carried out by UEPOHP, UEPO, STL, TWC, HDO and
LAB to ensure that all the units follow the schedule and comply with the
principles of the RAP. The purpose of the internal monitoring is to make the
resettlement organizations fulfil their duties efficiently during the implementation
of the RAP.
Independent Monitoring Organization is responsible for making independent
monitoring and evaluation on the activities of land acquisition, house demolition
and resettlement regularly. NRCR, as the independent monitoring organization
(IMO), und'Drtakes the independent monitoring of the project. The independent
monitoring covers the issues following:
* OperatiOn efficiency of the resettlement network;
*  CompeEnsation and implementation process of land acquisition, house
demolition, rehabilitation;
* Relocation and production and business reestablishment of the PAPs and the
units aflected by the project (PAUs);
*  Investigation and analysis of the living standards of PAPs.
The indeperident monitoring is to entrust an organization independent of UEPO
with the monitoring and evaluation on the implementation of resettlement and
economic rehabilitation from a overall and long-term point of view. IMO follows
80



the resettlement activities of the project closely to evaluate whether the goals of
resettlement are achieved. The evaluation criteria include:
*  To follow national laws and regulations relevant to land acquisition, house
demolition and PAP resettlement;
*  To comply with the principles of Operational Directive 4.30 (OD4.30) on
Involuntary Resettlement of the World Bank;
*  To help the PAPs to improve their living standards or at least to restore
former one.
The IMO should provides UEPO suggestions about the implementation of RAP so
as the problems incurred during the implementation of RAP can be resolved
without delay.
10.1 Internal Monitoring and Supervision
HDO and LABRCD have developed an internal monitoring system to supervise
the resettlement activities. They establish relevant database on land acquisition,
house demolition and resettlement and use it to compile the RAP, monitor the
PAPs and PAUs and carry out the internal investigation and supervision of the
whole course of resettlement preparation and implementation.
10.1.1 Implementation Procedure
During the implementation of RAP, HDO and LABRCD collect and file
information on PAPs and PAUs according to the samples provided by
monitoring organizations. At the same time, they should report the record
of the current activities timely to UEPO and UEPOHP so as to ensure a
continuous monitoring on implementation. UEPO should conduct regular
inspection on the implementation of RAP and report it to higher
authorities concerned.
81



In the internal monitoring system mentioned above, the information table
with unified form should be fixed in order to realize the continuous
information flow from LABRCD and HDO to UEPOHP. UEPOHP, UEPO,
STL, TWC, HDO and LABRCD, the important members of internal
monitoring system, should carry out regular inspection and verification.
10.1.2 The Tasks of Monitoring
(1) Payment of compensation to PAPs and PAUs
(2) House reconstruction and relocation
(3) Rehabilitation of the vulnerable groups
(4) Rehabilitation and business recovery of shops
(5) Rehabilitation and production recovery of PAUs
(6) Reconstruction and production recovery of infrastructure

UEPOD invited NRCR as the IMO of the project. NRCR is the first national
research institution of project resettlement in China, and it is also the only
one in cooperation with EDI in training of resettlement personnel in china.
It has rich experience in resettlement policies, planning, design,
implementation, monitoring, evaluation, management, etc. Moreover,
NRCR has undertaken independence monitoring and evaluation of
projects funded by the World Bank more than 10 times. The monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) group of NRCR consists of 12 members
expeiienced in sociology and engineering resettlement including professors,
lecturers, Ph. Ds and masters. See Annex 1 for the outline of independent
monitoring and evaluation.
10.2.2, Responsibilities
NRC]R should traces, monitors and evaluates the implementation of RAP.
In addition, as an independent consultant, it should provide advice and

production level of PAUs. Survey on production and living
standards will be made annually thereafter to measure the changes
in the living standards of PAPs. Various methods such as sampling
survey, tracking typical sampling households (sampling households
, are determined using random sampling method), random visit and
in-site observation are used to collect necessary materials. ]Finally,
NRCR analyzes those collected materials and gives an evaluation.
Sampling sizes of different groups of PAPs are 50% of PAP
households for house demolition, 10% of PAP households for land
acquisition and resettlement, 15% of PAP households for
temporary land use (The monitoring of this section focuses on the
land recoverv and income level recovery).
B. Regular Monitoring and Evaluation
During the implementation of RAP, IMO will conduct regular
monitoring on project resettlement once a year. By in-situ
observation, tracking typical sampling households and random visit

ANNEX
Annex I  The General Outline of the Independent Monitoring and
Evaluation on Urban Environment Project of Handan City
1. Introduction to the Project
Land acqutisition and house demolition of this project involves 3 districts, 1
county and relevant infrastructure units.
RAP of this project is complied by UEPO, STL and TWC and implemented by
LAB and LABRCD. NRCR is in charge of independent monitoring and
evaluation of the project.
2. Objectives of Independent Monitoring and Evaluation on Resettlement
According to the requirement of OD4.30 Involuntary Resettlement and annex 3 in
the technical document No.80 of the World Bank Involuntary Resettlement and
Rehabilitation in Development Projects -Guidelines of Policy for the World Bank
Loan Projects, NRCR undertakes the independent monitoring and evaluation on
the resettlement of Urban Environment Project of Handan City. NRCR will
survey the fund availability and utilization, project management and progress of
land acquiisition, house demolition and resettlement, conduct comparative
analysis anid evaluation on changes in production, business and living condition of
PAUs and PAPs before and after relocation and then make an evaluation for the
progress of land acquisition, house demolition, relocation and rehabilitation. It
will submit regular monitoring and evaluation report (once a year) to the World
Bank, UEPO and the relevant departments in charge of the project. At the same
time, it will also provide information and suggestions for the departments
concerned making decision. From these reports, the World Bank and the
94



departments in charge of the project can get,fuUlunderstanding of whether the
work of land acquisition, house demolition and resettlement achieve the desired
results on time. These reports can-also help to idelntify the crux of the problems
and make suggestions about how to improve the resettlement work.

5. Organization and Division of Labor of Resettlement Monitoring and
Evaluation
(1) The rNational Research Center of Resettlement (NRCR) is entrusted by
4'
UEPO to be in charge of the surveys, data collection and analysis work of
the independent monitoring and evaluation, while UEPO is responsible
for thie examination of the its results.
(2) NRCR sets up the Resettlement Monitoring and Evaluation Group of Urban
Environment and Water Supply Project of Handan City (M&E group). The
tasks 'of the group include:
* Guided by the project manager of the World Bank, M&E group will carry
out resettlement monitoring and evaluation of the project;
*  Compilation of the outline of resettlement monitoring and evaluation;
*  Monitoring site selection;
*  Outworki such as on-the-spot survey and monitoring and indoor work such as
data processing and data analysis;
d  Compilation of resettlement monitoring and evaluation reports.
(3) UEPIO provides required personnel, transport equipment and other
facilities for the M&E when on-the-spot survey and monitoring work are
conducted.
6. The Method of Resettlement Monitoring and Evaluation
(1) The method of monitoring and evaluation is a combination of field visit,
data collection and calculation, comparative analysis, and expert
evaluation.
98



(2) In the monitoring and evaluation process, both overall surveys and
sampling surveys are conducted. Overall surveys are for collecting dLata of
the progress of resettlement implementation, funds, organizations and
management, etc. At the same time, sampling surveys of house demolition
and reconstruction and living standards of PAPs are made.
(3) Sampling survey adopts various methods such as typical sampling and
random sampling to make a tracing survey of the sampling households,
shops and enterprises. Sampling sizes of different groups of PAPs are 50%
of PAP households of house demolition, 10% of PAP households of land
acquisition and resettlement, and 15% of PAP households of temporary
land use.
(4) The methods of overall surveys are distributing forms to resettlers and ask
them to fill out the forms, interviewing resettlers, holding discussion
meetings and checking the files kept in department concerned, etc.
(5) Besides written material, other kind of material need to be collected such
as pictures, magnetic tapes, video tape and material objects. Resettlement
Monitoring and Evaluation Information System on Urban Environment and
Water Supply Project of Handan City is also established.
7. Schedule of Resettlement Monitoring and Evaluation
* In March 2000, M&E Group was set up and began to compile the outline of
independent monitoring and evaluation.
* Before March 2000, preparations for resettlement monitoring and evaluation
have been finished. The preparation work includes:
99



(1) compiling the outline of survey and relevant forms; (2)establishing monitoring
system;
(3) identifying tasks;
(4) monitoring site selection.
*  In April 2000, baseline survey will be made.
*  The firsit external monitoring and evaluation will be conducted in December
2000, and its report will be submitted in January 2001.
* The second external monitoring and evaluation will be conducted in
December 2001, and its report will be submitted in January 2002.
* The third external monitoring and evaluation will be conducted in December
