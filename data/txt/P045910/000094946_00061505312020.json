It will\n            support Heibei Province in implementing a long-term urban\n            environmental services improvement program to recover from\n            environmental degradation of its water and land resources,\n            provide an adequate supply of safe water, and ensure\n            sustainability of delivery through institutional and\n            financial reforms of the service utilities. The project\n            comprises seven components: 1) Shijiazhuang wastewater and\n            2) Tangshan wastewater will support the construction of\n            sewer interceptors, a conventional activated sludge sewerage\n            treatment plant and a secondary sewer program. 3) Tangshan\n            water supply will finance the works of a raw water intake\n            pumping station, a water treatment plant, and a raw water\n            transmission main. 4) Handan water supply will finance raw\n            water intake works, construction of a gravity raw water\n            transmission main, and strengthening of distribution\n            networks. 5) Handan wastewater will support the construction\n            of sewer interceptors, rehabilitation and expansion of the\n            North Sewage Pumping Station. 6) The sixth component will\n            cover institutional development, financial strengthening,\n            operation enhancement, and management and geographic\n            information. 7) The last component will support an action\n            plan for industrial pollution control."}, "docdt": "2000-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
