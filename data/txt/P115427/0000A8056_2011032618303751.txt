                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall project development objective is to improve conditions for teaching and learning in basic education including early childhood development. This
                         objective is aligned with the ongoing IDA project and consistent with the overall objectives of the Government's Education Sector Strategy Plan and the
                         Medium-Term Plan for 2009-2011.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Budget estimates for 2011 indicate a continuous commitment to the sector, with a similar share as seen in previous years (education receiving around 18% of the Government's
                         recurrent budget). Donors contributed significantly to the sector in 2009, accounting for 33 percent of total expenditures. With the closure of Islamic Development Bank, African
                         Development Bank and Uk DfiD projects in 2010 and no further support in the pipeline for basic education, The Gambia is becoming increasingly a donor-orphan country. As a
                         matter of priority the Government is pursuing possibilities for further resource mobilization.

                         Growth in school enrollment continues to be modest (GER reached 89% in 2009 at the lower-basic level), over the five year period 2006-2010 actual enrollment increased by 9.7%.

                         Expansion at lower basic level has mainly been in private schools and Madrassas, while enrollment in government and grant aided schools declined marginally. Concerns around
                         quality, equity and cost of education (with household contributing 46% percent of education costs at lower basic) have been reflected in the recent Aide-Memoire and sector analysis.
                         The project development objective is likely to be met and is rated satisfactory.
