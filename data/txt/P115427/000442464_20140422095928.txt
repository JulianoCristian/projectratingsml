1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Context. The Gambia is a small West African country which had an
estimated population of 1.6 million (2008) and an average per capita gross domestic product
(GDP) of approximately US$420 (2007). Though the poverty rate had declined over the
previous decade, poverty prevalence was high and varied significantly by region. The
economy was largely driven by tourism while agriculture accounted for approximately one-
third of GDP but more than 70 percent of employment. Gambia’s ranking on the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) Human Development Index had improved in recent
years but its human development indicators were among some of the poorest in the world,
ranking 155th out of 177 countries in 2007. Life expectancy was 57 years of age which was
higher than the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) average, and maternal mortality had declined from
396 (per 100,000 live births) in 2000 to 281 in 2008. Child health indicators were also better
than the SSA average and there had been a consistent decline in the under-five mortality rate
since 1990. Adult literacy rates had increased from almost 37 percent in 2000 to almost 47
percent in 2007. Enrolment in lower basic education had increased by 21 percent from
182,562 in 2002 and 220,931 in 2008.

2.      Sector context. The Government’s Medium Term Plan (MTP) (2009-2011) for the
education sector was recommended for re-endorsement by the local education group (LEG) 1
in August 2008. The MTP identified a financing gap of US$33.7 million. MTP’s priorities
included improved access, especially for girls, for children in remote areas, and for children
with disabilities. The MTP also focused on issues of quality with an emphasis on improving
early grade reading and addressing marked gender, regional and socio-economic disparities in
education. It established clear baseline and target values for many of the key sector indicators.
The overarching plan for the sector (on which the MTP was developed) was embodied in the
Government’s Education Sector Plan (ESP) (2006-2015) which coincided with the end date
for achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Education for All (EFA)
objectives. The ESP’s objectives were to: (i) provide access to relevant and high quality basic
education for all; (ii) provide high quality education services; (iii) ensure gender equity in
education; (iv) provide relevant life skills; and (v) promote the principle of lifelong learning.

3.       Project context. The MTP timeline (2009-2011) was designed to coincide with
implementation of this project – the Republic of The Gambia Education for All-Fast Track
Initiative (EFA FTI) Project (P115427). This Project was the second phase of support from



1
  The main donors active in the sector included the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UK
Department for International Development (DfID), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Islamic
Development Bank, the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) and the International
Development Association (IDA). In addition, a number of national and international non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) were closely involved in education activities, including Action Aid, Future in Our Hands,
and Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), among others.

                                                      1
the EFA FTI Catalytic Fund (CF). Prior to 2009, efforts in the sector focused on improved
equity, access, quality and management. Specifically, an emphasis had been placed on:

   (i)     Improving equity and effective access by: introducing a hardship scheme to attract
           teachers to remote areas, creating additional places through efficiency measures and
           construction of classrooms; and ensuring that every child in lower basic has a book
           for all core subjects;
   (ii)    Emphasizing teachers’ role as key actors in improving quality by: supporting
           reforms in pre-service teacher training; and strengthening in-service training at both
           central and regional levels;
   (iii)   Assessing quality of education, putting in place instruments to measure quality in the
           classroom;
   (iv)    Improving monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the sector;
   (v)     Using performance as a key measure for career development;
   (vi)    Reaching out-of-school children and addressing gender and geographic disparities;
           and
   (vii)   Anchoring sector management to a well-performing base.

4.     Some of the persistent challenges in the education sector at the time of project design
in 2008 included: the large number of out-of-school children and pervasive disparities in
access; a pressing need for attention to quality improvements in the sector; weak sector
management at the regional and local levels; and an insufficiently developed M&E system.
Despite improvements, the number of out-of-school children remained high, particularly in
remote and rural areas. There were also a large number of children with disabilities and
orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) who were not attending school. While girls
outnumbered boys in lower basic education, they still under-performed boys at all levels of
education. They were also significantly under-represented among teachers and school
managers.

5.      The quality of education services was limited with issues in terms of early grade
reading and performance in math and English in lower basic schools (LBS). Despite growing
attention from donors and the Government, in- and pre-service training suffered from low
content-knowledge of incoming student-teachers, limited pedagogic support for new teachers
and those with difficulties, and very limited opportunities for the professional development of
existing teachers. While there was a strong vision for the sector and Government leadership,
this needed to be strengthened at the regional and local levels to prepare for the
decentralization of activities. Finally, while there had been improvement in M&E activities
(e.g., data collection, management and analysis) in recent years, it remained difficult to attract
and retain qualified staff to work in this area.

6.       The EFA FTI Project design was well-aligned with the sector program and the
Government’s MTP, aiming to address existing financing gaps in the sector, supporting
activities to improve quality, measurement of learning achievements (such as the Early Grade
Reading Assessment – EGRA) and changing incentives among teachers and management
(e.g., providing hardship allowances for teachers in remote areas and performance
management linked to team bonuses). As the International Development Association (IDA)

                                                2
had been involved in the sector since the 1970s, the Project was able to draw on the
institution’s macro-economic and institutional knowledge of the sector. Project activities were
not isolated initiatives but fell within the global implementation of the sector-wide approach.
As the largest financier in the sector, the Project supported activities laid out in the MTP and
were complementary to existing efforts in the sector (e.g., school construction and
rehabilitation activities which were ongoing at the time of project preparation were financed
by IDA and the African Development Bank (AfDB), among others). The EFA FTI Project
activities which focused on improving the quality of teaching and education complemented
AfDB, UK Department for International Development (DfID) and IDA-funded activities
supporting teacher development. In addition, the Project aimed to accelerate progress towards
universal primary education and achievement of other key MDGs.

7.      The Project was prepared in close collaboration with the LEG, including the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) (lead in-country donor at the time of the preparation),
DfID, with contributions from AfDB, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the Arab Bank
for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA), and the other UN Funds and programs
(including especially the World Food Programme (WFP)) and several NGOs. The EFA FTI
CF Strategic Committee approved the EFA FTI Project in the amount of a US$28 million
grant to The Gambia in November 2008. This was the second phase of support from EFA FTI
which began in 2005.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8.       The EFA FTI Project PDO was “to improve the Recipient's conditions for teaching
and learning in basic education including early childhood development, in alignment with the
overall objectives of the Recipient's Education Sector Strategy Plan 2006 and the Medium-
Term Plan for 2009-2011”. 2 The ten original PDO-level indicators as described in the project
appraisal document (PAD) included: (i) intake rate for early childhood development (ECD);
(ii) intake rate at lower basic level; (iii) intake rate for upper basic level; (iv) gross enrolment
for ECD; (v) gross enrolment at lower basic school (LBS); (vi) gross enrolment at upper basic
school (UBS); (vii) completion rate at LBS; (viii) completion rate at UBS; (ix) percentage of
qualified teachers (LBS); and (x) performance management system (PMS) is functional and
helps inform key personnel decisions.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

9.    In December 2012, the EFA FTI Project was restructured and the PDO was modified.
The Revised PDO was “to improve the Recipient’s conditions for teaching and learning in



2
  According to the PAD, the PDOs were “to improve conditions for teaching and learning in basic education
including early childhood development. This objective is aligned with the ongoing IDA project and consistent
with the overall objectives of the Government’s Education Sector Strategy Plan and the Medium-Term Plan for
2009-2011. Teaching and learning in basic education would be improved by (a) increasing access and equity in
basic education; (b) improving the quality of teaching and learning; (c) strengthening management, monitoring
and evaluation as well as institutional capacity at central and regional levels.”

                                                     3
basic education, in alignment with the overall objectives of the Recipient’s Education Sector
Strategy Plan 2006 and the Medium-term Plan for 2009-2011.” The exclusion of support to
ECD from the PDO stemmed from the fact that most of the ECD activities envisaged under
the Project were being implemented by a Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF)-financed
project administered by the same task team.

10.     The Bank has monitored activities supported by the JSDF ECD project while
monitoring the EFA FTI Project. It was agreed that the few activities that would receive
support from the EFA FTI relating to ECD did not justify inclusion of ECD in the PDO 3.
Therefore, the PDO was revised to reflect only those interventions leading to the outcome for
which the Project could be held accountable. A small amount of funding (less than
US$40,000) was originally allocated to ECD activities to: (i) create networks among
stakeholders; and to (ii) support primary teaching certificate (PTC) curriculum for ECD,
which were implemented prior to restructuring. Indicators were also revised to reflect the
change in the PDO. The revised set of PDO-level indicators included: (i) number of total
project beneficiaries (core indicator required by the World Bank); (ii) percentage of female
beneficiaries (also a core indicator); (iii) gender parity index (GPI) for gross enrollment rate
(GER) in LBS; (iv) GER in LBS; (v) average correct words per minutes in EGRA in grades 2
and 3; and (vi) percentage of qualified teachers in LBS.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The main project beneficiaries were: (i) out-of-school children as well as students in
LBS and UBS, including those in remote, rural areas, those with disabilities and those with
low socio-economic status (SES); (ii) teacher trainees who were in PTC and Higher Teacher
Certificate (HTC) programs; (iii) teachers receiving in-service training; and (iv) staff within
the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MOBSE). A detailed list of beneficiaries can
be found in Annex 2.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The EFA FTI Project had three components.

12.     Component 1: Increasing access to and equity in basic education (US$9.3 million).
The Project supported the construction, rehabilitation, and furnishing of classrooms and staff
quarters, provision of water points and latrines; employed strategies for out-of-school children
and for adolescent girls; and encouraged ECD.

      Activities supported under Component 1 included: the construction of classrooms with
      furniture and sanitary facilities (including separate toilet facilities for girls); rehabilitation
      of dilapidated classrooms (many in underserved areas); construction of water points;
      construction and/or rehabilitation of teachers’ quarters in extremely deprived


3
 It was agreed that the few activities relating to ECD supported by the Project, including the support of ECD
networks and the formulation of an ECD policy, do not have the intensity to warrant inclusion in the
development objective (from the Restructuring Paper).

                                                     4
      communities; provision of customized horse/donkey carts to transport early graders to-
      and-from school; and provision of sanitary supplies for adolescent girls to avoid loss of
      instructional time.

13.  Component 2: Improving the quality of teaching and learning (US$16.5 million). This
Component constituted the bulk of the grant and supported quality interventions.

      Activities supported under Component 2 included: the provision of learning materials;
      curriculum development at all levels; support for in- and pre-service teacher training and
      school-level pedagogical support; provision of incentives to attract and retain teachers in
      remote, rural areas; design and implementation of learning assessment instruments;
      support to ECD and for special needs education, as well as for orphans of HIV/AIDS;
      communication, advocacy and community activities to support mothers’ clubs; and
      provision of scholarships.

14.     Component 3: Strengthening Management and Institutional Capacity at central and
regional levels (US$2.2 million). The Component supported M&E systems and sector
management, with a strong focus on data management, performance monitoring and bonuses
(in line with plans under the ongoing IDA-funded Third Education project). Support was
provided to the MOBSE and to the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) through the provision of
technical assistance (TA), and support for covering operating costs and carrying out
performance and financial audits.

      Activities supported under Component 3: Leadership training for managers in the
      MOBSE; improved data collection, analysis and dissemination, including the timely
      availability of reliable statistics each year; completion of a school mapping exercise and a
      facilities assessment survey; EFA assessment in all six regions; provision of performance
      bonuses to teams within MOBSE as part of the PMS, complementing initiatives in the
      ongoing Third Education project; formulation and finalization of the postings policy;
      convening bi-monthly Coordinating Committee Meetings (CCMs) and Senior
      Management Team (SMT) meetings in Regions 1-6; provision of office consumables for
      regions and headquarters (15 directorates/units); fuel and maintenance for regional and
      central stand-by generators; monitoring of assets; and annual audits.

1.6 Revised Components

15.      The project components were never revised.


1.7 Other significant changes

16.    As described previously, the project was restructured in 2012. Under this restructuring,
the results framework (RF) indicators were revised as the existing framework included too
many indicators, some of which were repetitive. The revised RF included a smaller and more
focused set of indicators which were regularly monitored and reported on by the Government.
The original indicators aimed to measure system-wide gains which was standard practice at

                                                 5
the time under EFA-supported projects whereas the revised RF were more closely tied to
project interventions. The revised RF also included a number of core indicators which had
become Bank requirements (e.g., number of project beneficiaries and percentage of which
were female). Baseline targets were also adjusted as new population projections were
validated by the Government in late 2011/early 2012. Moreover, the frequent name changes in
the madrassas 4 and well as the low response rates in some regions further undermined the
validity and accuracy of the data. 5

17.      The 2012 Restructuring also changed the overall scope of a number of project
activities by adapting to the reality on the ground, including: an increase in the number of
rehabilitated classrooms (from 88 to 144 classrooms due to high demand); and a decrease in
the number of constructed classrooms (from 400 to 252). The latter figure was reduced as a
result of an underestimation of unit costs at the time of appraisal. The Project also reduced
the number of water points constructed (from 200 to 20). This figure was modified as
UNICEF later committed to building a larger number of water points in Region 6 where the
Project had planned to focus its building efforts. Further, as many of these sites were
converted from wells to boreholes which are more costly, the number of water points to be
constructed had to be decreased. In addition, there was also an increase in the number of boys
receiving financial assistance in the form of tuition waivers (from 3,000 to 6,000). Finally, a
number of activities not originally envisaged were supported under the project including: a
conditional cash transfer (CCT) activity for 12 daaras (villages) and an early reading in
national languages pilot (125 classes) both of which were strongly tied to the revised PDO.
Given these activities were launched in 2012 and the fact that their impact would only be
observed in the medium-term, they were not formally included in the RF.

18.     The closing date was extended twice to ensure completion of project activities. First,
it was extended for six months from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013 to ensure that the
construction of the remaining 78 classrooms and rehabilitation of 144 classrooms and 15 staff
quarters would be completed by the end of the Project. Second, the closing date was extended
for three months, from June 30, 2013 to September 30, 2013 to ensure completion of: (i) the
reprinting and delivery of four core subject textbooks and teachers’ guides for grades 5 and 6:
and (ii) the publishing and delivery of Science and Social Environmental Studies (SES)
textbooks and teachers’ guides for grades 7, 8, and 9. These were delivered by the end of
September 2013.




4
  The term madrassa is used for those establishments that have been registered using Government standards and
curriculum. Government is also putting at their disposal government teachers.
5
  The strategy of school level data collection changed from the reliance of cluster monitors (which proved to be
unsuccessful) to giving this responsibility to the EMIS team in MOBSE. As a result, the response rate
significantly improved in 2011-2013 to over 90 percent. Every school has also now a unique school ID which
increases data accuracy.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.     Project preparation and design. The EFA FTI Project objectives fit squarely with
the Government’s strategy and action plan as laid out in the ESP (2006-2015) and MTP
(2008-2015) and with the Bank’s Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) 2008-2011 and the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The Government and Bank strategies underscored the
importance of increasing access, equity and quality in basic education. The JAS specifically
expressed its support for the FTI (2008-2010) as the preparation of the Strategy coincided
with the FTI’s support to The Gambia. The Project was designed to build on key aspects of
the previous phase of the EFA FTI as well as the ongoing IDA-financed Third Education
Project. A few key studies and assessments were undertaken that informed project design,
including: (i) a public expenditure review (PER) (2008); (ii) a teacher study (2008); and (iii)
an analysis of EGRA (2007) results which guided the Project’s focus on improving quality
through teaching and learning and the operation’s specific focus on early grade reading.
Given the Bank’s experience in The Gambia – and specifically in the sector (Phase I of the
EFA FTI and the ongoing Third Education Project) – the implementation arrangements were
able to rely on those structures and entities already in place and which were functioning
effectively, particularly in terms of financial management (FM) and procurement. 6 Further,
the same team in the MOBSE coordinating the ongoing IDA project and the first phase of the
EFA FTI Project facilitated preparation and implementation of this EFA FTI Project.

20.      While building on existing structures, as the Bank had developed a long-lasting and
stable partnership with the Government, it was also well-placed to adopt an incremental
approach providing continued support to existing approaches (e.g., hardship allowances to
teachers) while also introducing innovative and evidence-based activities (e.g., early grade
reading program in national languages). This also provided an important opportunity for
capacity-building in the sector. The Bank drew on lessons learned from experience in The
Gambia and other similar settings in designing the Project. Some of the key lessons which
guided both design and implementation included: (i) The importance of ensuring concrete
steps are taken to sustain and scale up successful interventions. A large number of activities
financed under the first phase had been mainstreamed and incorporated into the Government’s
budget. Key among those activities supported by the Government were: financing for more
than half of the teacher allowances; undertaking all pre- and in-service teacher training
activities; and providing scholarship support to girls. (ii) The need to enhance the quality of
teacher training programs as an important measure to improve education quality. The EFA
FTI Project focused on providing support to teachers (in-service teacher training) as a way to
ensure that skills acquired during training were translated into better practice in the classroom.
(iii) The importance of ensuring strong coordination among donors and Government – the

 As the PCU’s performance in FM and procurement (by assessments in 2008) had been deemed satisfactory, it
was determined that these responsibilities would be managed by the PCU (of MOBSE) under the new project
and that the procedures used would adhere to Bank guidelines and be consistent with those employed by the
Third Education Project.

                                                   7
Project was able to maintain and further strengthen the high-level of collaboration that had
developed as a result of the Bank’s work in the education sector prior to project effectiveness.

21.     Quality at entry. The project design supported key strategic objectives for the sector
and built on successful practice to date and lessons learned from Bank operations. The team
undertook key assessments in a timely manner and used these to guide decisions related to
project implementation. The Project was well-positioned to build upon existing IDA activities
supported under the ongoing Third Education Project and this facilitated a smooth transition
to the second phase of the EFA FTI. The Bank team possessed the necessary skills mix and
expertise to properly appraise the Project and guide its design. The Project did not, however,
benefit from either a Quality Enhancement Review (QER) or a Quality Assurance Report
(QAR) as it was not common practice at the time for these to be held for EFA-funded
projects. Despite the soundness of the preparation process, there were some shortcomings,
namely: (i) the lack of a well-established M&E system to regularly collect data to report on all
of the PDO- and intermediate-level indicators; (ii) an overly complex (and at times redundant)
RF matrix; and (iii) inaccurate estimations of unit costs at appraisal which led to a revision of
the number of schools, water points and teacher housing units that could be built/rehabilitated
under the Project. In light of the information above, Quality at Entry is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

22.     Revised design. The 2012 Restructuring attempted to address some of the issues
related to the design that appeared during implementation and introduced: (a) revision of the
PDO to exclude the explicit reference to ECD (as such activities were no longer funded by the
Project); (b) revision of the RF to better capture project-related results and outcomes; and (c)
extension of the project closing date by six months to June 30, 2013. The changes introduced
under the Restructuring were appropriate. The revision of the PDO was warranted given that
the Project no longer supported a large number of ECD activities as these had been taken over
by the JSDF-financed project and the operation had become increasingly focused on lower
basic schooling (LBS) (rather than upper basic schooling (UBS)). Revisions to the RF were
also important in eliminating redundant indicators and incorporating performance measures
that could more accurately capture progress towards the achievement of the PDO. Baseline
targets were adjusted on the basis of more recent population data projections released in
December 2011. Finally, the extension of the closing date was necessary to complete the civil
works activities by the end of the Project.

2.2 Implementation

23.     The following provides an overview of implementation before and after the
restructuring.

Phase I: Prior to Restructuring

24.     The EFA FTI Project became effective on August 6, 2009. Implementation was
relatively consistent during the first years of the project life and disbursement was on-track.
As of November 2009, only three months after effectiveness, nearly US$6.3 million
(approximately 25 percent of the grant amount) had been disbursed. Progress had been

                                               8
observed made in a number of key activities, including: (i) technical upgrades of the
Education Management Information System (EMIS); (ii) completion of technical studies
(including the school mapping exercise); (iii) introduction of a number of pilot activities
(including the provision of donkey carts, sanitary supplies to girls, reading instruction in
national languages, and training in sign language); (iv) construction of needed infrastructure
(including in rural areas); (v) training of teachers; (vi) development of new curriculum; and
(vii) two rounds of the National Assessment Test (NAT) that had been carried out. By the
mid-term review (MTR) in April 2011, substantial progress had been made in relation to
achieving the objectives of improving the quality of education services as well as increasing
equitable access to education. The MTR confirmed that the Project was being implemented in
a timely manner and rated both implementation progress (IP) and progress towards
achievement of the PDO as Satisfactory. This pace continued throughout the period prior to
restructuring in 2012.

Following Restructuring

25.     Following the Restructuring in 2012, IP remained steady. At the time of Restructuring,
89 percent of the original grant amount had been disbursed. Progress was made on a number
of activities that had been initiated in the first phase of the Project, including: (i) construction
and rehabilitation of classrooms; (ii) tuition waivers to disadvantaged boys; (iii) provision of
supplementary and EGRA pocket readers; (iv) training of teachers in pedagogical techniques
for early reading; (v) provision of hardship allowances; (vi) supply of donkey carts to early
graders as a means of transportation to school; and (vii) provision of sanitary packages to
girls. Although the inaccurate estimations of unit costs at appraisal led to a revision of the
number of schools, water points and teacher housing that could be built and/or rehabilitated
under the Project, project activities were implemented in a timely manner apart from the
delivery of textbooks and teachers’ guides near the end of the project. This delay was largely
attributable to the fact that this activity had been initially supported under the Third Education
Project but was later transferred to the EFA FTI Project (due to a lack of funds under the
former to finance this activity). The delivery of textbooks/guides was expected to take six
months but took approximately nine months in total (with contracts signed in January and the
textbooks/guides delivered in September 2013).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

26.     Original M&E Design. Most of the original PDO-level indicators were appropriate
given the project design and approach for selecting indicators employed at the time. As
described previously, it was common practice at the time of project preparation to include
system-wide indicators to measure progress under EFA-financed projects. The Project’s RF
was well-aligned with the Government’s desire to monitor progress towards achieving the
MDG and EFA goals. Although the intermediate-level indicators were tied to the
Government’s MTP and linked to each component of the Project, two indicators were never
measured: (i) annual instruction hours; and (ii) hours devoted to reading by region.
Moreover, a few of the PDO-level indicators were redundant (e.g., intake and gross
enrollment rates) also in relation to intermediate-level performance measures (e.g., NER).
Finally, although the Project’s primary emphasis was on LBS, the original RF also included

                                                 9
an emphasis on UBS which was not consistent with the scope/scale of the interventions being
implemented at the UBS level.

27.     Data to track progress towards achieving the PDO were provided by established
sources including the EMIS. M&E training was provided early on to those responsible for
undertaking data collection, analysis and reporting under the Project. Since the EMIS data,
however, relied on outdated population projections and did not fully cover the country’s
madrassas, the data used were not entirely reliable for setting targets and measuring progress
under the Project. The system-wide focus, high level of donor coordination and government
ownership characterized the overarching approach to M&E in the sector. Beginning in 2010
with increased availability of sector statistics, semi-annual joint sector reviews were held.
These were highly participatory, including a variety of key stakeholders in the sector
(including the Government, donors, civil society organizations (CSOs), teachers’ unions, etc.)
and provided a forum to discuss both challenges and achievements in the sector.

28.     Revised M&E Design. The 2012 Restructuring addressed many of the above-
mentioned limitations. The number of PDO-level indicators was reduced to: (i) address
redundant indicators; (ii) reflect the Project’s reduced scope and focus (excluding ECD and
emphasizing LBS); (iii) introduce core indicators which had become a Bank requirement (e.g.,
number of project beneficiaries); and (iv) move the GPI indicator from the intermediate- to the
PDO-level. One of the main reasons behind the 2012 Restructuring was the need to adjust
project baseline values and end-of-project targets that had been specified at preparation (in
light of newly available data, described in further detail below). Despite the improved M&E
design, some challenges persisted: (i) in some instances, outcome indicators rather than
output measures were classified as intermediate-level indicators; and (ii) baseline values of
some indicators were not available. 7 The provision of TA to the EMIS team in collection,
cleaning and verification of the reliability of data as well as data analysis and publication
continued under the restructured Project. In light of the above, the overall M&E design for the
Project is rated Modest.

29.      Implementation and Utilization. The Project provided ongoing support to M&E
during the life of the Project as the capacity was initially limited and M&E system needed to
be further strengthened. Specific activities supported by the Bank included: (i) training of
MOBSE staff in data collection, cleaning, analysis and utilization; (ii) TA to the upgrading
and utilization of EMIS; and (iii) support to field-level data collection activities. Over the
course of the Project, sector data became more available and reliable – and these data were a
critical input into the semi-annual joint sector reviews which began under the Project in 2010.
Project data as well as data collected from the PMS were used by the Government to assess
progress, realign activities and to undertake regular reporting. The Project also supported
evaluations of pilot activities (e.g., the provision of the hardship allowances), an important
aspect in undertaking new and innovative approaches. Further, the Government took an


7
  The baseline value included for the indicator Average correct words (passage) per minutes (EGRA) for grades
2 and 3 was from 2009 although the Project was restructured in 2012. Because the EGRA is only conducted
every few years, these were the most recent data available at the time. Therefore, as a result an end-of-project
target for this indicator was not set.

                                                      10
active role in ensuring the accuracy of data. When a data mismatch was identified in 2012,
the MOBSE undertook data collection at the field-level to address the inconsistencies.

30.     The 2012 Restructuring allowed for a better alignment between project interventions
and its intended results. The decision to restructure was motivated, in large part, by the fact
that new population data projections had become available which could be used to adjust
baseline and target values for key performance indicators. The original values had been
specified using population data which was no longer up-to-date. At the time of the
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR), in order to provide an accurate
assessment of the trends across all indicators that relied on population data (those that were
kept throughout the Project and those which were dropped/introduced at Restructuring), all
baseline and end-of-project values were recalculated using the new population data
projections. The recalculated baselines and end-of-project targets were derived by employing
the same simulation model used by the preparation team. This was done in order to ensure that
achievements observed under the Project were accurately and fully captured. On the basis of
the information above, M&E quality under the Project is rated Modest.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environment and Safeguards

31.     The safeguard screening category for the project was S2, and the environmental
screening category was B. To assess and mitigate potential environmental and social impacts
of project activities, two safeguards instruments - an Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) - were prepared and
disclosed in-country and at the Bank InfoShop prior to appraisal. These two instruments
provided guidelines and standard methods and procedures, along with institutional
arrangements for preparation, approval, implementation and monitoring of specific
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) and Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs). These
plans were to be prepared as and when necessary during project implementation. However,
the small size of the civil works activities did not have significant negative environmental or
social impact that warranted the development of either an EMP or RAP.

Financial Management Compliance

32.     The FM system of the Government (PCU/MOBSE) was adequate during Project
implementation evidenced by: (i) qualified FM staff being in place; (ii) a computerized
accounting system established and functional; (iii) an adequate flow of funds system; (iv) the
establishment of an internal audit function in April 2012; and (v) a strong SMT in place to
monitor Project funds. In addition, the Government complied with the Development Grant
Agreement (DGA) provisions relating to the submission of the interim unaudited financial
reports and the audited financial statements.

33.   FM performance improved over the course of project implementation as indicated by
the FM implementation support mission reports with the Government responding to Bank’s
recommendations with concrete actions. These missions also noted that the quality of the

                                              11
interim unaudited financial reports had improved and the external auditor expressed an
unqualified opinion on the Project financial statements.

Procurement Compliance
34.    Procurement activities in the education sector were undertaken by the PCU which was
well-versed in IDA procedures as it had relevant experience from previous and on-going IDA-
funded projects. The procurement unit in the PCU functioned effectively having a
procurement specialist on board during most of the project life. When this specialist left, the
procurement unit was able to handle the remaining procurement activities according to
procedures. Procurement under the EFA FTI Project was Satisfactory throughout the life of
the Project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

35.      Next operation: The Results for Education Achievement and Development (READ)
project which is funded by IDA, the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), and the
Government is expected to become effective in April 2014. This operation will continue
many of the activities that were supported under the EFA FTI Project, including, among
others: (i) construction of multi-grade schools in remote areas; (ii) construction of water
points within new construction sites; (iii) provision of donkey carts as transportation to school
for young students; (iv) provision of supplemental readers; (v) support to PTC and HTC
teacher trainees through classroom observations, distance learning, and stipends; (vi)
provision of hardship allowances to teachers in disadvantaged communities; (vii) training of
teachers on early grade literacy skills; (viii) completion of NATs for grades, 3, 5, and 8; (ix)
statistical capacity-building activities among MOBSE staff; and (x) support for bi-monthly
CCMs and Inter-Ministerial SMT meetings in Regions 1-6.

36.     There will be approximately eight months between the end of the EFA FTI CF project
(which closed on September 30, 2013) and the launch of the READ project (planned for April
2014). To support activities during the transition period, the Government received a Project
Preparation Advance (PPA) for US$1.4 million (approved in September 2013). The activities
under the PPA include: (i) Early Grade Reading and Math Assessments (EGRA and EGMA);
(ii) support to the evaluation of the Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) and CCT
programs for daaras; (iii) continuous professional development training for LBS; (iv) support
to the reading and national languages initiatives; (v) school-level monitoring by clusters,
regional directorates and headquarters; (vi) support to ECD activities; (vii) support to The
Gambia College; (viii) capacity-building in statistics and integration of the EMIS and HR
databases; and (ix) the preparation of an ESMF and an RPF.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

37.     Relevance of Objectives. The relevance of the PDO (both prior to and following the
project restructuring) is rated Substantial. The PDO remains: (i) highly relevant to the
current country's sector needs; (ii) aligned with the new READ project which will be effective
in 2014; and (iii) consistent with the overall objectives of the Education Sector Strategic Plan
(ESSP) (2014-2023) and the MTP (2014-2017). Further, it was aligned with the JAS (2009-
2013) and is aligned with the current JAS (2013-2016) in which human capital development is
a main pillar. Moreover, the PDO was linked to with the larger World Bank Education
strategy which focuses on Learning for All. The PDO remained the same after restructuring –
apart from the exclusion of ECD activities. As the JSDF had provided the majority of support
for ECD activities (including through pilot activities), it was agreed that the EFA FTI Project
should not be held accountable for outcomes related to these activities. At the same time,
given the importance of ECD to the Government moving forward, the new READ project
(P133079 IDA/GPE) will provide further support in this area.

38.    Following the Restructuring, as mentioned above, the PDO was only slightly modified
to exclude ECD activities as these were primarily supported by the JSDF. The revised PDO
remained highly relevant to the Government’s strategic objectives in the sector and more
accurately reflected the Bank’s decision to narrow its focus to improving teaching and
learning in LBS.

39.     Relevance of Design. The relevance of the project design was Substantial. As the
second phase of EFA FTI program in its series, the EFA FTI Project built on the achievements
and lessons learnt under the previous operations including: (i) attention to ensuring
sustainability; (ii) creation of performance-based financial and non-financial incentives; (iii)
sustained attention to quality of teacher training; and (iv) the importance of high-level of
coordination among actors in the sector. The Project’s dual aims of expanding access and
equity in underserved areas and improving the quality of learning were valid and are still
relevant in The Gambian context today. The Project included well-established approaches to
increase access with equity (such as construction/rehabilitation of classrooms and water points
– providing opportunities for children in rural areas as well as girls to attend school) while
also introducing and further developing evidence-based approaches to improve teaching and
learning outcomes, including: (i) support to early reading in national languages; and (ii)
teacher incentives (e.g., providing hardship allowances to teachers and stipends to student-
teachers).

40.     The Project also introduced innovative demand-side support activities (e.g., providing
donkey carts to reduce travel time to school and CCTs for daaras). Strengthening of
management and institutional capacity efforts (Component 3) achieved more than what had
been initially envisaged (e.g., supporting the design of the NAT and EGRAs as well as the
country status report (CSR)). Building on the success of the EFA FTI-supported
interventions, the READ Project will continue to support and build on several of these
activities including strengthening EMIS and NAT and building technical capacity to carry out

                                              13
analytical work to improve quality and efficiency of the education sector. Given the READ
Project’s results-based focus, these will be particularly important as the Government
strategically prioritizes and sequences its activities in the sector.

41.     Relevance of Implementation. The relevance of project implementation is rated
Substantial both before and after restructuring. Prior to restructuring, progress towards
achievement of the PDO was Satisfactory characterized by smooth and timely implementation
of activities. The approach and activities under the EFA FTI Project were specifically
requested by the Government and the FTI and Bank were the main donors providing support
to quality and capital investments. There were a number of achievements observed prior to
restructuring including: (i) technical upgrades of EMIS; (ii) completion of technical studies
(including the school mapping exercise); (iii) introduction of pilot activities (e.g., providing
donkey carts, sanitary supplies to girls, reading instruction in national languages, and training
in sign language); (iv) construction/rehabilitation of needed infrastructure throughout the
country (including in rural areas); (v) training of teachers; and (vi) development of new
curricula. Implementation of project activities was generally steady with more than one-half
of project activities completed by the Project’s MTR in April 2011. Though the Project was
restructured one year prior to project closing, the same trend for implementation was observed
during this period with progress made on all project activities – with many interventions
achieving more than initially envisaged (e.g., assessments including the EGRA and NAT,
supporting CCTs in daaras, etc.).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

42.     Assessment of PDO-level Indicators. The overall rating for the achievement of the
PDO is Moderately Satisfactory both for the period before and after the 2012 Restructuring.
A review of the PDO-level indicators shows positive trends for improvements in teaching and
learning and an increase in equitable access to education in The Gambia. Most of these,
including most notably the significant increase in GER, was important because it reflects a
core EFA goal and is strongly emphasized in the Government’s sector strategy and action
plan. This section describes achievements across the various components and associated
indicators for the periods before and after restructuring. The initial baseline and target values
were developed using a simulation model (2008) linked to the Government’s ESP. At the end
of 2011/early 2012, however, updated population projection data were validated by The
Gambia Bureau of Statistics. In order to accurately measure progress under the Project, the
ICR team used the new data to recalculate baseline and end-of-project targets (for all
indicators – including those which were dropped at restructuring). These new values were
calculated by employing the same simulation model which had originally been developed and
used during project preparation in 2008. Detailed information on project activities and outputs
can be found in Annex 2.




                                               14
Prior to restructuring

PDO-level indicators

43.     Increased access and equity. Component 1 supported a number of activities designed
to increase access and equity, including: (i) building and rehabilitating classrooms and staff
quarters; (ii) procuring donkey carts to reduce the time needed to travel to school for young
children; (iii) providing sanitary pads for girls to reduce drop out/absenteeism among them;
(iv) constructing separate toilets for girls; (v) providing financial assistance to disadvantaged
boys; (vi) supplying labor saving devices for mothers’ clubs, which in turn reduced the time
daughters were spending on chores freeing up time for them to focus on studies; and (vii)
providing special needs education.

44.     In terms of increasing equitable access, most PDO-level indicators show positive
trends in gross enrollment and intake rates in LBS and UBS. In LBS, the intake rate increased
from 102 percent to 117 percent by end-of-project surpassing the target of 111 percent.
Although the PDO-level indicators did not include measures of equity until changes were
introduced in the RF under the Restructuring (with gender parity remaining constant in LBS
across the project life), positive trends were observed more generally in terms of equity. For
example, increases in GERs were particularly salient in Regions 5 and 6, the poorest and most
disadvantaged in the country – where enrollment increased significantly among the
madrassas. Further, girls’ enrollment increased at a faster rate than that of boys’ likely
attributable (at least in part) to a number of demand-side interventions (e.g., provision of
scholarships, sanitary pads, construction of toilets) supported by GPE- and IDA-funded
projects over the previous decade.

45.     Improved conditions for learning and teaching. Activities supported by the EFA
FTI Project to improve teaching and learning in The Gambia (under Component 2) included:
(i) providing essential learning packages; (ii) supporting teacher training at The Gambia
College; (iii) strengthening assessment systems of the West African Examination Council
(WAEC); (iv) improving curriculum; (v) monitoring of teaching and learning in schools; and
(vi) supporting HIV/AIDS Education Sector response and strengthening CSOs. Completion
rates in LBS increased from 66 to 76 percent by the end of the Project and the percentage of
qualified teachers increased to 92.6 percent (far exceeding the target value of 80 percent).
Since some achievements are a result of important reforms (e.g., new policies on fee abolition
and incentive structures), it is likely that these trends will continue over the next several years.

46.      Under Component 3, project activities that aimed to strengthen management and
institutional capacities of central and regional systems included: (i) strengthening the data
management system (the EMIS) as well as the information, education and communication
(IEC) system and overall M&E and reporting; and (ii) providing information technology (IT)
equipment and consumables. The PDO-level indicator (the establishment of a fully functional
PMS) used to measure achievements under this Component was achieved in full by
restructuring. The new system, fully developed under the EFA FTI Project can be used for
staff at all levels and a DfID-funded analysis was used to develop service level agreements for
each role. Further, the system was introduced at the highest levels of the education system and

                                                15
extended to all teachers in government schools in 2011-2012. Within this new system,
teachers were asked to sign agreements on a number of performance indicators (e.g., on-time
attendance, delivery of lessons as planned, and providing feedback to students) and an
incentive structure was introduced for MOBSE (e.g., provision of performance bonuses).
These measures introduced an important aspect of accountability to the sector. Data from the
PMS have allowed the sector to identify good practices and to guide the development of
informed decisions which, in turn, have guided corrective action. Support in this domain
complemented activities under the ongoing IDA project and benefited from funding from the
Government’s national budget thus contributing to its sustainability.

Intermediate-level indicators

47.     In the period prior to restructuring, progress was observed across a number of the
intermediate-level indicators related to improving accessing with equity (Component 1),
including, most notably, the construction and rehabilitation of 174 classrooms. Further, the
Project was able to maintain gender parity while also increasing children’s access to
education. The NER, however, did not improve significantly during this period. Under
Component 2, notable progress was made in terms of the teacher pupil ratio and pupil
textbook ratio in both LBS and UBS; and a growing portion of schools created development
plans. Additionally, competency levels as measured by the NAT showed a positive trend
during this same period. By the time of restructuring, 181 madrassa teachers had been
trained; CCTs were provided to daaras; materials for core and non-core subjects had been
developed; and students in 125 classrooms were being taught reading in national languages
every day. As mentioned previously, however, two intermediate-level indicators under this
Component, however, could not be measured, specifically the number of: (a) annual
instruction hours; and (b) hours devoted to reading (by region) as data were not available.
Under Component 3, both indicator targets were achieved including: (a) an increase in the
education share of the budget; and (b) the availability of sector statistics on an annual basis.
MOBSE significantly improved the EMIS and the availability of school-level statistics during
this period which was an important aspect facilitating the start-up of semi-annual joint sector
reviews in 2010. The school mapping exercise had also been completed and the facilities
assessment survey had been undertaken.

Following Restructuring

PDO-level indicators

48.      As describe above, the 2012 Restructuring improved the alignment between project
activities and intended results – narrowing the focus of the operation by excluding ECD
activities and measures and concentrating efforts on improvements in LBS. Under the
Restructuring, the number of indicators was reduced thus simplifying the RF. Reflective of
the revised PDO, indicators related to ECD were dropped and the RF narrowed its focus to
capturing achievements made in LBS, and included a specific indicator related to gender
equity (GPI in LBS).




                                              16
49.     Most of the activities that had been initiated early in the Project life which aimed to
lead to increases in access and equity were continued under the restructured project. Key
among these activities was: (i) the construction of classrooms and water points; (ii) provision
of donkey carts; (iii) provision of girls’ sanitary pads; and (iv) support for special needs
education. In the period following restructuring, the GER for LBS (the only measure of
enrollment maintained after restructuring) reached 97 percent thus exceeding its end-of-
project target.

50.     Component 2 which focused on improvements in teaching and learning continued to
support: (i) intensive teacher training in reading instruction; (ii) an early grade reading pilot
in national languages; and (iii) support for successfully carrying out three rounds of EGRA.
Activities to strengthen the quality of teaching included: (i) continued provision of
supplementary readers; (ii) purchase of new textbooks and teacher guides; and (iii) support for
an increased focus on reading methodologies for student-teachers in The Gambia College.
The Project also funded student-teacher stipends, upgrading of teachers’ quarters, provision of
hardship allowances to teachers in remote areas, and supply of distance education materials to
teachers at the field-level.

51.     Improvements were observed across PDO-level indicators aligned with Component 2,
including: continued improvement in percentage of qualified teachers (as noted earlier, the
target was exceeded reaching 92.6 percent). With the newly revised RF, a PDO-level
indicator was added at the Restructuring to capture changes in EGRA outcomes – specifically
measuring the number of correct words per minute for grades 2 and 3. Though the baseline
figure is only available from 2009 as the assessment is only undertaken every few years, the
end-of-project values point to significant improvements in EGRA results in both grades 2 and
3. The PMS continued to function under the Project and provide important input into
decision-making related to the education sector. Finally, with the addition of new core
indicators, the reach of the Project and its attention to gender equity was evident – having
more than 332,377 beneficiaries more than half of whom were female (exceeding the end-of-
project target of 326,074).

Intermediate-level indicators

52.     In the period following restructuring, the pace of activities initiated in the early phase
of the EFA FTI Project continued to be steady. From Restructuring until project closing, an
additional 213 classrooms were constructed or rehabilitated (bringing the total to 396 –
reaching the revised target and almost reaching original target of 406). Equity improvements
were, following restructuring, captured with a PDO-level indicator (prior to restructuring it
was an intermediate-level indicator). With respect to improvements in the quality of teaching
and learning, gains were observed with the pupil-to-textbook ratio remaining steady in LBS
and improving in UBS (from 3:1 to 1:1 by project closing). The teacher-to-pupil ratio also
improved, achieving its target in UBS and almost in LBS. In addition, by the end of the
Project cluster monitors were undertaking four-hour visits to each school three times per week
while the original target had been to undertake one two-hour visit to each school per week.
Moreover, the indicator targets for mean scores in English and Math (in grade 3) were greatly
exceeded by the close of the Project. Finally, in terms of strengthened management and

                                               17
institutional capacity (Component 3), the sector continued to benefit from 20 percent of the
Government budget by 2013 – despite the Government’s large debt service and somewhat
fragile macroeconomic situation. Further, sector figures became available in the last year of
the project which has been useful in informing decision-making and addressing continued
challenges in the sector.

3.3 Efficiency

53.     The EFA FTI Project, which supported and complemented the Government strategy
and action plan for the education sector, continues to generate important economic gains for
the country. Research shows that average wage earnings rise steadily with increasing
educational attainment and age. Coefficients from a Mincerian wage regression analysis
reveal increasing returns to education as an individual progresses through each level of the
education system, even after controlling for other factors. The regression estimation for The
Gambia shows that an additional year of education results in about 6.1 percent higher wages.
The results also provide evidence that the marginal returns to education increase as an
individual progresses through each cycle of the education system (primary, secondary,
tertiary, etc.) (See Annex 3 for further details).

54.     Analysis of the EFA FTI Project implementation and outcomes points to a high level
of efficiency. There were positive trends in key quality indicators including, among others, an
increase in the portion of qualified teachers which is an important outcome observed under the
Project. A cost-effectiveness analysis under the IDA-funded Third Education Project assessed
the impact of investments in quality relative to the continued mass expansion of school
enrollment. The assessment found that without the investment in quality, it would take an
average of 8.93 years of investment to produce one graduate of LBS taking into account the
wastage due to dropout. With the investments in quality supported under the Project, EMIS
data show that it takes 6.59 years on average for a graduate to complete the cycle. The
improved efficiency results in a reduced total cost equivalent to producing one primary school
graduate from an estimated US$190 to US$179.

55.     Under the Project, there have also been improvements in early reading outcomes.
Following the poor results of the 2007 EGRA, the Government committed to undertaking
concrete actions to improve teaching and learning of reading for young children and has, to
this end, supported three major literacy programs including: Jolly Phonics, SEGRA and the
EFA FTI Project supported Early Literacy in National Languages (ENINL) program. The
most recent rounds of EGRA show a significant drop in the percentage of children who could
not read anything by the end of project. Further, all teachers in primary schools in The
Gambia had received training on teaching phonics. Not only was the ELINL pilot well-
received in communities – a recent study found that students who participated in the ELINL
pilot program improved more in all aspects of reading skills after five months than those
students who did not participate in the Program (control group).




                                              18
56.     The provision of hardship allowances, initiated under the first phase of the EFA FTI to
attract qualified teachers to remote (hardship) areas has been effective. A recent independent
evaluation of hardship allowances 8 shows that the proportion of qualified teachers in hard-to-
reach schools increased at a faster rate than that observed for non-hard to reach schools
leading to a pupil-per-qualified teacher ratio of 30:1 in hardship schools. District offices
reported a growing number of experienced teachers requesting to be transferred to a hardship
school.

57.     Finally, construction of schools and classrooms and provision of textbooks under the
Project were cost-effective when evaluated when compared to a number of other African
countries. The operation provided a total of 565,058 textbooks and teachers’ guides for
grades 5 and 6 and 180,146 for grades 7 through 9 at a unit cost of US$0.60. These costs are
on the lower end when compared to unit costs in other countries (Burundi – US$1.15 9; Eritrea
– US$0.60 10; and Mauritania – US$0.73 11). 12 School construction costs under the Project also
compare favorably when evaluated relative to costs of similar types of construction
undertaken by other development partners during the same time period. Specifically, the unit
cost per classroom 13 under the NGO-arrangement ranged from US$15,336 to US$18,199.
Similar structures built around the same time by the AfDB cost approximately US$19,412
while those built by BADEA were as high as US$31,404 (see Annex 3 for further details).

58.      Project implementation was also efficient. The EFA FTI Project was implemented in
less than four years and the full grant amount was entirely disbursed by project closing.
Although the original scope of construction/rehabilitation activities (e.g., classroom, water
point construction, etc.) was reduced from what was originally envisaged, a number of
activities which produced a substantial number of outputs and reached a large number of
beneficiaries were completed under the Project (as presented above and detailed in Annexes 2
and 3). Since IDA was the main donor in the sector and had been a key partner in the
implementation of both the EFA FTI (Phase I) and the Third Education Project, it was able to
rely on existing structures (e.g., the PCU in the MOBSE) which had proven to be effective
and it was able to leverage financing to scale up activities which had been initiated under the
Projects. Also, in light of this arrangement, the Project’s operating costs were low as they
were borne primarily by IDA under the Third Education Project and by other partners in the
sector. Finally, project implementation also benefitted from the fact that the core Bank team
remained largely unchanged throughout project implementation as senior management within
the Government also remained in place. In light of the above (and as described in further
detail in Annex 3), efficiency is rated High.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

59.     The project objective and design were highly relevant to the country’s sector needs
and fit squarely into the Government’s strategic plan. The Project’s dual focus on issues of
equitable access and quality were important in paving the way for long-term gains in the
delivery of education services. This Project was one of the first in the region to explicitly
include quality improvements as a key feature of the PDO. This Project also introduced
innovative and evidence-based measures to address key constraints to improving access,
equity, quality of teaching and learning and overall management of the sector including,
among others, efforts to increase the proportion of qualified teachers in the sector by
introducing reforms such as performance incentive structures for teachers and increasing
access to school among young children by providing donkey carts to facilitate their
transportation to and from school. This has laid the groundwork for the forthcoming READ
Project which draws on and scales up many of the activities initiated under EFA FTI Project.
Notwithstanding these features and important achievements, some of the planned activities
were either scaled down (e.g., number of water points and classrooms
constructed/rehabilitated) or abandoned (e.g., ECD activities as these were funded by the
JSDF). The Restructuring introduced important modifications (related to the Project’s
alignment with the PDO and revised targets), though this was accomplished with some delay.
In light of the above, the overall outcome rating for the Project is Moderately Satisfactory
(see Table 1 below).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
60.     Poverty Impact, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. The Project focused on
improving equity by supporting interventions in disadvantaged areas and promoting school
attendance among girls. Some of the main activities undertaken to improve equitable access to
education were: school construction/rehabilitation in rural areas; provision of hardship
allowances; provision of scholarships for disadvantaged boys; and supply of sanitary pads and
construction of separate toilets for girls. Under the Project, increases in GER were
particularly salient in Regions 5 and 6, the poorest and most disadvantaged in the country –
where enrollment increased significantly among the madrassas. Further, girls’ enrollment
increased at a faster rate than that of boys.

61.     Institutional Change/Strengthening. The Project played an important role in further
strengthening the MOBSE by: (i) supporting TA in data collection, management and
analysis; (ii) providing equipment needed for EMIS and for undertaking M&E activities; (iii)
capacity-building in project management, procurement and FM; and (iv) the development of a
PMS for the sector. Together, these activities further developed the MOBSE’s capacity to
implement, manage and monitor activities in the sector.

62.    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative). There are no other
unintended outcomes or impacts other than what has been reported.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

63.     Although identified risks, mitigation measures, and ratings during project preparation
were mostly appropriate, a few challenges were encountered during implementation, which
were not properly identified during project appraisal. Specifically, the risk related to
preparation needed for classroom construction/rehabilitation had not been adequately
considered which ultimately resulted in an extension of the project closing date. Though
delays in textbook printing and publishing posed a challenge – this could not have been
foreseen at project preparation as it was not originally supported under the EFA FTI Project
but was instead funded under the ongoing Third Education Project. At the same time, this risk
was not identified and/or described in the Restructuring documents in 2012. Table 2 describes
those risks identified during project preparation and evaluates their appropriateness at the time
of the ICR.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

65.     The overall objectives of the operation were informed by higher level strategies and
action plans for the country and sector as spelled out in the ESP, MTP, the JAS and the PRSP.
It also drew on key analytical studies related to the sector and lessons learned through the
Bank’s long-term experience in The Gambia and in other similar settings. This Project was
one of the first in the Region to have an explicit focus on improving the quality of education
services. The Bank also secured buy-in from other actors including those participating in the
LEG beginning in the design phase. The Bank exercised its comparative advantage by: (i)
employing implementation arrangements (i.e., using structures and entities) which had a
proven track record and were well-functioning including the existing FM and procurement
arrangements; and (ii) filling an important financing gap as the largest donor to the sector.
The Project design included important measures to promote access, improve quality and
strengthen management through a variety of traditional approaches and innovative pilots
which proved to be effective.

66.     Despite these positive features, there were moderate shortcomings which influenced
quality at entry. In particular, the design: lacked a well-established M&E system to regularly
collect data to report on all of the PDO- and intermediate-level indicators; had an overly
complex (and at times redundant) RF matrix; and was built around inaccurate estimations of
unit costs at appraisal which led to a scaling back of some of the originally envisaged project
activities (e.g., construction/rehabilitation of schools, water points, teacher housing units, etc.)
that could be completed under the Project. On the basis of the information discussed above,
Bank performance in ensuring Quality at Entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

67.     The Bank team was comprised of staff and consultants with the appropriate skills mix,
in terms of operations, education sector support, procurement, FM, and M&E. The Bank held
regular missions, often with FM and procurement staff, which in many cases included field
visits. The Bank was responsive to Government needs – maintaining a high level of
engagement with the Government and proposing measures to address issues faced under
project implementation as they arose. In addition to the strong policy dialogue maintained
with the Government, the Bank participated in semi-annual joint reviews chaired by MOBSE
which promoted coordination and harmonization of activities in the sector. Further,
knowledge transfer and capacity-building was achieved through a number of reverse

                                                23
supervision missions in DC attended by senior MOBSE officials which included sessions
with experts from different sector/regions in the Bank on subjects such as on ICT in
education, time on task, second chance education and school visits. These allowed the
Government to adapt those experiences to their own context. Finally, the Bank provided
technical advice to assist in the introduction of various pilot initiatives (e.g., donkey carts,
special education, CCT program, ELINL) and further supported knowledge generation
through the completion of a CSR, an economic and sector study on youth skills development
and employment, 14 and another study on the impact of the hardship allowance intervention 15,
among others.

68.     Though the restructuring of the Project was somewhat delayed (since the availability
of validated data necessary to adjust baseline and target values in the RF were only made
available in late 2011/early 2012), it introduced useful changes in the Project design.
Specifically, the decision to restructure was appropriate in that it further strengthened the
alignment between project objectives, activities and outcomes. At the same time, the data
provided evidence that the majority of the indicators were on track to achieve their end-of-
project targets suggesting that the Restructuring did not undermine those gains achieved in the
first few years of the Project. The Bank was proactive in ensuring that all project activities
were completed by project closing. As described earlier, there was consistency in the Bank
team throughout supervision which helped further cement a close working relationship with
the Government. On the basis of the information discussed above, Bank performance with
regards to the Quality of Supervision is rated Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

69.   Based on the performance of the Bank at entry and supervision and the overall
outcome rating, the rating for overall bank performance is Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

70.      From the early stages of project preparation, the Government demonstrated its high
level of commitment to working jointly with the Bank to tackle issues of quality, access and
equity in the sector and to ensure a coordinated approach among the various partners and
activities. This was evidenced by its leadership in organizing semi-annual joint sector reviews
beginning in 2010, holding inter-Ministerial SMT meetings and CCMs throughout the project
life and maintaining continued cooperation with the Bank team both at HQ and in the field.
As described above, this Project benefitted from the close partnership that had developed
between the Bank and Government teams – specifically, in the context of the previous phase
of the EFA FTI and the ongoing Third Education Project. The Bank was able to draw on and
strengthen this relationship from the earliest phase of project preparation.

71.     The MOBSE team remained constant throughout the Project life and had further
developed technical capacity in core functions (e.g., FM, procurement and M&E) relevant to
the Project. Further, the Government was willing to fund a number of activities that had been
successful under the first phase of the Project under its national budget, some of which
improved quality, accountability and incentives into the education sector. The MOBSE has,
in a few instances been recognized for its contribution by international organizations. On the
basis of the information discussed above, Government performance is rated Satisfactory.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

72.    As the PCU was housed within the MOBSE, the analysis pertaining to Government
(above) also captures the assessment of the only implementing agency (PCU/MOBSE) for this
EFA FTI Project. As such, implementing agency performance is rated Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

73.    On the basis of the Government performance under the Project, the overall Grantee
performance is rated Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
74.     Adopting an incremental approach to both capacity-building activities and efforts
to improve the quality of education services can be effective in a setting where the Bank
has a strong presence and a sound track record. Over the course of the Bank’s
involvement in the education sector, the Bank has been able to strengthen capacity and
education quality by building on existing activities and introducing small changes at each
juncture (under the Third Education Project and both phases of the EFA FTI). Cumulatively,
these changes have led to dramatic improvements in the overall education system. The READ
Project will also build on these and will benefit from the introduction of disbursement-linked
indicators which will also be important in further strengthening capacity and accountability
under the Project.

75.     Open and continued communication among all stakeholders is fundamental in
facilitating long-lasting and effective change in the education sector. Systematic
communication and collaboration during the Project life played an important role in achieving
key gains under the Project. Some examples of this included: bi-monthly CCMs to assess
progress on the ground and to promote exchange at the grassroots level; semi-annual joint
reviews which involved the active participation of development partners as well as teachers’
unions and student associations; and the Government’s dialogue with all populations
including those resistant to changes supported under the Project. As a result of the
Government’s leadership and willingness to adapt teaching to these communities’ cultural and
religious values, important breakthroughs were achieved under the Project (e.g., CCTs for
daaras).



                                             25
76.     Stability in the composition of Government and Bank teams can facilitate timely
implementation of project activities and the achievement of project development
objectives. Though consistency in teams across a project life cannot always be guaranteed,
continuity does bode well for effective and timely implementation of planned activities.
Senior management within the Government and technical experts within the Bank remained
relatively intact during project implementation and this facilitated cooperation in key
functional areas – having a positive impact on increasing the quality of basic education in The
Gambia.

77.     Contexts where the Bank has a long-standing partnership with the Government
provide a unique opportunity to introduce innovative approaches to address identified
needs. The active role that the Bank had played in the education sector and the long-term
support it had provided to the Government in this area, paved the way for the Bank to work
collaboratively with the Government as it introduced new and innovative approaches to
increasing both access to and quality of education in The Gambia (e.g., the first early reading
in national languages program).

78.     The selection of simple, specific, relevant and measurable indicators should be
prioritized. Although the quality and consistency of the RF improved over the life of the
Project, the original framework was overly complex. In some instances, indicators included
in the RF were redundant (increases in GER and NER) and in others no mechanism was in
place to regularly collect and report on data to measure progress under the Project (e.g.,
annual hours of instruction). Moreover, although the RF was generally aligned to the scope
and interventions of the Project, the original RF had a disproportionate number of indicators
related to UBS – an area where the project had a much more modest and discreet focus.

sanitary facilities
                                                  A combination of factors is responsible for this and these
                                                  include but not limited to the following: There was an oversight
                                                  in the unit cost at the time of project preparation. Lower unit
                                                  costs were used during the project preparation.

                                                  Use of the Delegated Management Contract (DMC) approach as
                                                  opposed to the framework agreement in the construction of 129
                                                  classrooms in the urban area with a unit cost higher than the
                                                  Framework Agreement contributed to the reduction of the target
                                                  number.
Rehabilitate 88 dilapidated classrooms            144 classrooms were rehabilitated.
200 water points                                  20 water points were developed (12 concrete-lined wells and 8
                                                  boreholes).

                                                  At project preparation the target of 200 sites included Region 6,
                                                  however, at implementation UNICEF committed to providing
                                                  all the identified sites in the region with water points as part of
                                                  their WATSAN Project. Given that Region 6 had the highest
                                                  number of sites in the initial plan, the number went down
                                                  drastically. The second factor that influenced the reduction of
                                                  the number of sites was the conversion of 8 sites from wells to
                                                  boreholes due to the depth of the water table. This decision had
                                                  financial implications in view of the fact that the cost of one
                                                  borehole is doubled the cost of a well. The third factor was an
                                                  increase in the unit cost of sinking a well, particularly in Region
                                                  5 where the depth of wells is well below 30 meters.

                                                  The MOBSE team visited all the sites twice in February/March
                                                  2013 and May/June 2013. The first visit was to observe if the
                                                  carts were functioning and if not, suggest solutions. The
                                                  purpose of the second visit was to see if the communities whose
                                                  carts were not functioning implemented the recommendations
                                                  provided during the first visit. At the first visit, 49 carts or 60
                                                  percent of the carts were functioning. The main reasons for
                                                  non- functioning donkey carts included: (i) the donkey had not
                                                  yet been purchased (although the money had already been

                                                         28
                                                provided to the communities); (ii) the donkey was sick or had
                                                died; (iii) the cart was heavy; and/or (iv) the cart had broken
                                                down or the tires were not functioning properly. These issues
                                                were tackled immediately after the first visit, and after the
                                                second visit, the communities which had unresolved issues were
                                                requested to return their carts. As a result, 72 carts (or 88
                                                percent of the total number of carts) became functional.

                        Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      This Annex provides an overview of the efficiency of the Project with regard to cost
effectiveness as well as implementation and external efficiency. In the external efficiency
sections, we present the rationale for investment in the education sector in The Gambia by
analyzing the labor market outcomes including rates of return to education. The second
section includes a cost-benefit analysis of the project interventions followed by sensitivity and
sustainability analyses.

Cost Effectiveness

2.      The EFA FTI Project, which supported and complemented the Government strategy
and action plan for the education sector, continues to generate important economic gains for
the country. Average wage earnings rise steadily with increasing educational attainment and
age. Mincerian wage regression coefficients reveal increasing returns to education as levels of
education goes up, even after controlling for other determinants. The regression estimation for
The Gambia shows that an additional year of education results in about 6.1 percent higher
wages. The results also provide evidence that the marginal returns to education increase as an
individual progresses through each cycle of the education system (primary, secondary,
tertiary, etc.).

3.      Analysis of EFA FTI Project implementation and outcomes points to a high level of
efficiency. First, there were positive trends in key quality indicators including, among others
increases in gross enrollment rates (GER) as well as a significant increase in the portion of
qualified teachers – both important outcomes observed under the Project. A cost-
effectiveness study was supported under the IDA project which assessed the impact of
investments in quality relative to the continued mass expansion of school enrollment. This
assessment found that without the investment in quality, it would take an average of 8.93
years of investment to produce one graduate of LBS taking into account the loss due to
dropout. With the investments in quality supported under the Project, recent EMIS data show
that it takes 6.59 years on average for a graduate to complete the cycle. The improved
efficiency results in a reduced total cost equivalent of producing one primary school graduate
from an estimated US$190 to US$179.

4.      Under the Project, there have also been improvements in early reading outcomes.
Following the poor results of the 2007 EGRA, the Government committed to concrete actions
to improve teaching and learning of reading for young children and has, to this end, supported
three major literacy programs including Jolly Phonics, SEGRA and the EFA FTI supported
Early Literacy in National Languages (ENINL) program. The most recent rounds of EGRA
show a significant drop in the percentage of children who could notread anything by the end
of the Project, all teachers in primary schools in The Gambia had received training on phonics
teaching. Not only was the ELINL pilot well received in communities – a recent study found
that students who participated in the ELINL pilot program improved more in all aspects of
reading skills after five months than those students who did not participate (control group).




                                               34
5.      The provision of hardship allowances, initiated under the first phase of the EFA FTI to
attract qualified teachers to remote (hardship) areas has been effective. A recent independent
evaluation of hardship allowances 17 shows that proportion of qualified teachers in hard-to-
reach schools increased at a faster rate than that for non-hard to reach schools leading to a
pupil per qualified teacher ratio of 30:1 in hardship schools. District offices reported
experienced teachers requesting transfers to a hardship school.

6.     The construction of schools and classrooms and provision of textbooks under the
Project were cost-effective when evaluated when compared to a number of other African
countries. The operation provided a total of 565,058 textbooks and teachers’ guides for grades
5-6 and 180,146 for grades 7-9 at a unit cost of US$0.60. These costs are on the lower end
when compared to unit costs in other countries (Burundi – US$1.15 18; Eritrea – US$0.60 19;
and Mauritania – US$0.73 20). 21

7.      In order to analyze the cost efficiency of school construction, the actual unit cost of a
new classroom was compared to similar projects supported by other partners in The Gambia
during the same time period. During the course of the project execution, two other partners
financed school construction the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA)
and the Africa Development Bank (AfDB). Under the EFA FTI Project, two different
approaches were used for school construction – one where the construction was undertaken by
through a delegated management contract (DMC) arrangement and another where the
construction was undertaken by an NGO (FIOH). The difference in cost when comparing
these two approaches was quite different where (for six-classroom blocks), the cost under the
NGO (FIOH) arrangement was considerably lower (24.5 percent). Later in project
implementation, the cost remained higher under the NGO arrangement but the difference in
costs between the two arrangements had decreased. Quality and pace of construction under
the NGO arrangements were more favorable than those built under the DMC arrangement.

8.      School construction costs under the Project also compare favorably when evaluated
relative to costs of similar types of construction undertaken by other development partners
during the same time period, specifically, the unit cost per classroom 22 under the NGO-
arrangement ranged from US$15,336 to US$18,199. Similar structures built around the same
time by the AfDB cost approximately US$19,412 while those built by BADEA were as high
as US$31,404.

9.     Project implementation was also efficient. The Project was implemented in less than
four years and all funds had been disbursed by project closing. Although the original scope of
construction activities (e.g., classroom, water point construction, etc.) was reduced from what

was originally envisaged, a number of activities which produced a substantial number of
outputs and reached a large number of beneficiaries were completed under the Project. Key
among these was the provision of supplemental readers to 241,284 LBS and UBS students and
EGRA pocket readers to 98,451 LBS and UBS students. Since IDA was the main donor in
the sector and had been a key partner in the implementation of both the first phase of the EFA
FTI and the Third Education Project, it was able to rely on existing structures (e.g. PCU in the
MOBSE) which had proven to be effective and it was also able to leverage financing to scale
up activities which had been initiated under the Project. Also, in light of this arrangement, the
Project’s operating costs were low given as they were borne primarily by IDA under the Third
Education Project and by other development partners in the sector. Finally, project
implementation also benefitted from the fact that the core Bank team remained largely
unchanged throughout project implementation as senior management within the Government
also remained in place. In light of the above, the efficiency is rated Substantial.

External Efficiency

Economic Context

10.    The Gambia is one of the poorest countries in the world. It is mostly rural and its
economy is largely supported by agriculture. GDP growth has shown mixed signals in the last
decade yet poverty has not significantly declined, decreasing only from 58 percent in 2003 to
48.4 percent in 2010. The GMD Budget Allocation to the education sector over the last ten
years has been consistently increasing - peaking in 2010 at 5.2 percent of GDP and currently
standing at 4.2 percent of GDP. Government expenditure on education has increased five-fold
– from 203 million in 2001 to about 1,039 million GMD in 2011. The allocation today,
however, is lower than the ECOWAS average which stands at about 4.6 percent.

11.     Most individuals with low education levels are in low-paid services jobs and/or work
in the agricultural sector. Higher education is, to a large extent, a prerequisite for higher-paid
occupations as shown in Figure 1 and this is corroborated by findings of Hasan and Jandoc
(2008) 23. The informal sector absorbs for the most part the less skilled labor while the formal
sector attracts the highly skilled and educated – the sector which usually offers better
remuneration.

12.    Analysis of labor market data from the Integrated Household Survey (IHS) 2010
shows wide disparities in wages by level of education attainment providing evidence of the
importance of investing in education. Figure 2 below shows that average wage earnings
increase steadily as educational attainment and age increase. Generally, younger and older
populations receive lower wages with wages peaking between the ages of 40 and 50. A
higher level of education is associated with a higher lifetime earning horizon thus
underscoring the economic rationale for investments in education.

13.    The Mincerian wage regression coefficients also show increasing returns to education
as levels of education increases, even after controlling for other factors. Similar to results
from many other developing countries, the regression analysis shows that an additional year
of education results in about 6.1 percent higher wages in The Gambia. In particular, people

                                                                             37
with higher levels of education prefer to work in wage/salaried jobs, and the breakdown of
education by levels gives further insight into the rates of return to education investment. In
general, those who attain a higher level of education receive greater returns from their
investments in education. For example, workers with a primary education earn 27 percent
more than workers with no education, controlling for all other variables. Similarly, those with
a secondary education earn 35 percent more than those with primary education while those
with technical and vocational education and training (TVET) earn 7 percent more than those
with a secondary education (holding all other factors constant). Finally, this analysis shows
that on average those with higher education earn 33 percent more than those with TVET
(Figure 3).

14.     This analysis highlights the pivotal role that education plays in wage earnings. In turn,
this provides evidence that investment in education at both the primary and secondary levels
is important.

15.     In this section, the impact of education on people's behaviors is analyzed using
econometric models. The data allow us to discern identifying the contribution of each grade
and each level of schooling to behavioral changes. Table 1 shows some of the key results
emerging from the models. Some of the most significant include the finding that the
completion of lower basic education is associated with a lower probability of being poor
(compared to not having completed lower basic education) and that both having no education
or just two years of lower basic education are associated with a higher probability of being
poor.

  Cost-benefit analysis

  16.     The benefits of the Project are captured in terms of access and equity and quality
  enhancements. Separate cost-benefit analyses were conducted for access and equity
  (Component 1) and quality enhancement and management support (Components 2 and 3).
  The access and equity analysis is based on labor market outcomes data while quality
  enhancement analysis is based on a combination of these data and findings from global
  research on quality and quantity correlations. The cost-benefit analysis of access and equity is
  fully quantifiable and is analyzed in relation to an individual’s lifetime earnings as a result of
  better learning. The analysis also provides an evaluation of the project interventions’
  intermediate benefits. The stream of benefits deriving from the quality enhancement activities
  is estimated using standard benefit findings from similar interventions in other countries.
  Thus, the analysis provided herein employs two different methods to estimate the benefit
  streams associated with the Project.

  17.      The first analysis focuses on the benefit of construction and/or rehabilitation
  interventions (e.g., classrooms, teachers’ quarters). It should be noted that some interventions
  affect both quality and quantity aspects of the observed outcomes, and therefore, the quality
  outcomes associated with Component 1 have been excluded in order to show the lower bound
  of the Project’s benefits. The second analysis focuses on the (direct and indirect) impact of
  project activities on quality improvements. The direct impact of interventions can be
  measured by looking at improvements in student learning through the provision of learning
  materials (e.g., textbooks, library materials, pocket and supplementary readers) as well as
  CCT, and learning assessments, while the indirect impact can be understood by analyzing
  activities such as offering incentives for teachers to relocate to hardship areas and providing
  teacher training. This analysis builds on existing research which explores the relationship




                                                                               39
between education interventions and student learning outcomes (mainly test scores) 24 and the
impact of learning outcomes (particularly cognitive skills) on labor market outcomes (mainly
earnings) 25. The summary of the results of the analysis are presented below.

18.     Since project benefits outweigh the associated direct and indirect costs (even under the
constitutive assumptions of the project benefits and incremental and forgone opportunity
costs, etc.), the two estimates are combined for the cost-benefit estimates based on plausible
assumptions and are presented together for sensitivity analysis. 26

Assumptions for cost-benefit analysis

19.     For this analysis, several assumptions are made about the Project and the associated
(opportunity and recurrent) costs and benefits. As most of the assumptions are used in both
models, those which are common to both are presented first and those unique to each analysis
are presented later in the text.

20.       The assumptions relevant to both models are the following:

      •   Since the analysis takes into account only quantifiable benefits, it is assumed that the
          internal rate of return (IRR) is the lower bound for the impact of the Project;
      •   Although the current lending rate is 12 percent, because projects benefits are very
          high, a discount rate of 15 percent is assumed;
      •   The official exchange rate is set at 33.0 GMD per US$1;
      •   A wage rate is estimated for different levels of education and age, using data from the
          IHS 2010 for the benefit and opportunity cost estimates;
      •   The earning rate per level of education and cognitive skills remains the same over the
          benefits time span except for inflation adjustment;
      •   Earning difference remains the same across the beneficiary’s life span (in labor
          market) in the base scenario. Although increasing quality of education increases
          wages, the content earning is assumed to take the lower bound of the IRR; and
      •   Primary school starting age is 7 years old.




24
   The first relationship (impact of intervention on learning outcomes) is based on findings from Schiefelbein,
Wolff & Paulina Schiefelbein (1998): “Cost-Effectiveness of Education Policies in Latin America: A Survey of
Expert Opinion”. The authors used a similar method when studying cost-effectiveness of education policies in
English speaking Africa countries (only focusing, however, on the experience of six countries). This analysis,
therefore, draws largely on the initial research in Latin America (while using the research in Africa as part of the
sensitivity analysis).
25
   There is a considerable body of research on the impact of cognitive ability (as measured by test scores) on
earnings (Patrinos and Sakellariou 2007; Green and Riddell 2001; Moll 1998: Glewwe 1996; Murnane 1995,
Jolliffe (1998), Vijverberg (1999), Boissiere, Knight and Sabot (1985); Knight and Sabot (1990). On average,
incremental earnings range from 13 percent to 20 percent per one standard deviation on the test score.
26
   This is defined as a partial tangible intervention in order to indicate that the model only captures the effect on
learning outcomes while the investment on capacity building could have several other impacts (including on
poverty reduction, health outcomes, fiscal space and other non- economic benefits and potential economic
benefits other than those from cognitive skills).

                                                        40
21.       The assumption for access and equity intervention include the following:

      •   Costs for the access and equity component equal about 34 percent of the total project
          costs;
      •   Unit costs are estimated for public (Government) and private (household) spending
          and included as part of the total cost (so that the IRR is at its lowest bound). (Note that
          the new READ Project aims to eliminate some of the costs that the households cover
          but we assume that some costs still remain in order to arrive at the lower bound of the
          IRR);
      •   Some costs associated with project implementation during and after project
          interventions remain the same but different maintenance rates are assumed for
          sensitivity analysis;
      •   Unemployment rate by level of education is assumed to remain the same after the
          Project although quality improvements might increase the chance of employment to
          confirm to the lower bound benefit assumption. The age of entry into the labor market
          is 18 and estimated earnings by age and by education level (no education primary,
          secondary, TVET and higher education) 27 are made using IHS 2010. The incremental
          earning benefit is defined as the difference between the earnings associated with
          attainment of each additional level of education relative to the attainment of the
          preceding level (e.g. primary attainment compared to lower secondary attainment);
      •   Project beneficiaries are assumed to be in the labor market for a period of 30 years;
      •   The schools are assumed to provide services for 40 years for the base scenario and this
          assumption is reduced to shorter periods for sensitivity analysis;
      •   Classroom size and student teacher ratio estimates are taken from the EMIS (29 and
          27, respectively) for lower basic education; and
      •   Benefits of the Project are estimated for those expected to complete lower basic
          education using the current survival rate to the last grade of primary school.

22.     The benefits of the quality interventions are based on various findings of the
relationship of education interventions with learning outcomes, as well as learning and labor
market outcomes. 28 29



27
   To determine the incremental wage at each level of education attainment after leaving school.
28
   This analysis uses research by Schiefelbein et al. on the impact of education interventions, and research
findings on learning outcomes and labor market relationships from developing countries.
29
   Although average measures are used for the baseline estimate, the estimated values can be affected by country
specific context, implementation efficiency and school management system which require several alternative
scenarios to be considered as robust. For example, the study by Schiefelbein et al. shows that of the 40
interventions assessed, a divergence of one standard deviation from the mean had an impact, on average, of 10.3
percent on learning outcomes (test score). They further estimated the probability of adequate implementation of
the intervention to be 62.8 percent - leading to an overall actual impact of 6.5 percent (10.3*62.8 percent).
Similarly, findings from the labor market show that one standard deviation from the mean in cognitive skills
(learning outcome or test score) results in a 0.17 to 0.22 proportional increase in wages29. Therefore, the ideal
intervention with these profiles increase earnings from 1.1 percent (6.5 percent*0.17) to 1.4 percent (6.5
percent*0.22).


                                                      41
        •   The minimum qualification considered is completion of secondary education (in
            order to estimate the lower bound of the IRR). The data from IHS 2010 show a
            completion rate of 30 percent;
        •   Although secondary completion rate can be improved over the project lifetime, it is
            assumed at the current rate of 30 percent (to take the lower bound of the IRR);
        •   The number of project beneficiaries are estimated using IHS 2010 and EMIS data;
        •   Project beneficiaries are assumed to be in the labor market for 30 years;
        •   Labor market entry age is 18; and
        •   The unemployment rate of beneficiaries is estimated using HIS 2010 data.

23.     The cost-benefit analysis of the access and quality interventions supported under the
Project reveals a strong and convincing rationale for this investment even under conservative
assumptions. Table 2 below presents the cost-benefit analysis results for the base scenario.
The cost-benefit analysis of the access and quality interventions supported under the Project
reveals a strong and convincing rationale for this investment even under conservative
assumptions. Both IRR and NPV of costs and benefits for all components (combined) show
that the Project is economically viable. Under the conservative assumption, the lower bound
based on the present discounted value of benefits for the overall project is estimated to be
US$53.65 million while the present discounted value of costs is estimated to be US$24.41
million (US$18.89 million project cost and US$5.57 other costs). The corresponding NPV of
program benefits is US$26.77 million and the IRR associated with this NPV is 21 percent.
Therefore, although some benefits are not fully quantifiable, the NPV is still larger than the
discounted present value of total costs. This strongly supports investment in the project and
the fact that the projects benefits are higher relative to the targeted number of benefices at
project preparation stage.

Sensitivity Analysis

24.    Sensitivity analysis was conducted by changing key parameters from the already
presented assumptions. Given that the above IRR is generated based on conservative
assumptions of the benefits, sensitivity analyses show that improvement in the quality of

                                                        42
education should result in an improvement in cognitive skills which would result in a
monetary benefit yet this highly depends on the quality of implementation (which as indicated
in the text, has been very successful). Given that the Project was fully implemented, the risks
associated with implementation are minor and are largely related to the sustainability of some
items and facilities such as donkey carts and school buildings. In addition, there is some risk
that some individuals, despite acquiring new skills and knowledge through education, will not
be able to find gainful employment. The sensitivity analysis considered such factors. The
sensitivity analysis looked at the worst case and best case scenarios to provide the lower and
upper bound of the benefits. In particular, two of the main indicators were given the following
“extreme” values: school survival (at least 60 percent survive to last grade of primary
whereas the current figure is 82 percent) and completion rates (at least 20 percent complete
high school where as the current rate is 30 percent), employment rate, (at least 75 percent
whereas the current rate is 93.5 percent), earning differential by level of education (decrease
25 percent between level of education), life span of the building (minimum 20 years, base
year 30 years), length of labor market engagement (minimum 20 years, base year 30 years),
unit cost (doubled public and private unit costs, given that unit costs decreases as access
increases), and maintenance and operating costs (15 percent for the worst scenario and 2
percent for the best scenario). The results are presented below.

25.     The sensitivity analysis provides some indication that as a result of the Project the
number of beneficiaries exceeded the original estimates (though fewer new classrooms were
constructed given the revised costs of construction). Under assumptions of benefit estimations
the project benefits outweigh the costs by 16 percent and 23 percent IRR from worst and best
scenarios, respectively. Tables 3 and 4 present the extreme lower and upper bounds of the
simulation modules considered for the sensitivity analysis. The results are self-explanatory. In
other words, in order for the Project to achieve its objective, at least those assumptions listed
under the worst-case scenario (Table 3) and the best case scenario (Table 4) must be
maintained.

Fiscal Sustainability Analysis

26.      The Project's financial sustainability is largely dependent on the Government's
sustained support to education. One of the main aims of this Project was to expand existing
initiatives by focusing on the most disadvantaged populations. The Gambia has also been able
to attract additional donor financing (including IDA financing through the READ Project) for
efforts which also receive co-financing from the Government (providing funds to cover
approximately 46 percent of the READ Project’s costs). The majority of project interventions
under the EFA FTI Project (66 percent) focused on quality improvements and capacity
building and thus this has minor implications on the Government’s fiscal space. For example,
under the base scenario of the cost benefit analysis, discounted incremental costs of the
Project’s impact (over 30 years) is only US$5.57 million. This is small compared to the
discounted incremental benefits (US$53.65 million) over the same period.

27.     In addition, the Project will not lead the Government to increase the number of civil
servants (teachers) to such an extent that it would jeopardize the public budget. In other
words, The Gambia has relatively low student teacher ratios and may utilize its existing
capacity to respond to the intended enrolment increases as the result of this Project without
increasing significantly the number of teachers. For example, in 2012, primary enrollment in
The Gambia was 175,211, and the number of out-of-school children (of primary school age)
could have been as high as 76,000 with a pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) of 37:1. Thus, if The
Gambia utilizes its capacity and increases the PTR to 40:1 (GPE benchmark) or even 45:1
(SSA average), they can accommodate most of the out-of-school children. This is especially
possible in light of the abolition of fees, small investments in infrastructure, and the provision
of alternative models such as the registered madrassas following the Government’s program.
However, this does not mean that there is no cost for expansion, but given that the main focus
of this Project was on quality improvement and capacity building, these interventions can be
sustained without further pressure on Government budget.



                                                        44
28.      While the share of external financing for the sector is high (although it has decreased
in recent years), the share of education spending as a share of GDP has been increasing for the
past seven years, which underscores the Government’s strong commitment to the education
sector (Table 5). The Government has demonstrated its ability to effectively implement and
sustain similar interventions. Thus, the associated costs needed to maintain the sector are
manageable. The EFA FTI Project is in line with the Government’s priorities and manageable
by the fiscal space of the current budget framework, therefore the Project’s sustainability is
not at risk.

Background
Following the endorsement of The Gambia as part of the partnership of the Education for
All/Fast Track Initiative (EFA/FTI) in 2003, the Education sector benefited from two rounds
of catalytic funding. Both rounds were meant to support The Gambia’s Education Sector Plan
2006 – 2015 and the Medium Term Education Sector Plan 2009 – 2011. These plans were
formulated to operationalize the pronouncements of the National Education Policy 2004 –
2015 in the areas of access and equity, the improvement of quality of teaching and learning
within basic education and the strengthening of management and institutional systems of the
sector with emphasis on improving the conditions of teaching and learning including early
childhood development. The project development objective indicators were therefore aligned
with the focus of both the Education Sector strategic Plan 2006 – 2015 and the Medium Term
Plan 2009 - 2011.

Key challenges in the education sector at the appraisal
Prior to the start of the project, the education sector was confronted with major challenges
across the three platforms of the national Education Policy 2004 – 2015: Access & Equity,
Quality of Teaching & Learning and Sector Management. It was therefore no surprise for the
project appraisal to highlight challenges that were anchored in these areas and key among
which were the following:
Access & Equity: While the sector made great strides in getting children educated, there was
a significant number of out of school children traced to disadvantaged communities and
vulnerable groups such as children with disabilities and orphans resulting from HIV/AIDS
mortality. In terms of gender participation, it was evident that girls outnumbered boys at the
lower basic level but they trailed behind the boys in upper basic and beyond and this resulted
in their gross under-representation among teachers and school managers.
Quality of Teaching & Learning: Recently conducted tests and surveys confirmed what was
clearly stated in the Government’s policy documents: education quality was very low and was
the key challenge for the sector. Serious problems persisted in early grade reading, and
English and mathematics mastery was very low in the lower basic cycle. Both in- and pre-
service training were given greater attention by Government and a few donor programs;
however, the system continued to suffer from low content-knowledge of incoming student-
teachers, limited pedagogic support at school level for new teachers and those with difficulties,
and very limited opportunities for the professional development of existing teachers.
Sector Management: The project appraisal results revealed that sector management was
strongest at the top, with a clear vision and solid leadership in policy implementation. The
challenge, therefore, was to build a strong base at regional and local levels to ensure that a
solid base existed to which more management tasks could be devolved. Data management and
analysis were recent improvements but continued to be vulnerable to problems in data
collection and in attracting and keeping qualified staff.

Project Endorsement & Approval
Having fulfilled the requirement of developing a credible education sector plan whose
preparation was characterized by a visible and meaningful participation of the local education
group guided by very clear in-country endorsement process under the leadership of the then

Development (DFID), African Development Bank (AfDB), Islamic Development Bank
(IsDB), BADEA, World Food Program (WFP) and other UN agencies and non-governmental
organizations and civil society, the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund Strategy Committee approved in
November 2008, the Education for All – Fast Track Initiative project in the amount of a
US$ 28 million for The Gambia with the expected closing date of December 31, 2012.

      The overall project development objective was “to improve the conditions for teaching and
      learning in basic education including early childhood development, in alignment with the
      overall objectives of the Education Sector Strategy Plan 2006 - 2015 and the Medium-Term
      Plan for 2009-2011”.

Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
 In December 2012, the project was restructured and the PDO was revised to “to improve the
conditions for teaching and learning in basic education, in alignment with the overall
objectives of the Education Sector Strategy Plan 2006 – 2015 and the Medium-term Plan for
2009-2011”. The exclusion of early childhood development (ECD) was based on the fact that
the majority of the early childhood interventions earmarked under the Project were already
covered under the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF). In an attempt to avoid duplication
of resources, two activities: support to ECD networks and the development of a module at
Gambia College on ECD were retained in the project. In view of the fact these two
interventions do not have the intensity to warrant inclusion in the development objective, the
PDO was therefore revised to reflect the interventions leading to the outcome for which the
program can reasonably be held accountable.

In addition to the above change effected in the project, the results framework was revised
following the restructuring of the PDO. The Indicators were revised in order to be specific,
measurable, available, relevant and time-bound (SMART).

Project Analysis
Operational Performance: The project was coordinated by the Projects Coordination Unit
(PCU) which was fully integrated into the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education with a
team that was well versed in the IDA procedures and was able to handle fiduciary
arrangements satisfactorily. The team comprised a project Manager, Financial Comptroller,
Internal Auditor, Construction Manager, Quantity Surveyor, Accountants, Donor Coordinator,
Stock Controller and a Procurement Team. This team was supported by heads of directorates
who ensured that activities were implemented as planned and reports generated and submitted
accordingly. The project was managed in accordance with the project implementation manual
(PIM). All expenditures were made with approval of IDA and in consonance with the
procedures of the World Bank as the Supervising Entity (SE). Eligibility of the activities for
funding was guided by the project’s action plan which was periodically updated with the
participation of all relevant stakeholders. The execution of some of the activities, mainly
procurement items which required prior review was done with IDA issuing No Objection
notice.

The semi-annual physical progress reports coupled with the quarterly financial reports and the
annual external audit reports were regularly submitted to IDA for review and comments.
At the closing date of the project, all contracts had been awarded with all deliverables met,
however, there were intermittent delays which warranted the project to be extended on two
occasions.

Analysis of the results achieved by the project: In the project design, the targeted
population consisted of primary school-age children, particularly those who did not attend
school at the time, those who were in remote areas, and those who were at risk of dropping
out. Main beneficiaries were: (i) out of school children as well as students in lower basic
schools (LBS) and upper basic schools (UBS), including those in remote, rural areas, those
with disabilities, and those in socio-economic difficulty, (ii) teacher trainees who were in

                                              52
Primary Teacher Certificate (PTC) and Higher Teacher Certificate (HTC) programs, (iii)
teachers that received in-service training, and (iv) staff within the Ministry of Basic and
Secondary Education (MOBSE). The following table summarized beneficiaries of each
project component.

               Beneficiaries
Component LBS students benefitted from the construction and equipping of 252 classrooms,
1              24 blocks of toilets in 18 schools for girls, and the rehabilitation of 144
               classrooms.

                 Construction of 252 classrooms: 45 classrooms, 129 classrooms, and 78
                 classrooms have been used since September 2012, January-April 2013, and
                 September 2013 respectively. Approximately a total of 18,000 students have
                 been enrolled in the 252 classrooms 30. Many of these students were out of school
                 prior to the construction of the classrooms.

                 Construction of 35 units of teachers quarters in 31 schools: 150 teachers
                 including heads and deputies in Regions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are currently occupying
                 these facilities.

It is also worth mentioning that activities under Component 1 (increasing access to and
equity) such as building and rehabilitating classrooms, providing water points, financial
assistance to needy boys and donkey carts to early graders also contributed to the PDO (to
improve conditions for teaching and learning. This was because as a result of Component 1,
an estimated more than 20,000 additional children were in school including those who were at
risk of dropping out and also better infrastructure was an integral ingredient for improving
teaching and learning conditions.

Lessons Learned

Component 1
Construction of classrooms: The experience of using the Delegated Management Contract
under GAMWORKS to construct 129 classrooms with the protracted delay and increased unit
cost was one useful lesson for both the Government and the World Bank. It was observed that
classrooms constructed under a framework agreement with Future In Our Hands (a Swedish
NGO) took less time to complete with a lesser unit cost than the ones done under the DMC.

Separate toilets for girls: The construction of 24 blocks of toilets in 18 schools has
significantly created a safer environment for the girls and this was one intervention that
should be replicated in all schools where the location of the toilets for boys and girls is not
separate. As a matter of policy, girls should be assisted to learn in an environment that is safe
and supportive so that they do not run the risk of being sexually harassed.

Construction of 35 staff quarters: The schools that have benefitted from this intervention
are testimony to the facelift of the status of teachers in those communities where
accommodation for teachers was a real challenge. Before this intervention, a good number of
these teachers were using the classrooms and offices to accommodate themselves overnight
and execute their work in these facilities during the day. The new facilities have therefore
changed the image of the teachers and the teaching profession in those communities.

Provision of water points: The provision of water points through concrete-lined wells and
boreholes has made life much easier for the beneficiaries whose source of drinking water
before this intervention was in the community, a distance from the school. Fetching water for
drinking, improved sanitation and gardening was a mammoth task for the children and often
times the instructional hours would be compromised.

Rehabilitation of 144 classrooms: Given that the age of some of the existing classrooms
dates back before The Gambia attained Independence in 1965, there was growing evidence to
suggest that these classrooms were in a state that was not conducive for teaching and learning.
Hence, intervening in 144 out of the lot was indeed significant and the returns thereof will
now contribute in no small measure to increased access and improved teaching and learning.

Provision of donkey carts: To further enhance access to schooling for communities with
very low school-aged population located two or three kilometers away from the nearest lower
basic school, a pilot was designed to use customized horse/donkey carts to transport early
graders to and from school until they are older and able to walk such distances. 82 donkey
carts were fabricated and handed over for use in regions 2-6. With this intervention, about
700 children who had difficulty in going to school were able to use donkey carts to go to
school. The next READ project will support to redesign the cart to reduce its weight and
provide additional 100 donkey carts to communities that are more than two or three
kilometers to the nearest school.

Financial assistance to needy boys in UBS: Due to the intensification of previous
interventions in favour of girls education, the sector experienced a backlash in terms of the
withdrawal of boys from school, particularly, at the level of upper basic where fee paying was
already a barrier for them. Supporting 6000 boys in grades 7 – 9 with financial assistance to
pay fees and other levies was indeed helpful for these boys to continue their education. It must
be noted that without such assistance, these beneficiaries would have dropped out of school.

Provision of labor-saving devices: The concept of the mothers’ club is well anchored in the
national effort to support the education of children through a range of local income generating
initiatives conceived and implemented by the mothers. The provision of 74 labor-saving
devices has reduced the amount of drudgery to undertake the chores at the level of the
household with reduced time. The savings in time will now be set aside for school homework
for both boys and girls.

The provision of sanitary supplies for girls: In the past, girls at puberty experienced
difficulty in changing their local sanitary pads during menstruation whilst at school the effect
of which resulted in absence from school and lessons. From the study conducted by the
Gender Education Unit on the effect of this intervention , there were some implementation
challenges which had to be addressed during the final phase of the project. Some of these
challenges included but not limited to the following:
    1. The distribution of the sanitary supplies without proper sensitization on the product
        and its use;
    2. Male school principals and teachers serving as custodians of the supplies which
        prevented the girls from asking for them because they were too shy to do so.

Component 2
The CCT program: is aimed at providing an alternative form of education with minimum
curriculum standards to children who are in the custody of religious leaders whose
responsibility is to teach them the Holy Quran and other Islamic values. The condition
attached to the provision of a monthly stipend of $3 per month per child to the custodian is to
release the children to attend classes. The children were exposed to literacy, numeracy, life
skills and livelihood skills for about 10 hours per week. The Project supported to develop and
print teaching and learning materials. About 1,000 children in 12 centers received instructions
in numeracy, literacy, life and livelihood skills for 10 hours a week. These children would not
have had this opportunity to be educated in these areas if the program had not been initiated
and supported.

                                              58
The ELINL program: The Project supported the workshops to develop and validate
materials such as primers, orthographies, readers and scripted lessons in the five national
languages. This was followed by the training of trainers and teachers. Language coaches were
also facilitated to offer coaching to the teachers under the Project. The pilot program is
ongoing in about 125 classrooms each grade in grades 1, 2, and 3. This pilot program will be
scaled up in the next READ project (P133079).

Publishing and reprinting of textbooks: This intervention came at a time when the ratio of
textbooks to students from grade 5 to 9 was not encouraging at all and this affected the level
of student/textbook interaction in school and at home. While it must be appreciated that the
textbooks finally reached the schools before the close of the project, the procurement process
was oblivious of the reasonable timeline required to complete the process before project
closure and hence, an extension of the project was required.

Payment of hardship allowance: The lesson about the payment of hardship allowances to
teachers serving in designated areas across regions 3 – 6 has been quite encouraging,
however, according to the study that was conducted to assess the impact of the intervention,
teachers serving in one region with eligibility to receive the allowance were paid the same
proportion of their salaries even though the locations of the schools were different in distance
and level of hardship. The other dimension highlighted in the study was the low numbers of
female teachers serving in hardship schools. These two issues have now necessitated a new
policy in the payment of hardship allowances to teachers serving in the upper limit of the
distance and female teachers in both lower and upper limits of the distance.

Teacher training for grades 1-3 reading: Following the 2007 EGRA, strategies were
developed to train all grades 1, 2 & 3 teachers on pedagogical methods for the teaching of
reading. The project intervention in this area was indeed timely and supported the Gambia
Association of Teachers of English (GATE) and FIOH in the training of teachers on the use of
the Jolly Phonics and SEGRA approaches respectively. From 2009 to 2013, the effect of the
intervention could be traced to the improvement of the students’ literacy levels, however, a lot
more needs to be done, particularly in the deprived regions (regions 4, 5 & 6) where the level
of improvement was very minimal.

Primary Teachers Certificate: With support from the project, the two models (extension &
regular) of teacher training at the level of PTC have produced qualified teachers with virtually
no difference in the quality of the graduates. However, in terms of numbers and cost, the
extension model is the better of the two and hence a shift in policy in favour of the extension
mode for all PTC training.

Component 3
Data collection: Although all challenges of data collection have not been addressed, the
process of data gathering and timely reporting has significantly improved during the life of the
project. This was made possible through the support of the EMIS Consultant whose services
were paid for under the project.



                                              59
Coordinating committee meetings: The CCM was institutionalized well before this project
became effective but its new version only came in 2008 and this has brought about greater
efficiency and accountability among schools and different players within MoBSE. The
project therefore supported the frequency of the meetings and the development of the
monitoring tool whose focus was to help schools attain the minimum standards. During these
meetings, schools that were found to be on track were commended for their performance
while the schools off tracked were assisted with the necessary capacity strengthening to catch
up with the performing schools.

The Country Status Report (CSR): One major activity of capacity strengthening of the
education sector was the development of the CSR in 2010 the process of which assisted some
key staff of the MoBSE and other institutions to undertake desk reviews and data analysis on
the situation of education service delivery in The Gambia. The success of this process has led
to the introduction of a Post-Graduate Certificate program at the University of The Gambia on
policy planning and analysis for young education planners.
