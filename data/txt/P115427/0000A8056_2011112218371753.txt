                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The last semi-annual education sector joint donor review mission was conducted from June 6-16, 2011, comprising WFP (lead in-country partner), IDA (World Bank), UNICEF,
                         NSGA, EFA Campaign Network, Action Aid, Child Fund, FIOH, US Peace Corps, UNESCO-NATCOM, and VSO. One of the objectives of the mission was to review the activities of
                         the education projects including the EFA FTI Catalytic Fund taking into consideration the results from the Mid-Term Review conducted in April 2011 which recommended an
                         adjustment in the PDO and results framework.

                         Component 1: Increasing access to equity in basic education
                         Although the components under the FTI have been soundly making progress, the number of new classrooms construction has been reduced from 400 to 252 due to the inaccurate
                         cost estimates that were used during the project preparation. So far, 45 out of 252 new classrooms have been constructed by the NGOs and a framework agreement for an

                         additional 78 new classrooms has been prepared with FIOH (NGO).

                         Component 2: Improving the quality of teaching and learning materials
                         This component's implementation has been satisfactory. With regard to the supplementary readers, 22 Gambian authors have been contracted to supply 41 titles for a total quantity of
                         247,999 copies. To date, 202,674 copies have been delivered to schools. Out of 41 titles, 18 are new titles and will be field tested soon in order to determine the effectiveness of the
                         materials.

                         Component 3: Strengthening management and institution capacity at the central and regional levels
                         Annual data collection from schools have been collected and processed through EMIS. The school data for 2011 has not yet been fully analyzed but a report will be prepared for the
                         next annual sector review planned for end of November. Also, a school mapping exercise was conducted and the results were used for the planning of classroom construction under
                         Component 1. In addition, the country status report was completed.

                         Policy Revision for Basic and Secondary Education (2012-2015)

                         The MoBSE presented its plans to review the policy for basic and secondary education. It is the first time that the policy will be based on solid data. Proposed thematic areas include:
                         access & equity, quality of teaching and learning, and sector management.

                         Under access---to attract the last 10% out of school children, service delivery approaches will be diversified. Key strategies include CCT(D100/child/month) for Marabouts as an
                         economic incentive to release children so they can receive some type of education to learn numeracy and literacy. Other strategies include upgrading Madrassa education, providing
                         special needs education, arranging customized and low cost transport mechanisms, targeting gender issues in education and providing non formal education, school feeding,
                         teacher incentives, and school grants.

                         Under quality of teaching and learning---strategies include providing a unified common direction for national languages, student assessments, teacher training, teaching and learning

                         Under sector management---areas of focus will include improvements to EMIS, M&E (x-ray of system), HR management, financing, ICT, harmonization of donors, decentralization,
                         efficiency, and performance management.

                         The national conference is planned for October 2011 and the goal is to have a draft education sector program ready for review by the next joint supervision mission and approval for
                         January 2012. It will be important that both Ministries collaborate together during their respective policy development/revision exercises in order to have an overall coherent sector-
                         wide approach. The MoBSE key stakeholders need to be included in the MoHERST policy development and the roadmap should be put into public domain. The strategic and medium
                         term plans will be drafted jointly.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
