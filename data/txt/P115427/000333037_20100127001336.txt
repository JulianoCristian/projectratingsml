STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE 
C
OUNTRY AND SECTOR ISSUES
 
1. 
The Gambia is a small West African country with an estimated population of 1.6 million 
(2008), and an average per capita GDP of approximately US$420 (2007)
1
.
The Gambia is 
ranked 155
th
 out of 177 countries in the 2007 UN Human Development Index.  The overall 
poverty headcount ratio is 58 percent, with large socioeconomic and regional variations.  
Tourism is a key driver of the economy and the country’s most significant foreign exchange 
earner.  Agriculture accounts for approximately a third of GDP but more than 70 percent of 
employment.   
2. 
The overall medium term outlook (2008-2010) is characterized by robust growth and a 
stable macroeconomic environment.  Real annual GDP growth is expected to be steady at 5.8 
percent over 2008-2010, consistent with recent history. The projected GDP growth rates for 2008 
and 2009 were recently revised downward by approximately 0.5 percent given the expected 
impact of the global downturn on tourism and remittances and the relatively poor performance of 
the groundnut sector.   
3. 
While the country has enjoyed relatively strong economic performance in recent years, 
governance challenges remain.  President Jammeh has remained in power through a series of 
elections since a military coup in 1994, including the latest election in 2006, which international 
observers described as fair. 
4. 
There have been important gains in education and health indicators.  Access to education 
has expanded, particularly in rural areas, and quality has been identified as the next major 
challenge. The overall life expectancy in the country, estimated at 57 years (2005), is higher than 
the SSA average. The Gambia has also performed relatively well on child health indicators 
compared to the SSA average. 
5. 
Education sector overview
:
In the last five years, substantial gains have been achieved 
in education service delivery, a key pillar of the PRSP.  The Millennium Development Goals for 
universal primary education and gender parity are within reach provided additional resources are 
available for sustained and accelerated progress.  The main challenge is to improve the quality of 
instruction, for which major initiatives are under way, including those supported by the 
Education for all-Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund (EFA-FTI CF) under Round 1, and 
proposed for support now under Round 2 (2009-2011).  The Government’s Medium Term Plan 
(MTP) for the education sector was discussed with and recommended for re-endorsement by the 
in-country donors in August 2008.  The key donors active in the sector include UNICEF (the 
lead in-country donor), the UK’s Department for International Development (DfID), the African 
Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the African Bank for Economic 
Development in Africa (BADEA) and the other UN Funds and Programmes, and the World 
Bank (IDA).  In addition, a number of national and international NGOs are closely involved in 
education activities, including Action Aid, Future in Our Hands, and VSO, among others.   
1
The Gross National Income per capita (GNI) in 2007 is US$320. 
Page  8
2
6. 
The MTP, which covers the period 2009-2011, is the outcome of a critical review of 
existing policies that aims at bringing a more practical and operational approach to the decision-
making and prioritization processes.  The priorities include improved access, especially for girls, 
for children in remote areas, and for children with disabilities.  It maintains primary focus on 
quality challenges, with a strong emphasis on improving early grade reading, and addressing 
marked disparities seen between girls and boys, between regions and between the different socio-
economic groups.  The MTP also sets out clear baseline and target values for the key indicators 
in the sector. 
7. 
The education sector has seen important gains
:
Over the past five years, there has 
been a strong focus on equity, access, quality and management: 
(a) 
Continued attention to equity and effective access
:
Attracting teachers to 
remote, rural areas; creating additional places through efficiency measures and construction 
/extension of classrooms; attracting and keeping all children in school, ensuring that every 
child in lower basic has a book for all core subjects, increasing the chances of success at the 
end of the basic cycle are all objectives on which significant progress has been seen. 
(b) 
Focusing on teachers as key actors in improving quality
:
Reforms in pre-
service teacher training; strengthening in-service training at both central and regional levels; 
establishing cluster-level training structures; and certificate programs for unqualified 
teachers have all focused attention on the importance of providing strong content 
knowledge and school-level pedagogic support to teachers. 
(c) 
Assessment instruments are in place to measure quality in the classroom
:
With World Bank and RTI/USAID support, Government has assessed reading levels in 
grades 1-3 in 2007 and has implemented an action plan as follow-up.  A national assessment 
test (NAT) was conducted to all grade 3-5 students in 2007, the results from which are also 
available.  These provide important baselines against which future progress can be 
measured. 
(d) 
Greater attention to monitoring and evaluation
:
Through ongoing support from 
donors, such as DFID and IDA, Government has made significant improvements in data 
management and analysis, and has caught up to data insufficiencies noted during the period 
2002-2004. 
(e) 
Performance is seen as a key measure of career development
:
In an effort to 
improve results, the MOBSE has initiated a performance measurement process with support 
from DFID, IDA, and the PHRD Grant, which has introduced the element of performance 
as an important aspect of both career development and accountability for results. 
8. 
In spite of these achievements, critical challenges still remain with the sector. These 
include. 
(a) 
Reaching the children still out of school, and addressing disparities
:
Improvements in access in recent years notwithstanding, there are still significant number of 
children out of school, including those in remote, rural areas, those with disabilities, and 
those in difficulty (including orphans of HIV/AIDS).  Although girls outnumber boys in 
lower basic education, they still under-perform boys at all levels of the school system.  In 
Page  9
3
addition, girls still lag behind boys in the upper basic cycle and beyond, and are 
significantly under-represented among teachers and school managers at all levels. 
(b) 
Need for sustained focus on quality
:
Recently conducted tests and surveys 
confirm what is clearly stated in the Government’s policy documents:  education quality is 
very low and is the key challenge for the sector.  Serious problems persist in early grade 
reading, and English and mathematics mastery is very low in the lower basic cycle.  Both 
in- and pre-service training have been given greater attention by Government and a few 
donor programs; however, the system continues to suffer from low content-knowledge of 
incoming student-teachers, limited pedagogic support at school level for new teachers and 
those with difficulties, and very limited opportunities for the professional development of 
existing teachers. 
(c) 
Sector management needs to be anchored in a well-performing base
:
At 
present, sector management is strongest at the top, with a clear vision and solid leadership 
in policy implementation.  The challenge, therefore, is to build a strong base at regional and 
local levels to ensure a solid base exist to which more management tasks can be devolved.  
Data management and analysis have seen recent improvements but continue to be 
vulnerable to problems in data collection and in attracting and keeping qualified staff. 
R
ATIONALE FOR 
FTI/CF 
AND 
IDA 
INVOLVEMENT
 
9. 
There are several reasons why the Catalytic Fund should support the education sector in 
The Gambia, complementing the support already provided by the ongoing IDA operation and by 
other actors (donors, NGOs) in the sector. First, the Catalytic Fund Grant, as with the IDA Grant, 
would fit within the framework of the sector program, providing support that enables both 
financing sources to fill gaps where other donors are not able to respond, including substantial 
investments in quality interventions, in innovations in the measurement of learning achievements 
(such as the Early Grade Reading Assessment) and in changing incentives to effect behavior 
change (such as hardship allowances for teachers, or performance management linked to team 
bonuses for personnel).  Second, coupled with IDA’s long-term involvement in the sector and in 
the country, the Catalytic Fund would be able to capitalize on IDA’s macro-economic and 
sectoral institutional knowledge due to its work in The Gambia since the 1970s.  IDA support to 
the Education Policy under Phase 1 of this APL launched an important programmatic approach, 
from which important lessons have been drawn (see Lessons Learned below).   
 
10. 
It is worth noting that activities proposed under the Catalytic Fund are not isolated 
initiatives but fall within the global implementation of the above-mentioned sector-wide 
approach.  They would support the Government’s Medium Term Plan and are complementary to 
existing funding sources:  school construction and rehabilitation are financed by IDA and AfDB, 
among others, in ongoing projects.  Activities aimed at improving the quality of teaching and 
learning complement support for teacher development under AfDB, DfID and IDA.  The early 
childhood activities are complementary to UNICEF initiatives.  Third, this proposal for 
accelerating progress towards universal primary education is the key objective highlighted both 
in the overall policy as well as in the MTP.  The Catalytic Fund would help the financial gap and 
focus its efforts on those areas of the program deemed critical for the achievement of the MDGs.

H
IGHER LEVEL OBJECTIVES TO WHICH THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTES
 
11. 
The CF’s objectives are in line with the Joint Assistance Strategy (IDA and AfDB), 
presented to the Board in 2008, and with The Gambia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which 
gives priority to human development in general, and to basic education and skills development in 
particular.   More specifically, the project responds to the PRSP pillar on enhanced equity and 
quality of service delivery, and contributes to two other pillars that aim to improve public 
expenditure management, and promote private sector-led growth.  
2. PROJECT 
DESCRIPTION 
A. P
ROJECT INSTRUMENT
 
12. 
The lending instrument selected for this project is a sector investment loan (SIL).  The 
sector budget support instrument that had been in use under the first three-year round of the FTI 
CF support to The Gambia had been a successful one.  However, with the continuing global 
financial and economic crises and its potential impact on the domestic economy,, the team 
considers the SIL to be the best adapted instrument to protect investments in the education 
sector. 
B. P
ROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND PHASES
 
13. 
The Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MOBSE) has concluded the Education 
Sector Strategic Plan for the period 2004-2015, and translated it into the Medium Term Plan 
(MTP, 2009-2011) which sets out the framework for the implementation period of this Grant. 
The proposed projects contributes in particular to the objective of achieving universal primary 
education as laid out in the MTP and takes into consideration other cross-cutting interventions 
such as special needs and HIV/AIDS education.   
C. P
ROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND KEY INDICATORS
 
14. 
The overall project development objective is to improve conditions for teaching and 
learning in basic education including early childhood development. This objective is aligned 
with the ongoing IDA project and consistent with the overall objectives of the Government’s 
Education Sector Strategy Plan and the Medium-Term Plan for 2009-2011.  Teaching and 
learning in basic education would be improved by (a)  increasing access and equity in basic 
education; (b) improving the quality of teaching and learning;  (c) strengthening management, 
monitoring and evaluation as well as institutional capacity at central and regional levels. The 
targets and key performance indicators are given below:

ROJECT COMPONENTS 
(
DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS ARE PROVIDED IN 
A
NNEX 
1) 
15. 
The CF program has three components, each of which is discussed in detail in Annex 1:   
16. 
Component 1:  Increasing access to and equity in basic education (US$9.3 million)
.
The 
project would support the construction, rehabilitation, and furnishing of classrooms and staff 
quarters, provision of water points and latrines, employ strategies for children out of school and 
for adolescent girls, and encourage early childhood development.  
17. 
Component 2:  Improving the quality of teaching and learning (US$16.5 million)
.
This 
component would constitute the bulk of the grant and supports quality interventions as a key 
Page  12
6
priority.  The activities would include provision of learning materials; curriculum development at 
all levels, support for in- and pre-service teacher training and school-level pedagogic support; 
provision of incentives to stabilize teachers in remote, rural areas; design and implementation of 
learning assessments instruments; support to early childhood development and for special needs 
education, as well as for orphans of HIV/AIDS, communication, advocacy and community 
activities to support mothers’ clubs and offer scholarships, and advocacy support to NGOs. 
 
18. 
Component 3:  Strengthening Management and Institutional Capacity at central and 
regional levels (US$2.2 million)
.
Under this component, support would be provided for 
monitoring and evaluation systems, and for sector management, with a strong focus on data 
management, performance monitoring and bonuses (in line with plans under the existing IDA 
project).  Support would be provided to the MOBSE and to the Projects Coordination Unit 
(PCU) through the provision of technical assistance, operating costs and carrying out of audits. 
 
E. 
 
L
ESSONS LEARNED AND REFLECTED IN THE PROJECT DESIGN
 
19. 
Experience and lessons learned from the first phase of the EFA-FTI  program and from 
past IDA projects are reflected into the project design and include the following:  
·
Pay attention to the sustainability of interventions.
 
A
significant number 
of activities financed under the first round of support from FTI have now been incorporated 
into the Government budget, including more than half of the teacher allowances, all pre- 
and in-service teacher training activities, scholarship support for girls (though some may 
remain under ongoing operations), operations and maintenance including a significant 
share of vehicle costs, among others.  This has ensured that the successful pilots under the 
first FTI round and other donor programs have been able to benefit directly from the 
increased budget allocation to education.    
·
Create incentives (financial and non-financial) that support the project 
and are performance-based: 
 Expand on ongoing capacity building efforts financed under 
the PHRD Co-financing Grant from the Government of Japan and the IDA project, the CF 
would sustain support for the performance evaluation framework that will be used to 
reward good performers and provide support for improvements for those unable to conduct 
their tasks effectively. 
·
Rather than trying to solely increase the number of pre-service places to 
fill teacher shortages, the quality of teacher training programs needs to be given 
sustained attention.
 The project will focus not only on the caliber of recruits but also 
provide support to teachers in their classrooms to ensure they translate their training into 
better practice. 
·
Strong coordination among donors is fundamental.
 
The project will 
benefit directly from donor coordination efforts currently financed under the ongoing IDA 
project.  With strong Government leadership and ownership of the process, harmonization 
of procedures and alignment of interventions is showing real progress.

LTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION

Other lending instruments considered
:
With the World Bank as the 
Supervising Entity, the sector investment loan is the only lending instrument currently 
available for FTI Catalytic Fund operations.   
·
Focus on quality
:
The CF program would focus on improvements in quality 
while continuing to support limited expansion of school places.  A limited number of 
access interventions are included that aim at attracting and supporting the last 15 percent of 
children to schools, at stabilizing teachers in remote, rural areas, and at improving the 
learning environment in existing schools.
 
·
Focus on intermediate targets related to school, student and teacher 
performance and outputs instead of on improvements in student achievement
:
The 
task team agreed with Government that focusing solely on student achievement measures 
was unrealistic given the time it takes to see significant improvements.  Instead the team 
has opted for a mix of intermediate outcome and output indicators for the next four years, 
while tracking student achievements and completion rates as important long-term goals.
 
3. IMPLEMENTATION 
20. 
The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education 
(MOBSE), supported by the Projects Coordination Unit (PCU), as is currently the case in the 
implementation of IDA, AfDB, IsDB and other donor programs.  The following arrangements 
have been put into place:

ARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS
 
21. 
EFA-FTI
:
The Education for All 
–
Fast Track Initiative has been the most important 
partnership arrangement coming to the assistance of the Government in recent years, supporting 
its efforts to accelerate progress towards meeting the education Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs).  The first year’s allocation of US$4 million was fully disbursed within the allotted 12-
month period, and focused primarily on access and quality inputs; the same was true for the 
US$4 million allocated in Year 2 and the US$5.4 million in Year 3.  Some of the most important 
lessons were:  (a) relatively small financial incentives were effective in attracting teachers to 
remote areas and in reducing requests for mobility out of those regions; (b) the absorptive 
capacity of the system was higher than was anticipated, as the MOBSE was able to program and 
execute all planned activities measures within the planned time period; and (c) the importance of 
addressing priority logistical problems (including lack of electricity or fuel for vehicles) as a 
means of attaining quality and management objectives, and of motivating staff by improving 
working conditions.  The second round of EFA-FTI CF allocation is expected to coincide with 
the implementation of the Education Medium Term Plan (2009-2011).   
22. 
Donor programs
:
This program has been prepared in close collaboration with the in-
country donor team, including UNICEF (lead in-country donor) and the UK Department for 
International Development (DFID), with contributions from the African Development Bank, the 
Islamic Development Bank, BADEA and the other UN Funds and Programmes (especially 
Page  14
8
World Food Program) and several non-governmental institutions.  
Examples of the interventions 
supported by these donors include:   
UNICEF:  Child-friendly schools initiative (including Essential Learning Package), support to 
policy and life-skills;  
DfID:   
Educational management, training of unqualified teachers and Whole School 
Development;  
AfDB:   
School construction, well drilling and school maintenance, school health packages, 
and teacher training and consultancy for TVET and Non Formal education; 
IDB:   
Provision of furniture and supplementary reading materials, and literacy support;  
BADEA:   Classroom construction, staff quarters and well drilling;  
WFP:   
Food for education (school feeding programme).   
 
23. 
In terms of geographical coverage, interventions are nationwide with the exception of 
UNICEF focusing on Upper River Region, BADEA in Kanifing Municipality and Western 
Region and WFP in rural areas excluding the growth centers (see also Annex 10, p. 52).  As 
some of the development partner’s existing programs wind down, the Islamic Development 
Fund, BADEA and OPEC Fund are currently discussing follow-up operations with Government 
in the areas of classroom construction, rehabilitation, teacher training and management support.  
The expected contributions of these donors come to about US$30 million in the next three years.  
Both the DfID and the AfDB projects are expected to close before 2010, and no follow-up 
projects are under discussion or likely before 2011.  
 
24. 
In June 2008, the Government made a formal request to the donors to re-endorse its 
Medium Term Plan for the sector, with the focus on universal primary education.  In August 
2008, the in-country donors unanimously endorsed this proposal, which was transmitted to the 
Catalytic Fund Committee in September 2008. 
 
H. I
NSTITUTIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS 
 
25. 
Overall project orientation and coordination
.
The project will be implemented by the 
MOBSE, with the coordination activities handled by the Projects Coordination Unit (PCU).  This 
unit, unlike those in many other countries, is fully integrated into the MOBSE.  Lines of 
authority and division of responsibilities between the Ministry and the Project Unit are clear.  
The PCU includes a project manager, deputy manager, fiduciary team and a small construction 
management unit.  The PCU team manages most of the donor programs in the sector – the staff 
is highly experienced and well versed in Bank and other donor procedures.  The Senior 
Management Team (SMT) of the MOBSE, comprising the Minister, the Permanent Secretary, 
the Deputy Permanent Secretaries and the Directors (both central and regional) are charged with 
the overall policy direction and make key implementation decisions.  The SMT delegates 
implementation either to the PCU or to the relevant Directorates as necessary.  The well-
qualified, committed and stable Government team has made a significant difference in policy 
formulation.  As in many small countries, the presence or absence of qualified and committed 
leaders in critical posts makes or breaks the institutions in The Gambia.  At present, strong 
leadership has been in place for the past four years and assurances have been be sought from 
Page  15
9
Government that mobility at both the political and technical levels within MOBSE and PCU be 
kept at a minimum during the implementation phase.  
26. 
Donor Coordination and joint semi-annual review
:
The PCU’s role within the 
MOBSE includes the coordination of sector program implementation and the management of 
donor-funded programs.  Its key areas of intervention include the fiduciary responsibilities, 
including procurement and financial management, construction supervision, reporting and donor 
coordination.  Semi-annual joint donor review meetings have been organized for the past two 
years, bringing together all key donors in the sector. During these joint missions, the MOBSE 
presents the progress in the monitoring indicators, and discusses compliance with financial 
management and procurement requirements.  The MOBSE and partners also review the 
education budget, ensure consistency between the activities proposed and the strategic plan, and 
conduct field visits to assess the results at the school-level
.
27. 
Construction
:
The PCU Construction Programme Manager (CPM) will be expected to 
head the implementation supervision activities, as a parallel structure does not exist with the 
MOBSE.  The CPM will coordinate with the Procurement Officer as well as with the Financial 
Comptroller to ensure all activities are conducted according to IDA procedures, or those of other 
donors, as necessary.   The following procurement methods will be used for the construction of 
classrooms:   (a) awarding individual contracts through National Competitive Bidding, (b) 
negotiating delegated management contracts with an implementation agency and/or (c) 
framework agreements with qualified NGOs.

ONITORING AND EVALUATION OF OUTCOMES
/
RESULTS
 
28. 
The output and outcome indicators that are selected for this project will be tracked 
regularly at school, regional and central levels, using the existing tools for data collection 
developed and rolled out under the BESPOR (DfID) and IDA projects, with the appropriate 
measures taken by Planning to ensure accuracy, security, and timeliness.  Any necessary policy 
actions will be taken by senior management to address any worrisome trends captured in the data 
collection. 
J. S
USTAINABILITY
 
29. 
The sustainability of this operation will be driven by the degree of ownership by 
Government, by the capacity of core education institutions (especially the MOBSE) to absorb the 
additional resources and to implement the necessary activities, and by Government’s continued 
commitment to the education sector as demonstrated by the priority given to it.  
30. 
Financial sustainability
:
Based on the scenario proposed in the medium term plan, a 
financing gap has emerged of US$7.7 million for recurrent costs and US$24.9 for investment 
costs.  The CF application is projected to comprise about 20 percent of the overall program costs 
and would help to close the financing gap.  As mentioned earlier in this document, a number of 
activities financed under the first round of support from FTI have now been incorporated at least 
partially into the Government budget (teacher allowances, teacher training activities, scholarship 
support for girls, operations and maintenance, etc.).  It is important, however, not to underplay 
Page  16
10
the challenge:  although macro-economic performance has improved over the past couple of 
years and has been assessed as satisfactory, the system still remains relatively fragile.
 
31. 
Government commitment and civil society involvement
:
The Education Sector 
Strategic Plan (ESSP) supported by this grant is very much Government owned, with the vision, 
goals and implementation arrangements articulated by the senior management leading the sector.  
It has benefited from extensive discussions with key stakeholders.  With strong leadership at the 
MOBSE, and with the high demand for education expressed by the population, there is little 
reason to believe that Government commitment will wane in the near future.  Finally, the regular 
engagement by MOBSE with civil society and with a broad cross-section of the population 
continues to provide strong support for long-term sustainability and ownership.  There is little 
risk, therefore, that the commitments in the ESSP and the MTP will not be met. 
32. 
Institutional sustainability
:
The ability of the sector to fulfill its ambitious objectives is 
directly related to the stability of the senior management team and core directors in the system.  
The IDA team is encouraged by the fact that the current management team has been maintained 
for the past three years, including most of the central and regional directors, contributing to the 
continued progress seen in the sector.  As was confirmed under the first phase of the IDA 
project, all persons sent for short- and long-term training overseas have signed guarantees 
(“bonds”) to confirm their commitment to return, and of those who have completed their 
training, more than 95 percent have returned to the civil service.

4. APPRAISAL 
SUMMARY 
M. E
CONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES
 
34. 
The share of the public recurrent budget allocated to education averaged just 11 percent 
during most of the decade, representing only 2 percent of GDP, far below the FTI benchmark of 
20 and 3.6 percent, respectively.  However, due to high debt service requirements, this share 
rises to an average of 18 percent of total public discretionary recurrent expenditure (i.e. exclusive 
of interest payments), not very distant from the FTI benchmark of 20 percent on this indicator. 
Thus, within its fiscal space constraints, Government commitment to the implementation of the 
education sector program has been high. 
35. 
Despite increases in the budget allocation in 2009, the current public investment in The 
Gambia is not sufficient to support high quality teaching and learning, exacerbated by low 
teacher qualifications and motivation; challenge of continued full coverage in teaching and 
learning materials, and inadequate school-level pedagogical support, among others.   
36. 
A cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out under the ongoing IDA project to consider 
the investment in quality versus the continued mass expansion of school enrollment only.  
Investment in quality will also increase the internal efficiency of the Gambian education system, 
contributing to the decreased repetition rate from 6 percent to 2 percent per grade on average 
during the primary cycle.  Only investing in expansion will keep these system indicators at status 
quo.  Without the investment in quality, it takes 6.38 years on average for a graduate to complete 
the cycle, and an average of 8.93 years of investment to produce one graduate, taking into 
account the wastage due to dropout.  It is envisaged that, with the planned investments in quality, 
it will take 6.12 years on average for a graduate to complete the cycle, and an average of 6.78 
years of investment to produce one graduate.  The improved efficiency will result in reduced 
total cost of producing one primary school graduate from estimated US$190 to $179, even with 
the increased unit spending per pupil per year from 7 percent of GDP per capita to 9 percent of 
GDP per capita. 
Page  18
12
37. 
A financial analysis was carried out to evaluate the attainability and sustainability of the 
targets specified in the Government’s Education Sector Development Plan.  The policy choices 
which aim to ensure the sustainability of the plan are as follows:  
38. 
Lower basic education:  
Access (i) increase the admission rate from 101% to 125%; 
increase the LBS GER (including 
madrassas
)
from 91.4% to 101.9%; (ii) reduce the repetition 
rate in LBS from 5.8% to 3.6%; (iii) reduce the dropout rate in LBS from 4.1% to 2.8%; (iv) 
increase  the transition rate (from Grades 6 to 7) from 88% to 90%; (v) increase the share of 
enrolment for boys in LBS from 49% to 50%; (vi) increase the achievement scores for girls at all 
levels to catch up with boys (NAT, EGRA, etc.); (vi) focus on reading as a key foundation 
competency; and (vii) introduce national languages to ensure early literacy of children. Quality 
(i) increase grade level competence (mastery) in the core subjects from 10% to 15%; (ii) increase 
grade level competence (minimum)in the core subjects from 46% to 60%; (iii) maintain the 
pupil-textbook ratio in LBS at 1:1; (iv) decrease the pupil-supplementary reader ratio in LBS 
from 2:1 to 1:1; (v) increase hours of instruction to 866
2
;
(vi) increase frequency of school-level 
pedagogic support visits from once monthly to  once a week by cluster monitors, with 
approximately two hours per school; (vii) introduce  the national languages as a media of 
instruction in the early grades i.e. Grades 1-3 while English will be taught as a subject; (viii) 
improve reading in the early grades, with 80% of children reading at grade level. 
39. 
In upper basic education
,
the major variables of this policy are to:  (i) increase upper 
basic gross enrolment rate (including official madrassas) from 60% to 69%;  (ii) reduce the 
repetition rate from 4.7% to 3%;  (iii) maintain the dropout rate at 2%;  (iv) decrease the pupil-
textbook ratio in UBS from 3:1 to 1:1;  and (v) decrease the pupil-supplementary reader ratio in 
UBS from 4:1 to 1:1. 
40. 
In secondary education, 
the following policy options are considered to improve access:  
maintain the transition rate from basic to secondary education at 52%;  (ii) increase the GER 
from 33% to 38%;  (iii) decrease the repetition rate from 4.2% to 2.7%;  (iv) achieve gender 
parity of students by 2011. For quality:  (i) increase the number of teachers from 1034 to 1531; 
(ii) increase the number of Gambian teachers to 50% by 2011;  (iii) train at least 115 Gambian 
teachers each year to degree level and increase the proportion of female teachers in this group; 
and (iv) establish gender-balanced board of governors in accordance with the Education Act (a 
complete economic analysis is provided in Annex 5). 
N. T
ECHNICAL
 
41. 
The CF program will provide support to the development of the education sector in The 
Gambia based on the MTP.  Providing pedagogic support at school level, and focusing attention 
and resources on teaching and learning conditions will improve teaching by offering teachers 
timely, good quality pedagogic support, and will enable students through active learner-centered 
methodologies.  Both teachers and students will receive instructional materials.  Direct support to 
schools and regional education offices will allow for greater ownership, better accountability and 
improved cooperation between Government and civil society in order to promote equity and 
2

ensure quality service delivery.  The technical soundness of the program will be reviewed 
carefully twice each year with all stakeholders participating.  
O. F
IDUCIARY
 
42. 
Financial Management Arrangements
:
A
full financial management assessment was 
conducted in August 2008, which noted that the Catalytic Fund (CF) transactions would be 
managed within the existing Projects Coordination Unit (PCU) of the Ministry of Basic and 
Secondary Education (MOBSE).  The Grant would follow the financial management 
arrangements already in place for the ongoing IDA-financed Third Education, Phase 2 project.  
The overall performance of the PCU in financial management was rated satisfactory by the last 
FM supervision.  
43. 
The fiduciary arrangements of the national implementing agencies
 meet the Bank’s 
minimum requirements under OP/BP10.02.  It is adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, 
accurate and timely information on the status of the project required by IDA.  
44. 
Procurement Arrangements
:
The proposed operation will use the same procurement 
arrangements as the ongoing IDA Third Education project.  An assessment of the Projects 
Coordination Unit’s capacity to implement procurement actions under IDA and EFA FTI 
Catalytic Fund (CF) financing was carried out in August 2008.  The objective of the assessment 
was to update the previous procurement assessment conducted in May 2006 and determine 
whether the implementing entities continue to offer an acceptable arrangement in line with Bank 
procedures.  The assessment reviewed the organization structure, the current procurement plan 
implementation and the interaction between the project’s staff responsible for procurement and 
found them to be satisfactory.  
P. S
OCIAL
 
45. 
The issues that are of particular concern included:  (a) the lack of parity between boys 
and girls in terms of access, with gross enrollment rates for boys dropping in lower basic; (b) the 
gap in learning achievements between boys and girls, with girls under-performing boys at all 
levels; (c) the lack of effective access for children with special needs; (d) the need to ensure 
equality of access to all levels, to the extent possible, for children in the parallel Koranic 
(
madrassa
)
system;  and (e) the low levels of reading accuracy and comprehension measured in 
recent assessments.  The interventions planned under the CF program will help address these 
problems.  
Q. E
NVIRONMENT
 
46. 
The framework documents already in use under the existing IDA project fully apply in 
the case of the CF Grant, since the activities planned are consistent with those addressed in both 
the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF). A screening mechanism is in place that will ensure that all sub-projects are 
screened on their environmental and social impacts, and where called for, limited environmental 
analyses will be carried out to mitigate the impact.  As most of the sub-projects are relatively 
small in size, it is envisaged that the impacts are normally small and thus a checklist will suffice.  
Page  20
14
Therefore, the impact of all sub-projects will be effectively addressed and adequately monitored 
during project implementation. 
R. S
AFEGUARD POLICIES
 
47. 
The project has triggered OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12 Involuntary 
Resettlement due to potential negative environmental and social impacts related to the 
construction of schools, and the possible construction and rehabilitation under the school 
improvement grants.  The safeguard screening category is S2, and the environmental screening 
category is B.  To address potential negative impacts consistent with the requirements of these 
safeguard policies, the project has prepared an ESMF and a RPF.  In addition to describing the 
environmental and social screening process, the ESMF makes recommendations regarding 
capacity building needs to ensure its effective implementation, and consultations with potentially 
affected persons as part of the screening process that will take place at the time construction 
plans are prepared.

Annex 1:  Detailed Project Description 
 
The overall project development objective is to improve conditions for teaching and learning in 
basic education including early childhood development.  This objective is aligned with the 
ongoing IDA project and consistent with the overall objectives of the Government’s Education 
Sector Strategy Plan and the Medium-Term Plan for 2009-2011.  Teaching and learning in basic 
education would be improved by (a)  increasing access and equity in basic education; (b) 
improving the quality of teaching and learning;  (c) strengthening management, monitoring and 
evaluation as well as institutional capacity of the central and regional levels. 
 
The components have been identified to help attain this objective, including: 
 
Component 1: 
Increasing access to and equity in basic education (US$9.3 million).   
Component 2: 
Improving the quality of teaching and learning (US$16.5 million).   
Component 3: 
Strengthening management and institutional capacity of the central and 
regional levels (US$2.2 million).  
 
Component 1:  Increasing access to and equity in basic education (US$9.3 million) 
 
Challenge:  
The school-age population continues to grow at a rapid rate in the nation, and the 
greatest demand now for school places is in urban and peri-urban areas.  However, as remote 
villages in rural areas still show significant increases in the school-age population and continue 
to lag in service delivery, any expansion of access would have to address the needs of these two 
distinct populations.  In addition, with gross enrollment at 90 percent, expanding access to the 
remaining 10 percent of children out of school will require additional effort and more innovative 
approach.  Many of these children are from disadvantaged backgrounds:  they are children with 
disabilities, children from poor families, and orphans of HIV/AIDS, among others.  To attain 
universal basic education by 2015, and maintain the enrollment rates in upper basic, additional 
school places in lower- and upper-basic schools will have to be created at an accelerated pace.  
One of the successes registered in the previous implementation of the first phase of the catalytic 
funding is the increase in enrolment of girls and the attainment of gender parity in enrolment 
between boys and girls at the level of basic education. However, the drop in enrolment for boys 
and the performance gap between boys and girls in lower and upper basic remain important. 
 
Strategies:  
This proposal is expected to deliver about 400 classrooms with furniture and 
sanitary facilities, and to rehabilitate 85 dilapidated classrooms across all regions, especially in 
underserved areas.  In order to address the difficulties around the supply of safe drinking water, 
200 water points will be provided where the need is greatest.  In addition, about 65 teachers’ 
quarters will be constructed or rehabilitated in extremely deprived communities.  To further 
enhance access to schooling for communities with very low school-aged population located two 
or three kilometers away from the nearest lower basic school, a pilot will be designed to use 
customized horse/donkey carts to transport early graders to and from school until they are older 
and able to walk such distances.
 
In response to the challenge of getting and keeping all kids into school, the construction of 
separate toilet facilities for girls will be expanded, with 234 new toilet facilities. Sanitary 
supplies would be provided for adolescent girls to avoid loss of instructional time.  The child-
Page  23
-
17
-
friendly school initiative will continue to be expanded in Regions 2 and 3 through support for 
new and existing 
mothers’ clubs, including but not limited to communication, advocacy and 
community support.  In order to bridge the gap in enrolment between boys and girls, financial 
assistance will be provided to needy boys in those areas where enrolments have dropped.  The 
employment of different pedagogic methods (such as methods for special needs children, 
orphans, or children with HIV/AIDS ) are planned under the project.  Efforts will also be needed 
in areas where the opportunity cost of education is higher than the immediate benefits to the 
household or the child. 
Component 2:  Improving the quality of teaching and learning (US$16.5 million) 
 
Challenges
:
The Gambia’s Basic Education Policy objectives are based on the assumption that 
improvements in the quality and relevance of schooling will increase the demand of basic 
education for both parents and employers while at the same time influencing the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the entire education system. Higher student achievement, stronger language 
skills, higher completion rates and lower rates of repetition and dropout are all immediate 
outcomes of the National Education Policy (2004-2015).
 
The quality of education constitutes the biggest challenge in the sector.  By all measures, quality 
education remains a challenge, with low mastery of both mathematics and English as observed in 
the school leaving examinations, in the UNESCO/MLA tests and the Gambia National 
Assessment Test (NAT). NAT shows that in all core subjects including mathematics, English, 
and science, a maximum of 10% of Grades 3 and 5 students reached the mastery level of 73%. 
Results from UNESCO’s Monitoring Learning Achievements (MLA, 2000) demonstrate that 
46% of students reached the passing minimum mark (40%) in the core subjects. GABECE, 
which is taken at the end of the Grade 9, yields similar outcomes. 
 
Although there are questions about the validity of some of the instruments used to ascertain the 
extent of the problem, there is no doubt that quality is disappointingly low in public education.  
In addition, there are critical issues that have a direct impact on instruction, including:  
·
Insufficient number of contact hours provided; 
·
Teacher and student absenteeism; 
·
Low content knowledge by teacher-trainees entering teacher training; 
·
Poor or outdated pedagogical knowledge and skills of teachers ; 
·
Few or no professional development opportunities for teachers both before and during 
their teaching service; 
·
Limited or non-existent pedagogic support to teachers at the school level and in the 
classroom ; and 
·
Lack of updated curricula and teaching syllabuses; and flawed assessment instruments for 
measuring student achievement. 
 
Strategies
:
The provision of quality education is essentially the main thrust of this proposal. 
Therefore, in acknowledging the urgency of bettering student performance, the improvement of 
learning outcomes will continue to be prioritized through a combination of strategies that include 
the following:  
Page  24

-
·
Essential Learning Package 
–
ELP:  The following elements of the ELP will be provided 
to all public schools across the country:  classroom consumables, library books and 
supplementary readers.  Materials that facilitate early grade reading will be given top 
most priority.  
·
Early Childhood Development:  Under the ESMTP 2008 - 2011, the strategy for 
providing ECD services will continue to be anchored in two approaches, one of which is 
the participation of the private sector in the provision of such service in the urban and 
peri-urban areas, while the other is the attachment of ECD centres to existing lower basic 
schools in the rural communities. Both approaches are expected to focus on the integrated 
model of ECD, which underscores the need for complementarities of other social services 
such as nutrition, health, care, water sanitation, protection and early stimulation for 
learning. However, under this proposal support will only be provided to:  creation of 
networks among stakeholders, development of a professional development plan and 
review and update ECD curriculum. 
·
Special Needs Education:  MOBSE will focus on disadvantaged and vulnerable groups 
given that part of the remaining cohort of children out of school may reside within these 
groups. The CF program would support:  Provision of equipment to blind and low vision 
students, provision of equipment to students with hard of hearing, provision of equipment 
to mentally retarded students (learning difficulties), mainstreaming of students with 
special needs in ordinary schools, development of an itinerant teaching programme to 
support mainstreaming, training of students with hard of hearing and their parents on sign 
language for ease of communication and monitoring and evaluation of special needs 
education programme. 
·
Teacher Training:  Improve distance learning for teacher trainees, provision of stipend to 
teacher trainees, supporting face-to-face sessions for teacher trainees and lecturers and 
supporting the Primary Teachers’ Certificate Extension Programme currently being 
piloted in Region 5 where all the regular unqualified teachers are being upgraded with 
skills, knowledge and abilities to deliver  better classroom practices.  
·
West African Examinations Council:  Strengthening the institutional capacity of WAEC 
in order that its mandate in the conduct of national examinations can be effectively and 
efficiently executed without creating undue cost burden to the parents, the majority of 
whom live below the poverty line). This will allow WAEC to maintain the level of 
examination fees currently being levied to students. 
·
Curriculum Improvement:  Conduct curriculum audit and research on non-core subjects 
for lower and upper basic schools – grades 1-9, development  of curriculum materials on 
non-core subjects for lower and upper basic schools – grade 1-9, development of 
curriculum materials on core subjects for upper basic schools – grades 7-9, and provision 
of syllabuses for grades 1-9) 
·
Teacher Incentives:  Given the success registered in attracting qualified teachers from 
non-deprived locations and regions to voluntarily take up postings in designated hardship 
zones, teacher incentives in the form of hardship allowances have now been 
Page  25
-
19
-
institutionalised and the allowances for Region 3 and part of Region 2 (Foni) have been 
mainstreamed into the Government regular budget.  In a bid to continue to attract 
qualified teachers to serve in these hardship areas, teachers in disadvantaged communities 
in Regions 4, 5 and 6 will be provided with hardship allowances with varying levels of 
percentages from the CF.  In addition, prizes will be awarded to outstanding teachers 
based on
 a
mutually agreed frame of criteria between the Gambia Teachers’ Union and 
the MOBSE.  
·
Monitoring Exercises:  Cluster-based monitoring has now become a regular feature of the 
education system, hence support to facilitate increased frequency of support visits to 
schools has been provided on a regular basis. Cluster monitors are gradually being 
equipped with skills and abilities to monitor quality assurance and other educational 
programs being implemented in the regions. There is evidence of support being provided 
to schools through this cluster-based monitoring model in the form of cluster-based 
training activities undertaken to support school-level pedagogic activities and mentoring 
of teacher trainees.  It is however noted that some of the cluster monitors with old 
motorcycles have difficulty in reaching schools on a regular basis. Consequently, the CF 
will provide more motorcycles. 
·
HIV/AIDS Education Sector Response (HIV/AIDS) is more of a development problem 
than an exclusive health issue and, consequently, children, youth and women are part of 
the vulnerable groups in this country. Furthermore, the menace of the HIV/AIDS 
pandemic is a real threat to the EFA targets and the education-related MDGs to which the 
Government of The Gambia is very much committed. Given that MOBSE acknowledges 
the seriousness of the pandemic based on empirical evidence, both local and 
international, coupled with the commitment of the sector to minimize the social, 
economic and developmental consequences of HIV/AIDS on the education system, a 
comprehensive education sector response to HIV/AIDS premised on the mandate and the 
social, economic and developmental consequences of HIV/AIDS on the education 
system, a comprehensive education sector response to HIV/AIDS premised on the 
mandate and comparative advantage of the sector has been developed through an 
operational sector policy on HIV/AIDS. Under this proposal, support to this programme 
will focus on the development of a comprehensive communication strategy on 
prevention, care, support and non-discrimination; provision of subsidies to HIV/AIDS 
orphans (students); provision of first aid kits to public schools and development of a 
training manual on nutritional care and support for PLWHA 
·
Civil Society Organizations:  The role of civil society in advocating for additional 
resources sufficient to pursue the targets of EFA and the education-related MDGs cannot 
be overstressed. In The Gambia, the EFA Campaign Network is the umbrella body of all 
civil society organizations that have a stake in education and whatever support that is 
provided to CSOs is channelled through this Network. Under this proposal, the MOBSE 
will continue to provide support to the Network so that its mandate in the area of 
advocacy can be efficiently and effectively executed. 
·
School-level Pedagogic Development:  The focus of this intervention is to strengthen the 
culture of pedagogic support within schools, targeting senior teachers, deputy head 
Page  26
-

-
teachers and head teachers as potential pedagogic leaders who will be expected to 
provide pedagogic support to classroom teachers.  In addition, the four subject teacher 
associations namely:  Mathematics 
–
MATAG, Science - STAGAM, English – GATE 
and Social and Environmental Studies – SESTA will be supported to deliver in-service 
training activities at the national, regional and cluster levels aimed at supporting 
classroom practices and mentoring arrangements. 
 
Component 3:  Strengthening institutional and management capacities of central and 
regional directorates (US$2.2 million) 
 
Challenges:  
The ability of the sector to deliver services in line with its vision of ‘universal 
access to relevant and high quality education’ is constrained by the current level of its capacity. 
 
This is experienced at two levels of capacities, namely institutional and management.  These 
pose constraints to both the central and regional directorates to the extent that the management 
and institutional practices are not conducive to optimal performance.  However, under the first 
phase of the Catalytic Funding, there has been significant improvement in these areas to the 
extent that a performance management system is being institutionalized to enhance staff 
performance. 
Strategies:  
Cognizant of the above challenges, this programme is expected to deliver outputs 
that will address the above challenges through the following interventions targeting sector 
management:
 
·
Leadership training for managers in the MOBSE 
·
Improved data collection, analysis and dissemination, including the timely availability of 
reliable statistics each year; 
·
Conduct of a school mapping exercise and facilities assessment survey; 
·
Conduct of an EFA assessment in all six regions; 
·
Providing performance bonuses to teams
within MOBSE as part of the Performance 
Management System (PMS), complementing such initiatives in the IDA project; 
·
Formulation and finalization of the postings policy; 
·
Convening of bi-monthly Coordinating Committee Meetings (CCM) and Senior 
Management Team (SMT) meetings in regions 1-6; 
·
Provision of office consumables for regions and headquarters (15 directorates/units) 
·
Fuel and maintenance for regional and central stand-by generators;  
·
Monitoring of assets; and 
·
Annual audits 
 
These activities would complement the resources made available both under the IDA project and 
the PHRD Co-financing Grant that provide opportunities for training and capacity development.

Arrangements for results monitoring
·
Institutional issues
:
Both the MOBSE senior management (particularly the Permanent Secretary and the 
Director of Planning) and the PCU will be charged with the effective use of data collected under the Results 
Framework to track progress towards both the intermediate and the overall program objectives.  The project 
will benefit from recent missions conducted under the Third Education, Phase 2 project with a Monitoring 
and Evaluation Specialist to improve the data collection, analyses and reporting arrangements within the 
MOBSE.  In addition, a support mission from UNESCO/UIS team provided recommendations for the 
improvement of the M&E framework. 
 
·
Data collection
:
Although the data collection has improved significantly in the past two years, there are still 
gaps in the process for the timely analysis, cleaning, security and reporting of data both internally, and to 
external partners.  Continued attention will be required from both the senior management team and from the 
regional and cluster level officers. 
 
Capacity
:
As noted above, capacity within MOBSE/PCU has been variable, and one of the key 
recommendations of the in-country donors is to create a position for a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist 
within MOBSE, under the office of the PS or the DPS/Technical.  This Grant will be able to help with this 
capacity development, as would the PHRD Cofinancing Grant from the Government of Japan which is co-
financing the Third Education, Phase 2 project.

1. Introduction 
This rep
ort was issued in the context of the preparation phase of the third tranche of “
The 
Education For All - Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Catalytic Fund
”
for the Gambia. Initial 
grants were approved for the years 2005 – 2006 and 2007 respectively at a value of USD 4 
millions per annum for 2005-2006; and USD 5.4 millions for 2007. The EFA FTI comes as an 
additional fund for the Government of the Gambia in its commitment to achieve education for all 
developed program. The Bank is also financing the Education sector in the country through the 
Grant H230-GM signed on August 17, 2006 for USD 8 millions. 
 
A
financial management assessment was carried out in accordance with the Financial 
Management Practices Manual issued by the Financial Management Board on November 3, 
2005. The objective of the assessment was to update the previous FMA and determine whether 
the implementing entities continue to have acceptable financial management arrangements, 
which ensure that:  (1) the funds are used only for the intended purposes in an efficient and 
economical way, (2) the preparation of accurate, reliable and timely periodic financial reports, 
and (3) safeguard the entities’ assets.  
 
Executive Summary
 
The EFA-FTI project’s transactions will be managed within the existing Projects Coordination 
Unit (PCU) of the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MOBSE). The overall 
performance of the PCU in financial management was rated satisfactory by the last FM 
supervision.  
 
The fiduciary arrangements of the national implementing agencies meet the Bank’s minimum 
requirements under OP/BP10.02. It is adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate 
and timely information on the status of the project required by IDA. However, actions need to be 
taken to update the format of the Interim Financial Report (IFR) to include the EFA/FTI 
operations. 
 
Summary Project Description  
 
The main objectives of the EFA-FTI Program are to (i) increase access to and equity in primary 
education through the construction and furnishing of classrooms and teachers’ quarters (ii) 
increase participation, performance and retention rates for girls (iii) improve the quality of 
teaching and learning in schools (iv) and strengthen management and institutional capacity at the 
central and regional levels through support to sector management and regional directorates. 
 
Country Issues 
 
Financial management continues to face significant challenges. The 2003 CFAA noted that The 
Gambia was associated with a high level of fiduciary risk resulting from weak public financial 
management of the different elements of the budget cycle, including strategic budgeting, budget

preparation, budget execution, accounting, internal control and monitoring, and reporting and 
audit.

Since the 2003 CFAA, the Government has made it a priority to ensure a better execution 
of the budget, enhance the budget process and complete ongoing reforms to improve the 
efficiency and accountability of public expenditure. As a result, there have been major reforms 
addressing many of the weaknesses identified in the CFAA. A new CFAA, or possibly a PEFA, 
has been conducted in FY08 and preliminary results of the draft report show major 
improvements of public financial management since the 2003 CFAA. 
 
The “2004 Budget Management and Accountability Act” provides an updated legal framework 
for reform. Recent progress has been made in preparing comprehensive and analytical annual 
budgets for 2006 and 2007. Though significant improvements in the budget have been made, 
reforms need to continue. A significant reform achievement was the operationalization of the 
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) in January 2007.
4
The system 
provides comprehensive public expenditure and revenue management and reporting. It produces 
financial statements on a timely basis and in conformity with international standards. The IDA 
and the African Development Bank’s Joint Assistance Strategy (JSA) for 2008 to 2011 will 
provide support to further strengthen financial management structure, procedures and interface.  
 
Risk Assessment and Mitigation
 
The objectives of the project’s financial management system are to: 
 
·
ensure that funds are used only for their intended purposes in an efficient and economical 
way;  
·
ensure that funds are properly managed and flow smoothly, adequately, regularly and 
predictably in order to meet the objectives of the project; 
·
enable the preparation of accurate and timely financial reports; 
·
enable project management to monitor the efficient implementation of the project; and  
·
safeguard the project assets and resources. 
 
Furthermore, the following are necessary features of a strong financial management system that 
need to be maintained within the PCU:  
 
·
the PCU should have an adequate number and mix of skilled and experienced staff;  
·
the internal control system should ensure the conduct of an orderly and efficient payment and 
procurement process, and proper recording and safeguarding of assets and resources;  
·
the accounting system should support the project’s requests for funding and meet its 
reporting obligations to fund providers;  
·
the system should be capable of providing financial data to measure performance when 
linked to the output of the project; and  
·
an independent, qualified auditor should be appointed to review the Project’s financial 
statements and internal controls.

In view of the general country financial management issues and the issues peculiar to the PCU, 
the overall financial management risk rating for this EFA/FTI project is 
Moderate.
 
Strengths and Weaknesses of Financial Management 
 
The project financial management is 
strengthened
 by the following salient features: 
 
ƒ
The Financial and accounting personnel are adequately qualified and experienced; 
ƒ
The PCU has experience in handling with EFA FTI funds  
ƒ
Budgeting arrangements are in place; 
ƒ
Banking arrangements are adequate; 
ƒ
There is an adequate accounting software. 
 
The project financial management will ensure that the
 
Interim Un-Audited Financial Report 
(IFR) incorporates the new EFA FTI operation; 
 
Implementing Entity  
 
The PCU will constitute the operational link between IDA and the Government on matters 
related to the Fiduciary aspect. The Permanent Secretariat (PS) and the Directorate of the Basic 
and Secondary Education are responsible (MOBSE) for the implementation of the project 
activities. The EFA FTI coordinator is the Director of DOBSE.
 
During the project execution, the 
PCU and the DOBSE shall coordinate project implementation and manage: 
 
ƒ
procurement, including purchases of goods, works, and consulting services;  
ƒ
project monitoring, reporting and evaluation;  
ƒ
contractual relationships with IDA and other co-financiers; and  
ƒ
financial management and record keeping, accounts and disbursements. 
 
2. 
Budgeting 
 
The Senior Management Team (SMT) in collaboration with the PCU will finalize and submit to 
the Bank for consideration and approval, proposals for the following Financial Year in respect of 
the Work Program and Budget of EFA FTI.  
3. 
Accounting and Financial procedures   
 
The PCU will follow the Companies Act 7 in The Gambia. The project accounts will, therefore, 
be maintained under the private accounting rules. The Chart of Account and Analytical account 
will be drawn up if need for new activities of the EFA FTI. A Procedures Manual providing all 
the required details on accounting and financial procedures had been developed in the context of 
the Third Education program and will be use for the EFA FTI.  The Grant proceed will be 
accounted for on a cash basis. This will be documented with appropriate records and procedures 
to track commitments and to safeguard assets. The Chart of accounts will facilitate the 
preparation of relevant quarterly and financial statement including information on the total 
project expenditures, the financial contributions from Donors and expenditures by 
component/activities.  
Page  39
-
33 - 
 
4. 
Information System   
 
All financial accounting and reporting activities related to EFA FTI will be performed under the 
automated information system TOMPRO mastered by the PCU’s staff. TOMPRO will allow 
production of all accounting and financial data required:  Financial Statement, Bank 
reconciliation statements, all the books of accounts and all financial reports including the Interim 
Un-Audited Financial Reports (IFR). 
5. 
Internal Control and Internal Auditing 
 
The PCU is required to have in place satisfactory internal audit arrangements to assist 
management in ensuring the continuing adequacy of and conformity with the project’s 
procedures. Despite the absence of an internal audit body, key internal controls will be 
undertaken by all the high level staff including of the PS, the MOBSE and the PCU:  approval 
and authorization controls (including for procurement) are documented in the manual, Bank 
reconciliations will be prepared regularly and on a timely basis by staff independent of the 
payment function, subsidiary records of fixed assets and stocks will be maintained and all assets 
will be duly insured. The manual outline the specific internal controls to be carried out by each 
staff member of the PCU. In addition, the external auditors and the Bank will pay attention to the 
continuing adequacy of and conformity with the EFA FTI project’s procedures by the PCU 
during their review. 
6. 
Reporting and Monitoring  
The EFA-FTI Coordinator will be responsible for overall reporting on the entity. The PCU will 
prepare quarterly Interim Unaudited Financial Reports (IFR) of EFA FTI’s financial operations 
that details (i) the contributions by Donors (ii) the expenditures of the quarter broken down by 
Components/categories or activities (iii) cumulative expenditures-to-date for the financial year, 
including comparative (prior year) information (where requested); (iv) the Net fund available (v) 
details of any commitments and contingencies (vi) a Note to the Financial Statement. The Bank 
FM Specialist will ensure that on a quarterly basis, Interim Un-Audited Financial Reports (IFR) 
of EFA FTI are produced and transmitted to the Bank no later than 45 days from the end of the 
quarter.  
 
On an annual basis, the PCU will also be required to produce, no later than June 30 of the 
following fiscal year, audited annual financial statements. 
 
7. 
External Audit arrangement  
An annual audit of the financial statements will be conducted by external auditors with 
qualifications and experience judged satisfactory.  Besides expressing an opinion on the 
Financial Statements in accordance with International Standards on Auditing issued by the 
International Federation of Accountant (IFAC), the auditors will be required to comment on 
whether the contributions for EFA FTI have been used in accordance with the Financing 
Agreement.  In addition to the audit report, the auditors will be expected to prepare Management 
Letters giving observations and comments, and providing recommendations for improvements in 
Page  40
-
34 - 
accounting records, systems, controls and compliance with financial covenants in the EFA FTI 
grant agreements.  The audit reports for the fiscal year ended must be submitted not later than 
June 30 following the end of that fiscal year.  
 
8. 
Funds Flow and Disbursement Arrangements 
 
Disbursement Methods 
Under EFA FTI’s FM arrangement, disbursement will be made based on Interim Un-Audited 
Financial Reports (IFRs) . Fund flows under the grant are expected to take place, as follows:  
IDA will authorize a six-month advance to the designated account based on the EFA FTI work 
programs.  Funds would be used to:  (i) honor eligible expenditures, (ii) and make advances to 
the sub-designated accounts if needed.  Each quarter, the PCU would prepare and transmit to 
IDA the IFR together with withdrawal application form and the pooled Designated Accounts 
reconciliation statements.  IDA would review the IFR and release the amount requested (See 
flow of funds at the end of this Annex). All supporting documentation would be retained by the 
PCU and must be made available for review by periodic World Bank review missions and 
external audits.  The format of the quarterly Interim Un-audited Financial Report was discussed 
and agreed upon and will be attached to the Disbursement Letter.  The reimbursement method 
will be used for retroactive financing.  Other transaction-based payment methods can be used 
under exceptional circumstances. 
 
Designated Account
 
The Designated Account will be managed by the PCU, and will be located at the Central Bank. 
The currency of the designated account will be the US dollar. Sub-accounts may be opened at the 
regional level. The currency of the sub accounts will be the Gambian Dalasi and the allocation 
for each Sub account will be agreed with the PCU during the implementation of the project.

Annex 6
:
Procurement Arrangements 
 
A.  General  
 
Procurement for the proposed project will be carried out in accordance with the World B
ank’s 
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits," dated May 2004 and revised in 
October 2006, and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank 
Borrowers," dated May 2004 and revised in October 2006, and the provisions stipulated in the 
Financing Agreement.  The various items under different expenditure categories are described in 
general below.  For each contract to be financed by the CF Grant, the different procurement 
methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior 
review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank in the 
Procurement Plan.  The Procurement Plan, defining the procurement and selection methods and 
the requirement of IDA prior review, will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect 
the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. 
Procurement Documents   
The procurement will be carried out using the World Bank’s Standard Bidding Documents 
(SBDs) or Standard Request for Proposal (RFP) respectively for all ICB for goods and works 
and recruitment of consultants.  For National Competition Bidding (NCB), the Borrower will use 
the World Bank’s SBD for ICB for goods and works, and the Bank’s RFP for recruitment of 
consultants.   
Advertising procedure 
General Procurement Notice (GPN), Specific Procurement Notices (SPN), Requests for 
Expression of Interest, results of the evaluation and contracts award should be published in 
accordance with advertising provisions in the following guidelines: "Guidelines: Procurement 
Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of 
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers," both of which are dated May 2004 and revised in 
October 2006. 
Procurement of Works
:
Works procured under this project would include but are not limited 
to:  construction of   new classrooms and rehabilitation of existing classrooms; construction and 
rehabilitation of staff quarters for teachers in remote areas; provision of classroom furniture for 
existing schools; and provision of water points and latrines.  The procurement will be done using 
the Bank’s Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for all ICB and National SBD agreed with or 
satisfactory to the Bank including Framework Agreements with NGOs, using thresholds 
established in the section above on Procurement Arrangements.  
 
Procurement of Goods:
 Goods procured under this project would include but are not limited to:  
(a) instructional materials (including textbooks, supplementary readers, classroom tools and 
other learning and library materials); classroom furniture and laboratory materials; computers 
and office equipment (including computers and peripherals, furniture, photocopiers, overhead 
projectors and all consumables related to these machines); and small and medium-sized 
generators.  Motorcycles and vehicles shall be procured through United Nations Office of Project 
Services (UNOPS), as this offers lower prices and faster delivery times than other options
.
The 
procurement will be done using the Bank’s SBD for all ICB and National SBD agreed with or 
Page  44
Annexes, Page 
38
satisfactory to the Bank.  Small articles and office supplies as well as small equipment and 
furniture available locally and whose estimated cost is 
l
ess than thresholds indicated in the 
Procurement Arrangements section may be awarded through Shopping; in those cases, the 
written request shall be addressed to several (at least three) established suppliers. After 
comparing a minimum of three quotations, the contract will be awarded to the bidder who has 
offered the lowest price, and has demonstrated capacity to successfully execute the contract. 
 
Procurement of non-consulting services:
 
The project will support capacity building activities 
including but not limited to pre- and in-service teacher training, training for head teachers and 
senior and mentor teachers; for cluster monitors; for subject teacher associations and unions; for 
partner institutions linked to the MOBSE, and for central and regional directorate staff.  The 
project will also support activities needed for the review of curricula and syllabi, and of training 
plans and implementation modalities (see Project Implementation Manual and Procurement 
Arrangements for details).  Regarding the size of these types of contracts, the procurement 
process will be conducted under acceptable procedures to IDA. 
 
Selection of Consultants:  
The general description of consulting services (provided by firms or 
individuals) that will be financed under the Grant will include but are not limited to:  preparation 
of bid documents for works to be financed under the project; construction supervision; training 
and advisory services; expertise for the design and implementation of capacity development and 
institutional strengthening activities, among others.  The procurement plan will set forth:  (a) the 
particular contracts for consulting services required to carry out the project during an initial 
period of at least 18 months; (b) the proposed methods for selection of consultants services; and 
(c) the related Bank review procedures.
5
The Borrower shall update the Procurement Plan 
annually or as needed throughout the duration of the project. The Borrower shall implement the 
Procurement Plan in the manner in which it has been approved by the Bank 
 
Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent per 
contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.  
 
The Standard Request for Proposal (RFP) and the Sample Form of evaluation Report for the 
Consultant, as developed by the Bank, will be used for appointment of consultants.  Small 
contracts will be used for short-term assignments, i.e. not exceeding six months, carried out by 
firms or individual consultants. 
 
Operating Costs:
 
Operating costs financed by the Project are incremental expenses, including 
office supplies, vehicle operation and maintenance, insurance, maintenance of equipment, 
communication costs, rental expenses, utilities expenses, consumables, transport and 
accommodations, per diem, supervision costs and salaries of locally contracted staff.  These costs 
exclude salaries, bonuses, honoraria and fees for Government civil servants.  They will be 
procured using the implementing unit's administrative procedures, which were detailed in the 
project administrative and financial manuals, reviewed and found acceptable to IDA.

The procurement procedures and SBDs to be used for each procurement method, as well as 
model contracts for works and goods procured, are presented in the 
Project Implementation 
Manual
.
B.  Assessment of the agency’s capacity to implement procurement 
 
The assessment of the Projects Coo
rdination Unit’s capacity to implement procurement actions 
under IDA and EFA FTI Catalytic Fund (CF) financing was carried out in August 2008.  The 
objective of the assessment was to update the previous procurement assessment conducted in 
May 2006 and determine whether the implementing entities continue to offer an acceptable 
arrangement in line with Bank procedures. 
 
The assessment reviewed the organization structure, the current procurement plan 
implementation and the interaction between the project’s staff responsible for procurement. 
 
Organization Structure 
 
The CF transactions would be conducted by the existing Projects Coordination Unit (PCU) of the 
Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MOBSE).  This unit is currently headed by a 
Project Manager, and comprises a Deputy Project Manager, a Financial Controller, a 
Construction Programme Manager and a Procurement Officer, among others. 
 
The PCU team is well versed in the IDA procedures, and has handled procurement under 
previous and ongoing IDA programs as well as all other donor operations where an executing 
agency is not in place (including AfDB, BADEA,  IsDB, among others).  The Procurement 
Officer has both the technical expertise and the experience necessary to carry out the 
procurement activities envisaged under donor projects supporting the education sector program.  
This is particularly important given the scarcity of these specific skills in The Gambia.
 
Key issues
:
Based on the experience with the current IDA project implementation, adequate 
capacity exists within the PCU for procurement reporting requirements.
 
Nevertheless, the key issues and risks concerning procurement implementation of the project 
have been identified and include: (i) heavy workload for the Procurement Officer who is 
involved in procurement activities with other donors, ii) need for a better follow up for 
procurement monitoring progress. 
The corrective measures are: 
·
recruit a Procurement Assistant who will be trained on  Bank’s procurement procedures 
(latter version), 
·
set up a follow-up mechanism for procurement activities. 
 
Therefore the procurement risk is moderate for the PCU.

In addition to the prior review to be carried out by the IDA task team, there 
will be one supervision mission every six months and at least one IDA annual Post Procurement 
Review (PPR).

Procurement Plan 
 
The Recipient, at appraisal, developed a draft procurement plan for project implementation 
which provides the basis for the procurement methods.  This procurement plan will be agreed 
between the Recipient and the Project Team latter during negotiations and will be made available 
at the Coordination Unit located at MOBSE
.
It will also be available in the project’s database 
and in the Bank’s external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the 
Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and 
improvements in institutional capacity.

Annex 7:  Safeguard Policy Issues 
 
OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment 
 
OP 4.01 was triggered due to the construction and rehabilitation of schools to be funded under 
the project, including under the school improvement grants.  To address the potential negative 
environmental and social impacts, Government re-disclosed the existing Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) documents (prepared for the ongoing IDA-financed 
Third Education, Phase 2 Project) to ensure that the same policies apply to the EFA-FTI 
Catalytic Fund operation. 
 
ESMF:
 
The ESMF will be applied by qualified personnel from the Environment Impact 
Assessment Unit of the National Environment Agency, who will be consulted by the PCU at the 
time when plans for the construction or rehabilitation of schools are made to ensure that potential 
environmental and social impacts are identified, assessed and mitigated appropriately. Thus, the 
ESMF (i) describes steps 1-7 of the environmental and social screening process; (ii) includes an 
environmental checklist to be applied/amended by qualified personnel as appropriate; (iii) 
provides generic draft terms of reference for an environmental analysis, should one be required; 
and (iv) it summarizes the Bank’s operational policies to ensure that these are taken into account 
during project implementation as required.  Furthermore, the ESMF includes provisions, 
including costs estimates, for environmental management capacity building to ensure effective 
implementation of the ESMF; these costs will be incorporated into the project cost tables.  To 
ensure adequate monitoring of the implementation of the ESMF and the RPF, the Recipient 
institution responsible for environmental management, i.e the National Environment Agency, 
will be charged with the responsibility of supervising implementation and sharing their findings 
with the Bank and other interested parties.  
 
OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement 
 
OP 4.12 was triggered due to the potential need for land acquisition which might lead to the loss 
of assets, loss of shelter, loss of access to economic assets or loss of livelihood, requiring that 
affected persons be compensated and/or resettled. 
 
To address potential negative social impacts 
due to land acquisition, the Government re-disclosed the existing Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) and Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) documents, 
as noted above.

Annexes, Page

Annex 8:  Economic and Financial Analyses
 
This Annex summarizes the economic analyses that were conducted during the preparation and 
appraisal of the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund project and includes the following:  (i) an assessment of 
the macroeconomic framework, (ii) presentation of achievements and continued challenges of 
the sector, (iii) an analysis of the financing of education, and (iv) an analysis of different 
scenarios and policy options for a comprehensive medium term plan. 
 
Macroeconomic Framework  
The overall poverty headcount ratio in The Gambia is 58 percent, with large socioeconomic and 
regional variations.
6
The Gambia has enjoyed steady growth and a stable macroeconomic 
environment in recent years.  Real GDP growth has averaged 6.2 percent since 2003 after a brief 
contraction in 2002 due to low rainfalls and poor macroeconomic management.  Growth has 
been driven by tourism, construction and telecommunication, and supported by significant 
foreign direct investments which have averaged 12.8 percent of GDP since 2003.  Sustained 
fiscal and monetary discipline has been accompanied by significant improvements of public 
financial management.

The overall life expectancy in the country, estimated at 57 years (2005), is higher than the SSA 
average. The Gambia has also performed relatively well on child health indicators compared to 
the SSA average, although both the infant mortality and the under five mortality rates remain 
higher than those in Ghana and Senegal, two of the best performers of West Africa. The 
Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) is 540 per 100,000 live births (2000), which is comparable to 
similar SSA countries.  
Fiscal context 
The education sector is evolving in a difficult but improving macroeconomic framework. Fiscal 
policy has been largely consistent with macroeconomic stability. In the past four years, the 
overall fiscal balance has averaged a deficit of 5.7 percent of GDP. It significantly improved 
from a deficit of 7.8 percent of GDP in 2007 to a surplus of 0.5 percent in 2008 due to reduced 
expenditures. External concessional financing has been large, averaging 9.5 percent of GDP in 
the past four years. It has funded significant public investments in PRSP priority areas, including 
education, health, agriculture, infrastructure and public sector capacity building.

The overall medium term outlook (2008-2010) is characterized by robust growth and a stable 
macroeconomic environment. Real annual GDP growth is expected to be at 5.3 percent over 
2008-2010, consistent with recent history. The projected GDP growth rates for 2008 and 2009 
were recently revised downward given the expected impact of the global downturn and dalasi 
appreciation on tourism and remittances and the relatively poor performance of the groundnut 
sector. Growth is expected to continue to be led by tourism, construction and telecommunication, 
funded by private investments. Government is committed to curtailing extra-budgetary 
expenditures and avoiding off-budget expenditures. Prudent debt management will be critical in 
order to keep public debt sustainable after debt relief.  
Links with PRSP and CAS.
 The project is fully aligned with the PRSP and the CAS. The 
strategic priority policies and actions
 of
the PRSP are organized into five “pillars”:  (i) 
macroeconomic stability and public sector reform; (ii) promotion of pro-poor growth and 
employment through private sector development; (iii) improved basic social services; (iv) 
decentralization and strengthened local governance; and (v) multi-sectoral programs on gender, 
HIV/AIDS, environment, nutrition, and population. The proposed grant will support policy 
actions in pillars two and three. The government indicated that the PRSP initiatives were chosen 
based on their contribution towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs).
 
Financing of Education 
 
Throughout most of the recent decade, public expenditure choices crowded out domestic 
financing for education recurrent expenditure.  The share of the public recurrent budget allocated 
Page  55
Annexes, Page 
49
to education averaged just 11 percent during most of the decade, representing only 2 percent of 
GDP, far below the FTI benchmark of 20 and 3.6 percent, respectively.  However, due to high 
debt service requirements, this share rises to an average of 18 percent of total public 
discretionary recurrent expenditure (i.e. exclusive of interest payments), not very distant from the 
FTI benchmark of 20 percent on this indicator. Thus, within its fiscal space constraints, 
Government commitment to the implementation of the education sector program has been high.

compared with the FTI benchmark of a desirable 33%.  Non-salary expenditure is unpredictable 
and has declined on a per student basis. 
A
large share (about 65%) of the recurrent budget is spent on basic education.  Nevertheless, 
expenditure per student is low 
–
averaging only US$ 25 – and has remained relatively constant at 
that level since 2001.  At the secondary level, per student expenditure increased by about 40 
percent in real terms since 2001 (Chart 2).  The increase was required to liquidate arrears 
accumulated by nearly all schools because although parents pay substantial fees, the subventions 
provided have been historically too low to enable schools to cover their costs.  To address this 
problem, in 2005, the MOBSE both increased the subsidy and adopted a per student formula to 
improve equity.

Education Recurrent Expenditure per Student, 2001-2007
 
Recent achievements in the education sector
.
Over the past decade, significant successes have 
been registered within the education sector. These include expanded access to education across 
all levels of the school system, particularly by girls in the rural areas, where, in some instances, 
interventions led to the unintended decline of boys’ enrolment. The gross enrollment rate at the 
lower basic level increased from 85% in 1998 to 92% in 2007. Concurrently, the GER at the 
upper basic level, which stood at 29% in 1998, has risen by over 30% to 65%. These 
achievements have ultimately contributed to the attainment of gender parity at the basic level 
(i.e., from Grades 1 to 9). At the senior secondary level, the GER doubled from 15% in 1998 to 
32% in 2007. The textbook rental scheme has been abolished, and the student-textbook ratio is 
1:1 for the core subjects at the lower basic level; that is, from Grades 1 to 6.  While the transition 
from the lower basic (primary) level to the upper basic level increased from 72% in 1998 to 
88%
7
in 2005 as a result of phasing out the Primary School Leaving Certificate Examination, the 
transition rate from the basic level (Grade 9) to the senior secondary level (Grade 10) has 
exceeded the 50% target. The Gambia has relatively high progression and completion rates and 
low repetition.  A 2005 MICS survey estimates that 96% of an entering cohort reaches grade 5.  
The net primary completion rate averaged 80% in 2006/07.

The partnership between MOBSE and the madrassa proprietors, through the
 General 
Secretariat for Islamic/Arabic Education, continues to enhance access, whilst improving the 
quality of education provided. The teaching of the English language in the 
madrassas
 that are 
being granted-aided by MOBSE and the harmonization of the various syllabuses of the 
madrassas and their synchronization with the curriculum of the conventional schools have 
contributed to this success. Generally, resources are more equitably distributed and better utilized 
for program implementation. The reviews and updates of the curriculum have also resulted in a 
more relevant and, therefore, more responsive curriculum to stakeholder needs.
9
As evidenced by 
the 2006 and 2007 results of the West African Senior School Certificate Examination 
(WASSCE) and The Gambia Basic Education Certificate Examination (GABECE) respectively, 
the performance of students is steadily improving (Analyses of Examination Results by the 
Planning Directorate, MOBSE, 2006 and 2007).   
Improving the quality of education remains a major challenge.  The high failure rates in 
standardized tests indicate that the quality of education is still poor.  There is a need to strengthen 
the training, supervision, and support of teachers, and increase the supply of classroom materials. 
In addition, improvement of the recruitment and retention of qualified teachers in rural areas is 
essential, which calls for substantially increased incentive packages.  
9
This is in accordance with the study commissioned by the Association for the Development of Education in Africa 
(ADEA) for the 2008 Biennale.

Objectives and Sustainability of Education Development 
 
To elaborate the medium term education sector plan, a simulation model was used to determine 
the resources needed to obtain the objectives in education. This section presents the main results 
and a sustainability of these objectives.  
 
Objectives 
Lower basic education. 
In order to sustain the gains registered thus far and remain on track to 
universalize lower basic education by 2015, the following objectives have been set during the 
period of the MTP:  Acces (i) increase the admission rate from 101% to 125%; increase the LBS 
GER (including 
 madrassas
)
from 91.4% to 101.9%; (ii) reduce the repetition rate in LBS from 
5.8% to 3.6%; (iii) reduce the dropout rate in LBS from 4.1% to 2.8%; (iv) increase  the 
transition rate (from Grades 6 to 7) from 88% to 90%; (v) increase the share of enrolment for 
boys in LBS from 49% to 50%; (vi) increase the achievement scores for girls at all levels to 
catch up with boys (NAT, EGRA, etc.); (vi) focus on reading as a key foundation competency; 
and (vii) introduce national languages to ensure early literacy of children. Quality (i) increase 
grade level competence (mastery) in the core subjects from 10% to 15%; (ii) increase grade level 
competence (minimum)in the core subjects from 46% to 60%; (iii) maintain the pupil-textbook 
ratio in LBS at 1:1; (iv) decrease the pupil-supplementary reader ratio in LBS from 2:1 to 1:1; 
(v) increase hours of instruction to 866
10
;
(vi) increase frequency of school-level pedagogic 
10
 This is based on the flexible school calendars of the six educational regions.

support visits from once monthly to  once a week by cluster monitors; (vii) introduce  the 
national languages as a media of instruction in the early grades i.e. Grades 1-3 while English will 
be taught as a subject; (viii) improve reading in the early grades, with 80% of children reading at 
grade level. 
 
In upper basic education
,
the major variables of this policy is to:  (i) increase upper basic gross 
enrolment rate (including official madrassas) from 60% to 69%; (ii) reduce the repetition rate 
from 4.7% to 3%; (iii) maintain the drop out rate at 2%; (iv) decrease the pupil-textbook ratio in 
UBS from 3:1 to 1:1; and (v) decrease the pupil-supplementary reader ratio in UBS from 4:1 to 
1:1. 
 
In secondary education, 
the following policy option are considered to improve access:  
maintain the transition rate from basic to secondary education at 52%; (ii) increase the GER from 
33% to 38%; (iii) decrease the repetition rate from 4.2% to 2.7%; (iv) achieve gender parity of 
students by 2011.  For quality:  (i) increase the number of teachers from 1034 to 1531; (ii) 
increase the number of Gambian teachers to 50% by 2011; (iii) train at least 115 Gambian 
teachers each year to degree level and increase the proportion of female teachers in this group; 
and (iv) establish gender-balanced board of governors in accordance with the Education Act.
 
In higher education, 
the main policy components are to:  (i) encourage the integrated University of The 
Gambia  to offer, beginning on a limited scale, graduate programs within the existing faculties 
and in cooperation with foreign universities; (ii) reduce dependency on expatriate teaching staff; 
(iii) encourage the integrated UTG to collaborate with other universities in programs relevant to 
The Gambia; (iv) enable the integrated UTG to take up a strategic position within the national 
development program; (v) finalize the Higher Education Observatory Act; (vi) establish the 
Higher Education Observatory as the  body charged with accrediting and validating 
qualifications in order to reduce the dependency on external bodies.
 
Financing the medium term plan 
The table below estimates the total recurrent and investment financing gap for basic education. 
Based on the scenario proposed in the medium term plan, a financing gap has emerged of 
US$7.7 million for recurrent costs and US$24.9 million for investment costs. In December 2008, 
The Gambia has been allocated US$28 million under the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund covering the 
next three years (2009-2011). Therefore the overall financing gap has been reduced to 
approximately US$4.7 million. The Government is currently engaging with new donors 
possibilities to fill this remaining gap.

Annex 9:  Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework
 
OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment 
 
OP 4.01 was triggered due to the construction and rehabilitation of schools to be funded under 
the IDA project and the EFA-FTI Catalytic.  To address the potential negative environmental and 
social impacts, the IDA project:  (a) prepared an Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) because the precise locations of the schools and the potential localized 
impacts could not be identified prior to appraisal. 
 
ESMF:
 
The ESMF will be applied by qualified personnel from the Environment Impact 
Assessment Unit of the National Environment Agency, who will be consulted by the PCU at the 
time when plans for the construction of schools are made to ensure that potential environmental 
and social impacts are identified, assessed and mitigated appropriately. Thus, the ESMF (i) 
describes steps 1-7 of the environmental and social screening process; (ii) includes an 
environmental checklist to be applied/amended by qualified personnel as appropriate; (iii) 
provides generic draft terms of reference for an environmental analysis, should one be required; 
and (iv) it summarizes the Bank’s operational policies to ensure that these are taken into account 
during project implementation as required.  Furthermore, the ESMF includes provisions, 
including costs estimates, for environmental management capacity building to ensure effective 
implementation of the ESMF; these costs will be incorporated into the project cost tables. To 
ensure adequate monitoring of the implementation of the ESMF and the RPF , the Recipient 
institution responsible for environmental management, i.e the National Environment Agency, 
will be charged with the responsibility of supervising implementation and sharing their findings 
with the Bank and other interested parties.  
 
OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement 
 
OP 4.12 was triggered due to the potential need for land acquisition which might lead to the loss 
of assets, loss of shelter, loss of access to economic assets or loss of livelihood, requiring that 
affected persons be compensated and/or resettled. To address potential negative social impacts 
due to land acquisition, the IDA project prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and 
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) which were disclosed in The 
Gambia and at the Bank’s InfoShop prior to appraisal of the IDA Education Sector Project. The 
same procedures are applicable for the activities supported under the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund.
