                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A joint review mission visited The Gambia during the period of November 28 –December 22, 2011. The Mission comprised the following development partners: WFP (coordinating
                         agency of the Local Education Group), FAO, FAWEGM, IsDB, JICA, Peace Corps, PAFEG French, Spain Embassy, VSO, US Embassy, Nigeria High Commission, UNICEF, and
                         World Bank. One of the objectives of the mission was to review the activities under the EFA FTI Catalytic Fund with special attention to civil works, teacher training, M&E framework
                         and implementation arrangements including financial management and procurement.

                         As the project is approaching the original closing date, the impacts of the project on education results and outcomes have been assessed in April/May 2012.

                          1.       Stipend to Gambia College students: The project finances $11.67 to each trainee per month during the entire training program. With this and a top-up stipend of $5 per
Public Disclosure Copy




                         trainee per month by MoBSE, the intake is now over one thousand (1,077 trainees in 2009/10, 1,243 trainees 2010/11, 1,512 trainees 2011/12 received the top-up stipend of $5 per
                         trainee per month from the FTI ) albeit the directive of the Higher Education Ministry to cap the intake for all constituent schools of the College at 1000. It is evident that the demand
                         for teacher trainee places at the Gambia College has surpassed the intake capacity of the institution and the category of applicants wishing to enroll has also greatly improved in
                         terms of entry requirements.
                          2.       Construction of schools: A total of 174 new classrooms (45 are being used and 129 classrooms will be in use by the beginning of th school year ) have a lot of potential to
                         meet the growing demand for places and an estimated minimum of 10,000 additional students can be enrolled if double-shifting is taken account of.
                          3.       Construction of 24 blocks of toilets for girls in 18 schools: A total of 9,779 girls benefit from these separate toilets.
                          4.       Supply of 81 donkey carts: An estimate of 1,000 additional students per year will be attracted to school. This is based on the assumption that some of the carts, depending
                         on their locations and school-aged population, will be expected to do more than one round trip per day.
                          5.       Teacher professional development
                         (a) Training of teachers through the Primary Teachers Certificate Extension Program (PTCE): 424 trainees who are also unqualified teachers will take the final exam this academic
                         year, which contribute to an increase of qualified teachers and the corresponding reduction of unqualified teachers in the education system.
                         (b) Training of teachers on early grade literacy skills: To date, 2,492 teachers have been exposed to the pedagogical techniques in the teaching of reading to early graders. The 2011
                         EGRA Assessment preliminary results reveal some improvement of reading abilities by the early graders.
                          6.       The provision of financial assistance to 6,000 needy boys in regions 1 – 6: With this intervention, chances of these boys’ dropping out of the system have been fully reduced.
                          7.       The provision of 13,812 sanitary pads to girls in schools: The evaluation revealed that before the advent of these pads, girls were losing 10% of instructional time during
                         menstruation due to the use of inappropriate pads which generated a high frequency of change or disposal and in some instances, resulted in absenteeism. It is now expected that
                         with the provision of sanitary pads, girls’ absenteeism during menstruation will significantly be reduced.
                          8.       Hardship allowances in deprived schools: With this intervention, the average percentage of qualified teachers increased from 45% to 60%.
                          9.       Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT): It targets children who are placed under the responsibility of Marabouts. Currently 1,026 children from 12 centers are receiving instructions
                         in numeracy, literacy, life & livelihood skills. These children would not have had opportunities to be educated otherwise.


                         Component 1: Increasing access to equity in basic education

                         Increased availability of usable classrooms in under-served areas: The associated GPE (formerly FTI) grant is progressing well, although the number of new classrooms construction
                         has been reduced from 400 to 252 due to the underestimated cost estimates that were used during the project preparation. Among 252, construction of 129 classrooms through
                         GAMWORKS is well advanced and the funds are 90% disbursed. Construction of 45 classrooms under a framework agreement with FIOH is complete and the classrooms are in use.
                         The remaining 78 classrooms are to be contracted through FIOH. Rehabilitation of classrooms, construction of toilet blocks and provision of boreholes are progressing well and are
                         close to completion.

                         Evaluation of school construction costs

                         Design features: With 55 m2 nett, the average classroom size for basic education schools in The Gambia is only slightly above the average of 54.2 m2 for 5 other sub-Saharan
                         countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia). In The Gambia there is 1.2 m2 class floor area available for each pupil, which compares to 1.12 m2 for the
                         average of the 5 other countries. With 69 pupils per toilet cubicle The Gambia provides fewer sanitation than the average of 50 pupils per cubicle in the 5 other countries. The
                         Gambia provides 70% more office space and 25% more storeroom space in basic education schools than on average in the 5 other countries.

                         Construction cost (2007 price levels):       At USD 18,669 per classroom (cost includes ancillary facilities but excludes staff housing) classroom construction in The Gambia is 21%
                         more costly than the average of the 5 other countries. However, owing to the relative durability of school construction (low-maintenance materials and details) and consequent lower
                         maintenance and rehabilitation cost in The Gambia, the lifespan cost of a classroom in The Gambia (consisting of the initial investment cost plus the total of maintenance and
                         rehabilitation cost over the assumed 40 years lifespan) is 14% less than the average for the 5 other countries.

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                          Report No: ISR6455




                         Conclusion:         Because practically all building materials for the low-maintenance school construction have to be imported in The Gambia (including all basic materials for
                         concrete), the initial investment cost is relatively high. The school design is rational. Some cost saving could be achieved by reducing office and storeroom space, but some extra
                         cost would be incurred if the sanitation ratio would be increased. The provision of teachers’ quarters in rural areas is a substantial cost-increasing factor (often exceeds the cost of

                         the educational facilities). In view of the school maintenance practices throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the principle of low-maintenance construction, such as practiced in The
                         Gambia, should be encouraged.

                         Rehabilitation of 144 classrooms and 15 staff quarters have started.

                         Contraction of the 8 boreholes and 12 concrete-lined wells started in April 2012, and hand pumps for the wells will be delivered in May 2012.

                         Improved retention and completion: The number of donkey carts supply has been reduced from 100 to 81 due to the higher than expected cost. A framework agreement is expected
                         to be prepared in April 2012.

                         Maintain gender parity and address inequities: Construction of 24 blocks of toilet facilities for girls in 18 schools has been completed and handed over for use.

                         Component 2: Improving the quality of teaching and learning materials

                         Increased ratio of pupils to teachers and pupils to textbooks: This component's implementation has been satisfactory. On the supplementary readers, supply of 47 titles for a total
                         quantity of 262,470 copies were completed end April 2012. The next lot of purchase for 135,000 copies for 28 titles will commence in May 2012.

                         On the EGRA pocket readers, advertisement for bids has been launched and the bid opening is slated for April 25, 2012. This activity is expected to deliver 315,529 sets of pocket
                         readers.

                         Enhance quality provision of Special needs education: The procurement process for the purchase of equipment and other materials for hard of hearing and learning difficulties has
                         been set in motion.

                         Two activities have been conducted to support the mainstreaming of students with special needs: The training of 181 madrassa teachers in regions 1 – 6 and the training of 36
                         polyvalent itinerant teachers on the execution of the recently developed itinerant teaching program.

                         Increased number of qualified teachers: Distance learning for teacher trainees is ongoing through Gambia college: Primary Teacher Certificate (PTC) Year1, 654 students, PTC
                         Year2, 496 students, PTC Year3, 362 students and PTC Extension 424 students.

                         Policy Revision for Basic and Secondary Education (2012-2015)

                         During the reverse Supervision Mission dated April 2012, the MoBSE presented a draft revised education policy for basic and secondary education. It is the first time that the policy is
                         based on solid data. Proposed thematic areas include: access & equity, quality of teaching and learning, and sector management.

                         Under access---to attract the last 10% out of school children, service delivery approaches will be diversified. Key strategies include (i) CCT (D100/student/month) for Marabouts as an
                         economic incentive to release children on a condition that 75 percent attendance is met so they can receive some type of education to learn numeracy and literacy, and (ii) School
                         grant (D45/student/year). Other strategies include introducing a synchronizing curriculum in Madrassa education with that of mainstream schools, reducing the maximum distance
                         from home to the closest primary school from 3 km to 2 km through building multi-grade classrooms, providing special needs education, arranging customized and low cost transport
                         mechanisms, targeting gender issues in education and providing non formal education, teacher incentives, and home-grown school feeding through the involvement of the
                         communities and students.

                         Under quality of teaching and learning---strategies include providing a unified common direction for national languages, student assessments, teacher training, teaching and learning
                         materials, school improvement initiatives including reinforcing of sanctions for sexual harassment and corporal punishment, ICT in schools and Science and Technology.

                         Under sector management---areas of focus will include improvements to EMIS, M&E (x-ray of system), HR management, financing, ICT, harmonization of donors, decentralization,
                         efficiency, and performance management.

                         Also, during the April 2012 reverse Supervision Mission, MoBSE and MoHERST confirmed that they would collaborate together during their respective policy development/revision
                         exercises and data collection as well as the implementation of the policies towards an overall coherent sector-wide approach. The MoBSE key stakeholders need to be included in
                         the MoHERST policy development and the roadmap should be put into public domain. The strategic and medium term plans will be drafted jointly.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
