established\n            within BRH to provide a rediscounting and guarantee\n            mechanism for participating financial intermediaries. The\n            project also includes a technical assistance component to\n            help develop medium- and small-scale industry and to assist\n            the institutional development of BRH, FDI and the Office of\n            Industrial Promotion (ONAPI). Through the provision of\n            medium- and long-term funds and technical assistance, the\n            project would help expand the industrial sector and\n            contribute to improving its efficiency. The project would\n            directly create about 2,000 jobs, and, through its built-in\n            incentives, stimulate the financing of small- and\n            medium-scale industry, which, thus far, has had no access to\n            medium- and long-term credit."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
