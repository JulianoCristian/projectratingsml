         support the industrial development of Haiti by making\n            medium- and long-term credit available to the industrial\n            sector through Industrial Development Fund (FDI) established\n            within Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH) to provide a\n            rediscounting and guarantee mechanism for participating\n            financial intermediaries. The project also includes a\n            technical assistance component to help develop medium- and\n            small-scale industry and to assist the institutional\n            development of BRH, FDI and the Office of Industrial\n            Promotion (ONAPI). Through the provision of medium- and\n            long-term funds and technical assistance, the project would\n            help expand the industrial sector and contribute to\n            improving its efficiency. The project will directly create\n            about 2,000 jobs, and, through its built-in incentives,\n            stimulate the financing of small- and medium-scale industry,\n            which, thus far, has had no access to medium- and long-term credit."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
