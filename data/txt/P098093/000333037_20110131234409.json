were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was negligible to low, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: while\n            using existing Government channels and structures for\n            implementation was consistent with longer-term public sector\n            management objectives, reliance solely on existing civil\n            service staff was insufficient to address capacity\n            constraints. APL II foresaw greater recourse to contracted\n            staff. Experience revealed that cash and food transfers met\n            different needs at different times of the year. Design of\n            APL II sought greater flexibility in resource programming\n            between cash and food. A financial management assessment was\n            done during appraisal. The main strength identified was the\n            avoidance of setting up parallel systems. Some weaknesses\n            identified include delays in reporting, shortage of\n            qualified accountants and auditors, limited focus on\n            internal audit, and delayed staffing of the external audit\n            function. Means to strengthen the multi-donor framework\n            developed in First Adaptable Program Loan (APL I) were\n            identified. Coordinated semi-annual project reviews were\n            placed as dated covenants of the project and the donor\n            coordination unit was reinforced."}, "docdt": "2010-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
