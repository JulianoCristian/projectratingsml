To advance the second\n            objective, the operation supports reforms directed at 1)\n            strengthening public expenditure management, by establishing\n            a more strategic and transparent budget formulation process,\n            and strengthening accountability and transparency in budget\n            execution; 2) improving the internal control environment; 3)\n            improving transparency, value for money and accountability\n            in public procurement; 4) improving service delivery in the\n            health and educations sectors; 5) enhancing the\n            effectiveness of the civil service; and 6) streamlining the\n            structure of Government ministries and agencies."}, "docdt": "2003-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
