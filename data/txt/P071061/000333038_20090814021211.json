Governance Structural\n            Adjustment Credit (GSAC) Project for the Kyrgyz Republic\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory,\n            the risk to development outcome was high, Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the Bank-supported program design needs to reflect\n            the reality that comprehensive civil service reforms and\n            public expenditure management cannot be accomplished on the\n            same time schedule; civil service reforms take significantly\n            longer to achieve, depending not only on major shifts in\n            long-held attitudes toward hiring, but also the\n            Government's very ability to pay a decent salary to\n            civil servants. To put public expenditure and civil service\n            reform on the same time schedule and expecting full\n            implementation is not realistic. To achieve better results\n            and within the short timeframe of a policy operation, civil\n            service reform could be scaled down to either of a couple of\n            options: reforms that affect only a certain top layer of\n            management, as was implemented in Albania; or a pilot reform\n            that focuses on selected ministries, possibly the ministry\n            of finance, rather than all ministries at once. If senior\n            management is appropriately recruited, it can lead to\n            improved recruitment at lower levels. The ministries can\n            then ensure a higher quality, less pro forma, due process\n            recruitment. The Bank did not tailor the design of GSAC to\n            the risks of disruption of elections scheduled before the\n            end of the program. More caution is needed even if the\n            consensus is that there will be no change of government."}, "docdt": "2009-03-09T00:00:00Z"}
