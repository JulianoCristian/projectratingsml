          made under the Governance Structural Adjustment Credit\n            (GSAC) to the Kyrgyz Republic. The GSAC supports the\n            Government's program to strengthen the effectiveness of\n            the state and improve governance. It's main objectives\n            are: to improve the transparency and responsiveness of the\n            public sector and enhance the ability of external\n            stakeholders to hold it accountable and at the same time\n            increase efficiency, effectiveness of the public sector. To\n            achieve these objectives, the GSAC is supporting reforms\n            aimed at (i) improving personal accountability of political\n            officials and civil servants and enhancing the effectiveness\n            of the civil service; (ii) improving service delivery in the\n            health and education sectors; (iii) streamlining the\n            structure of Government ministries and agencies; (iv)\n            strengthening voice and participation by improving public\n            access to official information; (iv) improving the\n            interaction between regulatory agencies and business\n            enterprises; (v) strengthening public expenditure\n            management; and (vi) improving transparency, value for money\n            and accountability in public procurement. The first tranche\n            was disbursed on effectiveness of the credit on 30 July\n            2003. The second tranche was originally planned for\n            disbursement in mid 2004. However, there were delays in\n            meeting some of the critical conditions, which were\n            increased by unstable political conditions in the Kyrgyz\n            Republic following the fall of the previous government in\n            March 2005. The tranche was eventually disbursed in May\n            2007. By this time most of the conditions for the third\n            tranche had already been met. All conditions have now been\n            met. The closing date of the credit is June 30, 2008."}, "docdt": "2008-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
