                         All activities financing under the original Project have been successfully completed, and respective funds are fully disbursed. The Project has achieved its project development
                         objective (PDO) against the two original outcome indicators: enrollment rate in primary grades has increased and Parents-Teachers Associations were active in 86% of the schools in

                         started at the end of August 2012 and seems to be catching up the schedule. In light of that, the Government has expressed interest in extending the project by six months to allow
                         for the completion of the civil works and equipping the NTC.
