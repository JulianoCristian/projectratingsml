                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is closing on July 31, 2013. The project supported education development at the national level and in 7 poor rayons of the country which were among those mostly
                         affected by the civil war. Although it was designed in back to 2003 it is still relevant to the current Bank Country Assistance Strategy which aims to strengthen quality of public
                         services to enhance human capital potential. All activities financed under the original Project (accounting for 90% of the financing) have been successfully completed, and respective
                         funds are fully disbursed. The Project has achieved its project development objective (PDO) against four outcome indicators of the original project:teacher turnover in the project

                         schools has decreased; schools attract qualified teachers; Parents-Teachers Associations were active in 86% of the schools in the project districts and community opinion of quality
                         of education and willingness to send children to school has increased. Also, enrollment rate in primary grades (1-4) in the project schools has increased and transition rate from grade
                         4 to 5 in the project schools is around national average. The National Curriculum Board was established in 2003 and is operational; primary grades curriculum has been modernized
                         and introduced countrywide; more than 5 million textbooks were published and delivered to all schools in the country; premises of rayon education departments were rehabilitated in

                         all 7 project rayons; 100,500 students benefited from rehabilitation of 149 schools and construction of 2 new prototype schools; 90,800 students benefited from school furniture
                         provision; design of new prototype schools worked out by the Project is being used for construction of schools with government funding; two rounds of grade 4 student assessments
                         have been conducted and the Student Assessment Department, also established with project support, was moved to the National Testing Center. Finally, the project supported the
                         design and piloting of per capita financing in general education, which has been operational nationwide since 2010.

                         The two PDO level indicators added under the Additional Financing in 2010-- construction and equipping of the National Testing Center's (NTC) premisesâ€”are expected to be
                         achieved by the Closing Date.

                         A key element of the Project Development Objective was to improve learning conditions and school enrollment and completion through grade 5 in selected districts. However,
                         throughout the life of the project, these indicators were tracked through grade 4 which is the last year of the primary school. The project fully achieved the intended results through
                         grade 4, however, the team has no measurement for whether the results were also achieved at grade 5. For this reason only, an otherwise Satisfactory Outcome rating has been
                         downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory.
