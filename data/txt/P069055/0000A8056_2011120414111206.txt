                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has already achieved its project development objective. All the Project's original outcome indicators have been met: enrollment rate in primary grades has increased and
                         PTAs were active in 86% of the schools in the project districts. Likewise, the Additional Financing is progressing well and its indicator of the National Testing Center's premises
                         readiness for the national exams is expected to be met by the Project's closing date.

                         Original project (EdMP) activities including, school rehabilitation, school construction of two new prototype schools, capacity building at the Ministry of Education (MOE), Rayons and
                         schools, provision of school grants to communities and their successful implementation, printing the textbooks as per the existing curriculum, modernizing curriculum for primary
                         grades and the development of textbooks as per the new curriculum have been completed successfully and satisfactorily. Publishing of the developed new textbooks is the only
                         remaining activity which is underway. The Additional Financing to this project is a little behind the schedule due to delay of the National Testing Center (NTC) premises design which
