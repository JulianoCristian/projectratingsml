 2.       The Project is performing satisfactorily and its development objectives have already been almost
 entirely met through the successful completion of all components except for one--publishing of new
 textbooks. Implementation progress of the Project has been satisfactory. The Project has already
 contributed to a substantial increase in community and local school participation in decision making and
 promotion of education. During a beneficiary survey taken in June 2009, many parents, principals, and



                                                     ii
teachers confirmed the complementarities between the school grants and other interventions aimed at
making improvements in schools. In addition to the linked approach, responding to immediate, high
priority issues such as textbook distribution and school rehabilitation have been essential to the Projects'
success so far.

3.       The project has supported modernization of the curriculum for primary grades, development and
trial of the new textbooks and teachers guide based on the modernized curriculum. These activities are
completed. However, planned publishing of the developed new textbooks and teachers' guide based on
new curriculum is suspended due to move to the new system of education envisaging 1 year expansion of
primary, basic and full general education from 4 to 5, from 9 to 10 and from 11 to 12 years accordingly
(adopted by the Parliament in May 2010). The Ministry of Education (MOE) plans to revise newly
developed textbooks accordingly and publish them in 2013.

4.      The proposed reallocation is for the proceeds from the original Credit/Grant [this excludes the
proceeds from the Additional Financing of US$2 million equivalent approved on May 25, 2010]. The
reallocation is necessary to accommodate project savings occurred due to XDR-USD exchange rate
variation and reflect more accurate funding needs by category. The requested reallocation does not
involve any changes to the Project's Development Objective or associated outcome targets.

5.      It bears mentioning that the revised Financing Plan and Disbursement Estimates in the Data Sheet
include proceeds from the Additional Financing.
