Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Tajikistan is a relatively small, low-income, and landlocked country in Central Asia with a
population of 8 million people, where poverty is widespread and deep. At Project appraisal in 2003, the
country was suffering from pervasive physical damage and heavy human losses from a civil war that broke
out soon after independence in 1991. Combined with the break-up of the Soviet Union and concomitant
losses in subsidies and trade, the war left the country politically, socially, and economically vulnerable. Many
teachers left the country. School buildings were destroyed or neglected. Remaining schools suffered from
severe shortages of textbooks and teaching and learning materials. The prospect for a generation missing out
on educational opportunities afforded to previous generations was increasingly real as the education system
continued to deteriorate. Only after signing and implementing the peace accord in mid-1997 was the
government able to turn its attention to the economic and social development agenda.

2.       In 2002, the government's first full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) comprised four
elements: sustainable growth, improved governance, better provision of basic social services, and targeted
support for the poor. In 2003, the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS 2003-2005) further emphasized
selectivity and focused on three key objectives, consistent with the PRSP. One of the priorities was to
“improve community-based support of public infrastructure and services, especially health and education.”
The population was young, indicating a continued need for investment in education and social services.

3.      The World Bank supported Tajikistan’s education sector reform efforts through the Education
Reform Project (ERP, IDA-32140) from 1999-2002. The Education Modernization Project (EMP), the
subject of this report, was part of a larger engagement to continue the successful efforts of the past and to
help the government achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Education for All (EFA)
goal of universal primary school enrolment. The EMP targeted reforms to solve four main problems in the
education sector: (i) inadequate spending levels; (ii) falling enrollment and attendance; (iii) poor learning
conditions; and (iv) lack of capacity in system management and planning. If these problems had persisted,
they would have threatened to derail the sustainability of past education achievements.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

4.       The EMP’s overall goal was to stave off further decline in the education system in Tajikistan and to
support the rebuilding process. The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to set the stage for change at
the national level while improving learning conditions and school enrollment and completion through grade
5 in selected districts. Through community-driven initiatives, the project would help to develop local and
district capacity.

5.      The project’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were to:

     a. Increase enrollment rates in Project schools in grades 1-5 to 90 percent of age cohort over 2003
        enrollments.
     b. Reduce teacher turnover in Project schools to lower than national average and attract qualified new
        teachers to these schools.
     c. Increase completion rate – number of children completing grade 5 over baseline data from year one
        of project.
     d. Establish functioning school committees/parent-teacher associations (PTAs) in 70 percent of Project
        schools at the end of the Project as measured by records of meetings.
     e. Increase community contribution of resources, as well as community participation in the decision-
        making process, at the school and district level.


                                                       1
      f.   Improve community opinion of the quality of education and their willingness to send children to
           school.

6.      It should be noted, however, that the six above indicators — defined in the Results Framework of the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) — were not identical to the six indicators listed in Section A.2. Key
Performance Indicators of the PAD, as listed below:

At the target district level:

      a. Increased enrollment and completion of students through grade 5 in Project schools.
      b. Functioning Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) in 70 percent of schools receiving grant funds.
      c. 133 schools rehabilitated and equipped to provide an improved school environment.

At the national level:

      a. Development of a national curriculum framework.
      b. Revised curricula for grades 1-5 developed in at least two core subject areas.
      c. Printing of 5 basic subject textbooks for the primary level, based on new curricula.

7.       This ICR uses the KPIs as defined in the Results Framework of the PAD as a basis for measuring
project achievement, as they were more appropriately related to the PDO and were monitored throughout
project implementation.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

8.      There were no official revisions to the PDO or outcome indicators. During implementation (starting
with Implementation Status Report - ISR No. 12 in June 2007), the first PDO indicator was amended from
“grade 5” to “grade 4” to be better aligned with the primary education cycle consisting of grades 1-4 in
Tajikistan, but there was no formal restructuring to rectify the indicator.

9.      The Additional Financing (AF) grant, introduced in June 2010, outlined two additional PDO
indicators, as follows:

      a. Construction of National Testing Center (NTC) building completed.
      b. Procurement of equipment completed.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.     The EMP’s target population was comprised of direct and indirect beneficiaries, including vulnerable
students, education staff, and parents and community members at both the central and district levels. To
achieve objectives at the local level, seven target districts – Kulyab, Fayzobod, Vose, Vahdat (formerly
Kofarnihon), Shohmansur, Rogun, and Nurobod (formerly Darband) – were chosen. Specifically,
beneficiaries of various components and sub-components included chairmen of PTAs, school principals,
teachers, parents (PTA members), students, the head of the education department, and mentors. Wherever
possible, inputs from the grant schemes were to be targeted to help vulnerable students stay in school. With
regard to PCF, this Project directly supported one of the five PCF pilot districts, which was selected from the
seven Project districts.
 
1.5 Original Components (as approved)

11.        There were four components:


                                                        2
Component 1. Support for Community Initiatives (Grant Financing US$3.81 million)
12.     The objective of this component was to address issues of low enrollment and attendance of
vulnerable groups, and improve schogreatol infrastructure, while building community and district capacity in
the education sector. The component financed activities organized into three sub-components:

      1.1 School Grants to Improve Quality, Enrollment, and Infrastructure (Grant financing US$3.38
          million). Schools in the seven districts were to receive two types of grants: (a) Thematic Grants of up
          to US$2,500 focused on improving school quality and encouraging enrollment and attendance by
          vulnerable populations; and (b) Rehabilitation Grants of up to US$30,000 per school to finance
          minor rehabilitation, with a seven percent community contribution. The project aimed to work
          closely with schools to develop active, well-functioning Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs). The
          PTAs were responsible for developing grant proposals that reflected the community's input and
          needs, and for overseeing grant implementation.

      1.2 Grants to District Education Offices (Grant financing US$0.24 million). District education
          offices (DEOs) and schools in the seven pilot districts were to receive grants addressing thematic
          issues (up to US$5,000 per district over the life of the project) and for rehabilitation (up to
          US$40,000 per district). Thematic grants for DEOs aimed to support the same types of activities as
          school grants but with a focus on issues that were beyond PTA capabilities. The rehabilitation grants
          were to be provided for the rehabilitation of the DEO premises with a contribution (in cash or in-
          kind) of seven percent of the cost of the grant's project.

      1.3 Training and Technical Assistance for Beneficiaries (Grant financing US$0.19 million). This
          sub-component aimed to support community capacity building to enable communities to prioritize
          their needs, plan strategies, and develop proposals to compete for the above mentioned grants. This
          sub-component financed international and local NGOs to support communities through training
          provision and local study tours.

Component 2. Support for Capacity Building (Grant financing US$3.93 million)
13.      This component aimed to set the stage for major changes in what students were learning across the
country. It was designed to support an education system focused on real learning outcomes, know-how, and
attitudes, rather than on factual, content-based learning. This sub-component envisioned creating the
framework for change and aiming to begin the process of curriculum revision in selected primary subject
areas. This component had eight sub-components.

      2.1 Curriculum Strengthening (Grant financing US$1.13 million). This sub-component aimed to
          establish the foundations for nationwide curriculum change through support for the development of
          institutional structures, the conceptual framework, and the necessary implementation mechanisms for
          ongoing curriculum modernization and improvement.

      2.2 Development of New Textbooks Based on the Revised Curriculum (Grant financing US$0.19
          million). This sub-component aimed to finance a nationwide development process for new textbooks
          in the two selected subject areas for grades 1-4 based on the upgraded curriculum, as well as a review
          of existing manuscripts to ensure best practices before the new manuscripts were developed.

      2.3 Student Assessment and Data Collection (Grant financing US$0.22 million). This sub-component
          had two main purposes. The first was to set the foundation for developing effective national
          assessment tools for Tajikistan, by examining the problems in the assessment tool developed in the
          previous Bank-financed project, the Education Reform Project. It would also support the extension of
          the 4th grade assessment developed under the previous project to schools in the seven Project
          districts, as well as provide training to staff in test administration and analysis. Finally, this sub-
          component supported efforts to encourage school communities to participate in a system of local-


                                                        3
          level data collection in a scheme piloted by CARE International - Tajikistan, Save the Children-UK,
          and UNICEF.

      2.4 Teacher Training (Grant financing US$0.29 million). This sub-component aimed to support the
          development of in-service training for untrained teachers in targeted districts and sought to provide
          financing to replicate teacher training programs that were being developed by international NGOs
          under the USAID’s Participation Education and Knowledge Strengthening (PEAKS) program.

      2.5 Improving Financing and Management (Grant financing US$0.17 million). This sub-component
          aimed to strengthen the financing and management capacity of district finance office staff, and staff
          in the economics department of the central ministry, through training and study tours, and to provide
          technical assistance to develop a mechanism for per capita financing (PCF) to be piloted in Yovon,
          Kulyab, Vahdat, Khorugh, and Khujand. This sub-component supported the pilot in Vahdat, while
          others were supported by development partners.

      2.6 Project Monitoring and Evaluation (Grant financing US$0.33 million). This sub-component
          aimed to establish a continuous feedback process within which data collected at school and district
          levels would be entered into the national statistical system, as well as into Project monitoring and
          subsequent evaluation reports.

      2.7 School Designs (Grant financing US$0.25 million). This sub-component sought to support the
          design of two new prototype schools – one rural, one urban – with a review of the standards and
          norms for buildings, to transition from the heavy and costly buildings of the previous era to a more
          affordable and suitable model for local needs. The construction of those models was to be financed
          under Component 3.

      2.8 Management Strengthening (Grant financing US$0.61 million). This sub-component supported a
          Project Management Unit (PMU) to lead project implementation.

Component 3. Strengthening Service Delivery (Credit Financing US$12.40 million)
14.     This component aimed to support improvements in the school learning environment to ensure a good
working climate. This was to be accomplished through rehabilitating and equipping schools, as well as
printing and distributing textbooks throughout the country, including in minority languages.

      3.1 Physical Infrastructure: School Buildings (Credit financing US$4.02 million). This component
          was to support major rehabilitations in about 33 schools in the seven selected districts, and the
          replacement of two schools based on the new school designs developed under sub-component 2.7.

      3.2 Equipment for Renovated Schools (Credit financing US$2.94 million). This sub-component
          would finance equipment for the newly rehabilitated (or constructed) schools under sub-component
          3.1.

      3.3 Textbooks (Credit financing US$5.44 million). This sub-component would finance the
          printing/purchasing of 5 million school books, including foreign language books for minority groups,
          reprinting of two textbooks developed under the first project, and selected upgraded textbooks, as
          well as the development and printing of new textbooks based on the new curriculum.

Component 4. Support for Project Implementation (Credit Financing US$0.60 million)
15.      While the financing of the Project Management Unit (PMU) consultants and technical assistance for
procurement and audit was to be provided under Component 2, this component supported the provision of
office furniture for the PMU and vehicles needed for the seven districts. This component also financed the
incremental operating costs of the PMU, which included expenses for communication, fuel, car maintenance,
local travel, office supplies, and bank charges.

                                                       4
1.6 Revised Components

16.       The original components were not modified during the implementation cycle.

17.    An Additional Financing (AF) Grant in the amount of XDR 1.4 million (US$2.0 million equivalent)
was approved in 2010. The AF funded a new activity under Component 2 to design and construct the
National Testing Center (NTC), including its furnishing and equipping.

1.7 Other significant changes

18.     Project extensions. The Project was extended twice for a total of four years and seven months, as
described below:

         First extension (19 months). The original closing date of December 28, 2008, was extended until
          July 31, 2010, to allow for the completion of a number of key activities, such as:

          Development and follow-on publishing of the new textbooks based on the revised curriculum –
          sub-components 2.2 and 3.3. These sub-components were extended due to delay of the new primary
          grades curriculum modernization under sub-component 2.1, which, in turn, was caused by almost a
          year cease of the National Curriculum Board (NCB) operation. New textbook development was also
          delayed due to a dispute with the firm hired to develop, test, and print the textbooks.

          Construction of the two new prototype schools and equipping them with school furniture and
          laboratory equipment – sub-components 3.1 and 3.2. These sub-components were extended due to
          a delay of the new school prototypes. The initial school designs and costs did not fulfill the objective
          of models that were replicable in Tajikistan. The PMU had to re-hire international technical
          assistance to fulfill that objective.

         Second extension (36 months). The second extension, from July 31, 2010 to July 31, 2013, was
          granted in the context of the AF, though it also allowed for the completion of the publishing and
          distribution of new textbooks - sub-component 3.3 – which were developed (sub-component 2.2)
          based on modernized curricula (sub-component 2.1). The original sub-component aimed to publish
          five new titles in Mathematics and the Tajik language for grades 1-4. However, based on a revised
          target it was decided to publish eight new titles, instead of five.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.     Background analysis. Project preparation included a realistic assessment of the education sector in
Tajikistan and the inherent challenges to achieve positive changes. Threats and risks were clearly highlighted,
as were areas where policy changes and action were most urgent. These areas comprised textbook quality and
vulnerable student populations.

20.     Selection of target districts. The government proposed to target schools in socio-economically
disadvantaged districts and included districts that had been most affected by the civil war from 1991-1997.
Four of the selected seven districts were also located in the Rayons of Republican Subordination where girls’




                                                         5
enrollment and attendance were among the most challenging issues. 1 Hence, the selection criteria were
adequate to target disadvantaged schools and students, especially girls.

21.      Adequate assessment of risks. The EMP was a follow-up operation to the first World Bank-funded
education project in Tajikistan. As the EMP was a significantly larger investment, the Bank team focused on
identifying key risks and areas requiring close coordination with other development partners working on
education projects in Tajikistan. The team attempted to mitigate these risks in the Project design by
temporarily placing a staff person in Dushanbe to develop a stronger implementation capacity for the EMP.
Also, monitoring and supervision was undertaken with local Bank staff, particularly where community
development activities were in place. This approach contributed to the overall success of project
implementation and coordination of donors’ involvement.

22.      Overly-ambitious project design. Despite various risk mitigation measures, the original project
design was overly ambitious to be effectively implemented within the intended timeframe. The result of the
ambitious design was two extensions of the closing date. Even without new activities added for the AF, some
of the original activities could not have been completed without the second extension.

23.       Lack of readiness. The initial design anticipated significant accomplishments in the Project’s first
year. However, there were delays in establishing the National Curriculum Board (NCB), and in staffing the
PMU —effectiveness conditions outlined in the Financial Agreement. As a result, implementation was
initially slow, as reflected in slow disbursement; for a little over a year after project effectiveness, there were
no disbursements beyond the initial Special Account allocation. These key delays indicated a lack of initial
readiness to implement the Project’s activities. However, after initial delays, there was constant progress in
the implementation of all project activities.

24.     Institutional capacity. Difficult political and economic conditions notwithstanding, a key
consideration during Project preparation was the MOE’s low institutional capacity. The MOE’s capacity was
an important component, since the Project intended to undertake multiple activities simultaneously. Low
capacity meant that there was an increased likelihood that certain initiatives under the Project would have
suffered during implementation.

2.2 Implementation

25.      Government interference and staff turnover. The political stability and consistency in the
government’s commitment to education reforms contributed to the Project’s successful implementation.
However, changes in senior Ministry of Education (MOE) management generated some governance
weaknesses and hindered implementation progress for several months. There were four ministers in total
throughout Project implementation. While four different minister appointments may not have been optimal
for the implementation of the Project, considering the ten-year length of the Project, these changes were not
overly frequent.

26.     For instance, when the MOE reassigned several members of the NCB during the project’s third year,
the NCB became inactive for almost one year – the MOE’s new management needed to become familiar with
the new structure and its own role – delaying the curriculum strengthening and modernization objective. This
incident primarily slowed down the development of new textbooks. In addition, textbook development was
delayed due to a dispute with the firm hired by the PMU; and textbook publishing was delayed because of
changes in the composition of the NCB Board following the appointment of a new Minister of Education.

27.      Lastly, during implementation, the Project’s Executive Director was reassigned without any
consultation with the Bank. This staff decision was made unilaterally despite the Project Operational Manual
including a provision that the Bank would be consulted prior to any staff reassignment. The Bank insisted
that a new PMU Director should have been selected on a competitive basis, and provided no objection on the
selection.

28.      Lack of project ownership and restructuring of the MOE. The PMU was established in 1999 by
government decree as an autonomous legal entity and entrusted with the overall management and
implementation of Project activities for the first Bank-funded education project. The PMU had the capacity to
implement most Project activities in a timely and effective manner — the physical and financial
implementation progress of the Project was consistently rated satisfactory – but the organization relied on
decision-making by the MOE. This reliance resulted in implementation delays in the NCB’s operations and
staff appointments. Given the MOE’s perceived weak capacity at the time of Project preparation, the creation
of the special entity for implementation was a pragmatic solution.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

29.      Design. An overarching shortcoming of the M&E design was the unavailability of complete and
reliable baseline data, especially in relation to the enrollment and attendance of students. For example, the
Project aimed to increase the enrollment rate for grades 1-4 to more than 90 percent. However, according to
the most accurate baseline data for each pilot district made available in 2007, it is likely that the enrollment
rates were already more than 90 percent in most target areas. The Project suffered not only from the lack of
reliable information and specificity in defining indicators, but also from the absence of an impact
measurement plan.

30.     This example of shortcomings in constructing the indicators was identified in several project updates
and the mid-term review (MTR), but there were no formally approved revisions to the indicator or the
overarching PDO.

31.     Implementation and Utilization. Throughout the Project, there was a lack of overall program
support for M&E. Baseline data for a complicated set of indicators were not available at start-up. Simplified
and aligned indicators, as well as data collection plans, were generated and subsequently used, but not until
2006. 2 By the MTR in May 2006, a baseline data collection plan was developed but the baseline and
stakeholder surveys were poorly organized. As such, the surveys could not provide a practical baseline. By
2007, the Project had achieved an improved M&E system to track implementation of Project activities but the
framework to assess Project impact remained weak.3

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

32.      Financial Management. The Bank team performed a financial management (FM) assessment during
the preparation stage. The financial arrangements were found to be satisfactory. However, at the MTR, the
FM capacity was observed to be weak. In 2006, it was noted that “transactions are not entered on a regular
basis into the FM system, adequate access levels have not been set up to prevent unauthorized transactions,
and reports are not being prepared regularly. FM reports are not used by management of PMU for day-to-day
management of Project activities.”4 However, financial management assessments performed later during the
life of the Project found that the Project’s reporting and budgeting arrangements were in place and

appropriate, the accounting records were properly maintained, and internal control procedures were
acceptable.

33.     The ICR team notes, however, that there was a delay in submitting the outstanding 2010 audit for the
entire portfolio, which was submitted only in December 2011. The delivery of the 2011 audit was again
delayed. It should be noted that the audit for all Bank-supported projects in Tajikistan is procured by the State
Investment Committee and delays are beyond the control of the PMU and the MOE. The 2011 audit report
was eventually submitted to the Bank in September 2012 and was found unmodified.

34.    Procurement. The procurement reviews performed during the life of the Project found that the
procurements were satisfactory.

35.      Safeguards. The environmental safeguards were in place, and supported through sufficient Project
staff, as well as policies developed and adopted. Specifically, the AF activity of constructing the NTC
triggered an environmental assessment. Such assessment determined that the impact of the AF activity was
minor, and it was easily managed during implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

36.      Project outcomes have high prospects for sustainability. The government has embraced many of the
reform initiatives taken by the EMP — e.g, national assessments, per capita financing, the establishment of
the NTC, and curriculum development and teacher training — and integrated them into the National Strategy
for Education Development (NSED) programs. To ensure sustainability, the government institutionalized
activities in the following ways:

         National Curriculum Board. The NCB actively operates within the Academy of Education. The
          NCB’s tasks include review of the proposed curriculum changes, and new textbook manuscripts.
         National assessments. The government ensured the sustainability of student assessments and the
          NTC by transferring the Student Assessment Department to the NTC.
         Per capita financing. This activity was initially implemented in five districts—one of which was
          supported by the EMP while development partners supported others — and its success resulted in the
          expansion of per capita financing to all schools nationwide.
         School design. The government embraced the design of the two prototype schools, which in turn has
          become standard for all new schools being constructed.

37.      Project activities were implemented in close coordination with key stakeholders, including MOE
specialists, managers, and representatives from local executive bodies of the state authority of the pilot
districts, as well as community members familiar with the EMP initiatives. This participatory approach
generated support from various stakeholders for the reform initiatives.

38.      A confluence of other factors will safeguard the likelihood of Project sustainability. Some of these
factors include multi-donor partnerships to build the MOE’s capacity and ownership of education reform
projects. One such partnership has been developed with the Russian Education Aid for Development (READ)
trust fund, which aims to continue supporting the NTC. The newly approved Fourth Global Partnership for
Education (GPE-4) is expected to build on the success of the EMP and expand them further to improve
learning conditions in early schooling and general education, inclusive of curricula, teaching materials and
practices, and physical infrastructure.

39.     One possible risk to post-completion operation is staff reassignment and turnover. Unilateral
reassignment of the Project Executive Director was a concern to the Bank. Staff reassignment and turnover
could result in institutional instability, thus compromising the Project’s gains.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

40.      The objectives of the Project were and remain highly relevant today. An underlying benefit of this
Project that is understated, is the strengthening of Tajikistan’s education system to meet the MDGs and EFA
goal of universal primary school enrollment. The objective to strengthen the local capacity also remains
relevant because strong local capacity is a foundation for any future reforms.

Design

41.      Design was relevant, particularly in addressing the overall needs of Tajikistan’s education sector and
selected districts. The first component, Support for Community Initiatives was designed to build the capacity
of districts and communities to complement the capacity-building efforts of other areas in the education
sector. The provision of grants to schools and support to communities through training in PCF and PTA
development allowed the EMP to improve funding at the school level, learning conditions, and management.
This component served as the foundation to improve the partnership between community groups and schools.
The success of this component was needed to implement and sustain the positive impacts of the Project,
including improved student enrollment, rehabilitated school buildings, and trained teachers and principals.

42.     Similar to the first component, the second – Support for Capacity Building – also focused on capacity
building. The main distinction between the two components, however, was that the second was targeted
nationally and the first, locally. It is evident, therefore, that this component is linked to the other components
and contributed to their success. Most of the reforms initiated and achieved under this component have
remained relevant today, including: the introduction of PCF in five districts, and its subsequent success,
which led to the expansion of PCF to all districts; student assessment, which continues being reformed with
support from the READ; and the development of curriculum, leading to further improvement supported under
the newly approved GPE-4.

43.     The third component, Strengthening Service Delivery aimed to improve the quality of services and
the conditions needed for improved learning. The focus of this component, therefore, resided in providing the
tools needed to generate positive education outcomes: physical infrastructure, equipment for rehabilitated
schools, and textbooks. As found in the team’s thorough literature review on Schools’ Physical Condition and
Learning Outcomes, international evidence suggests that students’ ability to learn is strongly affected by their
physical environment. By improving the physical conditions of schools that were in dire condition, this
component contributed to improving students’ learning and remained relevant for the overall goal of the
government to improve the conditions for better learning.

Implementation

44.     The operations of the PMU were critical to the EMP because of their role in communicating with the
MOE and various stakeholders. As the MOE’s project implementation capacity was strengthened, the shift of
the implementation responsibility from the PMU to the MOE for the Additional Financing was a timely
decision. The complete closure of the PMU by the end of the project remained relevant for the shared goal of
strengthening the government’s own implementation capacity.

45.     The National Curriculum Board (NCB) was established to implement and monitor strategies for
curriculum development. However, when the implementation of Sub-component 2.1 Curriculum
Strengthening was delayed, the mid-term review recommended that the NCB become the “national authority
responsible for the coordination of all activities and initiatives related to curriculum design and development
in Tajikistan.”5 By the closure of the EMP, the NCB became a member of the Academy of Education and
remained relevant for the implementation of the curriculum reforms.

46.     Lastly, in 2004, the Project was the first of its kind to use the country’s Treasury system and to
introduce an innovative fund transfer mechanism directly from the PMU to PTAs that were not legal entities.
The new mechanism succeeded in removing unnecessary intermediate entities between the two, reducing
potential delays and room for corruption and making the funding flow efficient and transparent.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

47.      The following eight PDO indicators measured the achievement of PDO in terms of four distinct
aspects: (i) setting national stage for change; (ii) improving learning conditions in selected districts; (iii)
improving school enrollment and completion through grade 5 in selected districts; and (iv) the development
of local and district capacity. Assessing the achievement of the PDO presented many challenges, particularly
concerning the evaluation of reforms, due to the lack of baseline data and/or concerns about the reliability of
the available data. Below are achievements in terms of each of the eight PDO indicators.

       2003 enrollments, by the end of the project.

48.      The first indicator measured the school enrollment component of the PDO. The original indicator
sought to increase enrollment rates in grades 1-5. However, as Tajikistan inherited the Soviet education
system with primary grades 1-4, during implementation it was decided that enrollment would be measured
for grades 1-4. Even though it is not explicitly stated, based on the data which includes figures above 100
percent, the Project collected “gross” enrollment rates. The December 2007 Implementation Status and
Results Report (ISR) reported that enrollment rates for grade 1 were above 90 percent in six of the seven
districts, but baseline data for grades 1-4 were not collected. Without comparable data, it is not clear whether
the enrollment rate in each district dramatically improved between 2004 and 2007; or the average rate of 88.7
percent in 2004 was inaccurate. Nevertheless, by the end of the Project, the enrollment rate for grades 1-4
increased to 99.9 percent, which seems to suggest that school enrollment in the target districts improved
considerably during the Project implementation.

49.     It is likely that many Project activities contributed to the enrollment rate increase. Those activities
include the distribution of grants to the poorest and most vulnerable students in the community. The
beneficiary survey indicated that 97 percent of students noted positive changes occurring at their schools
since the Project started. For instance, informal sports clubs became more active and these involved children
from needy families. In target schools in Shohmansur, parent and student organizations were supporting
children from needy families through fund-raising and donations for clothes, footwear, and medicine. The
prospect of receiving clothing, footwear, and musical instruments may have contributed directly to encourage
out-of-school children in the Project areas to attend school.

50.      The indicators above measured whether learning conditions improved. These outcome indicators
were measured in terms of the average teacher turnover rate in the target districts only without a national
average. However, teacher turnover substantially decreased in the target districts from 10.7 percent to 7.5
percent. The decrease may be attributed to the success of the thematic and rehabilitation grants. Both of these
grants aimed to improve the physical structure and learning conditions. According to the beneficiary survey,
79 percent of teachers believed that the impact of their grant projects resulted in the improvement of learning
conditions. This improvement might have been one incentive for teachers to continue working at their
respective schools, reducing the overall teacher turnover rate in the Project schools that benefitted from
improvements. However, it should be noted that the overall salary increases for teachers across the country
might have also positively contributed to retaining teachers. Salaries for teachers at the primary and
secondary levels rose by 30 percent in September 2011, and by an additional 60 percent one year later. As
such, it is not possible to deconstruct impacts of these multiple factors.

51.      Concerning the measurement of schools attracting qualified new teachers, this indicator was
measured by comparing the percentage of teachers ranked in the “high” category in project schools in the
seven targeted districts, and national average of teachers. In September 2012, the percentage of teachers in
the “high” category in project schools was 27 percent, while the national average was 27 percent in 2009.
This outcome indicator did not have a baseline value, and therefore, it is not possible to assess whether the
target was achieved. However, since the targeted districts were among those most affected by the civil war –
with high levels of outmigration, including outmigration of teachers, it was likely that the values of many
indicators in the targeted districts were worse than the national average at the beginning of the Project, thus
indicating relative improvement.

52.      This indicator measured the “completion through grade 5” component of the PDO. Rather than
measuring 5th grade completion rates as originally proposed, the Bank team decided to measure transition
rates from 4th to 5th grade in targeted areas compared to the national average. This decision was made because
the original syntax including “grade 5” was an oversight; and the grade 4 completion rate was unavailable. In
September 2012, this outcome indicator’s value was 99.3 percent, compared to 99.5 percent in September
2008. Although the transition rate of the targeted district was comparable to the national average, the lack of

                                                       11
a baseline value for these districts does not allow for evaluation of progress or failure with regard to
achieving the target. Similar to the previous outcome indicator, since the targeted districts were among those
most affected by the civil war and the values of many indicators were likely to be worse than the national
average, the values comparable to the national average today might suggest substantial improvement in the
target districts.

53.      This indicator measured whether local and distrist capacity was developed. The outcome indicator for
this goal was to establish functioning school committees/PTAs. The results were evaluated in early 2009 right
after the component activities had been completed. After achieving the goal to establish functioning PTAs in
70 percent of schools, 97.3 percent of parents, and 98.9 percent of teachers responded positively that they
wanted their PTA to continue its work, and 95.6 percent of parents were actually involved in a PTA with a
working plan. PTAs remained active in the majority of schools even after project completion and continued
contributing to annual plans for textbooks rental. One of the activities that contributed to the existence of
functioning school committees/PTAs was the creation of working plans. It appears that the head of the PTA
and school principals were monitoring the meetings, which also contributed to the sustainability of the PTAs
after their establishment.

54.      This indicator measured the development of local and district capacity. Data were not available to
establish a baseline value. This outcome indicator was not measured during the Project implementation.
However, according to the Borrower’s Project Completion Report, communities contributed to the
rehabilitation grants through financial and in-kind means. The government later provided a more specific
figure of the contribution as 7.1 percent. In addition, communities contributed 8.3 percent of the total cost of
the thematic grants.

55.     In October 2013, a Bank team visited Kulyab and Vose and confirmed with the respective local
education authorities and schools that PTAs, especially those which were registered as judicial entities during
the EMP and opened their own bank accounts, remained active. Main activities carried out by the PTAs
include assistance in school maintenance, organization of extracurricular activities, provision of reading
books for libraries, and support to children from poor families. In addition to the support from the EMP, these
PTAs received continuous support from the FTI Grant and the Bank-funded Governance Project, which
contributed to keeping them active and involved in the school budget decision-making process. The
transparent decision-making process in school financing has encouraged PTAs to contribute more to school
maintenance and activities.

56.      This indicator measured whether learning conditions and school enrollment improved. This outcome
indicator was measured by determining whether there was an increase in community opinion of education
quality, and parents’ willingness to send their children to school. According to the beneficiary survey, some
parents who had been concerned about the safety of their children, particularly that of girls, were no longer
concerned, and indicated a greater desire to send their children to school due to the restored school fences and
repaired roofs supported under the grant components. Indeed, the results of the beneficiary assessment
suggest positive responses from parents. As such, the ICR team acknowledges that this outcome indicator
achieved its target.

58.     This indicator was also added when the AF grant introduced in 2010 and measured whether the stage
for change at the national level was set. The outcome indicator was the completion of equipment procurement
for the NTC building. By the end of the Project, necessary equipment was fully installed, and hence, the
target was met.

59.     The rayons selected for the Project were among the most adversely affected by the war, and the
economic, political, and social conditions were far below those of other districts. The EMP resulted in
substantial improvement from the poor existing conditions due to the war.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

60.      Rationale for public sector provision. In 1990, education received about 22.1 percent of the
national budget, but this allocation had fallen sharply to 12.3 percent in 1998. In 2001, public spending on
education had recovered only to 15-16 percent (2.4 percent of GDP), which was significantly below past –
and average – levels in other countries. Public spending was supplemented by private spending at a level
roughly equivalent to public spending. Private spending was, and remained, a burden on all families,
especially poor families. In many cases, children were informally asked to pay fees for attendance, or for
special lessons, particularly in urban areas. Under these circumstances, the decision to invest IDA funds to
stop further deterioration and improve primary education, especially by targeting disadvantaged districts, was
an efficient and effective one not to create a lost generation.

61.     The ICR team did not have sufficient or relevant data to conduct a Net Present Value (NPV) or Rate
of Return (RoR) analysis. As such, efficiency gains were measured through PCF reform.

62.     Per capita financing. The rationale for continued public sector provision is evident. However, old
normative financing standards were not efficient. PCF allowed schools to decide how to allocate the financial
resources provided by the government to improve efficiency. The Bank piloted PCF in Vahdat. The success

                                                      13
of the Bank’s pilot led to an expansion of PCF by other donors: Yovon (CARE); Kulyab (PEAKS/USAID);
Vahdat (World Bank/PIU); Khorugh (Aga Khan Foundation); Khujand (OSI). The Bank’s PCF pilot, and
subsequent expansion to other districts, aimed to increase efficiency, equity, and transparency in distribution
of public resources for general education between Tajikistan’s rayons (districts, smaller administrative units
below oblasts - regions) and between schools.

      A. The PCF reform aimed to achieve success by shifting from financing institutions and teachers to the
         financing of students. One of the expected outcomes of the PCF reform was efficiency gain without
         compromising the quality. The efficiency gain is typically measured in terms of the average class size
         and the number of classes, as well as the student-teacher ratio, or in the case of Tajikistan, the
         student-stavka ratio.6

          In Vahdat, one of the five districts where the PCF was piloted, average class size increased from 19
          students per class to 20.7 in 2013, and the student-stavka ratio from 11.2 to 15.4 in the same period,
          indicating a positive effect of PCF. The PCF reform initiated by the EMP and other donor-funded
          projects was fully embraced by the government and has been expanded nationwide, resulting in
          further efficiency gains.

      B. The PCF reform was implemented together with the enhancement of school autonomy in managing
         human and financial resources. Unlike the previous school financing mechanism, PCF allows schools
         to decide how to allocate their budget according to their needs. This means that they could reallocate
         savings from personnel expenditures to non-personnel expenditures and spend it more efficiently
         according to their needs.

63.      The following table shows average class size, and student-stavka ratios in 10 districts, including the
five pilot districts. Comparing the ratios in the transition year to 2010, and 2013, indicates the efficiency
improvements of the PCF initiative in the majority of the 10 districts. This report references 2010 regarding
the PCF initiative since the Project was originally scheduled to be completed in that year.

  The Stavka—which is a terminology unique to the Former Soviet Union countries—refers to the teaching load. One stavka may
range typically from 18 to 24 hours and may vary across countries. Teachers may teach less or more than one stavka, which is also
usually defined in legislation. Whereas the student-stavka ratio reflects the total teaching load of teachers accurately, the student-
teacher ratio (unless the full-time equivalent teacher is used) reflects the headcount of teachers whose workload could widely vary.

                                                                 14
 NOTE: After the introduction in five rayons/towns supported by five different donors, the PCF’s nationwide
 expansion in subsequent years was supported mainly by FTI.

   Rayons/towns that implemented other components of the EMP.

64.      World Bank’s role in PCF. The Project supported the PCF pilot in one of the five pilot districts as
well as the initial development of the PCF reform. Following the successful implementation of the pilot, in
2006, the Minister of Finance approached the Bank with a request to assist the MOE and MOF in improving
the design of the PCF model and expanding it nationally. With the Bank’s assistance, the PCF model was re-
designed, and subsequently introduced nationwide in phases from 2007 through 2010 using Fast Track
Initiative (FTI) funds.

Challenges

65.     The Government has increased the education wage bill in recent years: 30 percent in 2011 and 65
percent in 2012. However, the formula parameters for these years did not adequately account for the increase.
This oversight resulted in an increase of the wage bill share in the school budget: from 71 percent in 2010 to
85 percent in 2012. If such an approach is applied to 2013 and 2014 (40 percent wage bill increase vs. 34
percent PCF parameters increase), then the wage bill share would have been more than 90 percent in 46 out
of 68 rayons, and it will be higher than allocated schools budget in 22 out of those 46 rayons.

    1. Due to these key factors, schools are already losing incentives to use resources efficiently (e.g. an
       unjustified increase in the number of class groups is observed). If the situation is not addressed, it
       may be difficult to justify the sustainability of PCF.

    2. Further non-wage share decline to a certain level and/or abolishing the PCF and accompanied school
       autonomy in the budget allocations will most likely result in a lack of funds for the school buildings
       maintenance which in turn may question rationale for further investments in school infrastructure
       upgrade.

66.     The Project’s length is an important efficiency concern. Although the Project achieved many
objectives, its accomplishments took twice the length as intended due to Project extensions for original
components and new activities introduced in the Additional Financing initiative. The ICR team notes,
however, that one possible explanation for the long duration of the Project may be Tajikistan’s short history
of implementing Bank-funded projects, as in other former Soviet Union countries. As such, drawing on
knowledge and experience from previous education development efforts was not feasible, providing an
additional challenge.

Project/Component Cost

67.     Total Project Cost. The initial cost estimate for the original Project consisted of US$20 million
equivalent from IDA and US$4.19 million equivalent from the government which were estimated based on
the original percentage of the Bank’s financing. The Amendment to the Development Financing Agreement
in 2005 which reflected new Country Financial Parameters for Tajkistan resulted in a lower percentage of the
Borrower’s contribution. Additionally, due to the fluctuation of the exchange rates between the Special
Drawing Rights (XDR) and the US dollars, the IDA allocation increased by 11 percent to US$22.2 million.
The implication of the exchange rate fluctuation is discussed later. The AF was in the amount of US$2
million equivalent from IDA. The Project fully disbursed by its closing, but as noted above, the timeframe
was twice as long as originally intended.

68.     Component 1: Support for Community Initiatives was estimated to cost US$6.11 million
equivalent. By the Project’s conclusion, this component had cost 100 percent of the adjusted appraisal
estimate. The difference between the appraisal estimate and the adjusted plan amount is consistent with the
Bank’s support for increasing the maximum amount for different grants available to schools and DEOs. After

                                                         15
successfully implementing the first round, the amount of thematic grants for schools was increased from
US$2,500 to US$5,000 per grant, or the maximum amount per school from US$5,000 to US$10,000.
Similarly, rehabilitation grants were initially limited to US$30,000 per school, but this amount was increased
to US $50,000 per school. The rehabilitation grants for DEOs were also increased from US $40,000 to US
$50,000.

69.     Component 2: Support for Capacity Building did not experience any cost overruns. This
component was estimated to cost US$5.09 million, which included the allocation for the AF (US$2.0
million). The actual implementation cost was 94.11 percent of the adjusted appraisal estimate.

70.     Component 3: Strengthening Service Delivery experienced minor cost overruns of 0.5 percent. The
adjusted appraisal estimate was US$15.24 million. However, implementation of these activities cost
US$15.32 million by the Project’s conclusion. The extension granted to complete the components activities
was an early indicator that cost overruns were possible.

71.      Component 4: Support for Project Implementation was estimated to cost US$1.29 million. The
activities related to supporting completion of this component included acquiring office furniture for the PMU,
vehicles for the seven target districts, and the PMU’s incremental operating costs. The implementation cost
was US$1.29 million.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.     The EMP contributed to initiating and institutionalizing many significant education reforms.
The Project achieved its objective of ensuring that community-driven projects involve parents and
community members in education initiatives, and appears to have contributed to improved learning
conditions and increased enrollment and completion. The implementation of grants, involvement of the
community in PCF, and regular participation of PTA members in school planning and problem solving
contributed positively to the overall outcome rating, and are also sustainable achievements. The Project
supported the creation and institutionalization of a Student Assessment system, Curriculum Board, and PCF.
Regarding PCF, it contributed to enhancing coordination among development partners. Despite all these
achievements to strengthen the education system in Tajikistan, the EMP’s overall outcome is rated
moderately satisfactory primarily because many PDO indicators were not properly defined or monitored,
thereby reducing the degree of attribution to the Project. Additionally, the PDO was never revised, despite a
number of opportunities, including the Mid-Term Review and the restructuring at the time of approval of
Additional Financing. Finally, the twice as long duration as the original timeframe is also a downside.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

73.     By selecting relatively disadvantaged districts for grant components, the Project aimed to engage the
poorer students in rural areas. According to responses to the beneficiary survey, it appears that grants
intended to support the poorest and most vulnerable students in the community have also resulted in
promoting activities to build social skills and improve daily living. These activities include sports circles
being established, donation drives, and fundraisers. In particular, musical instruments, skill-building tools for
girls such as sewing machines, and improved sanitary facilities have contributed to increasing girls’
attendance.




                                                       16
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

74.      The Project was the first externally-funded operation to use the country’s administrative
infrastructure, developing and successfully implementing a new scheme of funds transfer from the PMU to
PTAs which are non-legal entities. Eventually, the Treasury was used more widely by the FTI Grants series.

75.    The Project contributed significantly to capacity building of the MOE. While initially the Project
was implemented by an Implementation Unit made up of consultants, toward the last three years
implementation was devolved to the MOE, which was fully responsible for implementing the AF.

76.     The need for coordination among donors, within the MOE, and between the PMU and those involved
throughout the education sector required constant monitoring. While donor coordination is needed in all
development settings, it is even more critical in countries like Tajikistan where funding is limited, immediate
needs are immense, and the capacity at all levels is severely inadequate. Through partnerships and
communicating with donors and the MOE, the EMP was able to strengthen the foundation for education
reforms.

77.      Additionally, the Project contributed significantly to institutional change and strengthening through
the establishment of national assessments by transferring the Student Assessment Department to the NTC, as
well as the improved operation of the National Curriculum Board, after initial interruptions.

78.      The Project contributed to strengthening the human and physical capacity at the local level. This will
be essential to sustain the Project’s achievements. The combination of physical investment such as
rehabilitation, desks, chairs, and textbooks, as well as investment in human resources, such as school
management training for teachers and principals has proven to be effective in mobilizing local resources and
sustaining the impacts.  

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

79.      Due to a competitive textbook publishing and school furniture procurement, the Project contributed
to local market development: under the first education project (ERP) only one local firm participated in the
process for textbook publishing due to a lack of local private companies. In contrast, under the EMP, the
majority of the contracts were awarded to local companies. Support for textbook development and publishing
under the Project has also resulted in the creation of a database of local textbook authors.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

80.    The PMU conducted a beneficiary survey on a sample of the seven target districts between April and
June 2009. While the surveys were not statistically representative, and accounted for only completed
components and sub-components at that time, the results indicate some of the benefits derived from the EMP.
Key findings are listed below:

        At the time of the survey, 100 percent of PTAs at the evaluated schools were functioning and
         increased their community reputation. (Note that, by December 2009, only 86 percent of PTAs were
         functioning according to the Project’s ISRs).
        PTAs contributed to proposing strategies to solve urgent school problems.
        Parents and students reported improvement in the quality of education. Parents also reported an
         improved attitude in their desire to send children to school.
        Teachers with secondary education have received training certified by the MOE.




                                                      17
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

81.     The government is fully committed to sustaining development outcomes. Most importantly, the
government and the MOE have considered primary education as a priority reform area, and closely
collaborated with the Bank in implementing the EMP as part of a comprehensive education reform agenda.
The government is fully committed to pursuing education reforms in close partnership with development
partners, including the Bank. Many reforms have been fully institutionalized in the education system,
including the NCB, SAD, and NTC, and it is highly likely that these institutions will remain. The newly
approved GPE and on-going READ-funded projects will continue supporting the government in sustaining
the achievements through the EMP.

82.      School building prototypes. The Project supported designing and building two new prototype
schools, one each in Vose and Kulyab. School directors, teachers, and students of the two schools are pleased
with the new design, e.g., energy efficiency with improved insulation, adequate width of corridors, and easy
maintenance. The design has been adopted as a prototype by the government and used for other school
construction supported by the government. It is likely that the government will continue using the prototype
for future school construction.

83.      PTA participation. On the other hand, sustainable operation of new schools will partly depend on
the financial commitment of local governments and schools. Even though it had been agreed that the local
government (khukumat) would connect the new school to the district rayon’s central electricity and water
systems, the khukumat of Vose district has not fulfilled its commitments three years after the school was
constructed. The school in Vose was connected to electricity and water due to the school’s, and PTA, efforts
and funds available under PCF. In Kulyab, the school did not have any funding for maintenance – small
refurbishing tasks and repairs – because the school director was changing every year and was unaware of
his/her responsibility for allocating school budget for maintenance.

84.     PCF. While the successful nationwide expansion of PCF proved its institutionalization, a number of
challenges have arisen that threaten the sustainability of PCF implementation, as discussed above. It is
essential that the government continues to adapt the PCF model to suit the emerging needs, while pursuing
the foundamental principles to ensure the sustainability of the reform.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.     Overall, the Project was thoroughly prepared, particularly incorporating lessons of the previous
World Bank-funded Education Reform Project. Further, the EMP preparation focused on addressing
Tajikistan’s education priorities. The Project’s design provided for involvement and coordination of activities
with other donors. Feedback from the government indicated that the Bank provided adequate technical
assistance by engaging local and international consultants during the preparation of the Project. The
government also specified that support from the Bank team provided an opportunity to refine the Project’s
proposal to adhere to Bank standards and guidelines.

86.     However, the ambitious project implementation timetable and objectives suggest that the Bank team
may have overestimated the capacity of the implementation agency as well as local market providers,
specifically regarding the school rehabilitation component and textbook printing. More importantly, the

                                                      18
Bank team failed to define relevant PDO indicators and collect needed data to effectively monitor project
implementation, despite having had opportunities for doing such: one restructuring process and one
Additional Financing process.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

87.     During the project preparation, the Bank team was aware of two main challenges: undertaking
several complex activities would be difficult; and the socio-economic climate of Tajikistan provided
additional complexities. The activities also required ongoing support including technical, management,
networking, information gathering, and troubleshooting. The Bank team appointed a local Bank staff member
to closely support the project implementation and donor coordination. Given MOE and PMU staff’s high
turnover as well as the intense coordination required for EMP progress, the Bank provided sufficient
technical and management supervision.

88.     Overall, the Bank performed 22 supervision missions. Prior to each mission, the PMU prepared and
submitted progress reports, which helped to accomplish each mission’s objectives. The supervisory missions
included staff with specific expertise who helped to address issues and identify timely, yet feasible solutions,
and supported implementation. Additionally, the Bank staff performed a post-completion mission to obtain
feedback from the Project’s beneficiaries.

89.     Although the Bank provided strong support to the government, the main weakness of the Bank
team’s performance is the inadequate attention paid to the Results Framework. Despite numerous warnings
about the inadequacy of monitoring indicators and lack of baseline and actual data, the Bank team did not
take action to formalize needed changes and make the indicators more relevant and able to be monitored,
despite a number of opportunities noted above.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

90.     Throughout project preparation and implementation, the Bank team did not spare their support to the
government and Implementation Agency and worked closely to assure timely and effective preparation and
implementation of Project activities. In addition, the Bank team was engaged in policy dialogue beyond the
project implementation period and contributed to defining the overall framework for more comprehensive
education reforms. Unfortunately, the Project faced difficulties in tracking and assessing outcome
achievements due to a flawed M&E mechanism. For this reason, overall performance is rated moderately
unsatisfactory. 7

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


7
  The proposed MU rating is given in recognition of the important shortcomings of the Bank team to take appropriate actions during
the project implementation. According to the ICR Guidelines (page 37), when the rating for one dimension is in the satisfactory range
(i.e., MS for QAE in this case) while the rating for the other dimension is in the unsatisfactory range (i.e., MU for supervision
quality), the rating for overall Bank Performance normally depends on the Outcome rating. Thus, the ICR team could have rated the
overall rating for Bank performance MS, but instead, it took a conscious decision to downgrade it to show that the fact that some of
the indicators as specified in the PAD were not met were not related to project's poor design and/or performance, but the fact that the
Bank's team missed at least two opportunities to correct the Results Framework and change the indicators to more relevant.




                                                                 19
91.      The EMP was the second World Bank-funded education project undertaken in Tajikistan. As such, it
appears that the government’s commitment to the EMP resulted from being aware of the expectations and
requirements associated with Bank projects. The Borrower’s commitment to education reform was consistent
at the national, regional, and local levels. Most significantly, the commitment to per capita financing reform
was focused and thus contributed to the success of the initiative. The government was less focused, however,
on supporting student assessment in the beginning,8 but it renewed its commitment to student assessment
reforms to be funded through the AF (and the READ).

92.      There were extensions for activities outlined in the original components. Further, the government
requested the Bank to consider another closing date extension near project’s end. While most of the
objectives and activities, with the exception of the PDO level indicators added by the AF, were completed
due to extensions being granted, certain delays resulted directly from the government’s action, particularly
staff turnover and reassignment, as well as an early absence of ownership of the project and capacity.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.    The MOE, supported by the PMU, was committed to the education system reform throughout project
implementation and used capacity built under the Project as a basis for preparing the National Strategy for
Education Development (NSED) and coordinating its implementation.

94.     After the initial difficulties, the PMU significantly improved its knowledge of Bank procedures,
guidelines throughout implementation, and overall project management capacity. These improvements
contributed to better implementation. The M&E deficiencies noted early in implementation were overcome
with the assistance of an international consultant.

95.      On the other hand, the MOE experienced many administrative and personnel changes throughout the
life of the project that caused delays in some activities. These changes included recruitment, training, staff
turnover, and adjustments in procedure and structure, e.g., National Curriculum Board (NCB) members and
PMU Director. During 2006, the PMU was also without a director for several months. A new director was
appointed only after the MTR team and the PMU addressed this key staffing issue.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

96.      Based on numerous achievements and only a handful of shortcomings experienced during the
Project, the overall Borrower’s Performance is rated as moderately satisfactory. The main accomplishments
which contributed to the rating:

         Commitment to critical aspects of the Project, particularly PCF, NCB and SA.
         Borrower’s overall ability to regain momentum and recover from project delays.
         Incorporating the Bank’s feedback throughout the project about concerns, particularly the PMU’s
          M&E unit. Improvement was due partly to the commitment of the PMU director.
         Incorporating the EMP’s accomplishments and lessons into the country’s education strategy, NSED
          particularly the intent to replicate community involvement through PTAs.

97.       Shortcomings affecting the borrower’s overall performance rating:




8
    AM Education MTR, May 17 – 30, 2006; ISR 10, 6/22/2006; ISR 11, 4/9/2007

                                                        20
        Lack of ownership within the MOE at various stages of project implementation.
        Reassigning the PMU Director without consulting the Bank, even though unilateral action was not
         accepted in the Project Operational Manual. Additionally, during the project there was no PMU
         Director for approximately five months. This administrative oversight contributed to a disbursement
         lag which, at one time, was 27 percent.
        Delays in reviewing the NCB membership. This delay adversely affected the implementation of
         curriculum reform activities, which slowed the development of new textbooks.

6. Lessons Learned

Design

98.      Adequacy and measurement of outcome indicators. The EMP indicators presented measurement
challenges. First, baseline data for many indicators were unavailable, inaccurate, and unreliable at the
preparation and initial implementation stages. Some indicators were not suitably defined. For instance,
establishing a baseline derived from averaging the seven districts, and comparing it to a national average for
the actual, appears to be an inconsistent approach for determining whether the target was achieved. This
potential issue, however, went unaddressed for subsequent iterations of the ISR, although this averaging
approach was identified in 2008. Therefore, in future education projects, if baseline data is unavailable at
project implementation, teams should be prepared to develop alternative indicators to reliably capture the
impact of the intended program.

99.     Choice of instruments. Overall, it appears that project design was too ambitious for the initial
timeframe. For instance, it seems unrealistic to complete an entire curriculum reform—from the revision of
curricula to textbook revision based on the new curricula to the publication of the new textbooks—in five
years. For resource- and time-intensive interventions, an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) may have been a
more appropriate instrument.9

Implementation

100. Targeted incentives and reforms for involvement. Providing incentives during a project may help
to obtain support from stakeholders who stand to benefit, even if they are not yet aware of the impact of the
project’s success on their well-being. In the case of the EMP, the success of Component 1 – Thematic and
Small Grants – led to increased community-member interest in being involved with the education process in
schools, and directly influenced the involvement of children from vulnerable sections of the population. The
MOE needs to give special attention to targeted incentives, such as thematic and small grants, in future
initiatives, particularly regarding the sustainability of the EMP’s interventions.

101. Stakeholder ownership and cooperation. Partnerships and cooperation between schools and local
communities clearly demonstrated a positive result in developing and improving the education quality and
level of students’ knowledge, and their attendance. The partnerships were associated with a decrease in
teacher turnover and an increase in student interest. Partnerships were not limited to schools and local
communities, but also included collaboration with national institutions to implement various components of
the EMP.

102.   Advantage of NGO collaboration. The Project benefitted from the expertise of a local NGO,
Fidokor, which conducted an independent evaluation of the EMP implementation using beneficiary

  An APL provides phased support for long-term development programs and involves a series of loans that build on
lessons obtained from previous loan(s) in the series.

                                                         21
interviews. The beneficiaries indicated positive changes in the learning environment and education system in
Tajikistan. As an independent evaluator with knowledge of the country’s education system, Fidokor was able
to address specific impacts of the EMP on the ground, in addition to those of general education reforms.
Thus, it was important to take advantage of such an NGO as an independent evaluator.

103. Balancing improving hard and soft inputs. A comprehensive multi-pronged approach allowed
objectives to improve learning conditions. This approach included both the upgrade and rehabilitation of
physical structures and improvement of skills of the individuals who use the structures to help students learn
better —teachers. The two interventions were critical to improving the education sector. Maintenance of the
structures will be critical to ensuring that the gains generated from reforms are not lost. Therefore, the
government should balance future efforts regarding maintenance, toward the physical school structures, and
the individuals who use the structures.

104. Adherence to Results Framework. During implementation, some PDO indicators were excluded in
ISRs for unknown reasons, and subsequently added in latter stages of the Project to adhere to the PAD.
Excluding PDO indicators without formal approval and the missed opportunities to restructure the PDO
question the integrity, reliability, and quality of M&E mechanisms, particularly for a project of this length.
As such, the Bank team needs to strengthen its supervision capacity, especially regular and comprehensive
reviews of the results framework, especially when Task Team Leaders change over time.

105. Improved enforcement mechanisms. The reassignment of the Project’s Executive Director was
done unilaterally, although the Project Operational Manual contained a provision that the Bank would be
consulted. However, there are no enforcement mechanisms to deter unilateral decision-making regarding staff
reassignment. Future projects can consider enforcement mechanisms in their Project Operational Manuals,
since low staff turnover provides stability throughout the Project’s duration.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      The EMP achieved the following outputs based on the components outlined in the PAD, and included
through the AF grant:

2.       Component 1: Support for Community Initiatives (Grant Financing US$6.11 million). This
component aimed to support the implementation of grants to schools and district education offices in the
seven target districts of Kulyab, Fayzobod, Vose, Vahdat, Shohmansur, Roghum, and Nurobod. The goals of
the three sub-components were achieved by the initial deadline of December 28, 2008.

3.       Sub-component 1.1: School Grants to Improve Quality, Enrollment and Infrastructure. Under this
sub-component, the EMP provided thematic and rehabilitation grants to schools: 438 thematic grants were
provided to 403 schools; and 113 schools were rehabilitated through the rehabilitation grant program. For the
first time, a mechanism to transfer funds to PTAs (non-budget entity) using the Treasury system was
developed, piloted and later adopted for other projects: a positive development beyond the Bank’s portfolio in
relation to the EMP.

4.      Sub-component 1.2: Grants to District Education Offices. This sub-component was designed to
provide both thematic and rehabilitation grants to DEOs in the seven targeted districts, and also in some of
the schools in those districts. Nine thematic grants were implemented by providing school fences in Kulyab;
repairing 941 desks and chairs in Vahdat and Fayzobod; equipping a library in Roghun, renovating the toilet
and equipment of DEO teachers’ room in Nurobod; procuring school equipment and a minibus in Vose; and
creating an informational network and website in Shohmansur.

5.     Regarding the use of rehabilitation grants to DEOs under this sub-component, four DEOs in Vahdat,
Fayzobod, Roghun, and Shohmansur were rehabilitated, and three other DEOs in Kulyab, Nurobod, and Vose
were constructed. Additional support to district offices for equipment and furniture is accounted for in
Component 3.

6.       Sub-component 1.3: Training and Technical Assistance for Beneficiaries. The Project financed
international and local NGOs to assist the communities to prioritize needs, plan strategies, and develop
proposals to compete for the grants. It also supported workshops and local study tours for the communities to
learn and exchange experiences on grant activities. PTAs in all schools were established, and 86 percent of
them were active by the end of 2008.

7.      Component 2: Support for Capacity Building (Grant Financing $4.79 million). This component
focused on improving learning materials, as well as the skills of students and teachers to support the
education system to focus on real learning outcomes. As curriculum revisions and associated textbooks and
teaching would take time to complete, this component focused on creating the framework for change and
began the process of revision in selected primary subject areas.

8.     Sub-component 2.1 Curriculum Strengthening. The curriculum development process under the
EMP was guided by the National Curriculum Board (NCB), which was established under this sub-component
aimed to strengthen the existing curriculum. In 2007, a new Curriculum Framework and curriculum for
primary grades were developed and adopted by the MOE.

9.      The NCB comprised 11 members: the Chairman and board members. The Chairman was the Minister
of Education and the board members were education specialists. There were 18 working groups for each
curriculum subject, each consisting of 5-7 members. A standard curriculum approval procedure was
developed within the project and subsequently adopted:

    1. New curriculum and textbooks were discussed by experts as a group and their opinions were relayed.


                                                     24
    2. The curriculum/textbook manuscripts, together with expert opinions, were discussed at the NCB
       sitting. As a result of a discussion, three options emerged:
       a. Rejection;
       b. Approval and recommendation for submission for MOE review and approval;
       c. Improvement and amendments (by the same author’s team or with involvement of external
            experts) and resubmission for NCB review after amendments included.

10.     Recommended materials are submitted to the First Deputy Minister (together with the minutes of the
discussion) for MOE review and adoption. The NCB played a significant (leading) role in the development of
the curricula for primary school (grades 1-4) in 2007, as well as educational standards for secondary school
(grades 1-11) in 2009.

11.     Curricula for primary schools were printed and distributed to schools using Project funds (1,000
copies) and the MOE’s budget (1,000 additional copies). In addition to the printing of curricula, the Project
provided for the development and printing of teacher manuals for primary school teachers, and 6,000 copies
were printed using Project funds. The comprehensive approach within this Project sub-component
contributed to achievement of Project objectives.

12.     Presently, the NCB consists of a Board and 18 working groups. The MOE plans to continue using the
NCB in development of a new generation of educational standards as per adopted procedures. The support of
a working group will be continued through the individual contracts with the National Institute for Education
Development. However, NCB members will act on a voluntary basis without any honoraria. The NCB has
regular monthly sittings, although, ad-hoc meeting might be called upon at the request of the chairperson, if
necessary.

13.     Sub-component 2.2: Development of New Textbooks Based on the Revised Curriculum. The
Project also contributed to the creation and adoption of a comprehensive approach to textbook development.
This approach was used for the development of new textbooks for primary schools based on the creation of
new educational standards for primary school to print 300,000 textbooks more than planned (5.3 million
textbooks in total).

14.     The sub-component’s implementation was managed by the PMU with the active involvement of the
MOE. The initiative outlined in this sub-component involved training for stakeholders such as authors,
experts, publishers, MOE staff responsible for supplying textbooks to schools, as well as teachers involved in
textbooks piloting. A pool of local authors was also created.

15.      The initial aim of this sub-component was the development of five textbooks. However, due to
project savings, additional titles were developed, totaling eight, exceeding the initial target.

16.      Sub-component 2.3: Student Assessment and Data Collection. Student assessment took place in
2004 and 2008. The first assessment instrument was substandard, and revised with assistance from the
international consultant. The subsequent assessment results were highly regarded by the MOE, and evaluated
2,225 students from 103 schools in 12 districts. This sub-component financed training and equipment of the
Student Assessment Department (SAD) within the Republican Training and Methodological Center (RTMC)
which was later moved to the NTC.

17.    With Additional Financing funds, the activities of the sub-component built and equipped the NTC
premises, and supported further training activities for the NTC staff.

18.      Sub-component 2.4: Teacher Training. The training included in this sub-component laid out a
model for in-service training of teachers who did not have formal professional education – i.e. not certified.
The Project supported the development of in-service training modules for these teachers in the Project
districts. This sub-component’s aims were revised during the EMP, reducing the number of untrained

                                                     25
teachers who required additional training. The original goal was the professional development of 350 teachers.
This goal was revised downward to 200 teachers as the MOE modified the teacher selection criteria. Out of
198 teachers who completed training courses, 191 teachers received national diplomas. The 191 teachers
were located in the following five districts: Vose (41), Vahdat (70), Fayzobod (33), Roghun (23), and
Nurobod (24). There were no teachers from the Shohmansur district of Dushanbe who met the criteria.
Additionally, in Kulyab, few teachers who met the criteria were covered by a similar GIZ project.

19.      Sub-component 2.5: Improving Financing and Management. Per capita financing was initially
scheduled to be implemented in five districts (with donor support in each): Yovon (CARE); Kulyab
(PEAKS/USAID); Vahdat (World Bank/PIU); Khorugh (Aga Khan Foundation); Khujand (OSI). The success
of PCF is indicated in its implementation being achieved before the original deadline for the EMP. This was
one sub-component which was “closed” by the deadline of December 28, 2008, and was expanded to other
districts.

20.    Sub-component 2.6 Project monitoring & evaluation. The proposed plan, stemming from the
monitoring and evaluation goal, was to establish a method for grade 4 student assessments within the RTMC.
The SAD sector had conducted two rounds of student assessments in 2004 and in 2008.

21.     The first assessment round did not provide informative results due to substandard testing and
assessment tools. The tools were revised in 2005 and then in 2007, and the second round provided a more
comprehensive picture of the educational sector. The MOE did not appreciate it initially. However, with
assistance from the WB, the instrument was revised and adopted as a standard assessment tool.

22.      In May 2013, this instrument was reviewed by several Central Asian Republics and Kazakhstan
countries at the conference arranged by the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), and it was
recommended to use this tool as a basis for student assessments in the region. Additionally, the student
assessment instruments were adopted as a tool for overall education system management as part of the
MOE’s capacity building efforts. It was agreed that the financing of the NTC will be shared between READ
(technologies) and EMP (additional financing agreement for financing the building construction). There was
a delay in its construction. However, it was completed by July 31, 2013.

23.     The MOE regards the NTC as an anti-corruption instrument, since it introduces a new university
entrance system. NTC is a nucleus for the development of the country’s quality assurance system.

24.     Sub-component 2.7: School Designs. As outlined in the project design, two new prototypes were
developed for the project. These prototypes established new standards for schools and were used by the MOE
outside the EMP activities as a standard design for new schools being constructed in Tajikistan.

25.     The PMU organized a competition for proposed designs. Submissions were judged by a commission
appointed by the MOE. It appears that the initial winning design was rejected by the Bank due to high
construction costs. The design was modified, and subsequently approved for the prototypes.

26.      Sub-component 2.8: Management strengthening. This sub-component aimed to address staffing
levels. It appears that this sub-component achieved its aims since the technical assistance was managed well
and contributed to strengthening management, and capacity.

27.      Component 3: Strengthening Service Delivery (Credit and Grant Financing US$15.32 million).
The aim of this component was to strengthen the delivery of services in multiple areas such as physical
infrastructure, equipment, and textbooks.

28.      Sub-component 3.1: Physical Infrastructure: School Buildings. The inclusion of this school
rehabilitation sub-component focused on major rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts not covered under
other components. The selection criteria for schools adopted at the project preparation stage reflected the

                                                     26
overall school’s infrastructure. Based on the criterion of needing major repair, 33 schools with 35,000 school
children benefited from the project.

29.    The same criteria were applied in 2008 by the government of Tajikistan in development and adoption
of the State Program on Schools’ Rehabilitation and Construction for 2008-2015. The construction
monitoring scheme developed within the project, with a network of engineers and close involvement of local
communities and school directors in rehabilitation planning, monitoring and final acceptance, is now part of
the MOE standard procedures for school construction and rehabilitation.

30.      During the project implementation for each project site, the monitoring procedures included several
stages and authorities: project engineers managed daily monitoring; PTA representatives performed weekly
checks; and the DoE representative performed other construction works inspection. In some cases the
representatives of the Ministry of Emergency were involved in examining project sites to investigate the
feasibility of the construction plans for environmental compliance and against natural disasters.

31.      Combined with the sub-component focused on school design, the two prototype schools were built
under this sub-component focused on physical infrastructure. As such, two new schools were constructed
based on prototype designs, and six new buildings were constructed in addition to the rehabilitation of 33
schools.

32.     Sub-component 3.2 Equipment for Renovated Schools. This sub-component aimed to purchase
equipment for the rehabilitated schools in the seven districts. School equipment for approximately 90,740
students and 3,680 teachers and school principals was scheduled to be obtained and distributed.

33.     Sub-component 3.3 Textbook provision. The sub-component was implemented by the PMU. The
Textbook Revolving Fund (TRF) was established at the MOE under the previous education project (ERP).
Within the EMP, 52 textbook titles for the national (Tajik) language were printed for all school grades in the
amount of 4.33 million copies. Eight titles in Uzbek, Kyrgyz, and Russian languages were procured. One
million copies for the eight titles were printed. As such, 60 titles and 5.3 million copies were procured).

34.     Presently, the TRF is a sustainable body responsible for responding to all textbook demand across the
country. The system appears to work well, and the charges collected for textbook rentals to schools allow for
the annual printing of up to 12 new titles to replace the used and worn books. The annual national budget
provides funds for the production of two new textbooks titles).

35.      However, Tajikistan is facing rapid population growth. In 2003, the population was 6.5 million. In
2012, however the population rose dramatically to 8 million. As such, the school-age population has also
increased. The TRF is seeking new opportunities to provide for this increased school-age population. As a
result, in 2012, the TRF piloted the sale of surplus textbooks through retail network with the permission of
the MOE to obtain additional funding.

36.      The independent international auditing firm (Deloitte & Touche) conducted the most recent TRF
audit.

37.     Component 4: Support for Project Implementation (Credit Financing US$1.29 million). The
project was initially implemented by the PMU. However, during the project, the MOE assumed
implementation responsibilities for the AF activities. As such, project implementation support has been
achieved due to the increased capacity of the MOE undertaking the AF activities.

38.      To summarize, it appears that the overall EMP outputs and outcomes include the following:




                                                     27
1. Improvement in MOE capacity building in project management, financial management and public
   procurement, construction (capital investments) management, and overall education system
   management at the regional and local level.
2. Project funds were less than 10 percent of total spending on education in Tajikistan. However, the
   EMP provided more visibility due to targeted financing mechanism and transparency in funding and
   reporting.
3. EMP provided incentives for PTA growth and involvement in school maintenance. The establishment
   of PTAs positively influenced parents’ interest and desire to send their children to schools.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

1.       In 2004, the Government adopted an education reform action plan that intended to introduce per capita
financing (PCF) in general education. In 2005, PCF pilot as designed by a USAID funded regional project
started in five rayons with support from different partners: Yovon (CARE); Kulyab (PEAKS/USAID); Vahdat
(World Bank/PIU); Khorugh (Aga Khan Foundation); Khujand (OSI). In 2006, the Minister of Finance
approached the Bank with a request to assist the MOF and MOE in the PCF model design and introduction.

2.       With the Bank’s assistance, the PCF model was re-designed. PCF was then implemented nationwide
in stages, from 2007 through 2010 using Fast Track Initiative (FTI) funds. The FTI funds were also used to
assist the MOE and MOF in drafting all associated documents.

PCF objectives:

     1. To increase efficiency and transparency in education resources utilization at a school level, and
     2. To increase equity, equality and transparency in distribution of the public education resources among
        the rayons10.

Through:

      Shifting from financing of institutions to financing of students (from input-based financing to the
       PCF), and
      Providing more autonomy to schools in resource management (human, material and financial)

Achievements:

     1. Rayon education budget is being formed according to the formula, that results in (i) more equality,
        equity and transparency of the public funds allocation among the districts, and (ii) simplification of
        the Mid-term expenditure framework (MTEF) process.

     2. A decrease of the wage bill share in the school budget from 92.8 percent in 2005 to 71 percent in
        2010, providing more room for non-wage spending for quality improvement.

     3. Only in 2007 and 2008, due to rationalization and class size increase around 3,180 excessive class
        groups were reduced (equivalent to a reduction of approximately 150 schools).

     4. Only in 2010 (the last year of the phased introduction), the number of class groups in the schools
        moved to PCF that year was reduced by 1,423 while the number of students in those schools increased
        by 4,936. These changes saved TJS 5.69 million of the state budget.

     5. The following table shows average class size, and student-stavka ratios in 10 districts, including the
        five pilot districts. Comparing the ratios in the transition year to 2010, and 2013, indicates the
        efficiency improvements of the PCF initiative in a majority of the 10 districts.

Challenges:

The Government has increased the education wage bill in recent years: 30 percent in 2011 and 65 percent in
2012. However, the formula parameters for these years did not adequately account for the increase. This
oversight resulted in an increase of the wage bill share in the school budget: from 71 percent in 2010 to 85
percent in 2012. If such an approach is applied to 2013 and 2014 (40 percent wage bill increase vs. 34 percent
PCF parameters increase), then the wage bill share would have been more than 90 percent in 46 out of 68
rayons, and it will be higher than allocated schools budget in 22 out of those 46 rayons.

    3. Due to these key factors, schools are already losing incentives to use resources efficiently (e.g. an
       unjustified increase in the number of class groups is observed). If the situation is not addressed, it
       may be difficult to justify the sustainability of PCF.

    4. Further non-wage share decline to a certain level and/or abolishing the PCF and accompanied school
       autonomy in the budget allocations will most likely result in a lack of funds for the school buildings
       maintenance which in turn may question rationale for further investments in school infrastructure
       upgrade.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The following table outlines the beneficiary survey responses based on the evaluation by the Public
organization “Fidokor,” which was performed in December 2008. The purpose of the survey was to
determine perceptions of the Project’s overall successes, component’s strengths, weaknesses, and
sustainability. Identical questions were asked in individual and group interviews. Overall, 66 individuals were
asked questions: 6 school principals, 16 parents, 26 teachers, 12 government officials and staff (including
MOE, DEO, representatives from the Pedagogical College, and the PMU), 2 World Bank Staff, and 4 NGO
education experts. The number of respondents is indicated in parentheses, and respondents were allowed to
give multiple responses.

ICR Main Conclusions

I. Revised Development Objective and Components

1.       During the Project Mid-Term Review (MTR) in 2006, the output indicators were reviewed and
revised to better reflect the reality of the education sector’s challenges, and to effectively use the project’s
budget savings. Within the indicators, the main beneficiary group covered grades 1-4, not grades 1-5, due to
the official division in the country. The preliminary indicators of the project, with the agreement of the WB,
had been modified and took the following form:

    A. 318 schools receiving thematic grants completed and 100 schools rehabilitated through community
       contracting
    B. Grant funds are targeted to the poorest and vulnerable students and communities
    C. National Curriculum Board functioning, curriculum frameworks are developed, as well as curriculum
       on 2 subjects for 1-4 grades
    D. Five textbooks developed and printed for primary grades according to new curricula
    E. PCF pilot is evaluated and recommendations for scaling-up in the whole country were presented to
       the Government
    F. 4th grade assessment run successfully at least once in 100 schools in seven project districts
    G. Approximately 200 untrained teachers working in seven districts receive training certified by the
       MOE
    H. 5 million textbooks printed and delivered
    I. Tables and desks are delivered to schools and are in use
    J. 33 large schools rehabilitated and in use by the end of the project
    K. Two prototype schools designed and built to new design
    L. Procurement and financial management present minimal problems during implementation
    M. International consultancies are well managed and contribute to capacity building of education staff

II. Achievement of Outcomes

2.      Enrollment rates increase in project schools in grades 1-5 to 90 percent of age cohort over 2003
enrollments, by the end of the project. After adjusting the outcome indicator to grades 1-4 instead of grades
1-5, the number of students' coverage starting from the first to the fourth grades in the pilot districts had
increased to more than 90 percent in comparison to the level of attendance in 2003.

3.      Teacher turnover in project schools is lower than average for the country and the schools
attract qualified new teachers. Achieving this goal meant retaining more teachers who were qualified. It
appears that there was a reduction in the outflow of teachers in pilot schools by means of teacher training and
improved work conditions at schools.

4.      Completion rate - no of children completing grade 5 over baseline data from year one of
project. Based on an official report from the MOE, the completion rate for primary grades was more than 95
percent at evaluation.

5.      Functioning school committees/PTAs in 70 percent of project schools at the end of the project
as measured by records of meetings. This outcome was achieved since 100 percent of pilot schools had
PTAs, and 85.7 percent of them were actively functioning. The latter statistic was obtained from a final
evaluation.


                                                      37
6.       Increase in community contribution of resources as well as community participation in the
decision making process at the school and district level. At evaluation, it appears that the initiatives were
successful since there was an increase in the role and contribution of the communities in training processes at
schools. These initiatives included PTA creation and functioning in approximately 90 percent of schools of
pilot districts, and participation and contribution in implementation of thematic grants.

7.      Increase in community opinions of quality of education and in willingness to send children to
school. In obtaining opinions of community members in the beneficiary survey, it appears that most of
interviewed parents positively responded to questions about the quality of education in the schools, and
willingness to send their children to schools.

III. Products by Component

Component 1: Support for Community Initiatives

8.      The sub-component School Grants to Improve Quality, Enrollment and Infrastructure: included
two types of grants – thematic and rehabilitation grants.

9.      Regarding thematic grants, during EMP implementation, PTAs prepared and submitted 828 project
applications, out of which 552 thematic grant projects were approved. In general, 493 thematic grant projects
were successfully implemented.

10.     Regarding rehabilitation grants, during Project implementation, 189 rehabilitation grant proposals
were submitted. Of these 189 proposals, 116 were approved and implemented. Previously, it was prescribed
that PTAs had to contribute to the rehabilitation grant projects: 7 percent. However, accounting for economic
challenges facing PTAs regarding contributing such an amount, the community decided to accept in-kind
contributions.

11.      The sub-component Grants to District Education Offices: With the aim to prolong the impact and
stability of the Project in seven pilot districts, it was foreseen to raise interest of DEOs by offering thematic
projects and improved service delivery of the education offices through rehabilitation. Additionally, all pilot
DEOs had been supplied with office furniture and technical equipment. DEOs engagement had a significant
impact on the cooperation and subsequent benefits of completed activities.

12.     The sub-component Training and Technical Assistance for Beneficiaries: For the expansion of
training modules and PTA: on organization of PTA, school’s problem prioritization, preparation and
implementation of grants (thematic and rehabilitation projects), at the beginning of the Project Training
modules had been modified as a result of trainings conducted at the locations of the national
consultants/firms. As a result, in all 468 schools of seven pilot districts trainings had been conducted for more
than 35,000 beneficiaries on four themes, and materials had been distributed from Project funds. As a result,
all PTAs received training, and success had been evaluated as very high.

Component 2: Support for Capacity Building

13.      The sub-component Curriculum Strengthening focused on establishing the National Curriculum
Board which has been headed by the Deputy Minister of Education. During the work process, working
groups had been organized for curriculum modernization for mathematics, mother tongue (Tajik language),
arts and handcrafts, and singing and music, as supported under the EMP. Within the scope of the project, to
create favorable conditions, NCB was fully equipped with furniture and technical equipment. By the Order of
the Minister of Education dated December 9, 2005 #965 NCB membership had been renovated and continued
its activity. During the Project implementation, PMU had also proposed technical assistance by hiring
international consultants for the NCB.


                                                       38
14.     The NCB has been created and is functioning.

15.     This sub-component Development of New Textbooks Based on the Revised Curriculum focused on
producing five new textbook titles. However, with the Bank’s agreement, eight titles were produced, as well
as materials for teachers on the Mother Tongue (Tajik Language) and Mathematics for primary grades (1-4)
with project savings. The international consulting firm was involved in the process.

16.     The sub-component Student Assessment and Data Collection was modified during the mid-term
review, and directed toward capacity building and assessment of grade 4. Within the scope of this sub-
component, a Student Assessment Department (SAD) had been. With financial aid under the EMP, computer
equipment and computer programs had been procured and office furniture had been proposed for the SAD.
For the aid of the SAD specialists, international and local consultants had been hired and the specialists were
trained in the training centers of Bulgaria and the Netherlands (CITO). Testing tools had been formulated,
and testing had been conducted in 103 schools of 12 pilot districts of per capita financing. Data had been
analyzed and full report had been distributed to all of the schools nationwide for information. Conducted first
student assessment had been evaluated as satisfactory by the MOE.

17.    With the aim of capacity strengthening and attainment of prescribed aim, within the scope of this
sub-component, it was decided to conduct 2nd phase of student assessment of 4th grades in pilot districts in
October 2009. However, within the scope of capacity building support for creation of the National Testing
Center (NTC), the student assessment has been included to the given process and Student Assessment
Department was transferred to NTC.

18.     To expand activities and investments under this component, and to support development of an
assessment system in Tajikistan, the World Bank approved allocation of Additional Financing (AF) in April
2010. On June 25, 2010, IDA agreement was signed (Grant H569-TJ). In general, AF finances (i)
construction of new building of NTC and (ii) purchase of equipment and furniture for NTC. These activities
go hand in hand with the financing of the Russian Education Aid for Development program (READ), which
is focused on capacity building, technical assistance, and knowledge assessment. Construction of the NTC
building was carried out from August 2012 to July 2013 (11.5 months), and the cost was US$1,359,626.52.

19.      For the sub-component Teacher Training, according to official data, at the beginning of the Project
the number of teachers with secondary education (untrained teachers) in primary grades was 638 in pilot
districts. The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan created favorable conditions for the work of teachers
in the schools, which led to partial inflow of professional teachers and new specialists into, and outflow of
untrained teachers from the schools. In pilot districts, the current trend was a decrease in the number of
teachers with secondary education almost to half (46.1%) compared to the base year. The aim of the current
sub-component is fully completed taking into account real number of untrained teachers in pilot districts. In
total, 191 elementary teachers with secondary education were trained and received state diplomas on special
technical education.

20.      The sub-component Improving Financing and Management required input from multiple groups
including the World Bank and other donors. The Government of Republic of Tajikistan had decided to switch
the budget system to program budgeting for the social sphere. Within the scope of the pilot, in 2004, the
MOE had been included to the pilot MTEF by the Governmental Decree (dated November 1, 2004 by the
#441). The pilot introduced a new method of financing education (per capita financing), and management in
all of the schools of Kulyab, Khorugh, Vahdat, Khujand and Yovon. Within the framework of the EMP, the
PMU had supported initial implementation in Vahdat city. Moreover, the PMU had extensive support of the
MOE, MOF, and other departments. Additionally, the PMU had the support of local representatives of the
state authority of Vahdat city regarding technical assistance (international and local consultants), and
equipment procurement. Lastly, field and study trips to countries that were successfully implementing, or had
implemented per capita financing pilot, had been organized.

21.     The sub-component Project monitoring & evaluation: during the MTR it was decided to strengthen
the capacity of the PMU and MOE staff by changing the existing input-based M&E structure of the PMU to
an outcome-based system. An international consultant, Thomas Welsh had been hired; the system had
successfully changed; and was being used by the PMU staff.

22.     Additionally, the PMU had hired local NGO, Fidokor, to conduct an independent beneficiary
evaluation of the EMP implementation. The NGO developed a methodology of evaluation on the basis of
existing indicators of Component 1, and Sub-component 2.4. In general, work conducted within the limits of
the given components and results of EMP impact, within the scope of the indicators, have been evaluated as
highly satisfactory.

23.      The sub-component School Designs: the project firms were hired, and prepared design-budget
documentation for 33 schools that had been rehabilitated using grants allocated for schools requiring major
rehabilitation, and for construction of four new schools.

24.      The PMU had conducted a competition for the design of two new schools in urban (for 640 students)
and rural (for 330 students) locations due to the concepts prepared. Evaluation of competition projects was
undertaken by a commission appointed by the Ministry of Education. The winning project firm submitted
initial designs, but due to the high cost of constructing their submission, the prepared design was rejected by
the World Bank. However, one of the aforementioned project designs (urban school for 660 students), by the
request of Dushanbe Mayor office, was transferred to them for use to build a new school in the Shohmansur
district of the capital).The winning project firm, within the framework of the existing contract, modified the
design and prepared documentation for urban (330 students) and rural (175 students) schools with an aim of
doing sites more efficiently and for further replication of school designs.

25.     For the sub-component Management strengthening, key specialists of the MOE and PMU had
passed directed trainings, and attended regional and international seminars, and conferences with an aim to
experience exchange and capacity-strengthening.

Component 3: Strengthening Service Delivery

26.     The sub-component Physical Infrastructure: School Buildings: As a result of rehabilitation and
construction works, 610 educational classes have been rehabilitated and 38 new classes have been
constructed for more than 35,000 students. With the aim of proper use of rehabilitated and constructed
buildings, the PMU had prepared and distributed a specific guide to all of the schools. Within the framework
of implementation of the current sub-component, physical conditions had been improved for 34,469 students
and 67,381 square meters of roofing had been renovated.

27.     The sub-component Equipment for Renovated Schools: Within the scope of the component, the
intention was the supply of school furniture for the rehabilitated schools. Accounting for the procurement of
equipment out of saved funds, school equipment for 31,500 students (14.7 percent of total students) and for
3,680 teachers and school principals (37.4 percent of total teachers and school principals) had been procured
and fully distributed. The equipment is being used by the intended beneficiaries.

28.     The sub-component Textbook provision: After approval of the MOE Collegium, manuscripts had
been proposed to the PMU and 52 titles of textbooks, and 4,333,500 copies of these textbooks were printed
and distributed in Tajik, Uzbek, and Russian language. Moreover, for the schools with Kyrgyz language
education 18 titles of textbooks had been procured, and 23,600 copies were distributed to schools.

29.     Moreover, based on revised curricula, eight titles of textbooks were published in the Tajik language
and Mathematics for primary grades 1-4. Additionally, eight titles of methodical guides to the subject
textbooks were published for teachers.


                                                      40
Component 4: Support for Project Implementation

30.    Project management had been fulfilled within the procedures of the WB and legislation of the
Republic of Tajikistan. EMP had satisfactorily passed all of the audits.

IV. Costs and Financing

31.     For Project implementation, US$22.31 million had been spent. This total comprised an IDA Credit
US$14.43 million and an IDA Grant US$7.88 million as of October 31, 2012. The Government’s
contribution to the Project was timely. As a result of favorable conversion rate between XDR and the USD,
savings had been acquired that led to exceeding the targets of some indicators despite the increase in prices,
in connection to the global crisis.

V. Institutional Development Impact

32.     The fiduciary capacity of the MOE had been strengthened through work with communities, new
methods of financing (e.g. PCF), monitoring and evaluation, procurement and financial management. More
specifically, capacity of the pilot schools and DEOs on elaboration and realization of the projects,
implementation of per capita financing, work with community and fundraising, M&E and maintenance of
new equipment, and rehabilitated and constructed schools were not just strengthened, but expanded in some
cases, when the original goal was achieved. However, capacity on procurement and financial management
had been partially strengthened.

VI. Sustainability

33.      For EMP sustainability and continuing effect of the attained aims, all of the activities had been
organized with full involvement of multiple stakeholders. These stakeholders included staff at the managerial
level, specialists of the MOE, heads and representatives of local executive bodies of the state authority of the
pilot districts, including DEOs and other representatives of the government, and international organizations
that were involved to EMP implementation. Additionally, unanimous understanding and support of the
Project results had been attained, as well as cooperation with schools for the preservation of the Project’s
impact.

34.      Thematic grant projects had tremendous effect in influencing parents’ involvement in their
children’s, and gave opportunities to the poor and vulnerable student population to continue their education.
In many cases, most of the PTAs included girls in the vulnerable children group, as a group deprived of
education. One example of thematic grant projects contributing to sustainability is the creation of handcrafts
classes for girls which has led to an increase in the level of girls' attendance.

35.      Rehabilitation and construction works and school equipment supply had a significant effect on
enrolment and student attendance through improved conditions in the schools. Moreover, the results of
rehabilitation and construction works had the effect of improving teacher attitudes by creating better training
conditions and support to improve their teaching level and techniques.

36.     The Project’s community involvement efforts through PTAs had a positive effect and stimulated the
schools’ work. Parents and other community members activated their activities on strengthening relations
with the schools of wide access to the qualitative and accessible education the children. Other international
organizations and local communities in non-pilot districts had applied to the PMU for aid in organization and
training of PTA. Also, the PTA creation method has been approved by the Ministry of Education, and
recommended to schools for use. Establishment of PTAs us stipulated by the new Law of the Republic of
Tajikistan “On Parents Responsibility for Education and Upbringing of Children,” ensuring sustainability of
PTAs.

37.      Lastly, based on the success of per capita financing in five districts, PCF was implemented in all 68
districts. The experience has helped to reveal local characteristics and to introduce the modified approach for
expansion nationwide.

               Unofficial translation of Government’s comments to the draft ICR (Summary only)

1.      Firstly, we would like to highlight some incorrect translation and inconsistencies in the text of the
Report:

2.      Page iii, Table (а) PDO (Project Development Objective) indicators:
Indicator 5: “Increase in community contribution of resources as well as community participation in the
decision making process at the school and district level.”

3.       Section F: “Results Framework Analysis” (Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),
Page iv) – here we have no comment to this indicator. Para 56 of ICR (Page 16) mentions there were no data
to identify the parameters for this target. However, the Project Appraisal Document specifies in
Subcomponent 1.1 (School Grants to Improve Quality, Enrollment and Infrastructure) that under the
rehabilitation grant scheme, communities will be asked to contribute 7% of the cost of the grant project in
civil works. The communities are allowed to contribute not only in cash but in the form of labor or goods.
According to the Borrower’s Project Completion Report (Section 2.3 Achievement of Results by
component) the community contribution to the implementation of community grants for rehabilitation works
was 7.1% (over US$ 261,000). In addition, the communities have also contributed to the implementation of
the thematic grants in 8.3% (in the amount US$ 122,000; however the Project Appraisal Document does not
anticipate the community contribution to the thematic grants).

4.       In our opinion, these figures could be considered as basic data for this objective (7% of grants for
rehabilitation) and achievements (7.1% of grants for rehabilitation and 8.3% for thematic grants) for
community contribution.

5.      As for the community participation, Para 57 of ICR (Page 16) mentions an increase in community
participation in the decision making process. As a result, we can claim that in general the targets for this
indicator were exceeded.

6.         Taking the below mentioned factors into account,
- for all 8 PDO indicators the targets were achieved, and for two indicators the targets were exceeded;
- for all 14 intermediate indicators the targets were achieved, and for 8 indicators the targets were
     exceeded;
-    in all 22 Implementation Status Reports (prepared by the Bank) starting from 2003, the Project
     performance was basically rated as satisfactory;
-    some omissions and shortcomings related to the monitoring and evaluation indicators which can be
     attributed to technical errors cannot dramatically affect the overall ratings in the achievement of project
     objectives;

7.      We believe that the overall project performance and impact should be rated as “satisfactory”
rather than "moderately satisfactory".

8.      Page 12, Para 43: It is mentioned here that the National Training Council was integrated with the
Academy of Education. In fact, the National Training Council is a separate entity of the Ministry of
Education and Science and is a member of the Academy of Education. The Chairperson of the National
Training Council is the Minister of Education and Science.

9.         Secondly, we note our comments regarding the contents of the Report:

                                                        42
10.    Page iii Table (а) PDO (Project Development Objective) indicators: Outcome/Impact Indicator 2:
“Teacher turnover in project schools is lower than average for the country and the schools attract qualified
new teachers”.

11.      It is noted here that the actual achievement of this indicator is rated as 7.5%, which is 3.2% below
the baseline (10.7%). Also, paragraphs 51, 52 and 53 (pages 14-15) of this Report mention about
achievements of the Project with respect to reduce the turnover rate of teachers and attract new qualified
teachers. It should be noted that originally the targets were identified incorrectly since the growth of
indicators in these affected project districts is much higher than in other parts of the country. If you look at
the dynamics in improvement of growth with this indicator according for these districts, it is better than
across the country. Therefore, having no baseline indicators in place, and given the conditions in these
project areas in the post-conflict situation and real contribution of the project in these areas we can claim
that, in general, the project reached its targets for this indicator.

12.   Page iii Table (а) PDO (Project Development Objective) indicators: Outcome/Impact Indicator 3:
“Completion rate - no of children completing grade 5 over baseline data from year one of project”.

13.     In Tajikistan the primary level of education is completed in grade 4 and not in grade 5, as it’s
mentioned in the Bank’s documents (the Progress Report for the Education Modernization Project mentioned
about that in 2006). Therefore, in consultation with the Bank the completion rate for grade 4 and promotion
to grade 5 were monitored. According to the Progress Report for the Education Modernization Project
(EMP) in 2008 (prepared by the Project Management Unit (PMU) and submitted to the World Bank), the
percentage of children completed grade 4 and promoted to grade 5 class in the project schools was 99.3%.
According to the Progress Report for the EMP in 2010 the percentage of children completed grade 4 and
promoted to 5 in the project schools was 99.8 percent. That is, according to the PMU M&E estimates this
figure has increased by 0.5 percent for two years.

14.      It should also be noted that due to the efforts of the Bank and the Borrower including the PMU, the
Project has made a great contribution to the creation of conditions for development of school education in
project areas and across country. This includes in particular:

- creation and development of parent-teacher associations (this experience was broadly replicated in other
    schools across the country;
-   implementation of per-capita financing at schools (based on lessons learned and tools developed by the
    project, the Government approved the transition of all schools to per-capita financing nationwide);
-   creating conditions for the formation of a national student assessment (for the first time national
    knowledge quality assessment tools for students were created which are used by international
    organizations as regional instruments for the CIS countries; the studies of grade 4 students knowledge
    were conducted);
-   creation of National Curriculum Center (which now operates successfully);
-   development of new textbooks;
-   development of new-type building design for schools (which is currently used across the country) is an
    important achievement under the Project in terms of access to quality education and to support reforms.
    This project is sustainable contribution to the development of education. The Project experience is widely
    used by donors, international organizations and government agencies.

15.    Based on the above-mentioned information, as well as actual contents of this Report, the overall
performance of the Bank and the Borrower should also be rated as “satisfactory”.




                                                       43
VII. Lessons Learned

38.    Grants to schools. Thematic or small grants led to an increase of community members’ interest and
involvement in the education process and directly influence involvement of vulnerable children.

39.      Organization and partnerships. Implementation of the projects in collaboration with national
institutions increases the effect and positively affects the sustainability of the Project in the targeted areas. It
is impossible to implement a project successfully without initial capacity building of involving parties.
Therefore, to increase the effectiveness of in-country education quality there is a need for investments for
improving managerial capacity on all levels of education.

40.     Cooperation of schools with local communities has positive effect in development and, improvement
in school infrastructure, improving education quality and level of students’ knowledge, students’ attendance,
and decrease of teachers’ outflow from the school and raising interest of the students.

41.    Per capita financing. Per capita financing will lead to more responsible, entrepreneurial, and
independent schools that will give new incentives for the improvement of education quality in the school.

VIII. Monitoring and Evaluation

42.      During implementation of the EMP, the Government had been conducting stable supervision for duly
realization and attainment of tasks and indicators. The GoT had been solving tasks, within the framework of
the Project, and through feedback of the Bank’s supervisory visits. MOE undertook supervision and provided
assistance and support in implementation of the Project at different stages.
