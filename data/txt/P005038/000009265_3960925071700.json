{"cdata!": "This is the Project Completion Report\n            (PCR) for the Greater Cairo Urban Development Project in the\n            Arab Republic of Egypt. The overall outcome of the project\n            is rated as marginally satisfactory, due to the completion\n            of a revised set of justified project components after its\n            restructuring; its institutional development impact is rated\n            as negligible, and its sustainability as uncertain. The\n            performance of the Bank and the borrower was rated as mixed.\n            The primary objectives of the project were to initiate a\n            revised approach to urban transport based on low cost\n            engineering and management measures, and to strengthen the\n            institutional ability of the governorates thereby enhancing\n            their capacity to undertake further urban development. The\n            secondary objectives were to improve the living conditions\n            of the urban poor in the Greater Cairo region through\n            upgrading selected low income areas, and to improve the\n            efficiency of the public bus company. Lessons learned are as\n            follows: In retrospect, it seems that the project was overly\n            complex, involving a large number of integrated components.\n            The reclassification of Egypt's borrowing status\n            (cessation of International Development Association (IDA)\n            lending to Egypt) created a difficult political environment\n            for the project culminating in a sharp drop in support for\n            the project, which proved to be costly because the project\n            never recovered its earlier momentum. Under the\n            circumstances, the Bank should have taken the initiative to\n            restructure the project, at an earlier stage, in line with\n            the changing priorities of the Government. The Bank should\n            allow for possible policy changes in Governments and should\n            simplify institutional objectives of projects to ensure\n            continuous support for them."}, "docdt": "1993-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
