{"cdata!": "The project aims at initiating a revised\n            approach to urban transport in Greater Cairo based on low\n            cost traffic engineering and management practices; at\n            improving the efficiency of its public transport system; and\n            at strengthening institutional capabilities for urban\n            planning, management and service delivery in the area. In\n            addition, it seeks to alleviate the living and environmental\n            conditions of some of Greater Cairo's urban poor and\n            increase their access to public transport. To accomplish\n            these objectives, the project includes: traffic engineering\n            and management measures along key routes and in Cairo's\n            Central Business District, road paving for new bus routes,\n            the enforcement of traffic regulations and parking controls,\n            improvements in the efficiency of the public bus service,\n            pilot street cleaning, solid waste management, road and\n            footpath paving in low income areas, requisite technical\n            assistance and training, and feasibility studies."}, "docdt": "1982-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
