1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Background and Context at Appraisal

1.      After nine years of preparing for accession to the European Union (EU), Bulgaria entered
the EU as one of the poorest countries on January 1, 2007. The Social Sectors Institutional
Reform Development Policy Loans (SIR DPL) were initiated as a series of three loans prepared
and implemented over three years from May 2006 until June 2009. In 2006, at the end of
Bulgaria`s EU accession, the first DPL was prepared and appraised, and became effective in June
2007.

2.      Macro-economic performance: Following a difficult transition which culminated in a
severe crisis in 1996-97, macroeconomic stability was reestablished and had been maintained by
prudent fiscal policies and strict discipline in incomes policy anchored in the Currency Board
Arrangement adopted in 1997. During the period of preparing for EU accession, Bulgaria
implemented a broad reform agenda and maintained macroeconomic stability with strong
economic growth, averaging above 6 percent between 2004 and 2008. Institutional reforms were
implemented in a number of sectors and improved the effectiveness of public institutions. Fiscal
consolidation reduced the overall fiscal deficit from 15.2 percent of GDP in 1996 to a balanced
budget in 2003 and increasing fiscal surpluses around 3 percent of GDP during the 2005-2008
period. By 2008 the Government had accumulated 13 percent of GDP in fiscal reserves. The total
public and publicly guaranteed debt was reduced substantially from over 100 percent of GDP in
1997 to 16.1 for 2008. Inflation declined to single digits, except in 2008, from hyperinflation
levels of 600 percent in the mid-90ties. Investor confidence improved, both domestically and
externally, and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows increased over time. Amid the global crisis
the economy started to slow sharply. The economy entered into recession in 2009. Exports and
domestic demand both dropped. As a result, GDP contracted by 5 percent in 2009--the first
decline since the crisis of 1996/97.

3.      Income and social inclusion: Bulgaria has a population of about 7.6 million which is
aging. The gross national income per capita increased from US$ 3,510 in 2005 to US$ 5,490 in
2008 (GNI, Atlas method). Still, income levels in Bulgaria reflect only about 40 percent of the
EU-27 average, and social disparities still need to be addressed to sustain inclusive growth. The
poverty headcount declined from about 20 percent in 2003 to 10.2 percent in 2007, while extreme
poverty declined from 11 percent to 4.5 percent of the population. Poverty is concentrated among
the unemployed, the youngest and oldest age groups, Roma children, and individuals with less
than secondary education.

4.       A coalition government took office in August 2005 and remained in office until the
general election in June 2009. It prepared new comprehensive social sector strategies. The DPL
program was embedded in the National Reform Program covering 2006-2008 and 2008-2010
specifically (i) the Program for the Development of School and Pre-school Education 2006-2015
approved by Parliament in June 2006, (ii) the Government`s National Health Care Strategy 2008-
2013 approved by Parliament in December 2008 and (iii) the updated National Employment
Strategy 2008-2015 adopted by the Council of Ministers in April 2008. Additional top priorities
of the Government are the financial sustainability of social insurance funds including pension and
health insurance.

5.     Governance environment: Transparency International`s 2007 corruption perception`s
index listed Bulgaria as 64 out of 180 countries. Corruption became entrenched and


                                                1
institutionalized during the period of 2006-2009, which led the European Commission to suspend
pre-accession funds and freeze almost 500 million in farming and structural aid to Bulgaria in
2007 and 2008 1. The Global Corruption Barometer 2009 reports Bulgaria and Romania as the two
most corrupt countries in Europe 2. The State is still characterized by an absence of accountability,
transparency, effective financial management structures, a credible judiciary system and reliable
administrative capacity.

6.       Labor: The Government`s strategic objectives for the labor market include (i) economic
growth and job creation, (ii) integration of inactive individuals, (iii) labor market flexibility, and
(iv) a knowledge-based economy. In 2005, Bulgaria`s labor market was more rigid in particular in
terms of hiring workers, mainly on temporary and fix-term contracts. Compared to the Lisbon
Agenda 2010 Target (now called Europe 20:20 Strategy) of 70 percent, Bulgaria`s labor market
participation rate was relatively low with 58.6 percent of the population aged 15-64 being
economically active in 2006 3; however, until 2008 employment grew substantially, resulting in an
employment rate of 63 percent in mid-2009, which was close to the EU-27 average of almost 65
percent. Accelerated growth and net employment generation in the private sector caused
unemployment to decline from 13.7 percent in 2003 to 9 percent in the mid-2006 and 6.4 percent
in mid-2009. Youth unemployment has remained persistently high at 14.6 percent in mid-2009. In
addition to promoting employment, Bulgaria needs to raise labor productivity growth to 5 percent
per year to accelerate convergence to EU income levels. Higher labor productivity requires
reforming social sectors and investing in the level and quality of human and physical capital stock,
in the functioning of products and factor markets, and in the quality of the policy and institutional
frameworks.

7.       Social protection: In January 2006, Bulgaria decreased the pension insurance
contribution rate from 29 to 23 percent. In 2007, overall social protection spending amo unted to
35.3 percent of total public spending4. While lower social security contribution rates could help
reduce the cost of labor and support competitiveness, it could also further widen the financing gap
of the social security system and require larger government transfers. This would put at risk the
government`s medium-term balanced budget targets and the sustainability of the pension system.
To stabilize the pension system, the Government created a Silver Fund financed by revenues
from privatization, concessions, and from the fiscal surplus to address the negative effects from
population aging. In 2006, mainly low-qualified individuals were reliant on social benefits under
the Guaranteed Minimum Income Program (GMI) for over ten years without being accountable
for job search and improving skills and qualifications. The Government reform agenda included
measures to limit the GMI benefits to 18 months, and promote individuals` re-entry into the
work-force inter alia through the Active Labor Market Program (ALMP), which led to a
substantial reduction of 70% in the number of recipients of social benefits from 2005 until 2009.

8.      Health: The Government`s National Health Care Strategy 2008-2013 was approved in
December 2008, during the preparation of DPL3, and focuses on (i) improving quality of care, (ii)
reforming delivery and financing of outpatient care, (iii) hospital restructuring, (iv)
pharmaceutical sector reforms, and (v) financial sustainability through more efficient service
delivery and provider payment reforms. Bulgaria reports the highest death rate in Europe for
diseases of the circulatory system 5. Total health financing (7.7 percent of GDP in 2007) was in
line with comparable European countries. However, Bulgaria`s households finance a rather high
share of 40 percent of total health spending in form of co-payments. The remaining 60 percent are
paid by health insurance and the Government budget. More than half of health spending occurs in
the oversized hospital sector. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pools funding from
general government revenues and payroll taxes. The very low payroll tax rate for health insurance
increased from 6 to 8 percent in 2009.

9.       Education: The Government National Program for the Development of School
Education (2006-2015) approved in June 2006, identifies among the main education challenges
a decline in the quality and relevance of skills taught; lower school participation rates,
particularly in upper secondary education; and an ineffective use of existing resources.
Accordingly, education reforms include decentralization and optimization of the school network
via a capitation funding reform to municipalities; decentralization of school management
including human resources and budgets to school principals; and mitigating measures to prevent
an increase in drop-outs during the reform transition.

10.      Rationale for Bank involvement. The SIR DPL series was developed to respond to the
Government request to support Bulgaria's priorities as a new EU member state with a focu s on
social inclusion, access to social services, fiscal sustainability, transparency of public spending
and reduced corruption. The social sector reforms do not form part of the EU Acquis
Communautaire, and therefore received less policy reform attention during the preparation for EU
accession. Given the medium-term horizon of the Government`s social sector strategy to improve
the efficiency in social sectors, a series of single loans was determined to be the best option to
support reforms. The DPL series aimed to sustain two of three priority areas in the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2006­2009: (i) raising productivity and employment in private sector-
led growth along the lines of the EU`s Lisbon Agenda; and (ii) fiscal sustainability and improved
capacity for absorption of EU funds. The series was consistent with the third CPS priority area of
poverty reduction and social inclusion.

11.       The SIR DPL series built on the previous Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL)
(2003 ­ 2005) which supported structural reforms ­ especially in the enterprise, financial and
utility sectors ­ and established a more market-friendly business climate, including a stable legal
and regulatory environment and first steps toward judiciary reform. Key-lessons from the PAL
were a need for a more streamlined lending approach that focuses on fewer actions, maintaining a
flexible approach to a changing policy environment, and supporting the implementation of
reforms with technical assistance.

12.     The SIR DPL Program concentrated on four main policy reform areas that are
consistent with the Government`s National Reform Programs (2006­2008) and (2008­2010): (i)
Promotion of productive employment; (ii) Enhancement of the institutional capacity for education

quality assessments; (iii) Promotion of financial sustainability of the national health insurance;
and (iv) Strengthening of incentives to focus on quality and efficiency of spending:

   i.   DPL1 (May 2006­June 2007) focused on social protection to create additional
        incentives for employment generation, a new funding mechanism for schools, mitigate
        the impact of the changes in education financing on access, measures to stabilize public
        spending on health, and improving the institutional capacity in the education and health
        sectors.
  ii.   DPL2 (September 2007­March 2009) supported full implementation of the new
        education financing formula, introduction of governance changes in the sector,
        implementation of selected actions included in the medium term vision for social
        protection, and additional actions to maintain financial balance in the health sector.
        DPL2 was originally developed as a deferred drawdown option (DDO) allowing the
        Government to withdraw funds within three years the loan was signed.
 iii.   DPL3 (January 2009­June 2009) helped to sustain reforms and prepare for the expected
        economic slowdown by supporting (i) measures to address the potential adverse
        employment effect from the economic downturn, (ii) the efficiency of resource use in
        health and education, and (iii) structural reforms to improve employment activation
        policies, raise quality of primary and secondary education and to reduce the regulatory
        burden for the enterprise sector.

13.      The design of DPL3 was kept flexible and was consistent with the European Economic
Recovery Plan adopted in December 2008 by the EU Council to drive a coordinated EU response
to the economic downturn. One pillar of this plan highlights the need for short-term actions to (i)
reduce the human cost of the economic downturn and its effect on the most vulnerable by
stemming job losses and help people return quickly to the labor market and (ii) raise Europe`s
competitiveness in the long-term by investing in skills, facilitating labor market transitions and
reducing the regulatory and administrative burdens on enterprises ­ in line with the Lisbon Jobs
and Growth Strategy.


1.2 Original Program Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)

14.      The SIR DPL program development objective (PDO) was to support the adoption and
implementation of policies to (i) increase employment and lay the foundations for long-term
productivity growth by providing incentives for job creation and labor force participation as well
as by improving quality of education; and (ii) promote fiscal sustainability through efficiency
gains in the social sectors.

15.     Progress under the three operations was assessed by the following key indicators
presented in Table 1:

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

20.      The SIR DPL Program was a series of three one-tranche operations with the first Program
Document describing the entire program with policy actions for all three operations, leaving
flexibility for adjustments in DPL2 and DPL3. DPL2 was prepared as a Deferred Drawdown
Option (DDO), though was drawn immediately after effectiveness. Prior actions had to be met
prior to negotiations for each DPL to be released (Table 3). The FY08-09 Bank average time for
preparing a DPL from Concept Note Review to Board Approval was 6.2 months, which is
considerably shorter than the time used by DPL1 and DPL2 (Table 2).

                          Table 2: DPL Release Dates and Amounts

     Total          $499.2        355.1
Note: the loan amounts were disbursed in Euros.

21.     Each DPL contained ten prior actions which were all met before release (Table 3).

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

22.     Several factors had a positive impact on the implementation of the DPL series:

        Ownership for Reforms in Coalition Government

23.     The same Coalition Government remained in power over the entire DPL Program with
the exception of the Minister of Health who changed mid-way through the Program. There was


                                                8
strong government ownership for the prior actions supported under the DPL Program, as these
were part of the Government National Reform Program. However, buy-in for reforms varied
across Ministries in the Coalition Government, which required additional time and investment for
communication with different stakeholders and consensus building, in particular in the health
sector. The Ministry of Health did not appear to support any reforms that endangered particular
interests (e.g. closing hospitals). In contrast, health reforms were very supported by the NHIF and
the MOF. While the Ministry of Education and Science (MES) hesitantly participated in the
reform debate for a brief instant at the beginning, this changed quickly to strong ownership once
the MES saw its reform agenda reflected in the DPL program.

        EU membership and Lisbon Agenda

24.     EU accession and membership since 2007 created a reform momentum and Government
ownership for improving the performance and competitiveness of Bulgaria in Europe. This
momentum had a positive impact on moving forward education and labor market reforms
supported under the DPL, to the extent that Bulgaria introduced reforms that had not been
implemented yet in other EU states, such as decentralized school management.

25.     Structural reforms undertaken in the context of the EU Lisbon Jobs and Growth Strategy
had positive effects on the DPL Program. The Government updated the National Reform Program
in 2008 to address the following aspects:

        Improving the administrative capacity, particularly in key areas of government in relation
        to implementing policies in the field of the labor market, program budgeting, market
        regulation, and the EU Structural Fund absorption;
        Implementing measures in fiscal policy, market and competition functioning, consumer
        protection and income policy;
        Further improving the business environment and applying the principles of better
        regulation through implementing the measures of the Better Regulation Program and
        increasing the share of the electronic registrations in the Trade Register;
        Increasing labor supply, improving the quality of the workforce and raising the
        employment level;
        Ensuring the long-term sustainability of public finances in particular in relation to the
        potential risks related to the adequacy and sustainability of pension expenditures;
        Developing an integrated policy approach of the public sector in the field of research and
        development (R&D) and innovation with the aim to reform the public R&D system, and
        transition from publicly financed R&D to more competitive financing focused on key
        priorities;
        Taking measures against hidden employment by strengthening the institutional capacity
        for conducting inspections and ensuring law enforcement; and
        Encouraging lifelong learning.

    Synergies with Health Sector Reform Project (2000­2008)

26.      The DPL program (2006-2009) overlapped with the Health Sector Reform Project
(HSRP), resulting in strong synergies with the health part of the DPL. The health project
supported fundamental health sector reforms, designed to improve access to quality health
services and ensure financial and operational sustainability. The project contributed technical
assistance to refine hospital payment reforms and to the hospital Masterplan, and procured an
integrated IT system in hospitals and the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). The Project



                                                9
was supportive to the actions identified in the DPL policy matrix including strengthening
performance and the financial situation at the NHIF, introducing pharmaceutical reforms, and
hospital restructuring based on the Masterplan. Implementing the IT system at the NHIF became
a prior action in DPL3.

      Synergies with Social Inclusion Project (2008­ongoing)

27.      DPL2 and 3 overlapped with a new Social Inclusion Project which became effective in
2009. It aims to promote social inclusion by increasing the school readiness of children below the
age of 7 targeting low-income and marginalized families (including children with disability and
other special needs). The Project also supports the Government in absorbing European Social
Fund financing for social inclusion purpose.

      Continuous Policy Dialogue and Technical Assistance

28.      The DPL followed the PAL. Under both, the PAL and the DPL series, the Bank fostered
a continuous policy dialogue with the Government and the EU, through strong management
support and participation, and an increased preparation budget to finance policy notes. Bank
management (including HD Sector Director and Managers) actively participated in the
preparation of the DPL. Two sector staff (Education and Social Protection) went on extended
missions to Bulgaria, with the SP staff eventually moving to Sofia, to maintain a continuous
policy dialogue. The DPL 2 and 3 benefited from a PHRD grant that produced analytical work to
inform reforms. The increased DPL Bank budget financed technical notes on hospital
restructuring, the pharmaceutical sector, education financing, assessment of quality of education,
labor market and unemployment, disability cost containment, social assistance and social services
delivery; as well as reports on the National Framework Contract in health and on the Clinical
Care Pathways mechanism to set prices of hospital services. A policy note on skills shortages in
the labor market was produced at the joint request of the Minister of Labor and Social Policy and
the Confederation of Bulgarian Employers and Industrialists. This broad Bank involvement by
staff and management over time facilitated the implementation of reforms by the Government and
supported under the DPL Program.

      Global economic downturn 2008/2009 and Parliament Closure May 2009

29.      The anticipated impact of the global economic crisis in 2008 as well as the planned
closing of Parliament in May 2009 before elections accelerated the ratification of DPL2 by the
Government and the processing of DPL3. DPL3 was prepared to mitigate the impact of the global
financial crisis. After several years of strong economic growth and fiscal stance, the Bulgarian
economy was expected to shrink by around 3½ percent in 2009 which was feared to offset efforts
made in reducing poverty 6 . Bulgaria was relatively well positioned to face the economic
downturn with buffers accumulated during good times, including a sizeable fiscal reserve account,
low public debt, and buffers in the banking system. In 2009 Bulgaria posted an estimated general
budget deficit of 0.9% of GDP on a cash basis, which was the smallest deficit among EU
countries. However, the low cash deficit was in part the result of the build-up of payables and
arrears. On an accrual, ESA-95 basis, the deficit increased to 3.9 percent of GDP. The actual
contraction of GDP was 5.0 percent in 2009.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E Design

30.      The M&E design became stronger over time. During DPL1 policy notes were prepared
on health, education, and social protection and the team identified a number of key outcome
indicators and milestones for the program to be monitored over time. However, DPL1 did not
clearly identify the results framework including the methodology, indicators, baseline values and
approach to measure the DPL effect. DPL2 and 3 included an M&E framework with strong
analytical work that was partially developed with the support of the PHRD grant. The policy
matrix in DPL3 tracked indicators based on administrative data, which were used in the policy
dialogue jointly by the Government and the Bank, to identify progress made in reforms. The
indicators chosen were a suitable mix of indicators that the Government used for internal and EU
reporting purposes, reform-specific output indicators, and process indicators. Below is a summary
of reports developed with the support of the PHRD grant.

List of background reports prepared during the preparation of the DPL series

    a. Implementation of unified standard per capita finance formula in basic education
    b. VET in Bulgaria and best practice in Europe
    c. Assessment of proposal for differentiating payment for teachers
    d. Assessing Bulgaria`s performance in 2006`s PISA and PIRLS
    e. Bulgaria Living Conditions Assessment Report
    f. Assessment of administrative costs of social assistance programs in Bulgaria
    g. Revision of the National Framework Contract for publicly financed health services
    h. Resource Allocation for Hospitals: Assessment and Recommendations
    i. Competitive Social Health Insurance in Bulgaria: Assessment of a Proposed Model
    j. Options for Improving GP Referral and Hospital Admissions Practices
    k. Evaluation of National Programs on ICT in the Education Sector
    l. Policy Framework for Teacher Qualification and Career Development
    m. Using of National Assessment Data for Quality Improvement at the School and
       Classroom Level
    n. Student Loan Scheme in Bulgaria
    o. Survey of the profile of social assistance (GMI) beneficiaries affected by limiting the
       maximum duration of GMI eligibility

31.    There are moderate shortcomings in the M&E design. First, mainly process indicators7
and few output or outcome indicators were used. Second, some indicators included in the results
framework measured results that were not directly linked to the DPL program. For example, the
labor market measures could not necessarily have a substantive impact on the employment rate;
and an efficiency increase in hospital care would be better expressed by a set of indicators


7
 See for example, Mission Aide Memoire Policy Matrix September 2007. Indicators included: Hire
consultants under the PHRD-supported assignment to analyze the impact of the changes to the social
assistance system. Draft legislation on delegated budgets developed and shared with the Bank for
comments.

including inpatient admission rate, bed occupancy rate and patient turn-over per staff, instead of
just measuring the average length of hospital stay (ALOS). Inequality indicators were missing
although one of the key-outcomes was improving access for underserved groups. Third,
indicators should have been added to measure externalities. For example, the financial
sustainability goal in the NHIF leads to zero-deficit spending and creates financial pressure in
hospitals if hospital overcapacities are not reduced simultaneously. As hospitals also had to
reduce arrears, this may set an incentive to look for other revenue sources by increasing
copayment levels paid by patients, which could have a negative impact on access to care. Thus,
indicators on out-of-pocket spending etc could have been added to assess potential negative
externalities of DPL-supported measures. The ISR in DPL1 did not track any indicators, but rated
progress towards reaching the PDOs as satisfactory. The DPL2 ISR included two indicators on
employment growth and the student/teacher ratio; the final DPL3 ISR reports all 15 indicators 8.

M&E Implementation

32.      The responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the DPL program was with the
Council for Economic Policy (CEP) under the Council of Ministers, with representation of all the
Ministries involved in the reform (Health, Education, and Labor and Social Policy). The Program
was coordinated and managed by the Directorate for European Integration and Relations with the
International Financial Institutions.

33.     In a development which span off the DPL policy dialogue, the Government requested
Bank technical assistance on impact evaluation. The Bank provided several training activities and
a programmatic Technical Assistance program. Consequently, the Government instituted the
Impact Evaluation Task Force under the auspices of the Council of Ministers in September 2008
(overlapping with DPL2 and DPL3). Under the TA program, the Bank provided capacity building
workshops for the Task Force, at the end of DPL2: (i) on methods in October 2008, (ii) on the
evaluation design for interventions under the Social Inclusion Project in November 2008 and (iii)
on the impact of school closures on student drop-out in May 2009. This M&E implementation
and take up by the Government is rated as highly satisfactory.

M&E Utilization

34.      The education part of the DPL invested substantially in the successful institutionalization
of M&E at the Government including compiling a school level expenditure and performance data
base under DPL1. This database served as the basis for developing the system of per-capita
financing in schools. DPL3 built capacity in monitoring of student achievements and evaluating
the impact of education reforms on the quality of education. The DPL program supported social
benefits evaluation through new data collection with a targeted survey of beneficiaries of the GMI
Program. The DPL1 jointly with the OSI supported the multi-topic household survey (MTHS) in
2007. The health part in DPL3 included a revised prior action 7, stating the NHIF had
implemented the IT system financed under the HSRP, to collect, monitor and evaluate claims data
from contracted providers and detect inefficient practices such as over-referral from primary care
to hospitals, excessive cross-regional referrals, over-prescribing of medicines, or inappropriate re-
hospitalization.

35.      Over time the DPL pursued a deliberate agenda of strengthening the evidence base on
policy in education, social assistance and health where there was little information before. This
came both through contributing to data and information generation but also through strategic use
of existing data. As a result, any new program would now be able to support government policy
reforms which stand on a firmer results base.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

36.      After the elections, a new administration took office in July 2009. In their first 100 days
in office, the new Government implemented measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the crisis
and moving the economy towards a sustainable convergence path. The Bank continues to support
reforms with several ongoing and planned follow-up operations. At the request of the
Government, the World Bank is engaging in some immediate key activities, including:

    HD policy notes have been written with recommendations for continued reforms following
    the SIR DPL program.
    Bulgaria Policy Notes, presented to the new Government soon after it took office, provide a
    summary of economic challenges and options for reform in a selected number of areas
    including public finance policy, social safety net, health, and pensions.
    Technical Assistance on pension modeling, including reform scenarios to improve fiscal
    sustainability. Continued dialogue in Social Assistance, and support the design of the impact
    evaluation of the voucher-based employment activation program.
    In the health sector, a TA program is under discussion with the Government to provide
    guidance on the insurance law, support the adoption of the Master Plan and continue to help
    the Government identify other areas where there may be scope for efficiency gains in ways
    that do not damage service delivery.
    In Education, through Bank`s School Autonomy Report (P118162), provide analytical
    support to evaluate reform, its impact, and areas for improvement. An education SIL
    (P120305) is being prepared to continue reforms started under the DPL.
    Monitoring and evaluating the impact of the economic crisis through the Programmatic Crisis
    Monitoring and Social Policy Technical Assistance (P118274).

37.     In addition to Bank support, Bulgaria as a new EU Member State continues to benefit
from EU support through Social, Structural and Regional Funds and participates in the
development and implementation of the EU 2020 Strategy, the successor to the Lisbon Agenda.
Also, in 2009 Switzerland approved EU enlargement contributions to Bulgaria in the amount of
$76 million to be implemented over five years, including for social sectors.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

38.     Relevance of Objective: The strategy of the SIR DPL program was to have a critical set
of social sector reforms that could strengthen long-term productivity and fiscal sustainability, and
contribute to convergence with EU policies and standards and enhanced competitiveness. Fiscal
sustainability of social sector spending remains a key priority, as the social sectors account for
almost half of Government spending. Productivity growth is a top priority for income
convergence with EU standards. These objectives were, and still are, highly relevant to Bulgaria`s
National Reform Program. The PDOs remain relevant to the continued dialogue between the



                                                13
Bank and Government, including in the Country Partnership Strategy (2006-09). EU membership
entails certain responsibilities for Bulgaria with regard to labor productivity, while the fiscal
criteria for joining the Euro will have implications for social sector spending efficiency.

39.      Formulation of Objective: The DPL objectives mirrored the CPS objectives and were
included in the DPL following the advice by the peer-reviewers and regional management. Each
row in the DPL matrix describes expected outcomes. While the continued relevance of
productivity growth and fiscal sustainability is important for Bulgaria, these overarching DPL
objectives may not be specific enough to identify the clear link with activities included under a
social sector DPL, in particular since productivity growth was driven by private sector investment
and Bulgaria already reported strong fiscal stance for several years.

40.      Design: The structural design of a DPL program with a limited number of sectors
included provided a much stronger tool for the Bank and counterparts to have a comprehensive
and cohesive approach in the reform dialogue, as opposed to the general DPL design with many
sectors involved. This limited sector DPL design allowed intensifying the quality of the reform
dialogue within a sector, as shown by the substantial Technical Assistance provided by the Bank
and the impressive results achieved, especially in education. The SIR DPL program spans over
three years and includes a series of three single loans. This serial approach with a strong
investment into analytical and policy work, management participation in the policy dialogue with
the Government and additional staffing in the Sofia Bank office, was most relevant for the DPL
series to partner with the Government with a longer-term vision. The DPL provided an
opportunity to the Government to restructure old debts and introduce social sector reforms
excluded from the EU Acquis Communautaire, during times of economic growth and fiscal
stance, which finally prepared the country to enter the economic crisis with stronger institutional
structures in particular in education, labor and social protection. A few prior actions in DPL1
were vaguely defined, such as starting the implementation of an action plan in action 6; or not
rigorous enough to have a satisfactory outcome as for example the Pharmaceutical policy in
action 8.

41.     Implementation: The reform measures implemented under the DPL`s individual
components in education, social protection, health and labor aligned well with the priority
problems of the social sectors. While the reform program under the health component would have
required more support and leadership from the MOH to implement than the Ministry actual had
available; in education and labor, reforms were fully implemented and are showing results.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

42.     The major expected outcomes are longer term and affected by various factors, especially
for outcomes such as productivity growth and fiscal sustainability. The objective of the DPL
series was to lay the foundations for productivity growth, mainly through investments in
education reform, which could take several years to lead to increased productivity. Therefore it is
not possible to fully assess these outcomes, given the short timeframe of the ICR and absence of
more rigorous evaluation data. Accordingly, many of the performance indicators in the policy
matrix were process-oriented, referring to completed actions or output indicators, and not true
outcome indicators. However, through the implementation of specific reforms, related output
indicators and continuation of the reform program by the Government, there can be some
reasonable assertions of outcome. This is strongest in the education sector. The DPL program was
based on the premise that social sector reforms would accelerate the convergence with EU
standards, enhance competitiveness through increased skills of the labor force and a better



                                                14
investment climate, and lead to more efficient health, education, and social assistance systems.
Access to and quality of social services was anticipated to improve as a result of the reforms
sponsored under the DPL program.

Macroeconomic and Fiscal Framework

43.      Table 4 shows a strong macro- and fiscal framework was maintained during the DPL
program until 2008. On the revenue-side fiscal sustainability was driven by continuous economic
growth and revenue increases caused by reforms in tax-administration. Inflation increased in
2008 due to surging global commodity prices and demand pressure; however prices decelerated
again as of mid-2008. The external debt increase was fuelled by FDI-related borrowing in the
private sector. Productivity growth has slowed down since 2005 (Table 4). The unemployment
rate dropped to 5.7 percent in 2008. Employment mainly grew in labor intense sectors such as
construction. In 2005-08, nominal wages grew at an average annual rate of 14 percent while
inflation was on average 8 percent per year during the same period.

44.     Growth was not sustained in 2009 when Bulgaria entered a recession as a result of the
global economic crisis. The new Government took remedial actions, adopted a public wage and
pension freeze, started rationalizing public administration, and implemented a 15 percent
expenditure cut in Q3 of 2009. This led to reduction in the fiscal deficit for 2009 to 0.8 percent of
GDP (compared to a projected 3.5 percent without corrective measures). Positive growth is
expected to resume in late 2010. The ongoing fiscal consolidation is expected to continue in the
medium-term with restructuring of public spending to reduce inefficient spending.

Summary of Achievement of Objectives

45.     The three DPL series sponsored a homogeneous program, which built up on each other
and aimed to achieve longer-term objectives. It is thus difficult to evaluate the achievement of
objectives under each DPL.

        Pillar 1: Increase Employment and Lay the Foundations for Long-Term
        Productivity Growth by Providing Incentives for Job Creation and Labor Force
        Participation as well as by Improving Quality of Education

46.     Labor: The reform of the labor framework and social protection system focused on
increasing employment by lowering payroll taxes, reducing social assistance dependency,
reforming disability benefits, and increasing formal employment through more flexible work
arrangements and better incentives to participate in the formal economy. The key-outcome


                                                    15
indicators assessed employment rates (Table 1). Employment increased driven by strong
economic growth in the past decade until the end of 2008. In the absence of any impact
evaluation, attributions and direct causalities of the DPL measures on objectives can be deduced
only. The employment rate of 63.3 percent achieved at the end of DPL3 is still below the Lisbon
target of 70 percent for 2010 9 but above the national target set at 60 percent (see Table 1) and
higher than in several other new EU member states. The respective rate has remained on a
relatively low level for young people (15-24) while it increased for people older than 55 years
(Table 5). Nevertheless, the structural reforms introduced in labor, social protection and in the
education sector (including programs for employment promotion, training for long-term
unemployed, access to vocational training for individuals with 4 th grade degree etc.) may have
helped Bulgaria to cushion the impact of the economic crisis in 2009 when employment started to
decline. The employment reforms contributed to creating a policy framework that is considered as
more conducive to employment creation and labor force participation than before. The
collaboration between the social assistance system and the ALMP for the reintegration of social
beneficiaries contributed to a 70% reduction in of social benefits dependency in 2005-2009.

47.     DPL1 (May 2006 ­ June 2007): During these 13 months the employment rate
increased while productivity growth slowed down since 2006 (Table 4). DPL1 aimed to
contribute to employment and productivity increase by supporting a more flexible labor market
through: (i) amendments to the Labor Code introducing part-time contracts and flexible working
hours; (ii) reduction of pension contribution rates to reduce labor costs; and (iii) a financial
incentive to unemployed social assistance recipients to find employment on their own initiative.

2003 to 71.1 percent by 2007 (MTHS data). The part-time employment rate has remained on a
similar low level, (Table 5) comparable to Hungary and Slovakia, but considerably lower than the
EU average of 18% in 2007. The government also implemented measures stipulated in the
Employment Promotion Act to encourage integration of people with disabilities into the active
workforce. From January 2007 until July 2009, the number of individuals receiving disability
benefits remained on a similar level. It can be assumed that some of the benefit recipients started
receiving remuneration against participation in Active Labor Market Programs for people with
disability as several special programs for people with disability were implemented 10.

48.      Pension contributions: Already in 2002, the Government initiated social insurance
reforms to reduce contribution rates, which continued over time. Reducing a relatively high tax
wedge level was expected to have a positive effect on labor demand in the formal sector 11. But
Bulgaria already reported a relatively low tax wedge of 36.3% in 2005, compared to the EU -15
median of 39.5% 12. While lowering the tax wedge might partly finance itself through higher
employment and output, there may be budget implications for the pension system in a country
with an aging population, which could likely lead to expenditure cuts. Although Bulgaria`s
pension spending (Table 5) is below the EU-27 average of 12% of GDP, ensuring the longer-term
financial sustainability in the Bulgarian pension system may require additional reform measures
(e.g. increasing the retirement age from currently 60/63 to 65 years; and reducing the number of
early retirees) 13. While DPL1 supported employment-enhancing measures through a 7 percent
reduction in labor costs (which was slightly affected in 2009 by a 2-percent increase in the health
insurance contribution rate), the following DPL2 and 3 then focused on reform measures to
improve labor market flexibility and skill building.

49.      DPL2 (September 2007 ­ March 2009) took substantially more time to prepare and
implement. It coincided with an increased employment rate, a similar level productivity
growth and a drop in the unemployment rate. DPL2 aimed to support an employment increase
through: (i) the transformation of seniority wage bonus into a professional experience bonus, the
impact of which is difficult to evaluate; and (ii) strengthening of professional training in line with
private sector needs. The restructured ALMP targeted the unemployed, inactive and discouraged
persons, and provided incentives to employers to employ ALMP beneficiaries. Reforms in ALMP
have contributed to an increase in the relative share of ALMP beneficiaries enrolled in
professional training programs (Table 5). The DPL did support the mitigation measures for those
who were subject to the ALMP policy including a strong focus on monitoring each case with
administrative data and the first phase of a tracking survey. Social welfare measures included an
employment activation plan for social assistance beneficiaries (including supporting job search
incentives for welfare beneficiaries, developing individual activation plans and design active
labor market programs for those who cannot find jobs on the primary labor market), which has
helped during times of economic growth to reduce the number of GMI recipients (Table 5) and

annual GMI program expenditures from BGL 65 million in 2007 to BGL 38 million in 2008. In
April 2008, the CoM adopted a Better Regulation Program 2008-2010 drafted by an inter-
ministerial group based on World Bank analytical work and advice. A Better Regulation Unit
(BRU) was established to manage, monitor and control the implementation of the program, in
particular related to measures to institutionalize Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs).

50.      DPL3 (January ­ June 2009) was under preparation when the Parliament ratified DPL2.
By the end of 2008, Bulgaria was hit by the global economic crisis. The employment rate
decreased including for young and older workers and the number of registered unemployed
increased (Table 5). DPL3 aimed to sustain labor reforms during the crisis through (i) the
approval of the National Employment Strategy; (ii) increased unemployment benefits
replacement rates and introduced labor market programs; and (iii) amendments to the vocational
education act. The Law on the Social Insurance Budget for 2009 raised the minimum and
maximum levels of unemployment benefit. The Government introduced a new model of results-
based active labor market programs through the Social Investment and Employment Promotion
Project in 2009, and transitioned for financing to the Human Resources Development Operational
Program (HRD OP) with EU funds. In January 2009, the Government expanded access to and the
generosity of its social assistance system, by increasing the eligibility threshold and the benefit
level for a number of social assistance programs, and the minimum level for certain social
insurance benefits. These measures have cushioned the impact of the crisis on the unemployed
and social assistance beneficiaries.

51.      Education reforms aimed to lay the foundations for employment and productivity
growth by strengthening the institutional capacity to monitor and improve quality and increase
accountability in education. The key-outcome indicators included an improved completion rate,
better quality education, and more efficient financing (Table 1). DPL1 contributed to these
outcomes by working with the Government in conducting a national assessment (sample-based)
of student performance in grade 7; and implementing information technologies in schools. The
resulting school database established in 2006 provided the Government with the necessary
baseline information on all school performance and a baseline to compare the impact of the
education reforms including data on students having completed the 7 th, 10th and the 12th grades.
The national Centre for Control and Assessment of the Quality of Education (CKOKO) is
responsible for institutionalizing an outcome-oriented education system. In 2006, Bulgaria
participated in PISA and PIRLS, and in TIMSS in 2007. PISA results suggest a large variance in
student achievement between schools, as opposed to within schools, suggesting that there are
many high quality but also many failing schools often in socially excluded Roma localities.

52.      During DPL2 the Government introduced the first Matura exams in June and September
2008, which improve the quality and transparency in access to Universities. About half of the
school directors attended training at the Institute for School Directors. In May 2008, MES
conducted the census-based 4th grade national assessment for the second time, and 5th grade test
for the first time. Technical seminars with teachers and principals throughout the country were
organized by the MES to disseminate and discuss the results. Despite these reforms and
substantial increases in real spending per student over the past decade, TIMSS Math scores
continued to decline from 2003 until 2008, as the education reform will take time to result in
better learning outcomes. There is no information on the percentage of principals reporting that
student assessment data (regional and school-level, respectively) are being used as one of the key
factors to identify training needs.

53.      DPL3 supported the implementation of Matura exams nationally in all subjects to replace
different University entrance exams. In September 2008, 72,532 students took the exam and

9,428 students in May 2009. From 2006 to 2009 the net enrolment rate in Universities increased
(Table 6). These education measures in the longer-run are expected to improve governance and
the quality of education which is anticipated to improve the availability of better skilled
individuals for the labor market.

        Pillar 1I: Promote Fiscal Sustainability through Efficiency Gains in the Social
        Sectors (health and education)

54.      Education reforms aimed to support fiscal sustainability through efficiency gains:
Public spending on education was 4.2% of GDP in 2006 in line with other new EU members
states (Figure 1). However, there were concerns with the composition of spending and the related
unsatisfactory outcomes.

55.     In education, DPL1 prepared and DPL2 sustained the introduction of unified payment
reforms and school consolidation which was expected to increase efficiency in financing. The
2007Annual Budget Act introduced decentralized management in schools with capitation
financing. The payment reform has been rolled out successfully to all schools, and the education
system has been decentralized financially and operationally. Principals are kept accountable,
teacher and school productivity increased as shown by an increase in student/teacher ratios and
average school size (Table 6); and international tests and M&E systems were institutionalized.
From 2006 to 2007 there was a slight reduction in early school leaving. The M&E assessments
also identified weaknesses in the system that still need to be addressed including the need for
providing timely feedback on the education system and individual schools, and a reduction in the
net enrolment rate in Primary education (Table 6), which was expected to increase based on the
Program`s key objectives (Table 1).

56.     DPL3 further supported school based management. School consolidation led to more
than 400 schools closing in 2007 and 2008, a reduction in teachers, an increased average school
size, and an increase in student/teacher ratio in primary and upper secondary schools (Table 6).
School transport was introduced. While these are impressive reforms for an education system in
any country that have improved efficiency, they will still need some refinement. Some
preliminary evidence from a recent impact evaluation suggests, the school closing program might
have had an effect on the drop-out of marginal students in closed schools. An impact evaluation
conducted as part of the parallel technical assistance activity with the Government Impact



                                               19
Evaluation Task Force indicates that students from a closed school may have seen a significantly
higher drop-out rate after one year (5-8%) and after two years of closing (3%) 14. Roma students
may have been more exposed to the drop-out risk associated with school closures. Net enrolment
rates in primary schools continued to decline (Table 6) which raises concerns about access to
education. Another concern is that the accountability mechanisms are not yet defined to make
schools accountable to parents and the community in terms of learning outcomes. All these points
are subject to further reform currently under way.

57.      The Health component of the DPL Program aimed to promote fiscal sustainability
through efficiency gains in health. The focus was on improving financial sustainability of the
NHIF through improved expenditure management by restructuring the hospital sector and
improved efficiency in the pharmaceutical sector. Key-outcome indicators focused on a
streamlined hospitals sector, increased outpatient spending by the NHIF, a ceiling on hospital
spending, improved access for underserved groups, and more affordable drugs (Table 1).
Structural reforms in health went in the right direction but were not implemented as planned in
the reform program. In 2006, public spending on health was 4.7% of GDP which was at the lower
end compared to other new EU member states. The 6 percent health insurance contribution rate
was the lowest among the New Member States. The rather low public spending on health resulted
in high out-of-pocket spending of almost 40% of total health expenditures (THE) in 2006 (Table
7), as increasing expenditures are shifted to other payers including patients and the general
government budget. Since 2003, the NHIF revenues started to be outpaced by increasing
insurance expenditures threatening the insurer`s financial viability. By 2007 the insurer`s deficit
was expected to increase to 47% of total NHIF revenues, which raised concerns about the NHIF
spending patterns. The DPL aimed to support the financial sustainability of the NHIF by trying to
control expenditure growth of the insurer`s main cost drivers including hospital overcapacity and
pharmaceutical spending.

58.     The DPL1 key-outcome indicator aimed to improve access to care, in particular for
underserved groups (Table 1). However, the DPL did not support any specific actions to improve
access by reducing high out-of-pocket spending. The DPLs M&E framework did not track these
access indicators. Since 2003, survey data suggest that households have increased on average the
share of total household expenditures on health from 4.3 to 5.3 percent in 2009. Out-of-pocket
(OOP) health spending was regressive with the poor paying 8.1% of total household spending on
health compared to 4.1% among the richest (MTHS, 2007). There are no follow-up household
survey data to compare progress against this baseline. High OOP payments limit access to care as
indicated by a substantial increase of sick survey respondents who reported foregoing medical
treatment for financial reasons (Table 8).

59.     DPL1 aimed to improve the efficiency of the health sector through (i) pharmaceutical
policy and (ii) health financing reforms at the NHIF focusing on revenue increase and ceilings for
hospital payment, and hospital payment consolidation (Table 3). The NHIF had to contract all
hospitals and pay for all services invoiced. DPL1 aimed to protect the NHIF sustainability by
putting a spending cap and reduce hospital overcapacity through the masterplan. Hospital funding
was successfully consolidated into the NHIF (Table 9). This fund consolidation decreased



                                                       21
opportunities for hospitals to shift costs across different payers which is expected to increase
productivity in hospitals.

60.      Financial sustainability of NHIF: Caused by strong employment and wage growth,
NHIF revenues increased over the past years despite the low contribution rate of 6 perce nt of
payroll, which was increased to 8 percent in 2009. The NHIF generally prevents a deficit
situation by not spending more than revenues available from contributions and the general budget,
which leads to hospital deficits if their revenue from insurance does not cover hospital
expenditures. A national framework contract requires the NHIF to contract with all public and
private providers accredited by the Ministry of Health (MOH); this eliminates any incentive the
NHIF could set to hospitals for restructuring and also puts financial pressure on the NHIF. In
January 2010, the NHIF initiated some selective contracting though with mixed results. Instead of
closing redundant hospitals, the MOH plans to convert them into long-term care facilities.

61.      Hospital streamlining through the Masterplan and provider payment reforms would
have to be described as less successful. Hospital payment by Clinical Care Pathways does not set
incentives for improved service provision, and the current Government budget ceiling for
hospitals is annual; but a longer-term ceiling is needed to strategically manage hospital spending.
The hospital Masterplan has been finalized during DPL2, but was dropped in DPL3 which
introduced outpatient care measures. The Masterplan continued to facilitate discussion on hospital
rationalization between municipalities and central level, but the plan has not been adopted.
Contrary to the plan recommendations, there was an increase in the number of hospitals and in
hospital beds. Not surprising, the already high number of hospitalizations increased to one of the
highest levels in Europe. Combined with a relatively low average length of stay (ALOS) (Table
10), this suggests that hospitals treat patients in a more expensive inpatient setting, although they
could be treated at lower costs in outpatient or day-care. Hospital performance indicators
remained less efficient than European standards. Nonetheless, the Masterplan is ready to be
adopted and implemented as soon as the Government finds the reform will to start hospital
rationalization. In May 2010, the Parliament passed a bill that would reduce the number of
hospitals the NHIF has to contract with from 400 to 130, which still requires a careful review of
the hospitals included in the list to ensure criteria of availability, access and efficiency.

62.     Hospital arrears decreased since 2005 but increased again (Table 9) as hospitals did not
become more efficient by closing redundant hospitals and beds (Table 10). Arrears have
decreased as the fiscal surplus was used to clear the arrears. The necessary measures to prevent
arrears from accumulating again have not been implemented yet, which will put additional
pressure on the budget deficit.

63.      During DPL1 and DPL2, the Bank provided technical advice on pharmaceutical policy.
Successful was the introduction of the reference pricing system which led to a price decrease for
drugs of around 20 percent. However, it did not lead to a decrease in overall pharmaceutical
expenditures as the new drug list includes new and expensive drugs, which pose a financial threat
to the NHIF drug budget in 2009. It also did not lead to a reduction in the rather high share of the
population`s out-of-pocket spending for pharmaceuticals. Patients continue to pay for more than
one-third of outpatient care expenditures (Table 9). The NHIF continues to spend about 20% of
total insurance expenditures on pharmaceuticals (Figure 2) which combined with pharmaceutical
spending by patients, points to rather high pharmaceuticals spending in the European context.

64.     DPL3 added Primary Health Care (PHC) and the IT system at the NHIF which has
helped to improve transparency and efficiency in public spending. Implementing the health
Management Information System (HMIS) in 2009 was most successful. It was procured under the
Bank HSRP and installed at the NHIF and in hospitals to register hospital claims. The HMIS was
financed and implemented with the support of the health project. It was rated by the ICR of the
HSRP as the most complex project activity which encountered significant obstacles that posed
major challenges to project implementation. However, once implemented, the HMIS was most
successful and resulted in hospital fraud reductions in the amount of BGN 8 million in the first
month and about BGN 4 million in each of the following three months. Although DPL3 stressed
hospital contracting reforms, this has not led to selective contracting. Consequently the NHIF has



                                                   23
to contract with all hospitals accredited by the MOH, which at the moment includes all public and
private hospitals. The NHIF has been paying an increasing share of public hospital spending
(Figure 2).

65.      The DPL program increased efficiency in the social sectors by contributing to improved
transparency and reduced corruption. While the population`s perception of corruption
deteriorated in 2006-09, the Government was taking measures to curb corruption and improve
governance across the public sector. The DPL program aimed at complementing these efforts by
focusing on supporting measures to improve governance at the sectoral level. For example in
education the DPL program focused on supporting reforms to improve accountability and
governance, and the health insurance fund reduced fraud with the new HMIS since its
implementation in 2009. In addition, since 2009 the Social Investment and Employment
Promotion Project supports the development of local capacity for applying for EU funds, and
created different active labor market programs that are directly eligible for European Structural
Fund financing. Despite progress in governance in social sectors, the overall perception of
corruption deteriorated, as the efforts of the government were not sufficiently systematic to be
effective. The percentage of survey respondents who reported having given a bribe to receive
medical services remained largely on similar level in 2000 (7.2%) and in 2008 (6.1%). The 2009
Global Corruption Barometer of Transparency International rated the judiciary as the most
corrupt sector, followed by the Parliament; the Report states the poor are disproportionately
burdened by bribe demands.


3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

66.      Under the SIR DPL Program there were substantial reform achievements and progress in
a political environment with various buy-in among stakeholders. The Program was relevant and
embedded in the Government broader reform agenda. Moreover, the prior actions were met and
the Program kept flexible in DPL3 to specifically respond to the challenges created by the
economic downturn starting in late 2008. The PDOs were consistent with the CPS, remained
relevant and allowed flexibility for an evolving program. The Bank`s approach to focus on a
limited number of sectors allowed a comprehensive and cohesive approach with high quality
Technical Assistance that would not have been possible under a multi-sector DPL. The DPL
program included the right reform actions. The Program showed moderate shortcomings in its
implementation (e.g. masterplan, pharmaceutical policy, improving access for underserved
groups) and hence, achievement of objectives.

67.     Ownership for reforms varied across sectors in the Coalition Government. Ownership
was strong in the education and labor sector, but not as strong in health which compromised full
achievements; this was an underestimated risk at the beginning of the operation. The education
sector managed to implement difficult school reforms, despite initial teacher resistance. Similarly
in labor, strong ownership supported the implementation of reforms. The MOH was less
supportive of reforms. The focus on hospital rationalization and financial sustainability of the
NHIF in the DPL led to less attention given to related areas including primary health care (only
added in DPL3), high OOP payments for patients and inequity in access to health care. The health
component - with the exception of the IT system at the NHIF sponsored ­ did so far not have an
impact on the efficiency in the delivery of care and financial sustainability of the system.
Nonetheless, the health part did prepare the stage to facilitate the implementation of reforms, for
example with the Masterplan, which would then lead to the expected outcome.


                                                24
68.     The overall MS rating reflects moderate shortcomings in the DPL program including the
need for actions in health that would have led to better access for underserved populations (a key-
outcome indicator in DPL1), the need for more attention to potential negative externalities on
access to education such as decreasing enrollment rates and in health care, the initial limits in the
M&E framework and missing indicators (e.g. inequality in access), and the weak impact in health
where political buy-in for reforms was mixed. It is difficult in some areas, perhaps because of a
weak link between the objective-action-indicator chain, to document outcomes in the
performance of the health and social protection sector. However, education reforms progressed
successfully, as well as labor reforms which were also supported by a strong policy dialogue with
the EU. Education had a rather ambiguous start at the very beginning, which quickly changed
once the MES took full ownership for the reform agenda. The education part is rated to be the
most successful of the DPL components, which managed to implement challenging reforms and
is currently refining these reforms to address unexpected consequences, such as decreasing
enrolment rates.

69.      Overall, the health component did not have a substantial impact on the PDOs and key-
outcome indicators (Table 1). The slow progress under the HSRP should perhaps have been a
warning sign for the DPL health program, and suggests that the Bank was overoptimistic in its
assessment of the degree of Government ownership for health sector reform (as proved to be the
case), specially in the hospital sector. With hindsight, it is clear that ownership at the MOH was
not sufficiently deep and the Bank team underestimated the risks of obstacles such as stakeholder
interests among politicians that blocked and delayed reforms before elections (e.g. IT system
which took 8 years to implement with the support of the HSRP) or diluted their quality (e.g.
pharmaceutical law approved but not satisfactory to the Bank). Then again, the emphasis of the
Government`s own National Strategy on health sector reform clearly made a case for the DPL to
include health. The objective of financial sustainability was relevant to reducing hospital arrears
and billing fraud at the NHIF, issues addressed under the HSRP, but it was diluted through the
framework contract forcing the NHIF to contract with all hospitals in an environment of
overcapacity; and not comprehensive enough to assess effects on patients` access to care and out-
of-pocket payments. Implementing the health reform proposed in the Strategy and the DPL would
have required more political buy-in and leadership from the MOH.

70.     The DPL program was designed as a homogenous program with substantial time overlap
from DPL2 to 3. This makes an individual rating of each DPL difficult. Based on the evaluation
of each DPL presented in the previous section, DPL 1 and 2 are rated MS, and DPL3 is rated
Satisfactory. DPL1 benefited from a substantial preparation budget, management support and
synergies from ongoing projects, which could have allowed a clearer description of prior actions
in line with the PDO,and a clearer evaluation framework identifying the dimensions to be
evaluated, the methodology used, and a comprehensive set of indicators that assess all aspects of
the key-outcomes initially defined (Table 1). DPL2 was designed as a DDO and took a longer
time to pass Parliament. DPL2 benefited from a newly added and very strong M&E effort
supported by the PHRD grant. Although originally planned, no follow-up household survey was
conducted to assess the impact of reforms against the 2007 baseline. DPL3 is rated Satisfactory,
mainly because the DPL benefited from previous year investment and made some important
adjustments to the prior actions. The DPL3 - in a context of renewed need for fiscal support in
view of the economic crisis - had a changed focus in health to align with the implementation of
the HMIS for the NHIF and focus on outpatient instead of hospital care.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

71.      The DPL Program aimed to improve social sector service delivery, but the results
framework did not track any inequality indicators. The M&E data do not provide information on
the poverty and gender impact of the Program with a follow-up household survey for example in
2009. The recent increase in incomes and reduction in poverty and extreme poverty was driven by
strong economic growth that has added a high number of individuals to the active workforce. But
some groups have benefited more than others and thus, large disparities still exist. The DPL
helped to institutionalize several social and employment programs to integrate vulnerable groups
into the society, which improved social service delivery and thus affected the life of the poor. For
example, the Social Assistance Agency (SAA) and Employment Agency (EA) reviewed the
structure and profiles of beneficiaries and developed individual activation action plans for
affected beneficiaries through its branch offices. The GMI majority of beneficiaries are Roma (63
percent).

72.     Improved education under the DPL is expected to influence the life of the poor in the
long run; however this objective may not be achieved if the primary and secondary school net
enrolment rates continue to decline (Table 6). Primary and secondary school attendance rate
among children from poor households was considerably lower than for th ose in non-poor
households. Individuals with less than secondary education are more likely to be poor: they
represent only 37 percent of the adult population, but make up nearly 80 percent of the poor.

73.     In the health sector, it could be argued, that an increasing share of people was not able to
afford health care when they needed it (Table 8), in a context of economic growth, because they
were charged higher fees, formally and informally. Providers are likely to increase fees for
patients to finance hospital expenditures if the NHIF puts ceilings on hospital payments and
hospitals are not reducing their costs. Although DPL1 included a key-outcome indicator on
improving access for underserved groups, the DPL program did not include any targeted
measures to achieve this outcome and indicators to measure progress.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

74.      The institutionalization of the education reform with decentralized school management
and financing, school closure, Matura, PISA participation and M&E system at the MES was the
key institutional change achieved under the DPL program. In addition, constant institutional
strengthening and improved governance is attributable to the NHIF IT system implemented under
the HSRP. The HMIS will institutionalize transparency in hospital billing leading to better budget
execution in the NHIF. Reforms in employment and social assistance agencies have been
institutionalized and changed the attitude towards beneficiaries of social assistance and
unemployment services. The new administration that took office in July 2009 continues to
develop and implement reforms that will build up on past reforms.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

75.     None reported.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

There was no specific beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshop as this ICR is not an Intensive
Learning ICR.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings: Moderate

76.      As summarized above, the inference with the PDOs and the DPL actions during times of
economic growth is difficult to be established. The context for introducing comprehensive social
sector reforms with a Coalition Government was more challenging than anticipated in particular
in health. Reforms in education and labor have been fully started and will lead to the expected
results once the refinements are completed. With the new reform-oriented Administration arriving
in mid-2009, a reform momentum has been created on a fiscal level to manage the impact of the
economic crisis, which may also help sustaining efficiency reforms in the social sectors, and kick-
start the needed reforms in health that have been prepared during the DPL program.

77.      There are some weaknesses in the health part in the implementation of the
Pharmaceutical Law under DPL1 and 2 which pose a risk for higher pharmaceutical expenditures
for patients and the NHIF; as well as the slow progress in hospital reform, which will need to be
addressed in the future to redirect spending from inpatient to outpatient and improve the
efficiency in spending. Social assistance improvements are still small in scale to have an impact
but will continue to be supported under the Social Inclusion Project and other partners. Similarly,
the impact of school reforms on equity in access to education needs to be monitored to take
corrective measures.

78.      The global economic crisis starting in late 2008 does not necessarily pose a risk to the
sustainability of the actual outputs achieved under the DPL program such as education and labor
reforms; however, the crisis puts the Program PDO at risk, including employment growth and
fiscal sustainability if costly public sector overcapacity is not reduced. The achievements under
the DPL Program have included reforms that softened the impact of the crisis on vulnerable
groups, and made the education and labor sectors more effective and flexible in line with EU
policies.

79.     The economic crisis has also created increasing strains on the budget, causing the new
Government to take steps to reduce public sector spending by 15 percent in 2009 including a
similar reduction in the public workforce in the beginning of 2010. These crisis response
measures will put additional pressure on the social assistance system, but also generate
momentum to continue efficiency-enhancing reforms and reduce wasteful spending, which is
expected to strengthen fiscal sustainability in the future. For these reasons, the ICR rates the risk
for development outcome as moderate. The ISRs in the DPL Program all rated the development
outcomes as satisfactory.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)

Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

80.     The top ten policy reform measures to for an increased productivity growth in Bulgaria
were identified in the Report Accelerating Bulgaria`s Convergence` in July 2007. Most of the
suggested labor and education measures are included in the DPL Program. The Report further
suggests that all these reforms could be carried out within Bulgaria`s - at that time - projected
budget envelopes for 2007-09. The reforms in the primary and secondary education system were
considered to be self-financed from efficiency gains and grant funds available from EU 15. Thus,
the Bank has little leverage in a middle-income country with a fiscal surplus; however, the main
support the Bank can bring with a DPL to reforms is Technical Assistance and support the
collaboration among reformers within a Government. The DPL1 operation went forward because
the Government considered it politically more feasible to implement reforms in social sectors
under a policy lending program to ensure coordination of reform efforts across agencies, instead
of Technical Assistance. In addition, DPL1 allowed the Government to change its debt portfolio.

81.      A Quality at Entry Assessment was conducted in August 2007 following the release of
DPL1 and just before the Concept Note review of DPL2 16. The Quality at Entry of DPL1 was
rated overall as Moderately Unsatisfactory. Strategic Relevance, the Approach and the Risk
Assessment were rated as Moderately Satisfactory, whereas Poverty, Structural, Financial and
Macroeconomic Aspects, as well as Implementation Arrangements were rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory. The Assessment identified some missed opportunities including non-realistic
PDOs, a need to increase the focus on inclusive growth e.g. excluded ethnic and low-income
groups, and weak capacity to assess the impact of reforms including a need to strengthen the
M&E framework by identifying the dimensions of the project to be evaluated and the
methodology used. The DPL team sent a rejoinder explaining (i) the strategic relevance and
approach of the DPL program and its consistency with the CPS as well as the approach used was
following recommendations from peer reviewers and Regional Management; (ii) within the
macroeconomic framework, additional funding from the DPL will not serve to increase public
spending in social sectors but rather to finance reforms that will lead to higher efficiency; and (iii)
although the DPL program does not have an explicit poverty and social inclusion objective, the
policies included in the reform agenda are expected to have a positive impact on the poor, and
have already increased the awareness about vulnerable groups. The team also highlighted the use
of the 2007 MTHS as a baseline survey to analyze the impact of policies and the plan to conduct
a follow-up survey to assess progress against the baseline. Most important, DPL2 included a
substantial additional investment in Technical Assistance and M&E work which was funded from
additional funds from a PHRD grant.

82.     The DPL Program received substantial management support and an impressive
preparation budget especially during DPL1 and 2. There are moderate weaknesses mainly related
to equity key-outcomes not being followed up by actions, and some disconnect between
supported actions and M&E indicators, as well as actions included with insufficient government
buy-in to introduce reforms over time, mainly in health. Thus, a rating of Moderately Satisfactory
is appropriate.

(b) Quality of Supervision)

Ratings: Satisfactory

83.     The supervision of the DPL Program was detailed and constructive. There has been a
considerable effort by the Bank to provide substantive Technical Assistance (TA) through
consultants hired under the PHRD Grant (DPL2), and through the Bank`s pharmaceutical expert
during DPL1 and 2 who advised the Government on the pharmaceutical policy. Also, two head
quarter based team members (education and SP) spent extended missions in Bulgaria to foster the
policy dialogue with the Government and the EU in particular with respect to social inclusion and
education reforms. Education technical assistance produced strong analytical work including the
ABC report and subsequent notes that helped provide rationale for reforms. These efforts led to a
better understanding for reforms and positively affected the collaboration with the MES which
subsequently became a reform champion and invested in school database to create inventories
based on which cost and performance analysis was conducted. This investment considerably
improved governance in education. Particularly during DPL1 the Bank showed strong
management support to the Program, including with frequent visits through the Bank`s field-
based Sector Manager (in Croatia).

84.     The implementation phase substantially strengthened the initial M&E framework in the
design of the program. ISRs in DPL1 and 2 tracked progress with respect to PDOs but did not
make systematic use of indicators. This changed in DPL3 with all indicators completed and
updated. A PHRD grant in the amount of US$ 708,000 provided substantial additional funds to
finance consultants` analytical work and design DPL2 and DPL3. Related to the DPL, technical
assistance was provided to the Government to support institutionalizing the Impact Evaluation
Task Force (IETF) responsible for M&E of reform progress; and funded several in-detail analyses.
Findings from the analysis, in particularly initially in education, were instrumental in getting the
government buy-in for a rather far-reaching education reform agenda. The ISR ratings were
always satisfactory for both implementation and achievement of development objectives,
including when employment and productivity declined and efficiency gains in health did not
materialize.

85.      The Bulgaria Bank country office provided fully satisfactory support to the Program.
During DPL1, a team member moved to Bulgaria which allowed a continuous policy dialogue
with the Government on SP and education and collaboration with the EU on Roma aspects in the
social inclusion agenda. Accordingly, supervision remained strong during the program and M&E
improved under DPL3. Also, the quality of supervision in health became more pragmatic under
DPL3. This warrants a Satisfactory rating for the overall supervision of the program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory




                                                29
86.      The moderately satisfactory performance overall is based on the MS performance at
quality at entry and satisfactory at supervision. The Bank supervision budgets 17 for DPL1
($671,800) and DPL2 (708,870) were comparatively very high (DPL3: $201,170) and substantive
additional technical assistance was provided through the PHRD grant in health, education, labor
and social protection, as well as the ongoing health and SP projects. On the other hand, the
Program contributed to an ongoing policy dialogue and supported the Government in reforms, at
a modest amount of IBRD resources. Thus, Bank support was worthwhile in terms of
effectiveness of resource use, despite the Program`s limitations described above.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

87.     The government showed strong ownership for the program. The DPL was designed based
on the Government National Reform Program prepared by the new government that took office in
mid-2005.The DPL was seen as budget support, easier to manage as a PAL and as a tool to
coordinate reforms across Line Ministries without increasing their budget allocation. Thus, the
Ministry of Finance asked the Bank for a focused HD DPL to facilitate the implementation of
reforms in social sectors where reforms lagged behind compared to the public sector. Social
sector reforms were not included in the Acquis Communautaire and considered a challenge in
preparation for joining the EU in 2007. The DPL fostered from the beginning a strong partnership
with the EU including DG/Employment and DG/EcoFin. The EU collaboration helped
maintaining a consistent message in the DPL on equity-relevant issues such as the Roma Agenda
and maintaining the social assistance program.

88.     The Government did meet the prior actions. Fiduciary management was rated as
Satisfactory to the Bank. The DPL1 preparation phase served to set up a school database with
data on cost in education. The MOF and MES in collaboration with the Bank education team
conducted projections of future education cost based on this dataset which convinc ed the
Government to implement education reforms.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

89.      Buy-in for reforms varied across Ministries in the Coalition Government, which required
additional time and investment for communication with different stakeholders and consensus
building, in particular in the health sector. While the MES at the very beginning hesitantly
participated in the reform debate for a short period, this changed quickly to strong ownership
once the Ministry saw its reform agenda reflected in the DPL. The MOH was reluctant about
reforms that were politically difficult to implement (e.g. Masterplan that would lead to closing of
hospital overcapacity). On the other hand, the MOF and the NHIF as the main financer of health
care had a strong interest for efficiency-enhancing health reforms and reductions in hospital



17
     See Annex 1.




                                                30
overcapacity. But in a coalition government and in a middle-income country with a favorable
macro- and fiscal situation it may simply be too difficult for the MOF and NHIF to put reform
pressure on the health sector. During the DPL formulation and implementation, stakeholders were
involved and influenced the program, as for example the local NGO that successfully brought
Bulgaria`s stance on social welfare reforms to the EU Committee of Social and Human Rights.
For each of the three DPLs, the support of the implementing agencies is rated as MS, which is
influenced by slow progress in the health sector.

90.      The sustainability of the reforms started by the previous government is supported by the
new administration that took office in mid-2009, with a strong focus on downsizing overcapacity
in the public sector, mainly among staff. In the context of rapidly falling budget revenues, this
new government may be able to implement efficiency-enhancing measures that seemed too
difficult to implement previously, in particular in the health sector.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

91.      Overall the program achieved important gains; however more could have been achieved
with a stronger buy-in by the Line Ministry in particular in the health sector, where achievements
remained modest despite several years of support under the ongoing health project. This mixe d
performance across Ministries with stronger performance in education and SP compared to health
leads to a Moderately Satisfactory performance overall, as well as for each DPL, as the
performance remained similar during the implementation period.


6. Lessons Learned

Some important lessons can be learned from this first Social Sector DPL to an ECA country that
may be of relevance to other operations.

Human Development reforms require a longer timeline

92.     Social sector reforms tend to be politically difficult to implement in any country. To
support longer-term policy reforms it is worthwhile to have a multi-year program design that
allows some flexibility in the program. A DPL program series instead of a single DPL provides
an opportunity for continued policy dialogue and support reforms over longer time.

A Human Development DPL provides a more focused, coherent and comprehensive
approach to a country's reform agenda than a DPL with too many sectors included

93.    A DPL that is focused on a small number of related sectors, such as Human
Development, provides a comprehensive and cohesive approach for the Bank to support a
Government`s reform agenda. A limited sector DPL is also easier to manage for the Bank than a
DPL with many sectors. Such a cohesive approach intensifies the policy dialogue in a sector
which could lead to better quality benchmarks and coherent reforms.

Analytical work and policy notes with realistic recommendations help designing a program
and get government buy-in for reforms




                                               31
94.      Despite the higher cost related to it, the upfront investment in analytical work and policy
notes in the preparation phase can help to set the reform framework and embed a DPL program in
a country`s national strategy. Investment lending projects can further supported these analytical
works.

A coalition government may justify a narrower program scope

95.     A coalition government with different parties in charge of different Ministries can make
it more difficult to move ahead with a comprehensive reform agenda. In these situatio ns, a polit-
economic analysis could help identifying the change makers as well as additional investment
that would be needed to receive the support from all coalition partners and opposition leaders for
reforms. In these situations, a more focused DPL design to include reform-interested sectors only
may yield better implementation results.

Strong Bank support through management and decentralized staff supports the policy
dialogue with Government and other partners

96.     Strong management support from the Bank at the beginning of an operation with Senior
Management participating in the DPL1 preparation phase can help to get the buy-in from the
Government and Country Unit for a DPL program. Decentralization of HQ staff to the field
ensures a close and continued dialogue with the Government and other partners throughout the
program series.

Even though it does not really qualify as a policy action, the IT investment at the NHIF can
have a substantial impact on good governance

97.      The computerization of data and financial management in an insurance fund generates
several benefits including the identification and reduction of fraudulent claims and expenditures,
better information on hospitals and treatment patterns, and the ability to carry out provider
performance analysis and using results for contracting and payment adjustments.

Keeping a flexible DPL program allows adjusting to a changing environment but poses
some risks for implementation effectiveness

98.     Keeping the DPL program flexible allows a fast design for DPL3 in a program of three
DPLs; however, the risk is that a quickly developed program is mellowed down to allow faster
disbursement, in particular if the DPL has to pass Parliament before it dissolves for elections.

Synergies exist between a DPL and parallel investment lending (IL) projects

99.      Bank DPLs tend to include prior actions that are supported under an IL. This leads to
synergies with different operations supporting each other. On the other hand, it also raises
questions about the effectiveness of each operation, and the efficiency of implementation. It could
be argued that the policy dialogue under an IL operation should be strong enough to support the
implementation of an activity, without necessary needing a DPL with too many overlapping prior
actions.

The Bank should use a pragmatic approach to objectives, related actions and indicators to
measure progress




                                                32
100.     The Bank could generally do better in defining the objective­action­indicator chain
when designing an operation. A much more pragmatic approach should be applied about the
feasibility of reaching objectives taking into account the relevance of confounding factors. In
countries with several years of strong fiscal stance, quality in social sector spending and good
governance might be a more relevant objective than fiscal sustainability.

The Bank could develop a stronger "change management" approach to DPL Programs

101.    Implementing reforms involves changes on an institutional, sector, organizational,
business and individual level in a country. Managing these changes would require more
comprehensive tools that are often not included in DPL programs, such as for example,
developing a communication strategy to inform the population about reforms and get political
buy-in from different stakeholders.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

The Borrower Contribution to the ICR provides a detailed overview on the impact of the DPL
Program and the excellent collaboration between the Government and the Bank team.

(b) Cofinanciers

Not Applicable

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
(e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)

IMF comments are presented in Annex 5. The Fund points to the insufficient reforms in the
health sector which has led to less efficient health spending and to the increased financial
pressure in the pension system caused by a reduction in contributions and pension increases. The
ICR is consistent with these points. The DPL program supported pension reforms through
contribution reduction by 6 percentage points mentioned in DPL1 while at the same time
increasing the contribution base by introducing labor market reforms throughout the DPL
program to raise the number of individuals in the workforce.

During DPL1 preparation in 2006, the IMF approved a 25-month SDR 100 million Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) of a precautionary nature. The SBA-supported program aimed inter alia to
achieve sustainable high growth through: (i) continued tight fiscal policy; and (ii) structural
reforms to boost output and export capacity. The related structural benchmarks pertained to the
increase of work-time flexibility, the submission of the education sector reform strategy to
Parliament and a reduction in the number of redundant teaching positions which were all
complementary to the proposed DPL program. The IMF conducted annual missions. In light of
the economic crisis, the Article IV Consultation in December 2008 recommended, continued
fiscal prudence and structural policy reform to maintain a fiscal surplus, including through a
significant slowing of expenditure growth and policies to curb wage growth and moderate unit
labor cost increases.

In March 2010, the IMF Article IV Consultation recommended urgent pension reforms to ensure
the sustainability of the pension system through a combination of the envisaged slowing of


                                              33
pension increases over the next years, after the freeze in 2010, an adjustment of the pension
system parameters, including an increase in the retirement age or the minimum years of
contribution, addressing the underreporting of insurable income, as well as a revision of those
parameters that have created inefficiencies in the system. In health the IMF points to a need for
comprehensive reforms, - whereas the government`s on-going reform efforts aim at mitigating the
weaknesses in the health care system, - and suggests that swift completion of a broad-based
health care reform will be crucial.

Introduction
This Report aims to be an evaluation in brief of the overall DPL program. It assesses the overall
program objectives against Bulgaria`s current development priorities. With regard to the analysis
of design, the Report first reviews the background and the overall DPL program based on the
cumulative experience of the Bulgarian Government and then addresses specific key topics of the
implementation. The Overall Assessment section first reviews the overall outcomes in the areas
supported by the DPL overarching objectives, and then tries to highlight the key accomplishments
of the Government in the process of implementation. The lessons learned reflect the
organizational and administrative experience of the overall DPL program and as a closing the
Report underlines the sustainability of the achieved strategic goals.


Background
Macro background
In January 2007 Bulgaria became a Member State of the European Union ­ nine years after the
Accession Partnership was decided by the European Council. Over these nine years, a broad
reform agenda was implemented, macroeconomic stability was maintained, and economic growth
was strong, averaging above 6 percent between 2004 and 2008.
After a steep decline in 1996-97, output recovered and GDP growth averaged 4.8 percent in
2000-02, and 4.5 percent in 2003, and average for the 2002-2005 period of 5.2 percent with
inflation contained to low levels 18. There have been major structural changes in the economy,
with private sector share of GDP dramatically soaring as a result of a major push in privatization
in 1998-99 and continuing efforts thereafter.
Building on the reforms of the previous years, the medium term program between 2006 and 2009
has aimed to sustain economic growth and support the country in its full integration into the
European Union after the accession on January 1, 2007.
With the support of the DPLs, GOB has made substantial progress towards meeting or exceeding
the objectives of the medium term structural reform program. The average annual growth rates
during 2006-08 were maintained at about 6 percent and the unemployment was reduced
dramatically. Structural reform in education and health are sped up and living standards are
gradually improving. Bulgaria has joined the European Union in 2007, as planned.
Bulgaria has maintained macroeconomic stability and kept building on a strong track record of
sound economic policies over the last decade. The country maintains the Currency Board
Arrangement as a precondition for the effectiveness and sustainability of the public finance until
accession to the Eurozone. The CBA has served Bulgaria well, providing a stable monetary
environment, contributing to low inflation and boosting confidence.

CPS
The last Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Bulgaria was approved by the World Bank`s
Executive Directors in June 2006 and covered the period ending June 2009. The centerpiece of
the CPS base case program was the series of three Development Loans (DPLs) totaling US$500
million equivalent, designed to support Bulgaria`s structural reform agenda help facilitating the
country`s convergence with the EU. In particular the DPL series supported the adoption and
implementation of policies to:


        Improve the institutional framework in the labor and social sectors to more closely align
        their policies with EU standards; and
        Improve the efficiency of the health, education, and social protection systems to maintain
        a fiscally sustainable expenditure framework and improve access to basic social services.

The policies supported by the DPL series were not fully reflected or guided by the adoption of the
acquis communautaire and other accession processes, but remained nonetheless relevant for the
accession and membership agenda, because of their focus on fiscal sustainability, social inclusion
and access to services, issues that have been highlighted by the EU in the various assessment
reports of candidate countries. The need to address these issues before accession has been a key
lesson from the experience of the EU new member states. In addition, the policies supported by
the DPL series increased the transparency of public expenditures for health and education.
The accession of Bulgaria to the EU represents a turning point in our history and it also altered
the nature of Bulgaria`s relationship with the Bank. In that sense, the value added of the DPLs
can be found not only in providing budget support for the implementation of reforms, but also in
assisting the government to define the critical path for achieving key reforms and outcomes
contained in the sectoral strategies; providing or mobilizing technical assistance to develop
technical options; focusing the attention of the needed stakeholders; and establishing a timeframe
for the reform process. Given the dynamism created in the Bulgarian economy and its institutions
as a result of accession, the DPL series has been designed with added flexibility in phases two
and three to accommodate to the GOB needs in a rapidly changing environment. Thus, the DPL
series also helped for a safer landing in the beginning of the world economic crisis in 2009.


Structure
The policy framework of the DPL series was seriously streamlined and the whole cumbersome
structure of triggers, Board conditions, and benchmarks organized around the five pillars of the
previous PAL program was greatly simplified. Within this framework each DPL contributed to
the matrix of policy measures in all DPL areas. So all DPL intervened in social assistance and
labor market reforms, education restructuring and health system transformation. Each DPL
comprised of 10 Program Actions contrasting to the PAL program including over 150 measures,
triggers and conditions.


Overall assessment
Complemented by several investment loans and technical assistance the DPL program acted as a
primary vehicle for the Bank`s support in addressing Bulgaria`s medium term structural
challenges. The DPL program was consistent with the CPS and its main strategic areas: raise d
productivity and employment in support of private sector-led growth along the lines of the EU`s



                                               42
Lisbon Agenda and fiscal sustainability and improved capacity for absorption of EU funds.
Bulgaria`s successful implementation of reforms in these areas supported by the DPL program
contributed to good macroeconomic results and a respectable EU convergence rate.


The country is meeting the program targets established in the DPLs: Increase in the employment
rate of older workers; increase in the employment rate of younger workers; Matura examination
results are used by Bulgarian universities as credential for admission; Placement of students in
upper secondary institutions is done on the basis of objective ability testing (using the new 7th
grade national test) (intermediate outcome that shows information is used for quality
improvements); Percentage of payments to hospitals channeled through NHIF remains constant
or increases. Increased efficiency as shown by halting the decreasing trend in pupil-teacher ratio
in public schools (for grades 1-13) observed since 2002.

Lessons Learned
In the Lessons learned section we would like to highlight the excellent work of the coordination
mechanism that made the DPL Program possible and guaranteed a mutually agreeable final
output, thus securing positive results out of the operation.
In the first place we would like to thank the World Bank team in Sofia as well as in Washington
and Zagreb for the determination, hard work and commitment and for the understanding of the
specific features of the unique problems posed and solved in the process of realization of the DPL
Program. We would like also to acknowledge the huge amount of work they have done to
simplify and accustom the lending mechanism to the specific requirements of Bulgarian DPL
Program.
On the other end of the coordination mechanism the Government of Bulgaria was represented at
operational decision-making level by the Council for Economic Policy. The CEP was created
with Ordinance 58/2002 of the Council of Ministers with later amendments and was authorized
to:
        Formulate priorities of country economic policy;
        Coordinate the actions of line ministries and institutions in regard to the economic policy;
        Set priorities in the implementation of the state policy on private and public investment;
        Coordinate the actions of state institutions on privatization and post-privatization control;
        Coordinate all work regarding donor operations and control the implementation of all
        projects with international financing;
        Coordinate and control the implementation of all Government commitments to the Wo rld
        Bank and the International Monetary Fund as well as other IFIs.
The Council for Economic Policy reviewed and approved on regular basis the World Bank
portfolio, incl. the DPL Program. Each individual loan of the series has also been specifically
assessed and approved. On a higher level of authority, the final decisions for the DPL Program
were taken by the Council of Ministers and the Loan Agreements were ratified by the National
Assembly.
A leading role for the program implementation and success at Government level has to be
attributed to the concerted efforts of the Ministers of Finance and Economy.
The actual field coordination was responsibility of the Coordination of EU Affairs and IFIs
Directorate of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria, acting both as intermediary


                                                 45
between the Government and the Bank and between the line ministries and agencies of the
Government itself. The Directorate was responsible for monitoring and control on the
implementation of the DPL agenda, respectively for assessing the Ministries` progress in
fulfilling the obligations set in the Loan Agreements in the form of completing concrete program
actions.
The financial conditions of the loans were negotiated by the Ministry of Finance upon appropriate
authorization by the CoM and the National Assembly. The MoF was also in charge of the loans
planning, disbursement and servicing as well as for the financial management of the respective
loan accounts.
The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and Science
as well as the National Health Insurance Fund actively participated in all stages of planning and
implementation of all measures in all three loans. They are due well deserved credit for designing,
together with the Bank`s experts, and implementing sound policy measures across the DPL
intervention sectors, thus helping Bulgaria achieve good economic and social results.
We believe that the coordination mechanism, based on both formal and informal contacts
between the parties and the hard work of the Bank and the Government was key in succeeding to
align the Bank views with the Government priorities in the DPL agenda. It does credit to all
institutions involved that the necessary decisions were taken in due time and the respect ive
actions were made along the lines of the agreed steps. It is also worth recognition that the main
field coordinators ­ WBSO, the Coordination of EU Affairs and IFIs Directorate of the Council
of Ministers and the Ministries of Finance and Economy showed great flexibility and swiftness of
reaction to smooth the process and iron out all possible problems even before they become a
threat to the Program and be able to hinder its satisfactory progress.
Finally, we would like to reiterate that after all necessary assessment and appraisal we believe
that the existing at the time coordination mechanism of the DPL Program is of fundamental
importance and constitutes an essential factor for the success of the DPL Program.
In this section it is also the place to highlight the design and implementation decisions that made
the DPL program so easy to operate on the part of the Government. The good coordination
mechanism and excellent collaboration between the Bank and the Government were vital, but the
streamlined design and the numerous simplifications that the Bank introduced made the operation
much more trouble-free and undemanding to control as well as more results oriented. We would
also like to acknowledge here the new possibility of choice that was given to the Government by
introducing the DDO. Although the not actually taken advantage of, DDO gives the Government
new flexibility options and shifts the focal point of the operation from lending to Technical
Assistance, which for countries like Bulgaria may be much more valuable.
Last but not least we would like to acknowledge the importance of Technical Assistance.
Throughout the Government it is widely conceived that the TA is a vital part of the DPL program.
The policy advice that the Bank can assure is unique in detail and flexibility as well as proofed
against experience in many different circumstances across the WB-member countries. Many
policies in the fiscal sustainability, public administration, education, health, labor market and the
social safety net has been designed or fine-tuned with the help of the TA supplied through the
structural loans of the Bank. Beside the TA in the form of policy advice and proposals for
concrete measures and interventions, the project preparation grants (PHRD) proves to be cr itical
for successful operations. The PHRD has strong track record in Bulgaria, as the PHRD for
preparation of the second DPL delivered essential analyses and fundamental research and
proposal documents to the Government. DPL 2 PHRD absorption rate was abo ve 90% and in
interviews representatives of the line ministries and agencies confirmed that TA in the form of
preparation grant was vital for the successful design and implementation of all measures.

Sustainability of achieved strategic goals
The achievements of the DPL Program highlighted above are merely an excerpt and only few out
of many achieved with the help of the DPL. The fact is that really most of the accomplishments
under the series of loans show immense sustainability. The implementation of the unified
standard in education as well as the school consolidation and the new way of financing the
secondary education sector are widely verified as a very successful reform. It seems there is now
no way of going back compromising the achievements of the DPL program in education. Also the
preparation and analytical work in the health sector proves sound basis for further reforms. The
legal framework of the labor market and social insurance that was fine-tuned under the DPLs,
though already most of it already amended, has succeeded in livening up the labor market and
stabilizing the social safety net. Thus the DPL Program not only helped the Government in
making critical steps towards improved fiscal sustainability, better public management and EU
convergence, but it also created a policy framework that will continue to be a basic building block
of all new policy measures designed by the Government in the EU environment.

Annex 5. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


International Monetary Fund

In assessing the original PDO (ii) promote fiscal sustainability through efficiency gains in the
social sectors, it should be mentioned that the sustainability of the social pension systems has
declined in recent years, as the combination of large pension increases and reductions in social
security contribution rates has widened the gap between pension contributions and pension
expenditures, and the increases in minimum insurable incomes were insufficient to make up for
the revenue losses. In the health care system, distorted incentives have led to a proliferation of
hospitals, mispricing, and rising financing pressures, while satisfaction with the quality of health
services remains low.
