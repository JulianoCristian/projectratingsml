       production and exports of these commodities. These\n            objectives would be achieved by providing farmers with\n            technical assistance and credit to finance on-farm\n            development plans. The project would finance over a two-year\n            commitment period and a four-year disbursement period: (a)\n            rehabilitation of about 4,600 ha of cocoa plantings\n            distributed among 2,000 farmers; (b) replanting of about\n            6,400 ha of cocoa plantings among 2,800 farms; (c)\n            replanting of about 5,000 ha of coffee distributed among\n            5,000 farms; (d) provision of 1,000 cocoa fermentation boxes\n            and 300 sun-drying facilities to cocoa farmers and of about\n            4,000 depulping machines to coffee farmers; (e) establisment\n            of 22 cocoa nurseries and 52 coffee nurseries by the\n            Ministry of Agriculture (SEA) and about 520 private coffee\n            nurseries; (f) reinforcement of the support services of SEA\n            and BA; and (g) monitoring and evaluation of project activities."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
