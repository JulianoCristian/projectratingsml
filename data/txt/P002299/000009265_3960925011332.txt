PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.        Following is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Dakar
Fishing Port Project in Senegal for which Loan 1405-SE for US$6.0 mil-
lion  was  approved  on  April 19, 1977.   The  loan  was  signed  on
June 7, 1977  and became  effective  on March 20, 1978.   The  original
closing  date  of  June 30, 1981  was  extended  several  times,  to
March 29, 1985 mainly for the completion of studies preparing the
subsequent port project. The loan was closed on March 29, 1985, and, as
of that date, US$5.64 million had been disbursed and the remaining
US$0.36 was cancelled.
2.        The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Western
Africa Region on the basis of the information collected by the comple-
tion mission in February 1986 and information available in the project
files.
3.        In accordance with the revised procedures for project perfor-
mance audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited
by OED staff. The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments
which have been incorporated in the report and are included as Annex 4.

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
DAKAR FISHING PORT PROJECT, LOAN 1405-SE
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The Fishing Port Project was the Bank's second involvement in
the Port of Dakar (para 2.01). The project objectives were to assist
Senegal's fishing sector and thereby help its economy. The construction
of the actual fishing port was fast and efficient (para 3.02). It is,
however, unclear from reports and other available information whether
the forecasted economic benefits have actually been achieved (pa-
ra 4.05). Even today, there is no certainty that the fishing statistics
are accurate and that the port receives -its due payments from the
vessels that use the terminal (para 4.07).  The construction of fish
processing plants in the port areas, though having lagged behind the
appraisal schedule, is p-ogressing according to market needs (pa-
ra 4.09).
2.        Although it is obvious today that a substantial part of the
general cargo wharves of the Port of Dakar could be used by the large
fishing, trawlers, thus economizing on project investments, it was
virtually impossible to foresee in 1975 that a reduction in Senegal's
economic activity, together with a high rate of containerization, would
free those wharves. Furthermore, concentration of fishing operations in
one part of the port has potential benefits (para 4.08).
3.        Other important points are as follows:
(a) The project was identified as a suitable Bank project in
December 1974 (para 2.01).
(b) The project was appraised in May 1976, presented to the Board
in April 1977, and the Loan became effective in March 1978
(para 2.06).
(c)  Bids were submitted in September 1976, .  t construction could
not start until December 1977 due to delays in Board presenta-
tion to allow cofinanciers enough time to approve their
participation in the project, and because of the complexity of
Senegalese regulations (para 3.01).
(d) Once construction had started, it was completed in record
time, and overall costs -- including escalations -- were still
14% below appraisal estimate (para 3.04 and Annex 1).
(e) The start of practically all studies and technical assistance
programs included in the project was late because complex



-v -
Senegalese regulations delayed the awnird of contracts. The delay in the
start of the technical assistance to fishing port operations and
management was critical, as the new facilities were operational before
an effective management was in place (paras 3.14-3.16).
(f) All the Bank's efforts to improve the financial management of
Port Autonome de Dakar (PAD), including the fishing port, have
been unsuccessful, and the same problems encountered during
1977-80 are still evident (paras 6.01-6.03).

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
DAKAR FISHING PORT PROJECT, LOAN 1405-SE
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Dakar Fishing Port Project was essentially a continuation
of the Bank's participation in the improvement of the Dakar Port Facili-
ties which started with the First Dakar Port Project (Loan 493-SE,
US$4.0 m) in 1967. This first port project was designed principally to
restore and expand existing general cargo-handling facilities; the
project also included important financial and institutional objectives
relating to port organization and operations, particularly for the
improvement of the accounting system.  The physical component of the
project was implemented satisfactorily with final costs approximately
14% lower than appraisal estimates.
1.02      As a result of a very rapid expansion of the industrial
fishing fleet in the late sixties-early seventies, a severe shortage of
berthing space for fishing vessels and for landing the catches devel-
oped, and commercial operations at the port were becoming seriously
affected.  Since traffic projections indicated a notable increase not
only in overall dry cargo but also in fresh fish and fish products, the
need was recognized for a fishing project which would provide for
extension of the fishing port facilities and the required organization
and  management  services.   The  Fishing  Port  Project,  appraised  in
May 1976, was thus designed to include physical facilities consisting of
a new berth face with associated reclamation of land, paving, ancillary
services, and access roads. The Project also included technical assis-
tance to the Port Authority of Dakar (PAD) for management, operations,
accounting, and tariff revision, and consulting services for study of a
container port facility and for an overall fisheries study.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAT
2.01      The  First  Dakar  Port  Project  (Loan 493-SE  of  1967),  was
implemented satisfactorily, with final costs 15% lower than the apprais-
al estimate.   The Fishing Port Project, which constituted a natural
continuation of the First Project, was based on a PAD design. It was
first discussed in mid-1973 during the last supervision mission of the
First Port Project. Eighteen months later, in December 1974, the final
form of the project was identified. In the meantime, PAD had prepared
outline  drawings  (avant-projet  d&taillE),  cost  estimates,  and bid
documents. On the basis of thet design and documentation, the prepara-
tion mission in March 1975 considered PAD's engineering staff incapable
of conducting the necessary studies, designs, bids, and bid evaluations.
PAD, then, reluctantly agreed to employ consultants for those tasks.



- 2 -
2.02      As no economic and financial feasibility study for the Fishing
Port Project had been prepared by the initial consultants, PAD hired a
second consultIng firm for that task.
2.03      Based on its own preliminary design, PAD had contracted the
dredging work for the proposed project -- 175,000 cubic meters of mostly
hard material - to a foreign company that had been established in the
Port of Dakar for many years. The design consultants were assigned the
difficult task of adjusting their design to the ongoing dredging.
2.04      The project was appraised in May 1976 after the completion of
the economic and financial feasibility studies, the engineering studies,
and the tender documents.
2.05      The project objectives were as follows:  (a) to create 1,500 m
of berth face to accommodate fishing vessels that otherwise would
congest the commercial port; (b) to create a 10.5 ha operational area in
which most fishing industry activities would be concentrated in order to
facilitate control and increase revenues to PAD and Senegal; (c) to
establish a plan of action for the development of the fishing sector;
and (d) to prepare for the next phase of the development of Dakar Port
-- namely, the establishment of a container terminal.
2.06      Negotiations were completed in November 1976.  Board presenta-
tion took place in April 1977, after a postponement from end-Decem-
ber 1976 because of cofinancier's (BADEA) delay in approving cofinancing
arrangements. The Loan did not become effective until March 20, 1978,
again because vf conditions of cross-conditionalities among cofinan-
ciers, as well as the time required for the Government to form a legal
opinion.
2.07      The project was cofinanced with BADEA, CCCE and PAD on a joint
basis, after all cofinanciers had agreed to follow Bank procedures for
procurement and project supervision. For its part, the Bank agreed to
provide additional funding in case of BADEA's nonacceptance of the
lowest bidder because of their more restricted bidding conditions.
2.08      The project consisted of:
(a)  civil works (including ccnsulting services for supervision):
(i) construction of about 1,500 m of new berth face; (1i) re-
clamation and paving of about 10.5 ha of land; (iii) ins-
tallation of ancillary services thereon; (iv) demolition of
the existing slipway and its associated buildings; and
(v) construction of the main access road to the new fishing
port.
(b)  technical assistance:   (i) for management,  operations,  and
planning for the fishing port; (ii) introduction of analytical
accounting procedures and preparation of a cost-based tariff
structure; and (iii) introduction of an ad-valorem tariff
structure for fish traffic.
(c) consulting services: (i) to study and define the needs of the
port of Dakar for handling container ships and to outline the



-3-
development of container port facilities and equipment re-
quired to handle future container traffic adequately and
competitively; and (ii) to study in depth the current situa-
tion in industrial and traditional fishuries and related
activities, and subsequently to establish a coherent plan of
action for development of the sector over the next ten years.

The total cost of civil works was financed jointly by the Bank, BADEA, CCCE
and PAD. The external lenders covered 90% of the total project costs, net
of taxes, and the Bank loan financed US$3.68 million of foreign exchange
costs (less US$0.36 million which was canc-lled) and US$2.32 million equiva-
lent of local currency expenditures.  The financing of the local costs for
this project was considered appropriate because of the Government's diffi-
cult public finance situation.
2.10      To facilitate bidding procedures, the civil works were split into
five lots.   Requests for bids were issued in May 1976 to 21 prequalified
contractors, who were invited to bid on all or some of the lots. Bids were
received in September, and their evaluation was completed in November 1976.
A contract was awarded on a combination of lowest bids; the overall figure
was substantially lower thar the consultants' estimates. The appraisal cost
estimates for civil works were based upon bid results.



-4-
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Bids for the civil works were received in September 1976.  The
works were expected to commence in April 1977 and be completed in 38 months
by June 1980.   Because of the delay in Board presentation and extended
delays resulting from complex Senegalese regulations, the contract was not
signed until November 1977.  Work commenced in December 1977 and was com-
pleted after 35 months in November 1980.
3.02      The unusual situation of the main contractor being based in the
port of Dakar itself allowed for a prompt start. The various sections of
work were completed between July and November 1980 and put into use as soon
as completed.  The fishing port opened officially for commercial use on
October 1, 1980.
3.03      The completion of the project within 35 months can be considered
as a very satisfactory achievement. A shortage among local suppliers of the
specialized cement needed forced the contractor to import some 11,500 tons.
However, this did not slow the progress.
3.04      The supervision report dated October 3, 1980 reported the follow-
ing:
(a)  The standard of work is good, and rapid execution has offset the
delay in starting the work on site.
(b)  Following the placing of the hydraulic fill within the quay walls,
cracks developed at three of the corners. This was hardly unex-
pected since the placing of the hydraulic fill exerts considerable
pressure on the inside of the walls to which they had previously
not been subject, and, consequently, some rotation of the wall
about its base will occur. The width of the cracks was not par-
ticularly great -- perhaps two centimeters -- and was made good by
the contractor. No further movement should occur.
(c)  The only point of concern to the mission was the siltation that
had occurred in the newly-created basin and which had been caused
by the material carried into the port by the city drainage in Ca-
nal V. The contractor carried out additional dredging under the
existing rates in the contract and removed an estimated 25,000 cu-
bic meters of material for about 30.0 million CFAF, an amount
included in the project  costs.   It was  estimated that unless
precautions were taken, the port would be faced with an annual
maintenance dredging volume of about 12,000 cubic meters at a unit
cost considerably higher than 1,200 CFAF. It has been agreed that
the port should continue its discussions with the city and the
Public Works Department in the hope of controlling the volume of
material carried into the port. The Ministry of Environment has
intervened as well, and the amount of siltation entering the port
is now controlled.
(d)  Civil Works Supervision.  The mission considered that the work of
the supervision team (the consultants' resident engineer and PAD's
seconded staff) had been excellent, both with regard to the



control of the work on site and, particularly, with regard to the
control of costs and the contractor's claims. The mission agreed
with PAD on the proposed future program for the team, including
the final account preparation and final inspection of the work
after the maintenance period of 12 months.
Cost of Civil Works
3.05      The construction cost of the Fishing Port was kept below esti-
mates. The enclosed table (see Annex 1) taken from the consultant's report
"Rapport d'investigation sur le projet peche," dated July 1982, states that
the cost of civil works was FCFA 4.46 billion, compared to the FCFA 4.70 bil-
lion originally estimated.
3.06      The appraisal cost estimates were
Base Cost:                            FCFA 3,900 million
Contingencies (10%):                         390 million
Cost Escalation (average 22.5%):             878 million
Total                 FCFA 5,168 million
Prices as of August 1976 were
Initial Fixed Price (see para 3.07): FCFA 3,547 million
Contingencies (see para 3.08):               322 million
Cost Escalation (see para 3.09):             586 million
Total                 FCFA 4,455 million
3.07      The  contract  price  for  Lots  1-5  for  the  basic  design  was
FCFA 3,408 million. Variations on structural details during contract nego-
tiations added FCFA 139 million, bringing the cost to FCFA 3,547 million.
The changes were 32% of the foreseen FCFA 440 million allocated for varia-
tions.
3.08      The  contingencies  of  FCFA 322 million  included  payments  of
FCFA 136 million for importing special cement. The balance of FCFA 186 mil-
lion was made up of various other unit prices that changed during construc-
tion.
3.09      The conditions of the contract called for binding bid prices
during the six months after bid submittal -- i.e., from September 1976 to
April 1977. However, bid base prices escalated by FCFA 586 million, or 16%,
during the period between the signature of the contract (November 1977) and
the start of work (December 1977), as the retroactive escalation was calcu-
lated from submittal date -- September 1976 (see para 3.01).
3.10      PAD had to pay an additional FCFA 136 million for importing spe-
cial cement, because the local industry could not provide the contractors
with cement at the rate demanded.



-6-
3.11      Final construction costs, including physical and price contingen-
cies, were 14% belcw appraisal estimates (similar to Loan 493-SE which was
15% below estimates).
3.12      Dredging cost.   PAD started dredging  in  conjunction with  its
synchrolift ship maintenance facility in 1974, costing some FCFA 627 million
(US$2.8 million).   The Identification Report of February 1975  states  in
para 6.26 that only a small proportion of the dredging cost can be attribut-
ed to the ship maintenance facility and that the entire contract cost can be
included in the Fishing Port Project. The staff appraisal report mentions
in para 4.10 the dredging work and its costs.  It is not clear why this
investment was not included in the project cost and considered in the eco-
nomic evaluation.  However, PAD is convinced that the dredging work was
especially needed for the Synchrolift operation and the cost should not be
allocated to the Fishing Port.
Consultants for Supervision
3.13      The delegated resident engineer of the supervision consultants
appointed as supervisory engineer performed very satisfactorily, training
PAD's staff and handling all contractual matters.  The consultant's total
fees were FCFA 106 million (under 3% of civil works costs) compared to
FCFA 180 million estimated during appraisal.
Technical Assistance and Studies
(a) Fishing Port Operations and Planning
3.14      Following the preselection procedures,  a joint venture of two
consulting firms was selected in October 1978 to conduct the operations and
planning for the port.  Because of the delay caused by Government proce-
dures, the consultants did not commence work until June 1980. This delay
was unfortunate because the port began its operations without any guide-
lines.   The budgeted  study cost was  FCFA 135 million,  providing  69 man
months of expert services. The final cost was FCFA 125 million. The re-
sults of the study were adequate even if they did not achieve the full
expected outcomes.
(b) Container Facilities Study
3.15      Following the preselection procedures, PAD selected a joint ven-
ture consulting group to prepare the container facilities study.  Again,
delays in Government approval were encountered, and the study began in
July 1978 rather than in October 1977, the date stated in the appraisal
timetable.  The draft final report was presented in April 1980, the final
report in September 1980, and following the preappraisal mission and the
fast development of container traffic, an update was made in 1983.  It
served as a feasibility study for the present Dakar Container Port Project
(Credit 1459-SE). The extension of the consultants' scope of work to update
the port master plan to include the proposed ICS phosphoric acid plant
increased the actual study time from eight months to two years. Consequent-
ly, the cost of the study for which the appraisal estimate was FCFA 74 mil-
lion (30 i-m) increased, but only slightly, to FCFA 77 million.  CCCE fi-
nanced some of the additional consultants' work.



-7-
(c) Fishing_Sector Study
3.16      The fishing sector study requiring 69 man mo:..thst though included
in the project, was managed and financed by the Government. The financial
arrangement was that the FCFA 98 million (US$0.4 million) cost of the study
was not to be loaned to PAD. The Direction de l'Oceanographie et des Peches
Maritime (DOPM) was nominated as executing agency. Following preselection
procedures, a group of consulting experts were selected to lead the study.
Once again, because of delays caused by slow local procedures, the study was
held up for eight months and did not commence until February 1979.   The
consultants' three-phased report was completed in March 1982. The results
of the study were adequate.
Revised Financing Plan for Project
3.17      During the final stages of project implementation, the financing
plan was changed.  Because of the fall in value of the USdollar and the
consequent decrease in the FCUA value of BADEA's and the Bank's loans, PAD's
share in financing the civil works had increased.
3.18      The following are the changes in the withdrawal of the proceeds
signed on August 4, 1980.

Disbursements (see Annex 2)
3.19      The start up of disbursements was substantially delayed, and
only US$0.54 million, as compared to the US$4.46 million estimated at
appraisal, were disbursed by September 1978 -- i.e., 12%. Disbursements
for civil works increased rapidly after the start of work: by Decem-
ber 1980 some US$5.0 million had been disbursed -- ie., 83% of the
appraisal disbursement estimate of US$6.0 million. The closing date was
extended several times from June 30, 1981 to March 31, 1985 - mainly to
allow for disbursements for the completion of studies in connection with
the container terminal project. An amount of US$364,000 was cancelled.



-8-
Covenants
3.20      Loan 1405-SE was closed after the effective date of Cred-
it 1459-SE. Any conditions not complied with were of a financial or
management nature and were included in the agreements relating to the
new credit (see Appendix A). For details on the financial performance
see Chapter V.
Traffic Data
(a) Fishing Port
3.21      The supervision mission of November 1981 could not collect any
reliable data on the fish catch for 1979 and 1980. The Government's
Statistics Department and Central Computing Department had an 18 month
backlog in compiling data for the Port. In addition, the fishing port
management consultants were late in completing their first assignment,
which included, among others, recommendations for elementary controls to
ensure that vessels disclose fish catch statistics and pay the appropri-
ate user charges.
(b) Port of Dakar
3.22      Port traffic statistics have been prepared regularly by the
harbormaster  department based  on  ships'  tonnage  declarations.   The
reliability jpf the statistics is, however, questionable, as they differ
by some 20% trom data prepared by SEI1POS, the stevedores' organization.
Reporting
3.23      The accuracy of reporting on construction progress was satis-
factory.  However, the accuracy of reporting on port traffic and on
financial matters was not satisfactory, and additional efforts should
have been made to collect that data. The status "l" given to reporting
in the supervision reports, was not adequate.
Performance Ratings
3.24      Only the last supervision report, of December 9, 19p1, assigns
a status "2" to Compliance with Loan Agreements, and since all earlier
reports put it as "1," they are misleading.   Similarly,  the delays
caused by the Commission deq March6s should have been more strongly
highlighted, and stronger action should have been taken.
IV. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
4.01      Before the project, fishing vessels used the northern part of
the western section of Dakar port. However, because of congestion in
that part of the port, fishing vessels also used other berths which were
destined for cargo vessels.  Since the latter had berthing priority,
before the project, the fishing vessels had to move frequently. Various
fishing fleets had repair facilities in the port and attempted to berth
close to these facilities. The scattering of fishing vessels throughout



- 9 -
the port was judged inefficient and detrimental to the industry and to
the overall port management and operation. Furthermore, both Senegal's
industrial fish landings and transshipments, as well as the volume of
other cargo through Dakar Port were anticipated to grow substantially,
which was expected to lead to increasing congestion and losses especial-
ly for the fishing industry because of its lower berthing priority.
This was a principal reason for deciding to build a separate fishing
pier.
4.02      The SAR expected specific benefits from the proposed port
improvements to include:  (a) operational savings to cargo ships using
Dakar Port; (b) increased utilization of fish processing plants; (c) va-
rious other productivity savings for the fishing industry; and (d) in-
creased fuel sales. The SAR found an internal rate of return (IRR) of
23% for the project. However, if only part of the benefits would accrue
to Senegal, it would yield an IRR of 17%.
4.03      The project has undoubtedly had a positive impact in overall
port operations and for the fishing industry, but its benefits are
difficult to quantify because of a general lack of reliable statistical
material at the Port level, compounded by the fact that the small
beneficiary tcompanies do not keep systematic data on productivity,
quality, etc. A PCR mission interviewed Government organizations and
about 15 direct or indirect port users such as canneries, ice plants,
cold storage establishments and fishing fleet operators. The port users
were generally pleased with the convenience of the new port, while some
perceived no real time savings or quality improvements.   Only a few
suggested reduced losses, mainly because of reduced theft.
4.04      Official statistics on fish landings are not reliable, because
of inadequate control in the port and under-declaration of the catch.
However, it is clear that the main changes which were expected, i.e.,
rapid growth of industrial fishing volume, better itilization of exist-
ing plants and ccncentration of the industry near the port, have not
taken place.
4.05      All available information leads to the conclusion that the
project was based on over-optimistic forecasts regarding available fish
resources, the possibility to improve the utilization of fish processing
industries and the competitive position of Senegal vis-a-vis other
African countries.  On the other hand, possibilities to improve port
efficiency were  under-estimated.   Several  owners  of  fishing  fleets
mentioned the advantages of Abidjan due to its more efficient port
laborers and more modern fish processing industry. A specific point was
made regarding the lesser quality of low value fish exported from Dakar
in frozen blocks to Abidjan, compared with competing Russian exports.
Apparently, local fish processing industries and fishing fleets in
Senegal are frequently handicapped by lack of fully effective management
and a shortage of financing  for modernization and  expansion.   The
observation was also made that other fishing ports (e.g., Las Palmas)
are more attractive because of more ready availability of such items as
supplies and spare parts.
4.06      Following is a summary of the benefits as found by the PCR in
accordance with the categories used in the appraisal. In 1967, the Bank



- 10 -
financed the First Dakar Port Project covering improvements to serve a
volume of dry cargo which is about the same as present volumes.  In
1977, the Fishing Pier was financed in large part because of major
concerns that, with increasing fishing traffic and growing volumes of
dry cargo to be handled by the port, congestion would become a problem.
However, volumes of dry cargo in 1982 were still below the target for
which facilities were built in 1967, while, with growing containeriza-
tion, the cargo which can be handled per berth is increasing.
4.07      Before the project, there were no comprehensive records of
fishing boat arrivals or days in port. Present record keeping is still
rather limited. As a result, increases in port utilization cannot be
quantified in terms of ship arrivals or ship days.  Therefore, fish
landings may be the only indication of port utilization by fishing
vessels.  According to the SAR, in 1974,  108,000 tons of fish were
landed in the port. Without the project, the quantity of fish landed
was expected to increase to 169,000 tons by 1983 and 185,000 tons by
1987, while with the project the forecast was for 207,000 tons by 1980,
282,000 tons by 1983 and 340,000 tons by 1987. Actual 1982 fish land-
ings in the fishing port were 100,000-120,000 tons (statistics differ
according to the source; there are no indications of major changes in
the last few years). The reasons given in para 4.05 above account for
the lack of growth. This is further borne out by continuing delays in
establishing a major fish processing industry in the port itself, which
was to be a joint venture between Senegalese and foreign interests. The
new company was to run an integrated operation, owning a fishing fleet
and a fish processing plant handling large volumes of the less valuable
pelagic species (sardinellas, etc.). The production was to be exported
in frozen blocks to other African countries. However, there is severe
competition in this field from Russian fishing ships which complete the
entire operation in open sea and apparently at low cost. Implementation
of this joint venture project is likely to start only in late 1986.
Should this be successfully achieved, the perceived benefits of the
project would increase.
4.08      The observations in the previous two paragraphs led to the
conclusion that requirements for berthing space at Dakar port for both
cargo and fishing vessels, have not increased since the project was
appraised, while, at least for general cargo handling, efficiency is
increasing because of better handling and organization. No substantial
growth of traffic through the port is expected during the next few
years, by which time Dakar's container terminal, now under construction,
will be fully operational leaving the rest of the port with substantial
spare capacity. The appraisal for the Fishing Port Project anticipated
operational savings for cargo ships to be 20% of total project benefits
accruing to Senegal in 1980 and growing to 45% by 1987.  Since there
would not have been port congestion without the project, these benefits
so far have not materialized.
4.09      Another major flow of benefits for Senegal was to be derived
by increasing utilization of processing plants from the 50% at the start
of the project. The appraisal estimated these benefits at about 50% of
total benefits for 1980, decreasing to about 25% of the total for 1987.
The PCR mission found that little has changed in the industry. Statis-
tics on number and capacity of processing plants were not available, but



- 11 -
it appears that some industries stopped operating, while a few new ones
started. According to sample data, plant utilization is still about 50%
on average with peak months' utilization staying well below 100%.  It
should also be noted that the 90% increase in fish landings without the
project which was forecast in the SAR would have used up the excess
plant capacity, allowing for seasonal fluctuations. A major improvement
has been achieved, nevertheless, with the construction of a modern ice
factory in the fishing port.
4.10      Other benefits  from  the project  accruing  to Senegal were
estimated in the SAR to amount to about 20% of the total pro4ect bene-
fits for Senegal.   They consisted of (a) savings in fish losses and
damage; (b) savings in handling cost; (c) freezer ship time savings; and
(d) additional  fishing  fleet  production.   The  expectation  that  the
project would result in savings in fish losses, damage and handling cost
seemed reasonable.  In an appraisal an estimate can be made but after
completion,  the savings have  to be measured.   Attempts  to do this
resulted in only vague answers because of a lack of basic data, but the
general view was that savings were not important, because dock labor
remained inefficient, and most of the processing plants are still at the
same distance from the port.
4.11      Whether benefits from reduced port time by freezer ships were
realistic remains to be seen, because these ships seem to already
receive adequate docking priority. Additional fishing fleet production
would only be achieved if exchange crews were used because the time in
port is usually not determined by the speed of unloading and loading,
but by the need for the crew to rest and time required for repairs.
Finally, the SAR expected about 5% of the project benefits to result
from additional fuel sales.  As fishing activity did not perceptibly
change, these benefits would not have been realized.
4.12      Based on the foregoing analysis, the PCR has to conclude that
the benefits of the project are very limited.   Quantification would
require an elaborate study, but would in any event be hampered by a lack
of base data. Therefore, it is not possible to re-quantify the economic
return and only estimate that it will be substantially below appraisal
estimates,since the major benefits (para 4.08) will not be realized.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
General
5.01      PAD's financial performance is summarized in Tables 1 and 3.
Generally speaking, slow revenue growth in the period from 1976 to 1981
caused some concern as to the ability of the Port to generate adequate
returns on its fixed asset  base.   Although the Port was revising
tariffs according to the rate of return targets specified by the Pro-
ject, delays in the revaluation of the fixed asset base and inadequacies
in the fixed asset accounting records resulted in lower than satisfacto-
ry increases. Starting in 1982, revenue growth was strengthened by rate
increases instituted in preparation for the Container Terminal Project.
Overall, PAD's net income remained below expectations, taking into



- 12 -
account the retroactive adjustments for insufficient depreciation and
interest introduced in the 1982/83 and 1983/84 statements.  If PAD's
potential tax liability (which is currently the subject of negotiations)
do indeed materialize, the net results would probably be negative for
several years (see paras 5.07 and 5.13).  Equally important for the
financial performance of the Port has been the lack of control exercised
by the PAD over its own cash flow. Under the pooling arrangement of the
Senegalese Treasury, revenues from entities with substantial positive
cash flows are used to provide funds for the operation of other, weaker
enterprises.   The effect of this policy is to severely limit PAD's
ability to renew its fixed asset base and spend for its maintenance of
port facilities, being subject to a priori controls over all expendi-
tures. Attempts to gain greater discretionary power and greater finan-
cial autonomy during the course of the Project met with limited success.
5.02      As outlined in the estimated income statements for fishing
activities in Table 2, during the period of the Project, net income
attributable to fishing has generally been positive, although slightly
less than projected. Revenues showed good development, but remained on
the average 15% below expectation during the 1976-84 period; related
expenses were considerably less than projected, largely due to the fact
that projected administrative structures were not created. Contribution
of the Project to this situation is hard to evaluate, however, as few of
the institutional/industrial elements of the fishing port were realized.
The fishing-related cash flow would appear adequate to finance the
capital investment. However, as with the Port as a whole, it is unlike-
ly that internal funds will be set aside for the maintenance and renewal
of Project assets.
Revenues
5.03      PAD's revenues during the period of the Project were influ-
enced by a number of factors. Tariff increases were applied during the
period to respond to the Bank's targets for returns on net fixed assets.
These increases were generally rather small and had little or no effect
on the demands for the use of port facilities.  Because assets were
never revalued, these increases remained rather small until 1982/83,
when larger percentage increases were agreed upon in preparation for the
Container Terminal Project.
5.04      Underlying traffic patterns reflect a long-term reduction in
ship movements since 1970, which was reversed for a brief time in 1977
and 1978 by transshipment of Nigerian petroleum products related to
logistics problems at the Port of Lagos.  From 1978 to 1981, tariff
increases were only enough to keep revenue stable as drought and revenue
restrictions brought about a reduction in traffic. Starting in 1982,
general  cargo,  increasingly  containerized,  registered  significant
increases.   The combined effect of a change in cargo mix to higher
tariff items and more significant across the board increases brought
about annual revenue increases from 16 to 20% between 1982 and 1984.
5.05      Fishing related revenues have shown considerable growth since
1979, particularly in fish landings. Though this category is somewhat
volatile and subject to sudden swings, the general trend has been an
increase of between 200 and 300% between 1978 and 1984.  In 1983/84,



- 13 -
total fishing related revenues reached CFAF 894 m, about 17% of PAD's
total revenues, instead of 12% average during the 1976-79 period. The
institution of a six-category tariff structure in 1982/83 has aided in
differentiating higher-value  fish.   Revenue  from port  services  has
approximately doubled from 1978 levels to 1984. Though these develop-
ments are positive, there is some indication that the receivables
related to these revenues are very difficult to collect, partly due to
their dispersion and partly due to the political influence of small
fishing interests. Spot checks during the PCR mission indicated discre-
pancies between fish landing statistics and their related revenues. It
is likely that some percentage of fish landings do not generate revenue
for the port.
Expenses
5.06      Worthy of note under the heading of expenses were the substan-
tial increases in salaries between 1981/82 and 1982/83.  The overall
effect was an increase of about 30% and was mandated by the Government
in most of the public sector at this time.  Other expenditures have
increased at a somewhat less dramatic rate, particularly maintenance
expenditures which are generally admitted to be too low. A number of
major adjustments were made to the PAD accounts in 1982/83.   These
adjustments reflected the inadequate depreciation charges of prior
years, and the failure tu recognize the retrocession of IBRD and BAD
loans at higher rates of interest. They totalled approximately 2 bil-
lion CFAF.   In 1983/84 adjustments were made to reflect additional
interest expense related to retrocession and an estimated income tax
liability  of CFAF 1,500 million.   In  the June 30, 1985  statements,
further adjustments were made for interest charges and foreign exchange
losses and additional provisions for taxes and depreciation pertaining
to the previous years, whereby the net results for 1984/85 became a net
loss of CFAF 69 million.  It is possible that additional unrecognized
tax liabilities will be found related to the Project period. This is,
however, in contradiction with the agreement and side letters at the
time of appraisal whereby it was foreseen that PAD was to be exempted
from income tax until completion of the project.
Balance Sheet - Current Assets
5.07      Net current assets (see Table 3) have been somewhat larger
than estimated at project appraisal, but the current ratio has remained
consistently less than projected (about 4.5 as opposed to a projection
of between 9 and 12) showing marked deterioration in 1982/83 avd 1983/84
as a result of accounting adjustments to reflect prior period deprecia-
tion, interest and tax expenses (para 5.06).  On the balance sheet,
these amounts were reflected as deferred charges (a long-term capital-
ized expense to be written off over a number of years) and a correspond-
ing accrued liability. Because the liability was shown as current, it
represented by itself a CFAF 2,520 million deterioration in net current
assets.   If this amount had been spread back over the years of the
Project (which gave rise to about CFAF 2,250 m of it), it would have
produced about CFAF 280 million of reduction in recorded income over
each of the eight years of the Project period.



- 14 -
5.08      More disturbing than the above in terms of asset quality and
the ability of PAD to manage its working capital, has been the low
turnover of receivables which rose to about 90% of annual revenues in
1980/81  (see Table 4).   PAD's  auditors  and  Bank  supervision  teams
exerted considerable pressure to improve this situation, and receivables
had reached about 55% of annual revenues by 1984. The goal of reducing
receivables to 25% of annual revenues was not realistic given the
quantity of slow-paying Government agencies and the inadequate level of
credit account  supervision  and  follow-up  that existed.   A covenant
requiring further progress in this area has been included in the Con-
tainer Terminal Project Agreement.
5.09      Three general trends in the structure of Accounts Receivables
bear mention:
(a) The percentage of receivables represented by the twenty
largest private clients has declined continuously from a high
of 71% in 1977/78 to a low of 44% in 1983/84 as is shown in
Table 4. A review of the aging of these receivables over time
has revealed a considerable improvement since 1980/81, which
indicates improved follow-up on these major accounts.
(b) From 22% in 1977/78, Government-related receivables rose to a
high of 32% of total receivables in 1981/82. In 1984, this
percentage had dropped again to 21% representing a healthier
level.
(c) Smaller "miscellaneous" clients represented only 4% in 1977/78
and represented approximately 25% of total accounts receiv-
ables in 1984. These customers are considerably less cred-
it-worthy and require careful management and follow-up.
Continued improvement in the account management function
should obviously be an objective for future projects.
5.10      Services rendered by PAD in assuming responsibility for the
maintenance of Senegal's aids to navigation and the Dakar-Goree ferry
appear in the regular accounts only under miscellaneous receivables
(representing cumulated balance-expenses in revenues and subsidies from
the state). Receivables for these services approached 1 billion CFAF in
1983/84, and were the subject of special conditions in the Terminal
Container Project.
Fixed Assets
5.11      Adjustments to fixed assets and depreciation made in 1982/83
reflected long-standing problems in accounting methods and record
keeping, but maintained the principle of keeping PAD's asset base at
historical cost. Attempts to revalue assets and arrive at depreciation
charges reflecting something closer to replacement cost have not been
successful.
Financial Situation
5.12      Calculation of return on net fixed assets in use presents a
number of problems, one of which is the relatively low valuation of the



- 15 -
asset base due to calculation of historical cost. However, 45% of the
t'tal net fixed asset value of the Port was added during the period of
the Project, so that distortion after 1979/80 due to this factor was
less.
5.13      A more serious distortion is represented by the effects of the
1982/83 and 1983/84 adjustments for insufficient depreciation, interest,
and tax expenses charged in previous years. It is difficult to correct
for these adjustments retroactively because there is no indication of
the portion of additional depreciation expense related to this period
nor is it possible to state definitively what the final tax impact would
be. PAD's provision is only an accounting estimate, and a real figure
will only be possible after negotiations currently in process with the
tax authorities.   However,  it is perhaps reasonable,  keeping these
factors in mind, to reduce return percentages in Table 1 by two-thirds
through 1981/82 and three-fourths for 1982/83 and 1983/84.
5.14      Despite  the  relatively poor  return on net  fixed assets,
however, PAD's financial position remained basically sound, with a low
debt/equity ratio and adequate interest coverage (Tables 1 and 3).
Financial Organization and Management
5.15      During the period of project execution, it became evident that
PAD had considerable weakness in the area of general and financial
management. Lack of a coordinated and dynamic structure was aggravated
by a lack of financial autonomy and the paralyzing effects of the
Treasury pooling concept.  These problems were not addressed directly
under the project, but actions In the area of tariff studies, audits and
technical assistance in analytical accounting served to gather a sub-
stantial amount of information. This information was put to use in the
elaboration of the Container Terminal Project, in which the majority of
these issues were addressed directly.
VI.  INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01      Delays in loan effectiveness and in award of various contracts
was primarily because of very time-consuming Government procedures (see
paras 3.14, 3.15 and 3.16).  Some of the delays in starting technical
assistance work could have been avoided if PAD had been more active.
The improvement of management has been included in the follow-up Con-
tainer Terminal Project.
6.02      PAD remains a relatively weak institution because of an acute
shortage of fully skilled and experienced top cadre. This problem has
not always been fully recognized, probably because, even without tight
management control, the port functioned reasonably well since it had
ample capacity while traffic grew very little. Maintenance of the port
facilities has not been fully adequate which can only be partially
blamed on shortages of funds.
6.03      Financial management is particularly weak and several cove-
nants, being the responsibility of either the Government or PAD, have



- 16 -
not been fulfilled. Measures agreed on during negotiations that the
Government would allow PAD a fuller degree of financial autonomy were
not fully implemented, and the Government made little effort to improve
PAD's financial management. PAD itself failed to fully adhere to the
agreed financial covenants as is evident from the previous chapter. The
follow-up project -- Dakar Container Terminal -- includes, therefore,
substantial technical assistance in the fields of general and financial
managements.
VII. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The role of the Bank in the appraisal and execution of the
project might have been more effective.   General cargo growth,  and
thereby future port congestion, was exaggerated by choosing an unusually
low base year for the appraisal. Little attention was paid to increas-
ing port efficiency before seeking to justify a new investment. Fur-
thermore, the growth potential of the fishing industry was overestimat-
ed, it seems amongst others, by considering the fishing port as a unique
venture, rather than as one of many fishing ports competing for the same
catch (e.g., Nouadhibou, Las Palmas, Cape Verde, Abidjan, Pointe Noire,
etc.).
7.02      The project seems to have achieved very little in institution
strengthening.   Considerable efforts are now  jnderway by the Bank's
Regional Office for West Africa to assist PAD in developing better
management and proper management systems. In spite of eight financial
supervisions, only very limited progress was made on proper implementa-
tion of financial covenants and establishing adequate financial manage-
ment in PAD.

DAKAR FISHING PORT PROJECT, LOAN 1405-SE
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Comments from Tables 1 - 3
1/   Total amount is 1,003. No breakdown available.
2/   This amount represents:
(a) adjustments to interest expense from prior periods which was
understated through failure to reflect properly terms of
retrocession of loans under the Fishing Port Project.  Total
value 250 million CFAF.
(b) adjustments to accumulated depreciation based on a review of
fixed assets and depreciation. Total value 1,742 million
CFAF.
3/   Original projections for the Fishing Port Project assumed exonera-
tion from income taxes (approximately 33X) through 1981. It
appears that this exoneration was not in fact effective during this
period. Figures shown as actual for the period 1977 to 1982 are
those estimated by PAD and included in the Container Terminal SAR
of March 29, 1984. The current status of taxes due the Government
by PAD remains in some doubt, even with the provision for back
taxes mentioned in 4/ below. It appears that PAD may be liable for
certain value added-taxes whose amount cannot yet be estimated.
4/   This amount represents (a) additional adjustment to interest
expense from prior periods (see 2/ above) in the amount of 328 mil-
lion CFAF; and (b) an estimate of income and other tax expense
which was unrecognized or improperly calculated in previous years
in the amount of 1,501 million CFAF. This figure is only an
accounting estimate and does not represent any agreement as to the
sums in question with the Government tax authorities. See 3/ for
futther comments on the tax situation of PAD.
5/   See 2/ above.  This figure includes recognition of an asset related
to the adjustment.
6/   See 4/ above.  This figure includes recognition of an asset related
to the adjustment.

Dear Sir:
Subject: Dakar Fishing Port Proiect. Loan 1405-SE
Please find attached the observations made by the Ministry of
Infrastructure on the preliminary version of the Project Completion Report in
this matter. I should be obliged if you would kindly pass them on to the
Western Africa Region Operations Evaluation Department so that they may be
taken into account when the final version is being drawn up.

Observations on Prolect Completion Report
Dakar Fishing Port Project. Loan 1405-SE
PAGE iv
Paragraph 2:
Since the problem in the port of Dakar was not really one of length
of wharf but rather of dock surface area, and since the fishing fleet
currently based in Dakar consists of approximately 240 trawlers (10 of them
large), lack of the fishing port would make efficient operation of;the general
cargo port virtually impossible, while overall operation of the port would be
greatly disturbed, despite a growing rate of containerization, without the
container terminal.
Paragraph, 3(c) and 3(e):
The delays referred to were not caused by the Commission nationale
des contrats de Z'administration, but by the applicable Regulations, which
are not always geared to procedures typical of the private sector.
PAGE 6
Paragraph 3.12:
The 1974 dredging operations, in the access channels to the
Synchrolift and the north and south fishing wharves, would have been carried
out even without the fishing port project, so there appears to be no reason
why their cost would have been included in the appraisal figures.
PAGE 12
Paragraph 5.01:
During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1985, arrears on debt
interest, exchange differentials, and taxes and depreciation, sustained in
previous fiscal years, were adjusted.
Posting of these various operations to FY1984/85 alone produced a
net negative result of CFAF 69 million. The net result will become positive
in the following period, FY1985/86.
