saline land
4.4 Hydrogeology:
Tie project area is mainly tocated in Chaigma altusial fan  and
Shiyoc allwviaL fan . Depth of. underground  water  bearing  strLtum   i a
Changma irrigation  District  is  100-ZOOm.    In  Shuangta  Irrigation
District drpth of underground water  bearing stratum is 20--4O  m; . i n
general water table of pressure va%ir is less  tian  51  .'  In  Huahai
Irrigation District depth  of  underground  water  bearing  stratum   is
comparativeLy tbin, with multiple confining stratum  , intergroand water
table Is 5-I5m.
Underground water  recharge  are  mainly  river  course
infiltration(accounting for 5Q% of tie totaL ),    caital  infiltration
(accounting for 23.3% of the total )and field infiltration(l5   of  tbe
totai)in seouencA.Main consumption in sequence: are evaparaton and
trarnspirai oncaccounting for 59.1% of the total), spring  atter overflow
(25.71 of the total )and exploitation through mecianicaL wells (4.2% of
the  tta).
Underground water quaLi-ty: In most  part  of  Claugma  Irrigati o-
Dis.trct , in the upstrzam  area  of  Stuangta  and  Huahai  Irrigation
*        Dist.ricts, water  quality  of  cain  water  bearing  stratum  can  meet
irrigation demand; but in  otier  areas  water  is  nolt  suitable   ror

5.Environment impact & counter measures:
541 Adverse environment impact:
5.1.1 Impact on SbuangtajReservoir by Leaching drainage :
there are 14 k ha of reclaimable satined land in Tiduntang
-Hutunji , salt remonal area islZ.5 k ha , content of  salt    removed
for i m depth soiL  is 2061.1 4 kg . Harnessing method is that  dividing
ep the Land and gredually reaDving salt year by'-year . After Leaching,
.be water wiLL be drained into Shuangta Reservoir through th emain salt
drainage ditches . This will cause increase of  mineral  contents   of
the reservoir water
Ln terms of the 2 plans, that is 10 years  and  Ii  years  salt
eemoval duration for calculation: mineralization of Shuangta  Reservoir
is Z.0 3/1 and 1.5 gil respectively   both index  can  meet  demand  o r
irrigation standard
For the sake of safety , to guard against 'inconformity  between
th euensured prediction results and reality , in the period of Leaching
for salt removaL (ingenerat it  is  arranged  in  July  , - August  and
September , about 3 months  )water   inflow  and  outfLow  of  Shuangta
Reservoir wiLl be monitored. If the monitored index can not meet demand



or irrigation standard lecahing for salt removal wilt be 'postpond - a 
Tic best solution is to choose anotber1plece  of  reclaimablt  landt"
instead of  reclaiming  salined  Land  in  tb  eupstream  o  fShuangta
Reservoir. It Is quite'possible to choose-anothir piece of  reclimabl-ce.
Land In the project area and  not  to  reclaim  sa  lined  Land  In  th b
epstream area o fSHuangtn Reservoir as a final and thorough solution.l
5.1.Z Afrect on Shlyou liver water quality by oll Industrial pollution:    -
*                Shiyou River is originated from  Qilian: ;ountains;    its  water-
sources are melted snow , glaciers and rainfall supply; :water  qua' .lty .
of its upstream is very good , and yt can  meet  standards- of  surface 
water Grade I and Grade II. The river travels througb Ynmen City  wbere                   :
oiL iadustrial waste water  were  drained  into  the  river  and  water
quality was deteriorated. Contents o foil , volatile phenot , BODS  and
merdury etc in the river water all  exceed  the  standard  of  Grade   V
surface water.
Sbiyou River runs into gobi desert downstream , due  to  open   &
wide ruver bed, witb small flood, all  ruver water  infiltrates   into
ground ;   only  'With  large  flood  river  current  canrun  to  Chil in
downstreao tlrough old river bed , then water enters-Czijitn Reservoir
Although old river bed , then water enters Cbijin Reservoir,.   Although
water qulity is improved  through  underground  gravel  fittration  the-
water still affects irrigation and fishery in downstream
Tb-iuugb recent years harnessing on tb emain  pollution  sources
(such as Ll extraction factories ,   oil  refining  plants  and  power
stalions , accounting for 98% of the total, equivatentpoltuLtion  Load
of SHiyou River ), from 1993--1991   water  quality  was  significantLy
rurning better .Gansu proviLce stiptlated " Harnessing plan onpitlution
of Shiyou liver ". If the plan can be  tIoroughty  impleiseuted  in  the
year of 1998 water quality of Sbiyou River will be completeLy improved
. Yumen City downstream area can meet function requirement  of  aurface
water quality of Sbiyou River . Because through Shiyou  River  feeder
canal 51 million o3 water rrom  Shute  River  will  be  transferred  to
Shiyou River running into Chijin Reservoir pollotion  cotcetration  can
be diluted to makc water quality improved.

accumulative drop is 6.38  ;in Simi lar- acas water. table al-soiv: L. d rop
to some extent.
In Irrigation areas to where river water Is conveyed .watertalbe wilL 
rise to small extent comparing witb present silnatlon.Fof Example,water
table  inn' `ie areas along the Now west- main. canal  wil.   approxinmately
rlse O.9--Z.1 a in average.
In Shuangta Irrigation District ,water,tahLe in:'the are'as along Shale t                 ' .
River wilt drop 1.7 m in average.Due to irrigation retain ::watsr,water
table in the areas along the feeder canal will rise I.0--Z.5    '               rin
average.
In Huabai Irrigation District,in 10 years acdcumuLative drop of  ur4er
table is less tha I m.
b. in the project operation period ,underground  water  quality  also
-wilL be affected.For exampte,due to affect by canal svstem recbarge, in
some parts  of  Chaigma  Irrigation  District,from:  Jiun- to  August t
,aineralization  of  underground   water   is   decreased,thereafter
mineraLization will graduatty tend to rise.
inSiuangta Irrigation District.water allatization of some sections  i a
the east of Anxi Counts Town-wilL turn better.Ylineralizatifon   of  nirt
wat.er bearing stratum of sou-thern areas in southern aeas in Anxi County
To'wn .ends to satinization.Simitlar probLems will probabLy occur in  t h e
areas along Shule River.
c. Counter measures: Local areas ,where water table  drops  so  great
that growth of terrestrial biota is affected  to  possibly  cause  soil
desertificatiot,will be artificially recharged.lnpartial  'areas,wbere
water table rises to probably  cause  soil  salinity  and  salt  marsh
,drainage and irrigaton-througih wells wiltI  be  applied- by  means   of
