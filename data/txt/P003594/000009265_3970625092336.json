The\n            objectives of this environmental impact assessment are to:\n            ensure the efficient utilization of water, soil, light and\n            heat resources in the watershed; assist the resettlements of\n            immigrants from the middle and southern parts of Gansu\n            Province; and to monitor the environmental hazards in the\n            early stage of the project construction.  The assessment\n            identifies the following environmental impacts: soil\n            waterclogging, salinization, land desertification,\n            vegetation damage, and land submersion. In addition, the\n            study reviews the effects of the project on: resettlement\n            environment capacity, human health, water resource\n            utilization, and surface water quality."}, "docdt": "1995-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
