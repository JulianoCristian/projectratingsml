                                    F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives

The objectives of the project were: (a) to alleviate poverty of some 200,000 poor farmers from the
resource-poor areas of central and south-east Gansu Province by emigrating and settling on newly
developed irrigated land in the Hexi Corridor; (b) to increase agricultural production in Gansu
Province, especially in food grains and commodity crops; and (c) to protect and restore degraded
environments.

The project focused on the development of new irrigated lands and improvement of water
facilities for existing irrigated land to improve the livelihoods of resettling people who, at
appraisal, lived in dire poverty in the poorest counties of Gansu Province. The project area in the
Shule Basin is part of the Gobi Desert. It is very arid and windy, with naturally saline soil
conditions; the development and the sustainability of irrigation, land reclamation, soil leaching
and forest windbreak establishment are essential for agricultural production and resettlement.

Revised Project Development Objectives

The project had changes in scope which were recorded in the revised Legal Agreements in 2004.
However, the original project development objectives were not revised. The major revisions
were a reduction in the number of voluntary resettlers from 200,000 to 75,000 and a reduction in
the area of land to be reclaimed from 54,610 ha to 27,213 ha.

                 The Value Achieved was 118.3 percent of the SAR target and 101.1 percent of MTR target.
Comments         The project total per capita net income is weighted by the number of resettlers in the three
                 irrigation districts (Changma, Shuangta, Huahai).


Indicator 2       Changes in food grain production (tons)
Value             Project total: 7,200    Project total: 215,100 Project total: 120,300 Project total: 108,000
Date              September 22, 1995 June 30, 2006                 December 31, 2006      December 31, 2006
                 The Value Achieved was 50.2 percent of the SAR target and 89.8 percent of MTR target.

Comments         The unmet targets of food grain production, set at appraisal and MTR, do not necessarily
                 imply negative result but reflect the shift from production of food grains to production of
                 higher-value cash-income crops (see Indicator 3).

Indicator 3       Gross agricultural output (million RMB)
Value             Project total: 740      Project total: 1,989     Project total: 1,475   Project total: 1,957
Date              September 22, 1995 June 30, 2006                 December 31, 2006      December 31, 2006
                 The Value Achieved was 98.4 percent of the SAR target and 132.7 percent of MTR target.
                 The values of gross agricultural output are reported in nominal prices. Farm-gate prices at
                 completion did not differ greatly from those at appraisal, implying that real prices (if
Comments         adjusted for inflation) were even lower. Food prices declined as a result of China's WTO
                 accession in 2001, but began rising in 2003 as a result of an increase in world market prices
                 and in domestic demand. At the same time, the newly-reclaimed irrigated area at
                 completion was half of appraisal estimate (see Intermediate Outcome 4).




1The second MTR (in 2003) set revised targets for the Key Performance Indicators associated with the Project
Development Objectives and the Intermediate Outcomes; these are included here. The Intermediate Outcome
Indicators #3 and #4 were formally revised through a letter of amendment dated November 12, 2004 and counter-
signed on November 17, 2004.

            The original target value of 1.57 is not comparable with the actual result. The original
Comments    target was based on 98,200 ha of rehabilitated and new irrigated lands. At completion, the
            total irrigated area was 70,400 ha and, if recalculated, the original target would have been
            about 0.8. Note that the typical cost recovery ratio in Gansu province is reported at 0.6-0.7.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1    This project was one of a series of Bank-assisted poverty reduction projects in China
supporting the government's Ninth Five-Year Plan. The project aimed to promote the Bank's
overall goal of poverty reduction as articulated in the 1997 report "Rural Development from
Vision to Action" in which China was identified as one of the focal countries.

1.1.2    The project was designed to be consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of
19951 that supported income-generation programs in lagging regions, upgrading of marginal
agricultural lands, major water storage, and irrigation and drainage development. At the time of
project preparation, the voluntary resettlement of poor households from resource-poor to
relatively resource-rich areas was considered to be an important element to reduce absolute
poverty and prevent further environment degradation. This was also in line with the Poverty
Reduction Strategy jointly developed by the government and the Bank in the 1990s.

1.1.3    The rationale of Bank support for the project was that: (a) the Bank had significant
experience in addressing poverty in China in the most difficult environments; (b) the Bank sought
to develop a prototype large-scale settlement project integrated with irrigated agriculture for
future scaling-up; (c) enhanced knowledge transfer would occur during project preparation and
implementation; (d) the Bank's involvement would improve project implementation and induce
institutional reforms in the management of natural resources; and (e) the Bank's assistance would
leverage additional domestic resources for poor project counties.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

1.2.1    The project development objectives (PDOs) were: (a) to alleviate poverty of some
200,000 poor farmers from the resource-poor areas of central and south-east Gansu Province by
emigrating and settling on newly developed irrigated land in Hexi Corridor; (b) to increase
agricultural production in Gansu, especially in food grains and commodity crops; and (c) to
protect and restore degraded environments.

1.2.2    The project focused on the development of new irrigated lands and the improvement of
facilities for existing irrigated land to improve the livelihoods of resettling people who lived in
dire poverty in the poorest, mountainous counties of Gansu Province. The project area in the
Shule River Basin, part of Gobi Desert, is very arid and windy with naturally saline soil
conditions, thus the development of irrigation, land reclamation, soil leaching and forest
windbreak establishment were considered to be essential for the sustainability of the resettlement
and agricultural production.

1.2.3    The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor the achievement of the PDOs were

environment protection) and included, among others: (a) changes in per capita income; (b) total

production of grain and cash crops; (c) per capita grain production; (d) distribution system

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.3.1    The original PDOs were not revised, but in 2004 the project had changes in scope which
were recorded in amendments to the Legal Agreements. The main changes included a reduction
in the number of immigrant farmers (from 200,000 to 75,000) and a corresponding reduction in
the area of land reclamation (from 54,610 ha to 27,213 ha).

1.3.2   The project was intended to address complex issues related to water resources and land
development under challenging environmental conditions. In addition, it involved the creation of
new administrative areas (townships) and moving 200,000 people to new and difficult conditions.
For these reasons, the Borrower originally proposed a project implementation period of twelve
years. In view of the rapidly changing economy and implementation conditions in China, the
Bank did not consider such a long project implementation period to be advisable and in a
compromise an implementation period of ten years (already unusually long by the Bank's
standards) was agreed upon. At the time, the Bank did not have alternative lending instruments
that could accommodate phased project implementation. Instead, in the legal agreements it was
agreed that a two-stage Mid-Term Review (MTR) would be used to adjust the project.

1.3.3   By the time of the first stage of the MTR, a number of serious design flaws had surfaced
and a severe shortfall in counterpart funding had had a negative impact on project implementation.
The two-stage MTR (2000 and 2003) was used to mitigate the design shortcomings (described in
Section 2.1) and issues that arose during implementation (described in Section 2.2).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1   At the time of project preparation, the average per capita rural income of the project area
significantly exceeded the average for Gansu Province and even more so for the eleven intended
emigration ("move-out") counties located in central and south-eastern Gansu. Most households
in the move-out areas lived in absolute poverty with per capita annual income below RMB300
caused by the poor resource base, a deteriorating environment and increasing population pressure.
The project intended to resettle 200,000 people to the relatively resource-rich Yumen City,
Guozhou County (formerly Anxi County) and selected state farms in the northern Hexi Corridor.
The intended target population included a large number of ethnic minorities living in Yongjing,
Jishishan and Lixian counties of eastern Gansu.

1.4.2   During the MTR process, the scope of the resettlement was reduced to 75,000 people (see
Sections 1.6 and 2.1 below). The actual number of resettlers at the time of completion was
75,378. These included 62,000 people directly moved by the project (37,908 people to Changma
Irrigation District (ID), 9,419 people to Shuangta ID and 14,673 people to Huahai ID) and 13,378
"self-moved" people under the local authorities' permission (for which residential identification
cards - hukou ­ were issued). The self-moved people came from 43 national/provincial level
poverty counties in Gansu and included more than 7,000 people from the project's original eleven
move-out counties. Their relocation to the Hexi Corridor was mainly stimulated by the
infrastructure and income-generating opportunities created by the project.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1    There were seven components in the project as designed in the PAD. The costs shown
below included provisions for price and physical contingencies. The components were:

(a) the Changma Dam (US$41.25 million) on the Shule River was designed to provide storage of
about 194 million m3 of water for irrigation. The design required 131 families (566 people) to be
involuntarily resettled from the reservoir site and 172 ha of cultivated land acquired.

(b) Irrigation and Drainage (US$143.30 million) to improve irrigation facilities for an existing
area of 43,300 ha and to develop 54,600 ha of new irrigated land in three irrigation districts.

(c) Agriculture Support (US$3.37 million) for agricultural machinery, seed production and
processing, extension and research.

(d) Livestock Development (US$2.86 million) for improvement and establishment of a livestock
extension network, the supply and production of improved livestock, fodder production and feed
processing, and credit for livestock production activities.

(e) Environmental Protection and Management (US$10.33 million) for afforestation (forestry
development) and for soil and water conservation activities.

(f) Voluntary Emigration and Land Settlement (US$44.51 million) for 200,000 immigrant
farmers to newly developed irrigated land in 16 new townships and 160 villages.

(g) Institutional Strengthening and Support (US$14.61 million) through the provision of
training, technical assistance, equipment, vehicles and essential facilities.

1.5.2    The construction of the Changma Dam and the irrigation facilities provided the basis for
agricultural development and income generation for the resettlers in the existing and newly-
reclaimed irrigated areas. The project set the institutional arrangements and financed the
capacity-building activities to ensure a high distributional efficiency of the irrigation system and
the cost recovery of operating and maintenance expenses (O&M). The Voluntary Emigration and
Land Settlement component enabled the resettlement and the preparation of agricultural land for
resettlers. At the same time, the Agricultural Support and the Livestock Development
components helped the resettled farmers to produce new crops and livestock, mainly through
training and extension services and also through a "one-time" provision of agricultural inputs.
Finally, the Environment Protection and Management component encouraged afforestation in
support of environmentally sustainable development.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1    The original components were revised through the MTR process and recorded in the
Amendments of the Development Credit Agreement due to significant changes in project scope.
The main changes included a reduction in the number of immigrant farmers from 200,000 to
75,000 and a corresponding reduction in the area of land reclamation from 54,610 ha to 27,213
ha.2




2The scale of the original components was adjusted twice. During the MTR in FY2000, it was agreed to reduce the
number of resettlers from 200,000 to 95,000. During the second MTR in FY2003, the decision was made to reduce the
number of resettlers to 75,000.



                                                         3

1.6.2    Other project activities were also revised accordingly, including the construction of
canals and on-farm works, land improvement, agricultural, forestry and livestock development
activities related to the settlers, the establishment of new townships, villages, schools, hospital
and clinics, etc. In addition, the MTR included the government's policy decision not to finance
commercial seed-processing companies, commercial livestock-breeding farms, and commercial
forestry farms, and to reduce agricultural equipment purchases (farmers financed this themselves
with direct government subsidies). The number of project components remained unchanged but
their scale and financing amounts were altered. The major changes are presented below:

(a) Irrigation and Drainage: There was a reduction in: (i) the area of land reclamation and on-
farm works from 54,610 ha to 27,213 ha; (ii) the total length of branch canals from 952.6 km to
340.9 km; (iii) the length of branch drainage canals from 412.3 km to 116 km; and (iv) the
quantity of roads, power transmission and communication lines, and other related small facilities.
Funds were reallocated to finance two small hydro-electric power stations on the main canals and
to establish farmer water users' associations (WUAs) in the irrigation districts.

(b) Agricultural Support: There was a reduction in number of technical extension stations at
the township level (from 16 to 6) and in the purchase of agricultural machinery (from 304 sets to
57). Funds were reallocated to add an extension station in one of the state farms and to cover for
additional soil desalinization measures on demonstration areas (13,467 ha). Funds for
commercial seed-processing companies were cancelled.

(c) Livestock Development: The number of livestock extension stations at the township level
was reduced (from 16 to 6). The area of commercial forage production was reduced (from 11,060
ha to 2,441 ha). Funds were reallocated to provide 30,000 sheep for immigrant households. The
development of commercial feed- and fodder-processing companies and commercial livestock-
breeding farms were cancelled, along with the provision of related fencing and tubewells.

(d) Forestry Development and Environment: The number of township extension stations was
reduced (from 11 to 6). The number of natural forest stations was reduced from 5 to 3; on-farm
field forest belts were reduced from 3,053 ha to 1,200 ha; and household orchard development
was reduced from 2,667 ha to 1,000 ha. The commercial forest farms in Yumen and Guazhou
and the 1,000 ha firewood forest were cancelled. Funds were reallocated to support: (i) the
Changma upper reach natural forest station; and (ii) water-soil conservation, grassland for wind
and sand protection, and cultural heritage protection.

(e) Voluntary Resettlement: T he number of immigrant farmers was reduced from 200,000 to
75,000. Correspondingly, the number of new townships and hospitals were reduced from 16 to 6,
new villages from 160 to 57, new primary and middle schools from 176 to 66, and new clinics
from 160 to 57. Resettlement-related infrastructure (roads, water and power supply, etc.) was
reduced accordingly.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

1.7.1    No other significant changes were made to the project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1    The PDOs were set clearly in the context of the CAS and the government's strategy for
poverty reduction. The specific activities planned to achieve the project's poverty reduction
objective built on the experience of previous "poverty-reduction-through-voluntary-resettlement"



                                                    4

programs in Gansu, the results of which were considered very positive in reducing absolute
poverty and providing greater level of incomes after resettlement on newly-irrigated lands.

2.1.2    However, there were four major shortcomings in the project design, which had significant
negative impacts on project implementation: (a) environmental issues; (b) institutional issues; (c)
social issues; and (d) technical preparation.

2.1.3    Environmental Issues. Insufficient attention was paid to environmental issues during
preparation and appraisal. The basin-level rate of water utilization agreed upon was very high (at
91.7 percent). During implementation, increasing attention in China was paid to the sustainability
of water resources management, and eventually the Gansu Provincial Planning Commission
started questioning the sustainability of the project's water withdrawals and requested that an
ecological study be carried out to evaluate the water balance in the Shule River Basin. The Shule
Basin Ecology Study investigated the water balance required for both the project area and
ecological uses downstream of the Changma Reservoir and concluded that there was a need for a
strong, province-level river basin management agency to protect the basin's water ecology and
environment, and specified the amount of water that needed to be reserved for ecological
demands along the lower reaches of the Shule River. Consequently, during the MTR, the water
utilization rate was revised downwards to 65 percent, which is in accordance with international
standards. Although the concept of "ecological water requirement" was acknowledged at the
national decision-maker levels only as recently as 2000, it had been a commonly accepted
concept internationally for some years; the Bank Task Team should have paid closer attention to
this fundamental design issue at the time of preparation and appraisal.

2.1.4    Institutional Issues. At the time of appraisal, a prefecture-level water resource
management bureau for the Shule River was agreed to be sufficient for the project although
integrated water basin management was already a widely-accepted best practice inside the Bank
and internationally. The Bank's Supervision Team had to exert extreme pressure and push
significant policy reform finally to convince Gansu to concede that a province-level bureau would
be more effective in handling the complex issues of water allocation among competing uses
within the prefecture borders and water- use control to stay within the extremely tight water
budget for the whole river basin. The establishment of the Province-level Gansu Shule River
Basin Water Resources Management Bureau (SRBWRMB) was eventually finalized, even if not
as quickly as the Bank would have wished. SRBWRMB establishment is a major
accomplishment for Gansu and at project completion is highly appreciated by the local, provincial
and the national governments. The Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) has recognized the
importance of this achievement by giving Gansu a special award for integrated river basin
management. It is unlikely that this achievement would have taken place without continuous
pressure from the Bank's Task Team and strong support from the Gansu Water Resources
Bureau.

2.1.5    The positive institutional impact that eventually was achieved was further strengthened
by the establishment of 87 WUAs which were originally not included in the project design. The
WUAs are now managing the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation systems in the
three irrigation districts under the project, ensuring efficient water use, and facilitating the
collection of water fees which fully cover the O&M expenses (still a rare achievement in China).
The institutional reform at the top (the establishment of SRBWRMB) and the establishment of
WUAs at the grassroots level "closed the loop", enabling a positive cycle of sustainable water
resource management in the project areas.




                                                    5

2.1.6    Social Issues. No stakeholder assessment or social assessment that systematically would
have identified the project's key stakeholders and their views of and attitudes towards the project
was carried out. While a social assessment was carried out in the move-out counties, no such
assessment was undertaken in the receiving counties (receiving local governments and
communities in Jiuquan Prefecture). This left the Bank's Supervision Team unaware of many of
the complexities which caused the reluctant attitude of Jiuquan Prefecture/Municipality toward
the project and their wariness in accepting re-settlers from the other poorer prefectures. A major
issue was that the large inflow of poor households would at least initially reduce the average per
capita GDP of the relatively better-off Jiuquan (which would adversely affect the development
reputation of Jiuquan).

2.1.7    With continuous internal negotiations and consultations between the provincial and
prefecture governments during implementation, the thrust to relocate people to the resettlement
sites gained renewed momentum as the major irrigation works were completed and land
preparations were initiated. In addition, the reduction in the number of re-settlers as a result of
the water balance issue eased the pressure on Jiuquan.

2.1.8    Technical Preparation. The extent of soil salinization in the selected irrigation areas
was seriously underestimated during appraisal, causing significant delays and cost increases for
land reclamation. The large share of extremely saline soils in the newly-reclaimed areas (about
65 percent) required particular attention. Intensive research was undertaken in close
collaboration with several international institutes to prepare land typing based on remote sensing,
with detailed descriptions of soil structure, salt content and treatment required, and the
classification of their potential use in agriculture. Extension workers and farmers received on-site
training in various soil-leaching techniques for different types of soil and groundwater conditions.
Guidelines and manuals were prepared and trainees participated in actual soil leaching of selected
pilot areas under the guidance of experienced technical personnel .             3



2.2 Implementation

2.2.1    Internal factors that had a significant impact on project implementation related to: (a) the
shortage of counterpart funds; (b) the introduction of a national program encouraging potential re-
settlers to stay in the move-out areas; and (ci) construction delays.

(a) Counterpart Funds. From the outset, progress on all project components was slow because
of counterpart funding shortages. At appraisal, the Bank's Task Team was informed that national
poverty reduction funds would be allocated to cover a large part of the required counterpart funds
(forty percent). However, the regulations for use of national poverty reduction funds were
changing and relevant provincial departments knew prior to negotiations that the project would
not be eligible to use those funds. Consequently, counterpart funds for the project were short by
40 percent before the project even had started implementation. The Bank Supervision Team
became aware of this situation only later, when the lack of counterpart funding started to have an
impact on project implementation.

(b) National Program Supporting Move-Out Areas. In the late 1990s, the central government
introduced a national program entitled the "Grain for Green Program" to rehabilitate forest and
grassland areas in resource-poor areas (mainly in the western areas of the country) which had



3The extension stations in the project areas have gained substantial and unique experience in tackling severe salinity
problems. This experience is worth transferring to other countries where land and water is very scarce and soil salinity
hampers agricultural production.



                                                           6

been damaged by poor farming practices (especially farming on steeply sloping land). This
program provided subsidies and grain for farmers to take sloping land out of grain production and
to plant trees and forage instead. The program supplemented the move-out farmers' income and
changed their incentives for moving out to the Shule River Basin in the harsh Gobi Desert. This
was another rationale for reducing the number of re-settlers. The introduction of the Grain for
Green Program was also the reason for the cancellation of the project's environmental
investments in the move-out areas as these activities were to be covered by the national program.
                                          4


(c) Construction. The collapse of a section of the Changma Dam silt diversion tunnel (caused by
geological conditions) in 1998 significantly delayed the completion of the dam and ancillary
works. The collapse also delayed the availability of additional water needed for land reclamation,
land leaching and crop production which, in turn, delayed the relocation of re-settlers. In addition,
the completion of bidding, evaluation and selection for ten key construction contracts for
irrigation and drainage works was delayed because of the Borrower's lack of experience in
following the Bank's procurement guidelines . The delay in procurement contributed to the
                                                       5

slow construction of irrigation facilities for the settlement sites. The Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-2003 further slowed procurement and construction progress
(see paragraph 2.2.3 below).

2.2.2     The Bank's Supervision Team was very flexible in addressing the design problems and in
adapting to unexpected events. The Mid-Term Reviews in FY00 and FY03 tried to cope with     6

the loss of the national poverty reduction funds, to bring attention to ecological sustainability and
social development, and to adjust the project activities accordingly. The targeted number of
beneficiaries was reduced along with the newly reclaimed irrigated areas, and the water
utilization rate was adjusted to 65 percent to ensure the sustainable use of water and to protect the
downstream environment7. Although Gansu was able eventually to make up part of the
counterpart funding shortage by obtaining funding through national treasury bonds issued by the
central government, the lack of timely availability of the funds at the project site continued to
hamper implementation progress throughout the life of the project.

2.2.3     One important external factor affected the project implementation; the outbreak of SARS
in China in late 2002 basically stopped movement for some six months between and within
provinces, and Bank-supported operations along with the government's own programs were
basically suspended during this time period. Project personnel were unable to travel within
counties and were to a large extent called on to support the control of the outbreak.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1     The project was supported by a survey-based M&E system, consisting of three parts:
(a) involuntary resettlement for the Changma Reservoir; (b) voluntary emigration and land




4The "Grain for Green" program provided compensation for farmers for converting low economic-value cultivated
land to ecological purposes in northern and western parts of China. In 2006, the subsidy equaled approximately
RMB200 per mu plus a certain amount of grain.
5A special training program was arranged in Yumen City by the Beijing Office of the Bank in October 2000 to
strengthen the project's procurement capacity.
6The detailed changes to the project components induced by the MTR are described in Section 1.6.
7At completion, the reserved ecological water balance of 260 million m3 was fully consistent with the
recommendations in the Shule River Basin Ecological Study. This is approximately 25 percent of the annual runoff of
the Shule River.



                                                           7

settlement; and (c) environmental monitoring of land and water resources. Output and outcome
indicators were selected for each project component.

2.3.2   The National Research Center for Resettlement of Hehai University monitored and
evaluated annually the socio-economic well-being of 131 households (of a total of 139
households) involuntary relocated by the construction of the Changma Reservoir and resettled
mainly in Huahai ID (and also in Yumen City and Changma ID). The M&E was undertaken
during 2000-2002. The progress of involuntary resettlement was regularly reported to project
management and the Bank for information and action. The Bank reviewed the quality of the
involuntary relocation and deemed it to be fully in accordance with both government regulations
and Bank safeguards.

2.3.3   The Voluntary Resettlement Program was also supported by an external M&E
mechanism conducted by Lanzhou University in Gansu, designed to advise program
implementation in the local social context of Hexi Corridor in accordance with the project's
voluntary resettlement plan. The annual surveys and reporting lasted for ten years until the 2006
report. The M&E reporting covered all major aspects of socio-economic conditions of "move-
out" areas (11 poverty counties in south-east Gansu Province) and "move-in" areas (in the Shule
River Basin), with a focus on the progress achieved in resettlement implementation, development
of the new settlements and livelihood rehabilitation of the resettled households. Besides
examining physical construction, social services and production arrangements in the new sites
(eight in total), a sample size of about 2,000 resettlers (500 households) was annually selected for
surveys of incomes and expenditures (from agriculture and labor out-migration, and in the new
sites and old move-out villages), living environment and satisfaction indexes. Tracking progress
on output and outcome indicators and other socio-economic indicators across "move in" and
"move out" areas, these surveys yielded high-quality data for the M&E of the voluntary
resettlement program.

2.3.4   The project was also supported by Environmental Monitoring and Evaluation conducted
in project "move-in" and "move-out" areas. The Water Environment Center of the Gansu
Hydrology and Water Resources Investigation Bureau, the Gansu Agriculture Engineering
Planning Institute, and other relevant universities and institutes were sub-contracted to conduct
M&E on parameters for surface and groundwater, meteorological data, water table, soil quality
and ecological environment. M&E techniques used included surveys, field investigations and
research. Various reports were prepared regularly for the PMO8.

2.3.5   In addition to the M&E system, a computerized Management Information System (MIS)
was set up to collect and monitor financial and physical progress data from technical bureaus and
units implementing the various project components. Procurement and financial reports detailed
all works, project expenditures and supporting documents for disbursement from loan/credit
proceeds. Progress reports were prepared semi-annually. The various M&E systems helped
greatly to inform on the status of project implementation and also facilitated the evaluation
discussions at completion. However, an integrated M&E system that would have measured
overall project efficiency, performance and outcome was never put in place.




8These included the reports on "Annual Environmental Management", "Water Resources Balance and Reservoir
Groundwater Level Prediction", "Anxi Grassland Ecological Environment Monitoring", "Meteorological Monitoring
and Analysis" and "Soil Monitoring and Evaluation".



                                                       8

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1   The project triggered Bank safeguard policies on environment, dam safety, resettlement
and indigenous people. The Bank supported the project's compliance with safeguard policies
through supervisions which were rated by QAG in late 1999 as "Highly Satisfactory."

2.4.2   Environment. The PMO established monitoring stations for water and soil quality and
controlling the environmental issues during construction. Particular attention was paid to the
ecological water balance and soil salinity after the major construction works were completed.
The monitoring of water table and changes in soil salinity allowed for improving the drainage
systems and for mastering soil desalinization measures.

2.4.3   The establishment of the SRBWRMB has greatly improved the implementation of the
Bank's environmental safeguard policies, and integrated ground- and surface-water management
has become a reality. Changma, Shuangta and Chijinxia Reservoirs became jointly operated and
regulated on flood control and supply of water for irrigation and other uses. Since its
establishment, SRBWRMB has released about 200 million m3 of water annually for downstream
natural reserve areas to protect the ecological system.

2.4.4   In 2004, the Gansu Water Resources and Hydropower Investigation and Design Institute
and Tsinghua University undertook research on the use of ground-water in the irrigation areas.
The report analyzed the current status and projected an outlook for changes in ground-water
levels between 2000 and 2030 for each of the project's three irrigation districts. The study
predicted a decrease in the ground-water levels north of the mountains while some increase was
actually observed across irrigation districts. In Changma ID, the ground-water level slightly
increased (0.3 m-0.6 m); in Shuangta ID, because of irrigation water diversion and ecological
water discharge, the ground-water level also increased (0.12 m - 2 m); in Huahai ID, for similar
reasons as in Shuangta ID, the ground-water level increased with about 0.4 m - 4m. These results
were later confirmed by actual ground-water level data collected by Gansu Water Resources and
Hydropower Investigation and Design Institute between the years 2001-2006. These increases in
some of the irrigation districts indicate the need for continued monitoring of ground-water levels
and possible future investments or measures to improve drainage.

2.4.5   The salt content of the water impounded by the Shuangta Reservoir, downstream of the
Shule River, has also been monitored carefully because of the potential for salt build-up. The
Water and Environment Monitoring Center of the Gansu Hydrology and Water Resources
Investigation Bureau monitors salinity changes in the Shuangta Reservoir at intake, reservoir area
and downside of Shuangta Dam. The monitoring data during 2000-2006 shows a decline in total
salt content, mainly resulting from the increased water diversion from Changma Reservoir and
improved drainage systems downstream.

2.4.6   A Cultural Investigation Report and Protection Plan for the Shule River Project was
prepared by the Gansu Relics and Anthology Research Institute and the Guazhou Relics and
Tourism Bureau. The Plan was followed during construction under the supervision of the PMO.
As a result, those relics found remained protected and a list was prepared and provided to the
Bank. Seven reports on cultural excavation and relics' protection were submitted to the PMO and
the Gansu Culture Protection Bureau.

2.4.7   Dam Safety. Three dams (Changma, Shuangta and Chijinxia Dams) triggered the
Bank's Operational Policy on Dam Safety (OP 4.37). An International Panel of Experts was
appointed in accordance with the policy and was involved in project preparation and



                                                   9

implementation stages. The Panel of Experts inspected the sites three times and their comments
were incorporated in the final dam designs. In 2001, the China Institute of Water Resources and
Hydropower Research reviewed the safety status of the Changma Dam granting permission to
initiate water storage. The Changma Dam was completed and operational in 2002 and is now
operated by the Changma Reservoir and Hydropower Management Station. The Provincial
Water Resources Bureau periodically reviews the dam and flood control emergency preparedness.

2.4.8    Involuntary Resettlement. The construction of the Changma Dam caused the
involuntary resettlement of 580 farmers (139 households) in Shuixia Village of Changma
Township, Yumen City. About 2,489 mu of farmland was inundated. The physical relocation of
households started in May 2000 and was completed in November of 2000. Some 547 people
moved into the newly-constructed Xixia village while 33 people decided to return to their old
township.

2.4.9    The Changma Involuntary Resettlement Program was planned and implemented in
conformity with OP 4.12, ensuring that all resettled households' living standards were improved
and their incomes enhanced. Infrastructure construction of the new site was completed before
people moved in. Housing and social services such as schools, clinics and cultural centers, were
established based on consultation with the relocated people. More than 5,500 mu of land was
developed, including forestry and grassland. About 2,200 mu of farm land was allocated to the
relocated households with each farmer receiving 4-5 mu of land. Intensive training on irrigation,
desalination and techniques for economic cropping was provided to the farmers to enable them to
adapt to their new living and production circumstances. Land quality in Xixia village was
continuously improved and is now nearly equal to that in the old irrigation districts.

2.4.10 Indigenous Peoples. Resettlement was carried out based on social assessments covering
all move-out areas and potential resettlers. About 30 percent of the resettlers belong to ethnic
minorities, all of them moving voluntarily and with special consideration in regard to their culture
and practices. Among them, Dongxiang accounted for 13.75 percent of the total and Hui
accounted for 10.7 percent of the total. There were 65 Tibetan households and 7 Tu households.

2.4.11 According to tradition and custom, all Dongxiang (Muslim) and most Hui (Muslim) were
settled in concentrated sites. According to the National Ethnic Minority Autonomous Law and
the project design, the Qiduntan resettlement site was established as a Hui and Dongxiang Ethnic
Minority Township. Other new sites, such as the Dushanzi sub-farm (township level), have also
been populated mainly by Dongxiang people and are currently going through formalities to
become ethnic minority townships. Tibetans and Tus (both Buddhists), consistent with their own
requests, were mostly resettled in concentrated areas in the old irrigation districts. Ethnic beliefs
and religions were respected in the new resettlement communities, including the construction of
21 mosques in all (Muslim) sites with separate cemeteries for each Hui and Dongxiang village.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1    Post-completion operation will be greatly facilitated by the institutional arrangements
created by the project. SRBWRMB at the river basin level and the WUAs as grassroots water
management organizations, with active farmers' participation at the field level, form an integrated
system giving impetus to agricultural growth while ensuring environmental sustainability. The
distribution system efficiency of irrigation canals is high, and full cost recovery of water charges
provides a sound mechanism for continuous support of operation and maintenance and the long-
term sustainability of the irrigation systems and facilities.




                                                 10

2.5.2     The main challenge in the post-completion phase will be to manage the increasing
pressures for more intensive water and land use, and the trade-off between income generation and
environment protection. Population growth and limited income opportunities beyond crop
production in rural Gansu will require the continuous attention of the SRBWRMB on the
technical efficiency of water supply and on-farm efficiency of water use in order to save water for
other high-value uses. SRBWRMB will need to be pro-active in meeting the changes in water
demand and to prevent environmental degradation. This includes, but is not limited to, the
regulating of water fees and water supply. Moreover, a hydropower development plan (based on
generating stations on the main canals) should be developed to utilize fully the potential for
hydropower without damage to the environment, generating revenues to help fund SRBWRMB
operations.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1     The project's objectives remain relevant to the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) 2006-2010 for China that aims to reduce poverty, inequality and social exclusion. The
project also remains consistent with current government policies/poverty reduction strategy. The
most recent "slogan" for the provincial government's poverty reduction strategy is: "Yi Ti Liang
Yi" meaning "one body (village-based comprehensive poverty reduction) and two wings
(agricultural skills training and mobility of labor, and agricultural industrialization and
modernization)".

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1     The PDOs were met. Many of the indicators for achievement of the PDOs exceeded the
targets set at both appraisal and MTR.

3.2.2     The main indicator of the first project objective was to increase per capita income above the
absolute poverty line in the project area, and it was fully achieved9. At completion, the net per
capita income in the move-in project villages had increased by RMB 1,602 to about RMB 1,850 (to
RMB 1,601 in Changma ID, RMB 1,720 in Shuangta ID, and RMB 2,575 in Huahai ID). The
project's per capita income targets were RMB 1,564 at appraisal and RMB 1,830 at MTR.
Moreover, the quality of income significantly improved. The re-settlers shifted from the production
of food grains for subsistence to production of cash crops, and are instead purchasing grain for
household consumption and livestock. Furthermore the outlook for additional income growth and
poverty reduction for households in the "move-in" areas is much more promising than for those
staying in the "move-out" areas. A discussion of the types of welfare gains and how much of the
reported gains could be attributed to the project is provided in Section 3.5 and Annex 4.

3.2.3     The substantial shortfall in achieving the appraisal targets, however, is that the number of
project beneficiaries decreased from 200,000 to 75,387 people. The initial resettlement target
was based on a level of water use which was too high, assuming as it did an overall water
utilization rate of 92 percent (see Section 2.1). Once this assumption was revised to 65 percent,




9The project's M&E system collected data on net per capita income but not on the poverty headcount measure. In
2006, the absolute poverty line in Gansu was RMB650 per capita and the relatively-poor poverty line was RMB956
(see Section 3.5, paragraph 3.5.3).



                                                       11

the resettlement and all associated activities had to be scaled-back, automatically leading to a
qualitative rather than quantitative achievement of many of the project's targets.

3.2.4     The project's second objective, to increase agricultural production in Gansu Province,
was fully achieved. While the targets of food grain production set at appraisal and revised at
MTR were not met, the gross agricultural output in the project area exceeded both appraisal and
MTR targets. This resulted from the shifts away from low-value grains to higher-value cotton,
spices, herbs and vegetables which all are well-suited to Shule Basin conditions. At completion,
these cash crops accounted for about 80 percent of total cultivated land. The price effect was
small because the nominal farm-gate prices of most agricultural outputs at completion were very
similar to those at appraisal (the real prices were even lower if adjusted to inflation), and income
growth was caused by the increases in yields on the smaller, newly-reclaimed irrigated areas (the
actual reclamation irrigated area was 25,100 ha compared to 27,200 ha planned at MTR and
54,600 ha planned at appraisal) and especially the massive change to much higher-value crops10.

3.2.5     The project's third objective, to protect and restore degraded environments, was also
achieved. The overall vegetation coverage of the area reached 15.3 percent, exceeding both the
appraisal and MTR targets. In terms of irrigation, the efficiency of water-use is high. The target
of distribution system efficiency of irrigation canals, set at 62 percent, has been achieved and the
O&M costs are fully recovered through fees collected from water users. These are significant and
rare achievements in China, where canal efficiency is usually well below 50 percent and cost
recovery averages 60-70 percent (and is often much less).

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1     The project's Net Present Value (NPV) at completion is estimated at RMB 21.5 million.
With an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 12.2 percent, the project's rate of return about
equaled the social discount rate (12 percent). The ERR of the largest component (Irrigation and
Drainage) is 11.9 percent, with the lowest ERR in Changma ID (9.9 percent) and highest in
Shuangta ID (14.4 percent). The NPV and ERR at completion are substantially lower than the
NPV and ERR estimated at appraisal (because of the reduction in the project's scale) but larger
than those estimated at MTR. The MTR is more relevant comparator because of the similar
project scopes with the ICR. With this in background, the project efficiency at completion was
higher than expected at MTR. Annex 3 provides a comparison of the NPVs and ERRs of project
components at appraisal, MTR and completion.

3.3.2     The project's overall ERR critically depends on the Irrigation and Drainage Component
which makes up 86.3 percent of the total investment . Its ERR was found to fluctuate between
                                                                  11

7.6 - 12.0 percent in Changma ID, between 11.7 - 15.9 percent in Shuangta ID and between 7.9 -
15.7 percent in Huahai ID, using a simulation analysis of a 10 percent decrease/increase of the
gross revenue from agricultural activities. Such fluctuations in gross revenues are possible and
can be caused by changes in prices and yields of the agricultural products.




10The gross agricultural output is expressed in nominal prices. At appraisal, food prices in China exceeded world
market prices. After China's WTO entry, food prices initially declined but increased starting 2003 following the
increase in world market prices and domestic demand.
11Note that the investment costs of project components for economic analysis differ from those in Table A of Annex 1.
The project costs were allocated to crop, livestock, forest and hydro-electric power stations' components based on the
weights in total benefits.



                                                            12

3.3.3    The ERR is especially sensitive to changes in the price of cotton (the main crop). At
completion, cash crops in Changma ID accounted for 63 percent of the total cropping area (with
91 percent in Shuangta ID and 85 percent in Huahai ID). A 20 percent fall in cotton prices at the
farm-gate would result in a 2.2 percentage points decrease of the ERR. A 30 percent fall in
cotton prices would reduce the Irrigation and Drainage component's ERR from 11.9 percent to
8.6 percent. The largest decrease would be in Huahai ID where the ERR would decrease from
12.2 percent to 5.9 percent.

3.3.4    That the ERR significantly declines when cotton prices decline underscores the critical
importance of sustainable irrigation systems, efficient farming and development of marketing
infrastructure. It further highlights the importance of extension services in effectively
transferring new knowledge to farmers on modern technologies for other crops and on
prevention/mitigation measures against cotton pests. More generally, similar to this project,
future poverty projects should include serious capacity building and institutional improvements
for extension services to help farmers diversify and to prevent them from falling back into
subsistence farming and poverty.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1    While the project was designed almost thirteen years ago, its basic objectives remain
relevant to the government's current plans to construct a "new socialist countryside", although
today much more attention is given to the environmental sustainability of development
interventions. The project's PDOs were met and the efficiency achieved is satisfactory, given
that this was a poverty reduction project. Significant positive poverty reduction impacts, gender
benefits and social developments were achieved and although the total number of the project
beneficiaries was smaller than planned at appraisal it met the MTR target. Moreover, the outlook
for further improvements for the poverty-stricken people who settled in the "move-in" areas is
much more promising than for those remaining in the "move-out" areas (see Section 3.5). With
this in view, the overall outcome of the project is rated as "moderately satisfactory."

3.4.2    This rating is supported by the weighting calculation against the original PDOs and
revised MTR targets (Annex 5). Although the MTR targets were not formally revised, they are
useful to judge the achievement of the PDOs.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1    Poverty. Significant improvements in the re-settlers' welfare were recorded. At
appraisal, the average annual per capita income of the future re-settlers in situ was estimated to
be about RMB 248. At completion, the average per capita income estimated for the largest
resettlement townships increased to RMB 1,810. Since the re-settlers were reallocated to new
reclaimed areas, the increase in per capita income (RMB 1,562 per capita) can be fully attributed
to the project. The results remain significantly positive even after the changes in per capita
income in "move-in" areas is corrected for the changes in income in "move-out" areas (i.e., to
allow for the changes which would have happened in the absence of the project - a "difference in
difference" evaluation). Since the average per capita income in the "move-out" areas ("without




                                                 13

the project") increased by RMB 968, the per capita income increase fully attributable to the
project is RMB 594 . Annex 4 presents a detailed analysis of the poverty impact.
                          12



3.5.2     The majority of the project's "move-in" households succeeded in escaping absolute
poverty by the year 2006. At the outset of the project, most of the res-ettlers were absolute poor,
but in 2006 none of the surveyed households lived in absolute poverty using the Gansu poverty
line of RMB 650. Only 38 percent still had a per capita income below the "relatively-poor"
poverty line of RMB 956. However, while significant improvements in poverty reduction were
achieved in comparison with Chinese poverty thresholds, the majority of the re-settlers (except
some of those living in Huahai ID) continue to live below the Bank's poverty line of US$1 per
day (equal to about RMB 2,800 per capita). This raises the question of whether the Bank
investment was justified and if there were better alternatives to the investment (e.g., investing in
the "move-out" areas). For the latter, investment opportunities for economic and human
development in the "move-out" mountainous areas were and continue to be extremely limited.
For the former, the investment is seen as justified taking into account the positive future outlook
for poverty reduction in the move-in areas. Since the relocation was delayed, most of the re-
settlers did not achieve their full income potential from agriculture and off-farm activities at the
time of the ICR, but their outlook is very promising as land productivity has great potential to
increase, the reliable irrigation promotes diversification, and the farmers increasingly master new
farm techniques (none of which can be said about the "move-out" areas).

3.5.3     Gender Aspects. While the project focused on enhancing household welfare in general,
it also helped women to improve their well-being. Among the resettled people, more than 29,700
were women. Women laborers not only work in fields but participated in new site construction
and labor mobility outside villages, which has become an important source of income that most
resettled households rely on. In 2006, for example, 5,073 women in the project areas took outside
work accounting for 47 percent of all off-farm laborers and their income added up to more than
RMB 7.12 million, 48.4 percent of the total project area income from outside work (Table 1
below). On average, the women earned more than RMB 1,400 per person in 2006 in off-farm
income, increasing their contribution to their families well- being which, in turn, increased their
participation in household decision-making (according to survey, 75 percent of women took equal
part in household decision-making.)




12This is a conservative estimate. The project's contribution was probably higher. The people in "move-out" areas
obtained "Grain for Green" subsidy at approximately RMB200 per mu for conversion of cultivated slope land to
grasses and forests. Excluding this subsidy from per capita income calculations in the "move-out" areas increases the
project's contribution to re-settlers' income growth to about RMB800.

3.5.4    Social Development. The resettlers directly benefited from project investments in
irrigation infrastructure, agricultural and livestock support and financing of the resettlements.
Positive externalities from environment protection and management accrued not only to the
resettlers but also to other residents in the project area. Additional indirect benefits were obtained
from the establishment of the WUAs and the improved extension services.

3.5.5    Ethnic Minorities. With production improvements and development of new
opportunities for all resettlers, the incomes of ethnic minority communities were enhanced during
and after resettlement. For Dongxiang people, the largest "move-in" ethnic minority group, per
capita income grew from RMB 294 in 1997 to RMB 1,253 in 2006. In contrast to their
hometown where they could plant only rain-fed crops, now they have mastered irrigated
agriculture. According to the satisfaction survey carried out in the resettlement sites, 95 percent
of the resettlers are satisfied with their new life.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.6    The highlight of the institutional change induced by the project was the establishment of
the SRBWRMB and the introduction of WUAs. Establishment of the SRBWRMB greatly
improved project completion, ensured environmental water use for ecosystem protection and
strengthened coordination among government line agencies. After project completion, the
SRBWRMB will continue to play the key role in integrated management of water resources and
ensure sustainable social, economic and environmental development of the Shule River Basin.

3.5.7    In general, substantial institutional strengthening took place at various levels during
project implementation, from the implementing agency down to the resettlement sites. Various
kinds of training were provided to farmers, extension workers and the implementing agency. The
implementing agency's project supervision practices were adjusted to the supervision methods
similar to those of the Bank.

3.5.8    At the grassroots level, the water management structure is supported by the WUAs that
are managed by the farmers. The establishment of WUAs was not originally included in the
project design, but was introduced by the Bank's Supervision Team. Some 87 WUAs are in place
in the project areas. The WUAs, combined with SRBWRMB, provides a well-functioning,



                                                    15

integrated water management system that will provide sustained impetus for agricultural growth
while ensuring environmental sustainability in and beyond the project areas.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

4.1      The risk to the development outcome is considered to be "moderate". The national
government's commitment to further reduce poverty continues to be one of the most important
policy priorities. Increased funding is being channeled to the western areas of the country,
including large sums being allocated for village-level development and rural infrastructure. The
establishment of the SRBWRMB ensures the sustainable management of water resources across
prefectures, and great attention is now being paid both to the ecological water balance and
efficient use of the scarce water resources. Dam safety measures have been fully implemented,
the distribution efficiency of irrigation channels is high, and full cost-recovery for water will
ensure adequate future O&M of the irrigation systems.

4.2      The main risk posed to the development outcome is related to slower than expected soil
desalinization of the reclaimed land. About 60 percent of the new reclaimed lands in the project
area have required three to five years leaching, with some land plots where the salinity conditions
proved much worse than expected needing up to eight years for adequate desalinization. While
the project has made significant investments in desalinization measures, in capacity building of
the extension services, and in subsidization of fees for water used for leaching, the extended time
required for land development works reduced the project funds available for move-in households.
Even though the SRBWRMB has prepared a plan aiming to use RMB 107 million of collected
water fees annually for soil leaching, many post-project investments will need to be financed by
local public funds and the households themselves. Therefore, the SRBWRMB has requested
additional provincial funds to assist the move-in households in post-project agricultural extension.

4.3      Changes in market incentives also pose certain risks. Currently most farmers in the
move-in areas specialize in cotton production which generates cash income and contributes to soil
desalinization because of its salt tolerance. In the future, the profitability of cotton production
may decline resulting in shifts from cotton to less salt-tolerant crops. The probability of a large
decline in cotton profitability, however, is low in the Hexi Corridor, given the favorable climate
conditions, the less favorable conditions for grains and the rising demand for textile and clothes
inside and outside of China. In addition, the severity of soil salt problems can be expected to
decline after a number of years of cotton production and leaching of salts out of the root zone.

4.4      The probability of continued spontaneous self-resettlement remains low, but if controls
are relaxed the impact would be negative. At this point, local government has recognized the
consequences of potential over-use of land and water resources and the importance of the
environmental sustainability in the area. Adequate administrative measures have been put in
place to prevent further resettlement (e.g., hukou issuance). Furthermore, the SRBWRMB
controls the water supply, preventing its access by illegal users. The local government will have
to continue closely to monitor and prevent any over-use of land and water to minimize risks to
sustainability of the project development outcomes.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Unsatisfactory

5.1.1   No QAG "Quality at Entry" review of the project was carried out.

5.1.2   Although the project was consistent with the government's poverty reduction strategy
and the Bank's CAS, its design had several major shortcomings which had negative effects on
achieving the development outcomes (see Section 2.1). A full ecological assessment focused on
water should have been carried out for the Shule River Basin during project preparation, and
downstream ecological water requirements should have been included in the water balance
calculations. Similarly, better soil surveys should have been done to estimate accurately the
required soil desalinization efforts. Furthermore, the Bank inadequately addressed the issue of
integrated river basin and watershed management, significantly delaying the creation of a
province-level river basin management bureau. Finally, the Bank did not require the completion
of a social assessment covering both the "move-out" areas and the "move-in" areas which
probably would have uncovered the wary attitude of the receiving prefecture toward the project as
designed. All these drawbacks in the project design were mentioned in two QAG reviews (1999
supervision quality of safeguards, and 2004 supervision quality). In view of these major
shortcomings, the Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as as "unsatisfactory."

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.3   In late 1999, the quality of safeguard supervision was rated by a QAG review (which
included a field review) as "highly satisfactory". The field review noted a number of problems
with quality at entry but gave the project a "Highly Satisfactory" rating for supervision.

5.1.4   However, in 2004 a second QAG rated the quality of supervision during the period of
FY2003-2004 as "moderately unsatisfactory". The major reasons for the rating were reported as
follows: "The project had serious design flaws as the proposed infrastructure development was
not based on realistic assessment of resources for development and the poor communities who
would derive the benefit. Throughout the period under review, the team grappled with these
fundamental design problems and the lack of counterpart funding.". Additional concerns raised
at the 2004 QAG review included that "... little attention (had been) given to social development
of the re-settlers ..." and that the Supervision Team had not rated the project implementation as
unsatisfactory earlier.

5.1.5   The ICR team, however, is of the opinion that the quality of supervision of the project as
a whole has been "satisfactory" for the following reasons:

(a) Significant financial and human resources were provided for implementation support during
supervision to mitigate the project design's shortcomings and to assist the Borrower to address
the evolving challenges. The Bank demonstrated a strong commitment to correcting the design
problems and considerable flexibility in addressing them.




                                                  17

(b) The Bank's Task Team successfully induced significant institutional reform through intensive
dialogue and persuasion. The Prefecture-level Shule River Basin Water Resources Management
Bureau was finally transformed into a Provincial-level Shule River Basin Water Resource
Management Bureau. Compliance with the Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies
was supervised regularly, either by the main team or by specific technical experts. The
establishment of the involuntary and voluntary resettlements was closely monitored by the Bank.

(c) When the larger-scale relocation became possible as the major irrigation and infrastructure
works were completed, the Bank's Supervision Team paid close attention to the timely
completion of construction of schools, hospitals and other social infrastructure for resettlers and
their children and their adequate staffing.

5.1.6    It should be noted that the 2004 QAG mainly raised problems of a "quality at entry"
nature rather than of supervision, emphasizing the shortfall of counterpart funds at the outset and
the inadequately-addressed ecological issues. Also, basically all the reasons for the unsatisfactory
supervision rating were successfully resolved by the time of project completion.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.7    Based on the "unsatisfactory" rating for Quality at Entry, the "satisfactory" rating for
supervision of the project and the "moderately satisfactory" achievement of the PDOs, the Bank's
overall performance is rated as "moderately satisfactory."

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

5.2.1    In spite of the strong political support and high attention to the project that eventually
was received from the provincial government, and the efforts made to raise the counterpart funds
after the MTR, the government's performance is rated as "unsatisfactory". Project
implementation was severely constrained by the shortfalls in counterpart funds. The ineligibility
of Gansu to utilize national poverty reduction funds for the project was suggested at lower levels
at the time of appraisal but raised by Gansu only prior to or at the time of negotiations. Gansu
should have undertaken quick measures at that time either to find alternative sources of
counterpart funds or to adjust the project's scale to match the actual funds available. It is likely
that the relevant departments over-estimated their ability to replace the lost poverty reduction
funds from other sources, and may also have under-estimated the impact of the loss of these funds
on project implementation. On the other hand, had implementation gone according to plan it is
likely that the long-term ecological impact of the project would have been severely negative
given that ecological water requirements were not included in the original project design and
water balance.

5.2.2    After the MTR, the problem of the counterpart funds was eased through high-level
leadership attention at the provincial level and close attention given to the project by provincial
leaders. At completion, the actual allocation of counterpart funds reached 85.6 percent of the
MTR target. However, even with the additional funds project implementation was severely
hampered by the untimely/uncertain allocations and the slow release of those funds to the project



                                                   18

office. The planned infrastructure works were slowed down, resulting in delayed resettlement
and consequently delayed agricultural growth and human development.

5.2.3     In addition, the provincial government exhibited weak coordination on resettlement and
social issues. Registration of many resettlers had not been completed even at the time of the ICR
mission. A remaining concern is the re-settlers on the two state farms who are still in the process
of having their hukous transferred to the newly-created townships. Although the Bank
acknowledges the associated complex institutional constraints to complete the issuance of the
hukous, greater efforts could have been expected from the government to overcome these barriers
to allow the relocated people to have as smooth and quick a transition as possible.

5.2.4     Finally, together with the Bank's Preparation Team, Gansu government was also
responsible for the major shortcomings in the project design as described in Section 2.1. These
shortcomings greatly affected project implementation and reduced the achievement of the PDOs.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.5     The performance of the implementing agency - the Gansu Provincial PMO - is
considered to have been "satisfactory". Implementation difficulties were acknowledged and
addressed, even if not always as rapidly as the Bank would have wished. Despite the continuous
lack of counterpart funds and the limited "construction seasons"13, the PMO was able to carry out
project implementation to a high quality. Staff at all levels were highly qualified and extremely
dedicated, working long hours under challenging and harsh conditions. The main institutional
achievement - the establishment of SRBWRMB - can now serve as a demonstration model not
only for China but also internationally.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.6     In view of the "unsatisfactory" rating for government performance, the "satisfactory"
performance of the Implementing Agency and the "moderately satisfactory" achievement of the
PDOs, the overall Borrower performance is rated as "moderately satisfactory."

6. Lessons Learned

6.1       The main lessons from this project relate to: (a) the project's length and complexity; (b)
the project's design and preparation; (c) the stakeholder and social analysis; (d) the importance of
flexibility during implementation; (e) leadership attention; (f) securing counterpart funds; (g)
institutional arrangements; and (h) M&E.

(a) The Project's Length and Complexity. The project was extremely ambitious and its
planned implementation period unusually long. To develop the water source, undertake land
reclamation and development, provide for agricultural and other support, build townships and
villages, resettle tens of thousands of people and establish a new river basin bureau under the



13The construction season in the Hexi Corridor is from May to August, with construction activities in the remaining
part of the year greatly constrained by severe weather conditions.



                                                          19

difficult and harsh, cold desert conditions of the project area was a daunting task. Proper
synchronization and sequencing between infrastructure construction, water mobilization and land
development on the one hand and social development on the other hand should have taken place
over a longer period of time but instead had to be rushed. In hindsight, the project should either
have been designed with a longer implementation period as originally requested by the Borrower
(12 years or more) or have been split into two separate operations consisting of: (i) construction
of the dam and main irrigation facilities; and (ii) resettlement, township and village
establishment, construction of water distribution facilities, agricultural support, and forestry
development. If designed today, the project could have been designed as a phased operation.

(b) Project Design. The main design flaws that surfaced during project implementation related
to the lack of application of internationally-recognized best practice in proper water utilization
ratio and integrated river basin management. There simply was not enough water, based on
international water resource and ecological standards at the time of preparation. This was a
fundamental flaw that should have been caught during the Bank's intensive internal review
process, but was not. It is imperative that the Bank uses effectively its quality control and support
mechanisms, and internal formal and informal quality reviews, to ensure that no significant
design flaws are introduced in projects financed by the Bank.

(c) Stakeholder and Social Analysis. This project demonstrates the importance of proper
stakeholder and social analyses, particularly in the context of complex projects. Clearly, a
thorough stakeholder analysis covering both "move-out" and "move-in" areas should have been
carried out as part of project preparation. It is likely that such an analysis would have revealed
the differing views which the provincial government and the receiving prefecture held with
regard to the project.

(d) Importance of Flexibility. Flexibility during implementation encouraged the effective
correction of the project's design problems, raising attention to the various issues of
environmental and economic sustainability and enabling completion of the project with relatively
satisfactory achievement of the PDOs. It is important for the Bank's supervision teams to be pro-
active and flexible and to respond in a timely manner to unexpected changes and difficulties
during project implementation.

(e) Leadership Attention. Close leadership attention, at various levels and in various forms, is
fundamental to successful project implementation and the resolution of issues arising during
implementation in China. Such attention is also a key prerequisite for putting in place suitable
institutional arrangements. Examples of effective leadership attention are: requests for regular
progress and problem identification reports from lower levels, and personal review of annual
funding requests. Without the close attention by senior leaders in Gansu, the project would not
have been successfully completed.

(f) Securing Counterpart Funds. Difficulties with timely availability of adequate amounts of
counterpart funding is a chronic issue in Bank-financed rural projects in China. This project in
particular demonstrates that relying on counterpart funding sources outside the direct control of
the implementing province is a major risk, as the inability of the project to make use of national
poverty reduction funds had a significant impact on project implementation. To resolve this issue
in future projects, the Bank and the Borrower should agree on a realistic proportion of counterpart
funds based on the payment capacity of the province, specifying sources of the funds and
minimum amounts per project component. Also, the project's counterpart fund requirements
must be included in the relevant provincial bureaus' annual budgets, thus ensuring regular
funding allocations as part of the province's regular budget provisions.

(g) Institutional Arrangements. Integrating project activities with the Borrowers' own
programs and project implementation units within the existing institutional system ensures a



                                                   20

higher degree of ownership, enabling better delivery of funding and technical services. It also
ensures more sustainable post-completion operations. In the case of this project, it was
considered a poverty reduction project but was implemented by the water resources bureau
instead of the poverty reduction office. Had it been designed as a water resources project with a
poverty objective, results might have been better.

(h) Monitoring and Evaluation. The right concept of defining and measuring efficiency and
performance is extremely important in order to monitor and evaluate a project's poverty impact.
In particular, in an environment as dynamic as China's, the concept of a "before and after the
project" comparison cannot properly capture the impact that can be attributed to a project and,
hence, can lead to wrong assumptions in implementation and incorrect conclusions at completion.
It is important to design M&E based on the "with and without" concept and also to integrate
different components of the M&E system to allow for consistent and timely use of monitoring
information.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies

7.1      The preparation of the implementing agency's internal implementation completion report
and the Bank's ICR took place in close cooperation, allowing for in-depth discussions on all
technical issues. As a result, the Bank does not have any comments on the Borrower's summary
report as presented in Annex 7.

7.2      Gansu Provincial Government reviewed the draft ICR and submitted written comments
(as presented in Annex 7) on the rating of the Borrower's Performance and the Bank's
Performance. The Bank considered these comments carefully when finalizing the respective
ratings, but concluded that no new evidence was presented justifying a revision in the ratings.

Annex 1. Project Costs and Financing

1.1     The total project cost was estimated at US$259.2 million (RMB2,697.6 million) at
appraisal and re-estimated at US$229.8 million (RMB1,907.7 million) at the time of the MTR.
The actual cost at project completion was US$211.46 million (RMB1,710.7 million). The actual
cost at completion was about 82 percent (in US$) and 63 percent (in RMB) of the appraised
estimate. The difference is being the result of exchange rate movements14. The cost reduction at
completion was the result of the reduced project scope and scale for the voluntary emigration and
land settlement: the reduction of the total number of resettlers from 200,000 to 75,000; the
reduction of the area of land reclamation and on-farm works for newly developed irrigated land
from 54,610 ha to 27,213 ha; and other related activities (see Section 1.6 of the main report).

1.2     The total actual project cost was about 92 percent of the total costs revised at the time of
the MTR, decreased by about RMB18.4 million to RMB196.9 million. The decrease was
primarily due to: (a) cost savings in procurement; (b) reduced price and physical contingencies;
(c) lower investments for agricultural machinery (about 9 percent of MTR targets and 2 percent
of SAR targets, due to the further adjustment made incorporating government's new subsidy
policy for agricultural machinery during project implementation which included project areas);
(d) reduced numbers of sheep provided to households (because of the lack of the feed in the
newly resettled areas, and difficulty in finding households willing to be responsible for loan
repayment for sheep raising).




14The exchange rates were: at appraisal: US$1 = Y8.4 and SDR1 = US$1.4563; at completion
US$1=Y8.09 and SDR1 = US$1.3859.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

2.1      The project was basically completed within ten years as scheduled. The main output
targets completed for each component compared to the appraisal and MTR estimate are
summarized below:

2.2      A. Changma Dam (US$49.63 million, 94 and 138 percent of MTR and SAR cost
estimate). The dam provides water to all the three irrigation districts. The dam is 54.8 m high
with a crest length of 366 m and a zoned earth fill embankment with a central clay core; A side
channel regulated spillway, with three gates (10 x 8 m), was built with discharge capacity of
1,570 m3/second; an 8.0 m diameter concrete-lined 298 m long flood and silt flushing tunnel on
the right abutment was built ; the water intake concrete-lined tunnel (5.5 m in diameter x 499 m
long) was built on the left abutment to divert water for irrigation downstream after passing
through a surface powerhouse; the powerhouse was built behind left abutment of the dam with a
total installed capacity of 14.25 MW (3 Francis turbines; 2 x 6.5 MW and 1 x 1.25 MW).

2.3      At project completion, a reservoir was created covering about 12 km2 of area with a total
storage capacity of 194 million m3, out of which 80 million m3 is dead storage. The reservoir is
jointly operated with the Shuangta Reservoir and the Chijinxia Reservoir downstream, improving
the irrigation guarantee of existing 43.6 ha and expended 27 ha of irrigation land, and provides 83
million m3 of water for industry purpose. The power house generates 60 million KWH power.

2.4      B. Irrigation and Drainage (US$98 million, 94 and 82 percent of MTR and SAR cost
estimate). This component supports various project activities. At project completion, an
additional total of 71,454 ha of land (43,600 existing land and 27,854 new developed land) is
benefiting from irrigation. Irrigation is provided by 2 headworks, 218 km of trunk canals, 94 km
of main canals, 330 km of branch canals and 500 km of lateral canals, and 160 km of drainage
canals. Provision of irrigation greatly improved crop productivity, land desalination, afforestation,
and soil and water conservation. The irrigation system also provides environment water to
downstream preserved areas and protected ecosystem of the district. An information
modernization system was also established modernizing the management of the SWRB.

2.5      Agricultural Support and Services (US$3.98 million, 86 percent of MTR cost estimate
and 131 percent of SAR, mainly for increased investments in improving saline land). The actual
outputs achieved under this component included: (i) improvement of 13,467 ha of saline land (100
percent of ICR targets) with the establishment of demonstration sites (620 ha, 100 percent of MTR
expected targets); (ii) supporting extension service centers in Yumen, Guanzhou (Anxi) and two
state farms (100 percent and 150 percent of MTR and SAR targets respectively), six agricultural
extension stations in newly established townships and sub-farms (100 percent of MTR targets and
40 percent of SAR targets due to the reduced number of voluntary settlers and townships); (iii)
procured 5 sets of agricultural machinery for 5 administrative villages (about 9 percent of MTR
targets and 2 percent of SAR targets, due to the adjustments made incorporating government's new
subsidy policy for agricultural machinery); (iv) agricultural research for land improvement, soil
testing and monitoring, etc (about RMB0.3 million, about 20 percent of MTR and 25 percent of
SAR estimate).

2.6      Through the newly developed irrigated land and soil improvement, the agricultural output
has increased substantially. In the existing irrigation areas, the annual food grain production was
about 77,465 tons at completion (about 96 and 198 percent of MTR and SAR estimate
respectively), despite decline of the total grain area cultivated (about 40 and 88 percent of the


                                                  24

MTR and SAR estimate). The decline in grain area was caused by falling grain prices after the
government withdrew the grain subsidy and freed the grain market. Cropping pattern was
appropriately adjusted to reflect the market demand. Commodity crop areas at completion
increased from 11,500 ha to about 25,385 ha with total production increased by about 90,874 ton
(about 665 and 83 percent of SAR and MTR estimate); thereby more than off-setting the
reduction in grain production. In the newly developed irrigation area, cash crop production areas
increased by about 18,446 ha with total production increased by about 224,664 ton (about 207
and 116 percent of SAR and MTR estimate).

2.7      Livestock Development (US$1.38 million, about 57 and 58 percent of MTR and SAR
estimate, the investment was reduced mainly due to smaller investment in sheep raising by farm
households (43 percent of the total MTR estimate). According to MTR adjusted targets nine
veterinary extension stations have been established in Yumen, Guazhou (Anxi), the two state farms,
and six newly established townships and sub-farms (100 percent of MTR targets and 50 percent of
SAR targets due to the reduced number of resettlers and townships). Civil works and equipment for
two forage seed production and extension bases in newly reclaimed area have been completed (100
percent of MTR and SAR targets). Establishment of 2,531 ha forage land by farm households has
been completed (103 percent of MTR and 23 percent of SAR target due to the reduced number of
resettlers). Furthermore, the project financed 1,066 breeding sheep, 1,117 sows, and 94,627
chicken (total RMB4.66 million, about 100 percent of MTR, and 89 percent of SAR targets).
Investment for cattle had been switched to sheep, sow and chicken due to market demand in the
local areas. Sheep raising only completed RMB0.25 million (836 sheep, three percent of the MTR
estimate) due to lack of the feed in the newly reclaimed areas and difficulties in finding households
willing to be responsible for loan repayment for the sheep raising.

2.8      Forestry Development (US$5.42 million, about 117 and 174 percent of the MTR and SAR
estimate). This component aimed to protect the fragile land from wind erosion and enhance eco-
environments for crop production and human habitation in the newly developed irrigation areas.
The project increased the vegetative cover from 4.2 percent to 15.3 percent (139 percent of SAR
estimate and 102 percent of MTR estimate). A total of 7,215.8 ha of forests were financed under
the component (about 126 percent of the MTR targets). This includes planting eco-environment
protective forest belts (2,043.5 ha, about 536 and 100.03 percent of SAR and MTR targets
respectively), primary and secondary windbreaks and on-farm trees about 1,487 ha planted along
the canal networks (about 124 percent of MTR targets), farm orchards (268.1 ha), and nurseries (42
ha), soil and water conservation forestry (3381.5 ha). In addition, 13 forestry service centers and
stations have been established in Yumen, Guazhou (Anxi), State Farm, six newly established
townships and sub-farms, and Changma Upper Reach Natural Forestry Reserve Area (100 percent
of MTR targets).

2.9      Environment Protection (US$4.41 million, about 108 and 78 percent of the MTR and
SAR cost estimate). With the forestry development described in section 2.8, the ecological
environment in the whole Shule River Basin has been effectively protected by the project. The
project systematic environmental protection measures had been carried out including the water
environment protection, air pollution control and noise control at the construction sites during the
project implementation; over 200 million m3 water per year of environmental flow provided for
ecological system in the irrigation district and downstream natural conservation areas;
establishment of the sound monitoring and evaluation system/monitoring stations to monitor the
soil and water quality (surface and groundwater); experiments for improvement of saline-alkali
soil (about 14, 247 ha saline wasteland and 13,607 ha wind eroded sandy land had been converted
to farmland in oasis, the desert has changed into green oasis to regulate basin micro-climate and
reduce the water loss and soil erosion, and protect ecological environment); water and soil

conservation works for grass grids, plantation of trees, canal dredging, and garbage treatment
(Y8.86 million financed, about 400 percent of ICR estimate); and the rehabilitation, monitoring
and evaluation of move-out area, especially about Y122.4 million from government subsidy
(about 904 percent of SAR estimate,) financed for land reversion of forestry in move-out area,
including freezing and prohibition of cultivation of steep slope land (more than 25 degree),
afforestation, land terracing, and planting of shrubs and grass.

2.10     Voluntary Resettlement (US$26.07 million, about 99 and 71 percent of the MTR and
SAR estimate). The output targets of this component were revised significantly during the MTR
process. Thee number of resettlers were reduced from 200,000 to 75,000, and all other project
output targets were reduced accordingly (see section 1.6).          At project completion, 75,387
resettlers from 11 of the poorest counties in Gansu had voluntarily emigrated and settled on the
new developed irrigated land under the assistance and subsidies as project planned (about 100.5
percent of MTR target), all new infrastructures and facilities for public services in the new sites
had been constructed and established, including 6 new townships (100 percent of MTR targets),
46 administration villages (about 81 percent of MTR target), 50 primary schools (about 88
percent of MTR target), 6 middle schools (about 100 percent of MTR target), 6 hospitals (about
100 percent of MTR target), 46 clinics (about 81 percent of MTR target), and total RMB67.75
million invested in road, water and power supply (about 110.8 percent of MTR target). In
addition, all other components supported the newly developed irrigation areas including irrigation
and drainage facilities, land and soil improvement, agricultural production technologies and
services, quality seed production, rural roads and electricity, and WUA development.

2.11     Institutional Strengthening and Development (US$22.6 million, about 101.6 percent of
MTR estimate and 177.7 percent of SAR estimate).                Various activities including water
management system reform, research, training, study tours, technical assistance, project M&E,
and provision of office facilities provided under the project were fully completed, achieving
substantial results in strengthening the management and technical capabilities of PMOs at all
levels.

(a) Water Resources Management System Reform. The water resources management system
was reformed and strengthened by establishment of the Shule River Water Resources
Management Bureau of Gansu Province, WUAs (87 WUA established in all existing villages in
project areas ­ a sub-component added during the MTR), and an Automatic Information
Monitoring and Simulation Management System for monitoring. The management system reform
ensures integrated water resources (including surface and groundwater) management in Shule
River Basin, joint operation of the three reservoirs, environmental protection for irrigation district
and downstream areas, and sustainable development of Shule River Basin; increases farmers'
participatory management and secures water fee collection; and information management of the
river basin by provision of effective and scientific means of tracking surface and groundwater
supply and quality, and decision making support in improvement of irrigation and water resources
management measures in the Basin.

(b) Research, Training, Study Tours, Technical Assistance, and M&E: A number of applied
research and studies were satisfactorily carried out by international, national and provincial
research institutions and experts (with consultancy assistance from Canada Jiahua hydro-power
engineering group, China Academy of Water Resources and Hydro-power Science, Xian Industry
and Science University, Gansu provincial Academy of Water Resources and Science, and Yumen
Agricultural Extension Center, etc.) at a total cost of about RMB1.86 million. The applied
research and studies covered various aspects including dam safety, saline lands improvement,
water saving irrigation, impact of soil salinity in Shuangta Reservoir, crop protection and
cultivation, livestock breed variety, forestry development and management, and river basin water



                                                  26

resources and irrigation management, etc. The research and study results are relevant and have
been disseminated in the project area during project implementation.

(c) Training completed included PMOs' staff training at a total investment of about RMB4.28
million (122 percent of MTR estimate and 104 percent of SAR estimate), covering topics in: (i)
procurement, disbursement, and M&E; (ii) operation, maintenance and management of large
irrigation areas and hydropower stations; (iii) water resources monitoring, simulation and
dispatch in Shule River Basin; (iv) management of large-scale human settlements; (v)
optimization of agricultural production in arid regions, covering crops, livestock and forestry; and
(vi) drainage and water and soil salinity control. Farm households/settlers' training was carried
out about 72,396 person-times (about 60 percent of SAR target due to the reduced number of
settlers). This training covered areas such as: irrigation technology, arable farming, fruit growing,
and livestock production. The overseas and local study tours involved a total of 303 person-times
(about 103 percent of MTR and SAR targets). Eleven overseas study tours on various technical
training topics took place to USA, Australia, European and Canada, involving a total of 72
person-times (about 116.13 percent of MTR targets).

(d) Monitoring was carried out by independent institutes. The impact of the voluntary
resettlement was monitored and annually evaluated by Lanzhou University. A total of 10
monitoring reports from 1997-2006 were prepared by the Shule River Project Implementation
Office covering all project areas. Surface and ground water and soil quality were monitored and
evaluated by several Water Environment Center of Gansu Hydrology and Water Resources
Investigation Bureau and other relevant universities and institutes. Annual Environmental
Management Reports and several other environmental reports concerning water and soil quality
and cultural relic protection were prepared and send to the Bank and government authorities.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

3.1      Methodology and Assumptions. The economic rate of return (ERR) and Net Present
Value (NPV) at completion have been recalculated using data from the project M&E system.
Methodology and assumptions used are very similar to those adopted at appraisal and Mid-Term
Review (MTR) to maximize comparability. The data on output/input prices, wages, water and
electricity prices, yields and other data were updated from appraisal and MTR. The ERR and
NPV were calculated across four out of seven project components and the overall project ERR
was obtained as the investment-weighted average of the four ERRs.

3.2      Estimates of the NPV and ERR are based on the data collected from three irrigation
districts (ID) of the project: Changma ID, Shuangta ID and Huahai ID. Actual investment costs
reported by the project were used to account for investments. In calculating the ERR for the
component, investments in overall institution building and dam construction were incorporated on
a pro rata basis as a cost. At the ICR, the Irrigation and Drainage Component accounted for 86.3
percent of total project investments, Forestry Development Component for 4.8 percent, Livestock
Development Component for 1.8 percent and Hydropower Stations Component for 7.1 percent.

3.3      Net Present Value and Economic Rate of Return. The project NPV at completion was
estimated at RMB21.5 million. With the ERR at 12.2 percent, the project's rate of return just
equals the social rate of return (Table A3.1). For the project's Irrigation and Drainage
Component (the project's largest component), the NPV and the ERR are the lowest in Changma
ID where the new reclaimed area is the largest on which it takes longer to reach the production
potential prevailing on the existing irrigated areas, and where the natural conditions to produce
cotton ­ the most profitable cash-generating crop in Gansu Hexi Corridor ­ are least favorable.
The project NPV estimate at completion is much lower than the one estimated at appraisal but
larger than estimated at MTR. This is because of the changes in the project's scale during the
MTR and economic reasons, as explained below.

3.4      At appraisal, all project components were expected to have a robust rate of return,
allowing for high efficiency at completion. During the MTR, project components were revised
and scaled down, and the investments costs were adjusted to the revised scope of the project
components. In addition to revising the number of resettlers, existing and new reclaimed irrigated
areas, structure of cropping areas, yields and prices, the MTR substantially changed the Livestock
Development Component. From the ten original subcomponents of the Livestock Development
Component, only three subcomponents remained after the MTR. Those included Forage Seed
Production Base, Breeding Development and Livestock Production Base. At appraisal, the
livestock subcomponents sought to establish large chicken and pig farms, but at MTR they were
dropped due to changes in market conditions.

3.5      The ERR at completion includes the returns from five hydropower stations, the
construction of which were financed by the project but the details for ERR analysis were
unknown at appraisal.

3.6      In addition to differences in prices and yields' assumptions at different stages and the
delayed/reduced resettlement, changes in irrigation areas and in cropping patterns were the major
determinants of the Irrigation and Drainage Component's ERR and consequently the total
project's ERRs given the large share of this component in total project investments. The new
irrigation area at MTR was adjusted downwards compared with appraisal but the actual
reclamation area at completion exceeded the MTR target (Table A3.2). Moreover, tremendous
changes were observed in the cropping pattern which was the result of shifts from grain
production for subsistence to cash-generating crops such as cotton, spices, Chinese herbs,
vegetables, hops and safflower. This strong supply response to market incentives allowed for
increased benefits that, to some extent, compensated for the losses from the delayed/reduced
resettlement and the smaller irrigation area.

3.7      The lower NPV (ERR) of the Livestock Development Component at completion
compared to the one at MTR is the result of the slow progress in construction activities which
caused the delayed resettlement and failure in predicting the demand of the resettlers for livestock
raising. The move-in area is part of the Gobi Desert with very limited natural pasture. At the
outset, the resettled households were preoccupied with land improvements and crop production
activities. With no natural pasture and little forage available, investments into animal husbandry
were reduced, resulting in the low ERR.

3.8      The value of separate calculations of the financial rate of return was considered
negligible, as markets in China are now well integrated, prices have limited distortions and
farmers are exempted from taxes.

3.9      Sensitivity Analysis. Given that the Irrigation and Drainage Component makes up 86
percent of the total investment, the project's overall ERR critically depends on the ERR of this
component. The ERR of this component was found to fluctuate between 7.6-12.0 percent in
Changma ID, between 11.7-15.9 percent in Shuangta ID and between 7.9-15.7 percent in Huahai
ID, given a 10 percent decrease/increase of the gross revenue from agricultural activities.

3.10     The ERR is particular sensitive to the changes in price incentives for cotton production.
At project completion, cash-income crops, mainly cotton, but also spices, Chinese herbs and
others, in Changma ID accounted for 63 percent of total cropping area, 91 percent in Shuangta ID
and 85 percent in Huahai ID. A 20 percent decrease in cotton prices at farm-gate would result in
a decrease of the ERR by 2.2 percentage points, with the highest decrease by 4 percentage points
in Huahai ID and the lowest by 1 percentage point in Changma ID. A 30 percent fall in cotton
prices would reduce the Irrigation and Drainage Component's ERR from 11.9 percent to 8.6
percent. For Huahai ID, the ERR would decrease from 12.2 percent to 5.9 percent, while the
declines in the remaining irrigation districts are smaller.

Annex 4. Poverty Impacts
4.1      Significant improvements in the resettlers' welfare and poverty were recorded. At
appraisal, the average annual per capita income of the future resettlers in situ was estimated to be
about RMB248. At completion, the average per capita income estimated for the largest
resettlement townships increased to RMB1,810 (see Table A of the Data Sheet). Since the
resettlers were reallocated to the new reclaimed areas, the increase in per capita income
(RMB1,562 per capita ­ Table A4.1) can be fully attributed to the project. The results remain
significantly positive even after the changes in per capita income in "move-in" areas is corrected
for the changes in income in "move-out" areas, i.e. to allow for the changes which would have
happened in the absence of the project (a "difference in difference" evaluation). Since the
average per capita income in the "move-out" areas ("without project") increased by RMB968 (to
RMB1,216), the per capita income increase, fully attributable to the project, is RMB59415.

Note: (i) the average per capita income was approximately RMB248 at appraisal; (ii) the resettlement to
"move-in" areas originated from "move-out" counties as shown in the table; (iii) for the move-in areas, the
income data is derived from the project M&E, based on surveys of 180 households. In 2006, the total
number of surveyed households in all "move-in" townships was 576; (iv) for the "move-out" areas, the
income used is the township's average as reported by the local statistical bureaus in 2006.

4.2      The smallest income increase was reported in Zhahua township (Changma ID) and the
largest in Bijiatan township (Huahai ID). The differences in income growth were determined by
the parallel income developments in the comparable townships ("move-out" versus "move-in"),
the time of relocation and the quality of land the households were relocated to. Relocation to
Changma ID was the largest and, thus delayed the most. In addition, Changma ID had the largest
areas of newly-reclaimed land that required more time and investments (i.e., soil leaching and
other desalinization measures) to reach the productivity of existing irrigated areas, and it is less
suitable to cotton production, the major cash crop in the Hexi Corridor.

4.3      Although the project's M&E system did not collect poverty headcount data, the income
distribution across surveyed households sheds some light on the poverty situation. It suggests
with high likelihood that the majority of the project's "move-in" households succeeded in
escaping absolute poverty by 2006. At the outset of the project, most of the resettlers were
"absolute poor." Table A4.2 shows that in 1999 the net per capita income of the most `fresh'
resettlers was below the absolute poverty line of RMB30016. In 2003, about 70 percent of the



15This is a conservative estimate. The project's contribution was probably higher. The people in "move-
out" areas obtained "Grain for Green" subsidy at approximately RMB200 per mu for conversion of
cultivated slope land to grasses and forests. Excluding this subsidy from per capita income calculations in
the "move-out" areas increases the project's contribution to resettlers' income growth to about RMB800.
16The "absolute poverty line" includes food poverty, while the "relative-poor poverty line" combines both
food and non-food poverty lines as determined by the provincial statistical bureau.



                                                     32

resettlers were still below both the absolute and relatively-poor poverty lines of RMB630 and
RMB879 per capita, respectively. In 2006, however, none of the surveyed households lived in
absolute poverty (the absolute poverty line at that time having been raised to RMB650), and only
38 percent still had a per capita income below the "relatively-poor" poverty line of RMB956.
While the income distribution within the townships is not known and the poverty headcount may
exceed the level ones presented in Table A4.2, the large poverty reduction impacts of the project
on the resettled households is clear.

4.4      While significant improvements in poverty reduction were achieved by comparison with
Chinese-poverty thresholds, the majority of the resettlers, except some of those living in Huahai
ID, continue to live below the Bank's poverty line of US$1 per day (equaling to about RMB2,800
per capita). This raises the question of whether the Bank investments were justified and if there
were better alternatives to the investment (e.g., investing in the "move-out" areas). For the latter,
investment opportunities for economic and human development in the "move-out" mountainous
areas were and continue to be extremely limited. For the former, the investments can be seen as
justified if one takes into account the positive future outlook for poverty reduction in the move-in
areas. Since the relocation was delayed, most of the resettlers did not achieve their full income
potential from agriculture and off-farm activities at the time of the ICR (see paragraph 3.5.5 in the
main text), but their outlook looks very promising as land productivity has great potential to
increase, the reliable irrigation promotes diversification, and as the farmers increasingly master
new farm techniques (none of which can be said about the "move-out" areas). There, as
population continues to grow, scarce natural resources continue to be over used, causing
continued high reliance on subsidies such as "Grain for Green".

4.5      Resettlement to Hexi corridor has significantly increased the income-generation
opportunities both on- and off-farm. The project provided the irrigation infrastructure and water
that enabled farmers to diversify from grains to more profitable cash crops. In 2006, the average
ratio of planted area for grains and cash crops was 15/85 compared to the expected 70/30 at
appraisal17. Furthermore, the resettled farmers have now received training in modern farm
technologies and have had access to effective extension services. As a result, the income of


17According to M&E information, in 2006 the net income (gross income from sales of main and by-
products minus variable costs) from cotton, for example, was reported to be 63 percent higher than that of
wheat , the main grain crop in the Gansu Hexi Corridor.

moved-in members of households from agriculture was six times as high as the income of any
remaining members of the household in the "move-out" villages (Table A4.3). Similarly, by
moving to the new areas some members of the resettled households increased their opportunities
to earn off-farm.

4.6      Furthermore, the project, by investing in schools, kindergartens, clinics and hospitals,
ensured the delivery of important public services to the resettlers. In the project's move-in areas,
the school participation rate was reported at 99.2 percent in 2006, compared to the average 96.8
percent in the move-out counties18. Now the resettlers' children overnight at home with their
families (instead of boarding) and spend less time to reach school; this is a significant benefit
compared to many children in the "move-out" mountainous areas, which is not reflected in the
school participation rate. The number of doctors per 1,000 people in the "move-in" areas
increased from 0.65 in 2003 to 0.94 in 2006. The delivery and quality of better public services,
therefore, has greatly improved the welfare of the resettlers and the future of their children, far
exceeding the current income gains.




18The data for the "move-out" counties is based on information from Dongxiang, Jishishan and Minxian
counties.

19The reduction in per capita grain production does not translate into an unsatisfactory outcome ­ rather it
is a positive sign that production shifted from food grains to higher-value crops as supported by Indicator 3.
20Despite the small under-achievement, the outcome against original PDO is rated as "satisfactory"
because the actual result is based on a cultivated area half that established as at appraisal target.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on ICR


Borrower's Comments on ICR

A Letter of Gansu Water Resources Department Concerning the Revision of the Implementation
& Completion Report on the Shule River Project of the World Bank (WB). May 30, 2007




Representative Office of the World Bank in Beijing,

The report you submitted on April 30, 2007 was forwarded to Gansu Water Resources
Department, Gansu Development and Reform Commission and Gansu Finance Department by
the Administration of Agriculture Irrigation and Migrant Relocation of Gansu's Hexi Corridor
(Shule River Project Construction Management Bureau). The report is basically comprehensive
and objective. After a further study of the report, we concluded that the Gansu Provincial
Government played an important role in project preparation, its mid-term adjustment, completing
the management structure, mobilizing supporting funds and properly settling various kinds of
complicated problems during the relocation of the local people. The government adopted a series
of effective measures for the smooth operation of the project and achieved remarkable results. At
the same time, WB also did a lot of work in the preparation and implementation of the project.
Scientific evaluation was made and many obstacles were identified and tackled during the
construction thanks to the effort of WB, who made indispensable contributions to the due
completion of the project and its functioning. It is because of the effective work of and the great
importance attached by Gansu Provincial Government, together with the active work of WB, that
the construction goals of the Shule River Project was fully realized.

Therefore, WB should change its comment on the performance of the Gansu Provincial
Government from "Unsatisfactory" to "Satisfactory", and its comment on WB performance
should be revised as "Satisfactory" rather than "Moderately Satisfactory".

Attachment: Statement of the Reasons for Revising the Comments on the
Performance of the Gansu Provincial Government and the World Bank


The Implementation & Completion Report on the Shule River Project of WB pertinently
reviewed and assessed the achievements made during the implementation of the Hexi Corridor
project for which Gansu province got loans from WB. However, the report graded the
performance of the government as "Unsatisfactory" and that of WB "Moderately Unsatisfactory".
As far as we are concerned, this does not conform with the real situation of the province and the
project implementation, and should be revised accordingly.

I. Changing the comment on the performance of the Gansu Provincial Government
from "Unsatisfactory" into "Satisfactory"

The Gansu Provincial Government has always attached great importance to the WB funded Hexi
Corridor project. During the more than 10 years from the initial planning to the accomplishment,
the government organized for many times coordination meetings to solve major problems arising
from the project. It also vigorously provided for the organization construction, project
management, fund mobilization, etc, thus greatly facilitated the project implementation and
realization.

(I) Great importance attached by the government to the establishment and completion of the
organizational and management institution ensuring smooth implementation of the project.
The WB funded Hexi Corridor project was signed in 1996, and was listed as a key agriculture
development project by the Gansu Provincial Government for the "Ninth Five-Year Plan" and the
"2010 Prospects" of the province. The project was designated as a state-level key development
project by relevant department. To ensure smooth implementation of the project, the provincial
government established an Execution Committee for the project. The committee was chaired by
the provincial governor. The Shule River Construction Management Administration was also
established, and corresponding project offices were set up in Yumen City, Anxi County and the
Provincial Agricultural Cooperation for the project construction and daily management. The
establishment of the institutions provided for the effective management and operation of the
project. Besides, during the implementation of the project, top provincial officials listened to
reports for many times, organized coordinating conferences, and carried out in-depth
investigations to make sure that the project was proceeding according to the plan.

(II) Successfully mobilizing the supporting fund and solving the problem of migrant relocation.
At the time when the project was signed, the total investment was calculated at 2.697 billion
RMB, out of which around 1.26 billion RMB would come from the loans of WB, with 1.437
billion RMB of domestic supporting fund. After the 2004 mid-term adjustment, the total
investment was reduced to 1.97 billion RMB, and the WB loan and domestic fund stood at 996
million RMB and 974 million RMB respectively. As of end of May 2007, a total of 968. 54
million RMB of supporting funds had been mobilized, accounting for 99.44% of the expected
amount. In the beginning of the project, because of national policy changes, the originally
planned poverty-alleviation supporting fund could not be used for the construction of key projects,
resulting in delays of supporting funds compared to the project plan in the first years. But during
the implementation, the Gansu Provincial Government overcame the difficulty of a tight budget
and arduous poverty-alleviation task, spared no efforts in mobilizing domestic supporting fund,
and finally received 320 million RMB of national debt funds, offsetting the deficit in the domestic
supporting fund. The domestic supporting fund was further supplemented in later period of the
project implementation and some postponed subsidiary projects were finished on time.


                                                 39

Meanwhile, the provincial government also managed to find money for the community level
investments and operation of 75,000 migrants, through earmarked transfers, facilitating the
realization of the poverty-alleviation goals according to the timetable. In addition, to ensure the
smooth completion of the follow-up programs, the Provincial Finance Department added some
supporting funds for the project to the 2007 budget, quite satisfactorily solving the funding
problem of the project.

Migration is a major development goal of the project. During the construction of the project, the
provincial government consulted for many times with the local governments and competent
departments for the relocation of migrants. Consensus was reached, local governments were able
to bear the overall picture of the province in mind and actively participated in the construction
and development of the project, and successfully integrated the migration work into the local
administration. Also, policy and fund support was given to the community construction in the
areas of culture, education and health for the migrants because of the local governments. At
present, the hand-over of 3 migrant townships constructed within the framework of the project
has been properly solved, and the hand-over of state-owned farms is underway. All these fully
illustrate, that the local governments and people bore the overall picture in mind, and made great
contribution to the smooth implementation of the Shule River project, as well as to the poverty-
alleviation and well-off of the migrants. The WB ICR report's statement that "Jiuquan area is
reluctant towards the project, and is unwilling to accept migrants coming from poor areas" does
not conform to the real situation.

(III) Improving the project design

The initial design of the project was carried out and accomplished more than 10 years ago.
According to the requirements of competent departments of the country and WB, Gansu province
asked designing companies with qualification to make elaborate designs for the project
construction. The early idea was to fully utilize the water and land resources. As the plan turned
out, utilization of water resources of the Shule River reached 91.6%. Whereas, there was little
potential for sustainable development and eco-environmental water consumption. Having said
that, with the adjustment of domestic policies, the Gansu Provincial Government made timely
adjustment on the scale of the Shule River project, which was endorsed by WB. With the
coordination of the provincial government, a conference assessing and evaluating the eco-
environment of the river valley was held, and the project plan was modified for several times,
further improving the water utilization efficiency and ensuring the water supply of the eco-
environment construction.

To conclude, it is suggested that WB change the comment on the performance of the
Gansu Provincial Government from "Unsatisfactory" to "Satisfactory".




                                                  40

II. Statement of reasons against the comment on WB performance

During the preparation and implementation of the project, the performance of WB was satisfying.

(I) Timely adjusting the scale of the project, and making plan for the sustainable development of
water resources utilization
At the very beginning, proceeding from the idea of fully utilizing the water and land resources in
the Shule River valley and tackling the poverty of 200 million migrants in central-south Gansu as
soon as possible, WB set the water utilization rate at 91.6%, in the special background of solving
the grain problem of poverty-stricken farmers in Gansu. During the implementation of the project,
WB, proceeding from the drainage water resources balance and eco-environment protection,
made timely adjustment of the too-high water resources utilization rate and the development scale
of 200 million migrants with 819,000 Mu of land, making the project more suitable for
sustainable development. It has been proved that the provincial government and WB were right in
making the mid-term adjustment of the project. Now, the goal of increasing individual income for
barely poor population in the project area has been fulfilled comprehensively, with the migrants
shifting from self-supporting grain production to the production of economic crops. More
importantly, the prospect of increasing the income and poverty-alleviation of the farmers is more
optimistic in the accepting areas than in the providing areas. The goals of increasing Gansu's
agriculture production and protecting & recovering the eco-environment have been
comprehensively realized.

(II) Frequent supervision and examination, tackling key problems

During the implementation of the project (May, 1996--April, 2007), WB supervising team
visited the Shule River project more than 20 times, altogether 113 person-times. The team was
able to give rational, detailed, concrete and feasible opinions and suggestions to the party of
Gansu in a timely, objective and candid manner, enabling the Gansu Provincial Government to
study and solve such major issues as drainage institution management, bidding & procurement,
quality process control, provincial supporting fund, settlement of voluntary and non-voluntary
migrations, environmental protection, expenditure reimbursement, water administration system
reform and association of water-consuming farmers. This provided strong support and help to the
project management institutions for their accurate understanding of the WB policy and
requirements and for improving their work in the project management.

(III) Introducing WB management methods, improving the project management level

During the construction of the project, many experts from WB had on-site visit to the project, and
provided technical consultation and help in the field of dam safety, eco-environment protection,
saline land improvement, bidding process, informationization of the irrigated areas, etc. This
helped the management institutions in understanding correctly the WB policy and requirements,
and helped established a set of more effective comprehensive management mechanism and
procedures, pushing forward the party of Gansu to continuously strengthen the control over
project process, quality and investment, and to improve the level of standard management of the
project, which ensures the quality and effectiveness of the project. At the same time, this helped
in the training of a group of talents good at WB project management, raising the management
level of the project.




                                                  41

(IV) Spotting and solving problems, increasing the sustainability of the project

During the implementation of the project, WB raised the question of a too-high water utilization
rate, which stood at 91.6%, adjusted the scale for land development and migrants relocation,
suggested a 15% increase of forest and grassland area, and helped to solve such problems as
water resources allocation, migrants relocation, saline land improvement and dam safety. WB
also coordinated the solution of problems affecting the project construction, such as the
supporting fund, water resources balance and environmental protection, making the project
implementation and realization of the goals more sustainable.

(V) Pushing forward the reform of the drainage water resources management system, promoting
democratic management in the irrigated area
WB supervising team followed closely the system reform of the water resources management of
the Shule River drainage and gave feedbacks to the provincial government for many times. It also
held meetings with competent department, put forward suggestions and requirements, helped
established the water resources management institutions of the drainage, and actively promoted
the water resources management system reform in the drainage area with the associations of
water consuming farmers participating in the management. Under the guidance and help of WB,
there came into being 87 associations of water consuming farmers in the Shule River irrigation
area, and the water resources management system evolved from a simplistic one dominated by
the government into a system involving industry management, social management and
participation of water consuming farmers. WB played a very big role in the water resources
management reform of the Shule River drainage area.

(VI) Scientific management methods and sense of responsibility endorsing the success of the
project implementation
WB set an example for the working team of Gansu province, by the scientific rigorous and
realistic working style.

Mr. Lang S. Tay, former TTL of WB paid 11 supervising visits to the project between 1995 and
June 2000. He was able to, after discovering problems, put forward rational opinions and
suggestions to the Gansu Provincial Government objectively and candidly. He helped lay a good
foundation for the project by supervising and coordination the solution to problems such as
institution establishment, bidding & procurement, migrants' relocation, environmental protection,
training & visit and supporting fund.

Mr. Richard Reidinger, former TTL project manager, organized 11-16 times of supervising visits
to the project between June 2000 and October 2003. He actively proposed and urged the
government to establish water resources management institutions in the drainage area, and
develop associations of water consuming farmers. He suggested the project institutions to
introduce advanced technology and management experience at home and abroad, for the
promotion of water administration reform, and made remarkable achievement.

Mrs. Sari Söderström, TTL of WB, headed 16-21 supervisions to the project. She actively pushed
forward the system reform for the water resources management and the water administration in
the drainage area. She helped to promote the participation of the associations of water consuming
farmers in the management system. Based on 10 years' practice and experiences in the project,
she did earnest and pragmatic work for the successful implementation of the project.

In November 2001, Mr. Daniel (Ritchie), who led a quality inspection team from WB
headquarters, made such remarks, "The Hexi Corridor Shule River project is very well managed


                                                42

among all WB projects. For three reasons, I am very much impressed: Firstly, the supervision
work is aimed at solving problems. The problems are discovered, raised and tackled in the timely
manner; Secondly, the two parties of the project demonstrated a great deal of flexibility regarding
the solution of problems. It is very important to make necessary adjustment and take a flexible
approach towards the solution of problems during the process of project implementation and
supervision; Thirdly, relevant policies of WB were well observed and carried out. They are
concerned with non-voluntary migration, environmental protection, dam safety, cultural heritage,
ethnic minority, etc. My overall comment on the project is `very satisfactory'".

In conclusion, it is suggested that the comment on WB performance in the project
should be changed from "Moderately Unsatisfactory" into "Satisfactory".

Summary of Borrower's ICR

1 Background

Located in the western part of Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province, Shule River Basin covers an
area of 41.3 thousand km2, with its mainstream river totaling 670 km in length and 1.031 billion
m3 in terms of long term average runoff. The river basin includes three irrigation districts (IDs),
namely Changma, Shuangta and Huahai, consisting of 27 townships and 3 state farms situated in
Yumen City and Guazhou (previously Anxi) County. In order to solve the poverty problem for
the tens of thousands people in the 11 counties in arid central Gansu province or in the high and
cold mountainous areas of southern Gansu province, the provincial government put forward the
strategy "developing the western area while aiding the central area through implementing poverty
reduction and development program" and decided to develop the rich water and soil resources in
the Shule River Basin through implementing the Hexi Corridor Project (the Project) following the
World Bank policies for poverty reduction and environmental protection and improvement.

The feasibility study of the Project was completed in 1994. In October 1995, the World Bank
conducted formal appraisal of the Project. With approval of the State Council, the Project was
listed in the national Ninth Five Year Plan as the major project for Gansu Province. On July 2,
1996, the Government of P. R. China officially signed with the World Bank the Project
Agreement, the Development Credits Agreement and the Loan Agreement for the Project,
defining that a World Bank loan totaling USD 150 million would be used for the Project with an
estimated total investment of RMB2.673 billion to support land reclamation of 54,600 ha,
resettlement of 200 thousand people and irrigation development of 97,800 ha.

In 2002, a Mid Term Review (MTR) of the Project was conducted in line with common
understanding reached between the provincial government and the World Bank on water
resources bearing capacity of the Shule River Basin, eco-environmental protection and
counterpart funding, resulting in reduction of resettlement scale from originally planned 200
thousand persons to 75 thousand persons, decrease of number of new resettlement
townships/farms from 16 to 6, decrease of number of resettlement administrative villages from
160 to 57, land reclamation downsized from 54,600 ha to 28,533.33 ha, forest and grass coverage
rate increased from 11% to 15%, water resources utilization ratio reduced from 91.6% to 64.5%,
and the Project total investment reduced from RMB2.673 billion to RMB1.971 billion.

The Project was launched in May 1996 and accomplished in December 2006. The successful
implementation of the Project had played an important role in solving the poverty problem for the
tens of thousands resettles in the central and southern Gansu province, enhancing the sustainable
social, economic and ecological development of the Shule River Basin in the Hexi Corridor.

2 Project Objectives

The main project objectives were: (1) to relocate 200 thousand (75 thousand as per MTR
adjustment) people from the central and southeastern Gansu province where the natural
conditions are poor to the new irrigation districts developed in the project areas within the Shule
River Basin; (2) to upgrade and increase agricultural production in Gansu province, particularly
grain and cash crops' outputs; (3) to protect and restore the deteriorated eco-environment.
Through 10 years' implementation, the Project had fully realized these three main objectives and
each of its components had basically accomplished or exceeded the development goals defined in
MTR, presenting outstanding economic, social and ecological benefits.



                                                  44

3 Achievements and Benefits of the Project

The Project had been completed as scheduled and given full benefits, including apparent
economic, social and ecological benefits produced thanks to full completion of the water
resources, resettlement, agricultural, forestry and live stock development components.

3.1 Construction of Water Engineering Works and Development of New
Agricultural Irrigation Districts

    · Funded by the Project, the Changma Reservoir, a grade-2 large scale reservoir with a
       storage capacity of 194 million m3, was fully completed and put into operation. Under
       combined regulation together with Shuangta and Chijinxia reservoirs at the downstream,
       the Changma reservoir is now functioning to serve multiple purposes including runoff
       regulation, flood retention and control, agricultural irrigation, industrial and domestic
       water supply, ecological water delivery, fishery, tourism, hydro-power generation, etc. As
       a result, the historical problem of spring and summer droughts in the irrigation areas
       along Shule River was terminated.
    · In the 3 IDs, the Project supported new and improved main canals of 681.64 km, main
       and branch drainage canals of 152 km, canals at branch level totaling 147 in number and
       1094.6 km in total length, resulting in great increase of canal water use efficiency (from
       54% to 62% for Changma ID, from 43% to 62% for Shuangta ID, from 54% to 62% for
       Huahai ID) and thus realization of the component's objective as designed.
    · The Project made it possible to ensure normal operation of and power generation by the
       18 small-sized hydropower stations at the downstream of the river basin, the produced
       power totals 280 million kWh with a revenue of approximately RMB45 million.
    · Water diversion and utilization increased from 430 million m3 in 1995 to 926 million m3
       in 2006, which made it possible for developing new irrigation area of 27,854 ha and
       guaranteeing irrigation for the existing farm land of 43,600 ha, thus the irrigated area
       reached 71,454 ha in total. In 2006, the total water fee collected was RMB33.77 million,
       water supply for industrial uses totaled 82.75 million m3, the amount of water reserved
       for ecological uses totaled 220 million m3.
    · The project area expanded from originally 13 townships and 3 state farms to 27
       townships and 3 state farms, with agricultural population increased from 105,890 at
       appraisal time to 195,891.
    · Along with full completion of the Project and implementation of integrated water
       resources management, regulation and utilization of water resources had been fully
       upgraded in the river basin, with canal water use efficiency upgraded greatly, flood
       pressure reduced and lives and properties of the local people in the downstream areas
       safeguarded.
    · Project construction drove forward development of the local economy as a whole, and
       facilitated development of sectors including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and
       the others, providing not only strong guarantee for comprehensive agricultural
       development and resettlement, but also a solid foundation for all-rounded, coordinated
       and sustainable social and economic development in the locality.




                                                  45

3.2 Full Completion of Resettlement Tasks and Basic Realization of Poverty
Reduction Objectives

By using the new resettlement approach of "preparing unified plan, setting up demonstrative pilot
and implementing whole village relocation," totally 75.378 thousand people ( 31,424 persons in
the agricultural farms, 30,576 persons in the administrative areas of Jiuquan Municipality, and
13,378 persons of spontaneous relocatees) were relocated on a voluntary basis in the past 10 years
from 11 counties in the central or southern parts of Gansu province, including Linxia, Hezheng,
Yongjing, Jishishan, Dongxiang, Minxian, Tanchang, Wudu, Lixian, Lintan, Zhouqu. Involuntary
resettlement was implemented because of construction of Changma Reservoir, involving totally
580 people from 159 households. Community service facilities established for the resettlement
purpose include buildings for the township governments, village committees, schools and
hospitals/clinics for the 6 townships/farms, 57 administrative villages and 8 natural villages.
Canals, access roads and tree belts had been completed in the newly established irrigation areas,
and the resettlement areas had been served with adequate water and power supply facilities and
roads. In 2006, the per capita net income of the relocatees reached RMB1,548, an increase by
500% compared with that of RMB300 when the resettlement was initiated, and the resettlement
objective defined as "first year moving in, second year settling down, third year having ample
food and clothes" had been basically realized.

3.3 Agricultural Restructuring and Increase of Both Agricultural Production and
Farmers' Income

Under the Project, adjustments were conducted to the scale of irrigation areas, irrigation system,
ratios of cropping, forestry, and livestock raising in the overall agricultural sector, cropping mix.
Totally 22,061.33 ha of land in the new irrigation areas had been leveled and equipped with
auxiliary on-farm structures, salinity improvement had covered an area of 10,267 ha,
desertification improvement and shelter trees had covered an area of 5,573 ha, forest land and
grass land had reached 3,800 ha and 666 ha, respectively, so that forest and grass coverage rate in
the project area had exceeded 15%. In 2006, livestock raised totaled 72 thousand heads and the
agricultural production value in the irrigation areas increased to RMB1,034 million from that of
RMB435 million at appraisal in 1996, ratio of grain and cash crops changed to 2:8 from
previously 8: 2, particularly cotton area reached 37,333 ha, resulting in farmers' income increase
by RMB250 million annually.

Income of the relocatees has been increasing year by year through cropping, livestock raising,
processing and labor service operations, their per capita net income increased to around
RMB1,500 in 2006 from that of below RMB600 before 2000, a net increase of RMB900.
According to analysis of the per capita land occupation in rural areas of Gansu province, the
newly reclaimed land can support 128 thousand people. If using the current per capita agricultural
added value in the calculation, the annual net contribution of the Project to agricultural added
value and GDP is RMB209 million and RMB260 million, respectively. In the new irrigation
districts, irrigated oases with an area of 27,854 ha of productive land and well-developed tree
belts had been formed with support of the Project and played an important role in increasing
farmers' production and income.

3.4 Eco-environmental Improvement and Harmonious Development of the IDs

For purposes of sustainable water resources utilization and eco-environmental protection,
adjustments to the project scale were conducted during MTR, including reduction of water



                                                  46

resources utilization ratio from 91.6% to 64.5%, increase of forest and grass land coverage from
11% to 15%, reserve of ecological water use of 220 million m3. Since more than half of the newly
reclaimed land of 27,846 ha was originally typical source area for wind erosion sands, the
reclamation of such area improved the sand source area and the local climate through turning it
into cultivated land and then oases. Combined regulation of the three reservoirs, including
Changma, Shuangta and Chijinxia reservoirs, can ensure annual ecological water delivery of a
total amount of 220 million m3 to the Ganhaizi natural reserve in Yumen City, Qiaozi ecological
reserve in Guazhou County, the national ecological reserve West Lake in Dunhuang City and the
wind-break and sand dune fixing tree belts in the irrigation areas, so as to restore the natural eco-
systems at the downstream, including the large area of popular diversifolia trees, effectively
protect the eco-environment in the river basin and realize harmonious development of human and
nature.

4 Major Factors Affecting Project Implementation

Constrained by the natural climate, project construction can only be possible from May to
October in a year, even during such a short period, the construction has to stop for half a month
on average due to windy and dusty weather, imposing great difficulties and heavy workload to the
construction. As a result, quite a lot engineering projects could not be finished within one
calendar year.

During construction of the Changma reservoir, collapse of the sediment discharge tunnel due to
geological difficulties caused delay of construction of the auxiliary facilities(including the hydro-
power station) and thus a one-year delay of water storage of the dam, though the main body of the
reservoir was finished as scheduled. Consequently, there was a one-year delay for implementation
of resettlement and other activities such as cropping, forestry and livestock raising, etc.

SARS occurred in China in 2003 covered a vast area and resulted in closure of transportation and
impossibility for the construction teams to enter into the construction sites, and thus a one-year
delay of project construction.

Due to change of national poverty reduction policies, poverty reduction funds could not be used
to support construction of water engineering works and thus the counterpart funds originally
committed to be sourced from the provincial poverty reduction office could not be made available,
leaving a gap of counterpart funds of RMB600 million and causing incompletion of annual
investment plans in the first years of project implementation. Through efforts made afterwards,
the counterpart funding problem had been well solved, but it still held back in the early stage
implementation of the PIP defined at project appraisal.

5 World Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 World Bank Performance

The project team leaders and consultants of the World Bank had played an important role in the
project preparation and implementation phases. Totally over 20 World Bank missions consisting
of 113 members had come consecutively to inspect the Project implementation, providing in a
proper and timely manner suggestions and recommendations that are objective and to the point to
the project province. World Bank introduced into the project its scientific management theory,
approaches and established an effective and integrated project management mechanism and
corresponding procedures to facilitate strengthening control over project progress, construction


                                                 47

quality and investment by the project province. It also provided great assistance and guidance to
ensure smooth project implementation, such as its coordination assistance in solving of problems
relating to establishing river basin management institution, counterpart funding and
environmental protection, etc, and its active efforts in supporting reform of irrigation water
management system and participatory management by the WUAs (Water Users Associations).
The World Bank project management team established a good example for the project province
with its pragmatic, careful and precise working style and the practical, realistic working attitude
aiming at constant improvement, which helped the province in the process of continuously
upgrading project management towards a standardized level and thus ensured quality and benefits
of the project implementation.

5.2 Performance by Gansu Provincial Government

Gansu provincial government paid great attention to the Project. It organized 14 times of
provincial governor's working conferences to discuss issues of project formulation, establishment
of the river basin management institution, project organization and implementation, counterpart
funding, resettlement arrangement, etc. and solve the problems encountered. Despite the very
tight budget for construction purpose, the provincial Development and Reform Commission,
Finance Bureau and Water Resources Bureau tried their best in raising funds to ensure timely
allocation of counterpart funds and played an important role in ensuring smooth project
completion.

5.3 Performance by the Shule River Project Construction and Management Bureau
(Project Implementing Unit)

The Shule River Project Construction and Management Bureau (the Bureau) strictly followed the
World Bank policies concerning dam safety, voluntary resettlement, involuntary resettlement,
environment protection, ethnic groups and religion, land acquisition, cultural heritage protection,
etc. In line with the World Bank procedures for project management and implementation, the
Bureau conducted scientific and standardized project management and effective control over
project investment, progress and quality, which had ensured the successful project
implementation and full completion of tasks for all project components. The Bureau introduced
advanced technologies and management skills at home and abroad into the project
implementation process, consequently its management concept and project management level had
been upgraded and a team of staff that is equipped with technical and managerial skills and
familiar with the management procedures for World Bank project had been trained and developed.
Because of its highly efficient and practical performance in the project implementation and
management process, the Bureau was recognized as `Advanced Working Unit for World Bank
Project Implementation in Gansu Province' and `Work Unit with Advanced Civilization' by the
provincial government, and also `Working Unit with Advanced Civilization' by the Ministry of
Water Resources.

6 Lessons Learned

6.1 Major Positive Lessons

6.1.1 Sustainability of Irrigation District Development

6.1.1.1 Sustainability of Water Resources Management in the River Basin

The newly established Shule River Basin Water Resources Management Bureau and its
functioning in formulating and implementing the long term plan for sustainable water resources
utilization and water-saving society development provided institutional and systematized
guarantee for unified planning, management, allocation, protection of water resources in the river
basin, as well as effective and sustainable utilization of the water resources. In the three IDs, the
management sections are now responsible for canals at the main and branch levels, while WUAs
and their members take the management responsibility for the tertiary and quaternary canals,
forming the integrated managerial model of ` Water Supply Unit + WUA + Water Users'. By
using information management in the river basin, sustainable water resources utilization has been
realized to support sustainable economic, social and ecological development in the river basin.

6.1.1.2 Sustainability of Democratic Irrigation Management

Based on experience accumulated from the pilot WUAs, totally 87 WUAs had been established
within the 3 irrigation districts of Yumen City and Guazhou County, covering 83 villages/village
groups of 14 townships and 2 township level farms. Thus, democratic water management by the
WUAs is implemented in the irrigation districts, with `Water Receipt System' established to
avoid irrelevant fees added into the water charge and reduce burdens to the farmers. The sound
water charge collection and management system is effective in motivating the farmers to
participate in irrigation management and construction activities and helpful in realizing
democratic and standardized irrigation management. Meanwhile, as a systematized measure,
0.004 yuan/m3 out of the water charge collected had been designated for purpose of operation,
management and maintenance funding of WUAs to ensure sustainability of democratic irrigation
management.

6.1.1.3 Sustainability in Resettlement Arrangement

Voluntary resettlement in the project was based on experience from the major resettlement
program (or the so-called `Liangxi Resettlement Program') implemented in the province and
obtained concern and policy support from the governments at all levels, as well as cooperation by
relevant departments and industries. As a result, high standard and complete public service
facilities had been set up in the resettlement areas, including school, hospitals, village committee
offices, water and electricity supply facilities, roads and tree belts in the farming areas, etc. The
national government provided through transfer payment or other channels the development funds
to support social development in the resettlement communities. The resettlement areas had been
handed over to the local governments for jurisdictional management, in order for their reliable
economic and social development in the locality. With good performance in solving the issues
and problems concerning production, living and development of the relocatees, the resettlement
component under the Project had created successful experience for poverty reduction in Gansu
province and is thus of great significance in providing guidance and useful reference to similar
resettlement programs in China.

6.1.1.4 Sustainability of Water Resources Regulation Information Management
System

Under the Project, an information management system for water resources regulation was
established with an investment of over RMB30 million. Built on an optical cable of 309.6 km,
383 monitoring and measurement sites in the irrigation districts and 200 monitoring and control
sites. The system consists of 6 sub-systems, namely integrated reservoir regulation, groundwater
monitoring, flood prevention and simulation, gate monitoring and control, water measurement
and office information management. Such a system can be used to undertake integrated and
optimized regulation of water in the three reservoirs, rational allocation of both surface and
underground water, prediction of flood, drought and water-logging disasters, monitoring on
groundwater and the salinity dynamics, assessment of impacts of water engineering works on
groundwater environment, etc, so as to provide references to support decision-making for
sustainable water resources utilization and management, upgrade irrigation management and thus
ensure full benefits of the Project.

6.1.1.5 Sustainability of Eco-environmental Protection and Construction

In accordance with water resources allocation plan for the river basin, water delivery of 220
million m3 had been conducted annually for uses by the ecological reserve areas at the
downstream and windbreak and sand dune fixing trees. Large-scaled desert improvement and
wind-breaking measures had been taken in the irrigation areas of resettlement locations, such as
the `straw-grids' measure covering an area of 466.67 ha in the Qidun township, a Hui nationality
resettlement township located in Guazhou County and known by the local as `the World Storage
of Winds ', and with that measure, the local people realized the dream of building oases and
settling down in the previously desert area. In the three IDs, totally 5,573 ha of windbreak tree
belts were planted, forestry land reached 3,800 ha and grassland reached 666 ha, thus the forest
and grass coverage rate reached more than 15% and a green shelter had been established.
Additionally, an eco-environmental monitoring center was set up for the purposes of monitoring
quality of water in Shule River, Shiyou River, Shuangta reservoir, Shijinxia reservoir, drinking
water quality in the resettlement areas within the 3 IDs, quality of soil in the newly reclaimed
land areas and the leached soil, and eco-environment recovery and improvement in the 11 move-
out counties.

6.1.2 Agricultural Production Increase Realized through Salinity Improvement

Soil salinity improvement experiments under the Project first started at the Xiangyang
resettlement area in Guazhou County, where there was a large reclaimed area with salinity
problem featured by high salt content and great difficulty for improvement. Improvement
measures such as leaching with open drainage canals, vertical leaching using flooding irrigation
with great quantity of water and intermingle clay to drain salt through vertical holes were tested
by the technicians and extended to the new IDs after having been proved to be successful. The
technical specifications and operational manuals prepared and training course organized made it
possible for over 10 thousand of farmer to master the biological and engineering measures in
improving the saline land. Consequently, totally 10,000 ha of saline land reclaimed in the IDs had
been successfully converted into stable and high yield land, with grain production increased by 40
million kg annually, cotton production increased by 2 million kg and the benefits generated
totaling RMB66.9281 million. Successful improvement of the saline soil not only made the
relocatees confident of salinity improvement in the project, provided them with the measures for
improvement and laid the foundation for production and poverty shaking-off by the relocatees,



                                                 50

but also provided good reference and example for salinity improvement in Gansu province and
even in the whole country.

6.2 Major Negative Lessons

Reviewing the project process, international and domestic awareness of environmental protection
at the time of project appraisal time was not that adequate, especially for Gansu province, a
province suffering water shortage problem, its emphasis of development was placed at that time
on full water resources utilization to support irrigation development, so as to solve the poverty
problem for its 200 thousand poor people. Along with social and economic development and
project implementation, construction of water-saving society became the emphasis of
development, with particular stress on eco-environmental protection and project sustainability.
Based on such consideration, the World Bank and the Gansu province reached the agreement for
adjusting water resources utilization in the river basin, thus water resources utilization ratio of the
river basin was reduced to 64.5% from 91.6%, and, correspondingly, resettlement and land
reclamation were downsized, while ecological water and forest coverage ratio were increased.
The purpose of such adjustment is to allow for sustainable economic and social development in
the river basin and to make the project implementation more realistic.

The major reason for counterpart fund allocation lagging behind the PIP is that, a total amount of
RMB600 million of poverty reduction funds planned at project formulation stage as counterpart
funds to the Project could not be made available to the project, due to changes of national poverty
reduction policy afterwards. In the mid period of project implementation, the provincial
government used the T-bonds to increase project investment and fill up the gaps of counterpart
funding, so that the delayed several project components were completed as scheduled.
