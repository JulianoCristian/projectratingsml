In  may  or  19i      Northwest  Investigation  Design and
Research Institute of Ministry of Electric Power  and Ministry or
Inter  Resources   and   Gansu  Provincial  Hydroelectric  Design
Institute
held  discussion  in  Lanzhou   with  the  project  unit -   and
preliminarily  determined   the  contents  of the  EIS ,they are:
water  quality or surface  water .variation of water  table .soil 
improvement ,affect on ecological environmetL , people's health l
agriculture ecology etc.
In  July  of  1991  .  the- State  Env-ironmenst  Burenu held
examination meetins  on the environmenti evaluatioii outline works
in  Lanzhou .there  were  25  units and 56  experts  attended the  -
meeting  ,and  Ihey  gave  positive  remarks on  the contents and
suibjects of the environment evaluation outline works  , and also
brought out comments on modification and supplementation
In September of 1991 , the project unit  reported preparatory
.work progress to the World Bank uission  headed hr Kr  .L.S Tay
Mr. Tay gave positive remarks on t'.e outline works .           .
In July of 1992  , the project unit held meetins in Lanzhou-.
with 22  units and 49  experts .  The meeting seriously discussed
each sub.ject , and confirmed basic information .and  broulght outt

2. General surrey of the project :
2.1 The project area has great pot.ential of land sourtes ,-ith adequate -
light and heat ;the lands are flat and continuous . with good irrigation
conditions .Area to  be newly reclaimed and irrigated is  540610 ha as
cultirated land
The derelopment area has less precipitation , with large evaporation
arnd frequent sand4 wind .In Terms of reclamation .and plantation , kwter
resources  Rust start first  . irrigation  and drainage  will go in
parallel . At present ,there is no reservoir   on the upstream of Shrule
Rirer. with 1.031 billion a3 surface iwter and 42X of utilizations rate .
Frequent    w eedging  " drought happens . Therefore it is necessary to
build Changma Reservoir in the upstrear of the trunk river .
As far as existing water facilities are concerned , some of them are
ased, and with low standard and low utilization coefficient or canals:
1.49  for  Chiangia Irrigation  District  , 10.43 for Shuangta Irrigation
District.  with great water conveyance loss. FarBs have poor counterpart
works, accounting for 50? , with great water loss . Therefore it is
necessary to build and rebuild irrigation system ,
Among the 54600 ha of proposed land to be reclaimed and irrigated
,salined land is 35030 ha to be- drained and leached .Therefore it is
necessary- to build new main drains
Total population  in  the project area  is  0.1353 million: among
rstich , 58300 labor force ;per capita cultirated land is 0.28 ha ,in
avera,ge per labor force cultirates 0.65 ha land . Fu-ther derelopment
of new areas is in great shortage of labor force .Therefore  ,it is
necessary  to imigrate   0.2 million people from middle and southern
parts of Gansu Province to derelop this resion ; the emigrated areas are
in shor tage of land and high cold with shady humidity ,or  with aridity
abd less precipitation ,kitb deteriorated liring conditions and severely
damaged ecology. rt is  certain that after -inmigration people's living
standard can be improrted .
Thze project includes following items:
* l'ater storage works, rwater conveyance works and drainage orrks.
*   [mui.qration works,  70000 immigrants  from  the middle part .0.13
million immigrants from southern part;at different stages and hatches to
settle 0.125 million in Changiza Irrigation District . 50000 people in
Shuansta Irrigation  District,  25000 people  in  Hnaihu  Irrigation
District .
Farm wiozks : to level and reclaim 54600 blv , 45800 ha of drainane
area in farm for counterpart  77700 ha of irrigated area.
* Aqriculture technical serrice s-stem

2.2  Brief introduection to the project and its scale
2.2.1  Changma Water Resources juncture project
Chan/ma oater Resources juncture is a large scale coaprehensi re
project with main function of power generating , water storage and flood
regulation . The project is located at the point of 1.36 kw down firo
Chaba Gorge inlet . about 75 kw away fromf usen Citr .
Changas Reservoir is not only the - faucet  w water resources works
of the Shule River but it also is the principal part of he juncture
,.Total storage capacity is 194 million o3  , active storage capacity is
100 million 3 , flood prevention capacity is 14 million *3 .
After cuspietion of  the reservoir  ,it  will  Jointly run Iith I
Shuansta and  Chiiin Reservoir  in  downstreau  to solve contradiction
bet ween water supply and denand by ceans of scientific dispatch and :
reasonable distribution of water resources .  Details see sketch 2   2 i
A dai will  be  built for the juncture  in  the river .The general
layout   is to build splll.wy and power station on  the left bank  . to I
build sluice and sand transport tunnel ( also for water diversion  ) an
the right bank  . The dna is a play  core gravel dam with good anti -
earthquake capability .The dam is 54 a high .Diaweter of the sluice and
sand transport tunnel is  7.5  a  and the tunnel is 48.9    long . Total
length of the spillreay is 572.9 a , width of the sluice slot is 18 t
.The spillwny and sluice tunnel can meet flood discharge dennd of 267G:
*3/ s encountered once in a thousand years . Relerant technical index
refer to table 2-1
2.2.2 Read rwrks:
a.  Nodification of previous Chann  He.ad works :
The old bead  works is  the existing  Chang'a dam head htrks, :
locating at the Changwa dam about 6 km awas frog the outlet of Changma
gorge . The bead works belongs to large scale (srade II ) project after.
20 years running , following probleas are existing due to poor sand;
transport .2000 r3 of annual sand and and were flushed into canals .and
canalp were seriously daraged .  Water intake has difficulty in taking

probleis ,in 1989 rebuildin.q works was started
h,. Extension works of the bead workrs:
Thlt is  to  extend  the old Chnmanim  hend  wgorks  (nor under
rebui)ding )  uipkwrds 6 l:m *locating at the outlet of Chanmgn Gorge, to
build damr to retain rater '.If the old  Changan hend works  to he rebuilt
can riun ell and meet design requirement ,it will be no need to ext end,
the  Head  works ,aiso the extended  Head  works power sttion jwi'll not
exist
c.  To newly construct Huahai Itead ro*ks:
The old head  works of NItahal Irr-isation  District ,vwth) riIer
dar . sand transport gate  and intake gate ,with 4 a3  Is of designed
diversion flow , and 4000 lha of irrigation area , Is located at Hiatian
jJn I'illage of Uhijin  Township about  11  km away from Chijin Reservoir
doknstream .Decause of poorl facilities ,ii is difficult to  divert water
duirinig irrigation  *anul canals  with  11  km froN Chuijin Resei'volr  tv
fluabiai Hend wrrks .According to the design  60700  ha of harren land uill
be reclaimed in Huahai Irrigation District ,  total irrigation aren will
be 10t00 ha . Therefore (lie old head works can not meet .demand   and a
nev one is to be constructed .
The new Head works, 5.5 km upwards to Chijin Reservoir .5.5 km
down wards to the old bead works . Thle Head morks juncturwe is composed
of overflow swir , earth rock dar , intake gate etc. HIaahai Feeder Canal
also will be extended upwards 7.55  km while the new Read works is tnder
construction .
2.2.3 Canal works :
a.  Canals of Changhe Irrisation District :
* Rebuilding Chanima old feeder canal
ihangma old feeder canal was a large  irrigation  canal .It was
built in 1.958  ,  taking water from Changa dam head wot-ks. It was the
main  artet   - of Shile River watershed  water resources  borks  . At
present .water flow is ordlv half of the designed flow , canals safetyr is
still not ensutred , some parts of canals need to be repaired due to a
lot of sand and Bud enteered into canals and damages occurred .Rater flow
of the repaired canals will he  35  m3/s ; water flow of the new feeder
canal (parallel with the old feeder canals, ) havingy been built in 1.486
i is 30 MS/s .
*  *   The  old  west main  canal  takes  water from Manganzhen
bifurcation gate  of the old feeder call  .Amon.g which 10.8  km is pen
gravel canal : 6..4 km of tail canal is concrete lined canal ,:the rest
is  earth canal with  much  loss  of water  .Cost for maintenance and

rebtIJdins is hbll . With coblubation  of the project  develoIpment . thJe
irrigntion district range of  the west aiJn canal. ws adjusted  ; it is
proposed to build new west vain canal , and It also will  deive  waten
to Shuansna Resetvoir Jn downstrean
* RebuJidJnu & enlargins enst main canal :
Ctnal water is diverted from Chulnbel  Town bifurcation gate
After manA  years' running ,  the canal is ased and danmaged  .At present
water flor is  onix  half of  the designed  flow  . It can  not meet
irrigation  dexand  and  sone parts of  the canal were  co)lapsed nld
fislshed  . It is  difficuIlt for the cantl to. run further more.  it is
proposed  to  change the  line of the upiper anrd middle sections  of the
coon)  for  new  cons tfruction  with  cmihJnatfion  of  programing  of the *
irrignt.Lon distr-ict  :' and  t.he lower section vill  be  rebuilt on its
former line . IrritisWton area will he increased by 3 sections
*   Rebuilding and enlarging of north main canal :
Total  length of   former north main canal ,  with steep earth
slopie  was built  In  13157 .  Vater is  diverted from  Chuanbei TownI
uifur cation gate . Serious swelling by cold weather was happened ,n lot
of fill rebuilding was pertformed , steep slopes vere tiurnred in to drops
some psat  of earth camia were chanped as  concrete  blocks lined cana?l,
it  is  still  dirficult  for  running  .  Ft is  necessarr  to perlbraf
rebuilding and enlargement on the canal line to meet requirement of

2.6 Analysis of the proposed project :
Project development involves a lot of natural and social environmenit
factors in the are.a ,it will affect larse area with many aspects . The
main influtence sources area due to - derelopment and construction works
w*ich will cause artificial redistribution or dater sources in ttle
vatershgd ,and change of environment .
2.6.1 Analysis of mrain environment problems;
a.   Changmd Resertoir :
*   Reservoir storage :
After completion of Changna Reservoir , storage and regulation
will change hydrology, of the river , spatial and temporal distribution
of water resources in the downstream will be changed , with recalation
of 54600 ha land  ,  water  utilization rate  of Shule River  will be
improved from 41. 7! to 89.84 . Thierefore large influence will be put on
Ahdrology and neologv of the downstream areas ,and balance status of the
existing  underground  hater is  changed  :and  it  is  farorable   for
improvement of water environment quality.
*   Reservoir submersion:
* 31 -



After coup)letion oftChan g:s Reservoir  -storage rea  - i . 14.
hi2 soe gullies , beach ,plmntation . houses will be submerged'; thpe
reservoir submersion vill produce involuntary resettlement , and brings
worries  to goverDeent organizations R, non goversaent groups and
individuals.
*   Reservoir induce esrthquakes:
ChanAMa Reservoir is a large scale f grade II  -reserroir..
The reservoir area is located at  7 dearee area teferred in' China's
Earthqua/e Division Hap        6d* Geological condition of the dam  area is
complicated  with relative  centralized stress  , ther efore  there is a
possibilitv for the reservoir to induce earthquake
b.    The 3 power stations  to be constructed  will provide
electricity for developmyent of  the area  ,and will not cause new
pollution
C.  The newly reelaimed wasteland:
The newly reclaimed wasteland vill bring about affects on
natural ground , topography , vegetation and habit. But enlargement of
artificial  oasis  vwil produce significant  social and ecological
effects.
d.  Improvwement of salined land:
Among the wasteland to be newvl reclaimed , 80.8X of thea with
salinization of dirferent extent , need to be comprehensirely harnessed
to change soil attribute . It is proposed to take- 10 years for
improvement of all land ,the saline soil anelioration for which the salt
leaching and drainage aethod is used will produce  certain effects in
water qvality . ater level and- vesetation in water receiving area
2.6.2  Analysis of the iJuil rats resettlement
large batch of immigrants will bring about significant effects on
social and natural enmironment , such as local water , soil , vegetation
,regional  economy  ,political affairs  ,culture  ,education  , hygiene
,hu.an health  ,industries ,comwerce and trade Fpost and comunication
and traffic etc Also resettlement wllJ  bring  surries  to  groups and
individuals of the inmigrated areas,
In addition ,0.2 million immigrants will produce effects on natural
and social environment of esigra±'ed areas in the middle and southern
parts of Gansu Province .
2.6.3 Analysis of service and auxiliary works:
* 32 



They are favorable for contstruction of agriculture mechanism of the
development area and  improvement of ia isrants produrtivity  to reduce
physical work burden ,  to increase output of agricullure  produiets  The
service  sgstea  , consisting of rural education .health  . medical and
post office  ,will improve  living  quality  of immigrants and native
residents .onstruction of service facilities will produreP a littJe
pollution . but water and atmosphere and environment quality Aill not
he affected due to  small scale and decentralizatioin  of  vorks , stronig
sunshine ,strong and frequent wind
2.0.4 Analysis of' construction period :
Excavation. disposal . noise .dust and constrntclion of immigrants
points will bIring certain affects to  landscape .lt-giene, atmosphere
biology sources and huoan health etc.,
2.6.5  Program on the project econox,r development
In accordance kith Gansu Province NatioIal Economv   the Eighth -
FilPe -  Year - Program and overall program of agriculttire developmenft
it is proposed that this project must base  tipon sources ,  to gi ;e plaj'
to adiantases  to rely on science and lechnoloar- ,o p%v Ji.gli attention
to el't'iciency . to regard siter resources works as key backbone   wafte-
harnessing and land  improvement as  care  ,  to pnt stress on immigrant
resettlement  ,to turn  scientific progress  illto  motii-e  torce  . to
perf orm  fill  development of' agriculture  ,forestryv  aniaal husbalndry-
,srdelines  and fisiery   . simultaneous  develaolrent  of  industry
commerce and transportation  . It is planned   to carry nut f'ollowing:
combination between development of sources and protect ion or environwent
m imigrant  resettlement  and proiper  scale  oJperation  : combination
between dereloping  production and exporting for loreign currency  . l I
run  along stereo  - development and conprehen.;sire growth  ,  to hi Iid

belongins  to  Uilian Mountain  folded  aren.  tChanmnqa  basin.,-- 
loc.ting at the upper reaches of Oflain Mountain  west section ,
is the only alliuvial plain br Mountaini strew  . The area of the
hasin Is 700 kz2 , vith ZO fi long from east to vest ,and with
35 km wide from south to north . The basin is composed or sand
secondaryr sand and stib -  clay of the  Cretaceous , Tertiary and
Quaternary systens .The periphery of the basin and  Changra Gorge
hare metamorphic rock of the Cambrian and Ordoricfan  Sjstem and
sediment of caareoniferous , vith nagmatic actiritr . low tectonic
movement in Changra district  is strong,  but tite fAuit zones in
the dam site are all stable
The agricultiure development area  in  the middle and lower
reaches geotectnlogicall.v belongs to  Talimu platform  ,the area
adipins 4ilian fold zone of Tianshang fpuntain ---- Mongolia fold
sstem  forms a depressed basin  . The fractures are actirated
,being divided br Kuangtai Mountain , ffeislsang hill ,Jieshaogzi
Hll) , forming thp basins , such as 'uta, Andian and Huajie etc.
Around the oasis regions ( irrigation district-)  in thle basin
the  gobi - shingle zones are extensivelr distributed . The rast
sgba   of Shule Rkier is corered with sand gravels.  Their upper
layer  is   the orerburden from delurial facies  sand gravels and
lacuistrine facies sand of upper Pleistocene series and lower
layer is  deep  and  thick   sandstone  of middle  and  lower
Pleistocene series . In Shuangta Irrigation District the law is
that : in east cobbles are coarse and in  west cobbles are fine
due to transport of Shule River
3.1.2 Soil
3.1.2.1 Soil forming mother materials and soil
In the project area soil forming mother saterials are mainly
alluvial and silting materials ,secondary materials are aeolian
and red clay of the Tertiary Period .In addition , human actirity
( such as irrigation , drainage ,cultivation and fertilization
etc ) also affect mother material- of the oasis
Under the comprehensive functions , in the irrigation
districts , barren land has 5 soil types and 31 sub - tjpes anhd
04 soil species : brown desert earth , solonchak .damp meadow
soil,  marshy soil and wind hlorn  sandy soil . Among the harren
land , maximum is solonchak , with area of 0.1532 million ha
;aaong the cultivated land ,maxiimum is irrigated desert soil with
area of 40600 ha .
The agriculture soil is mostly distributed at fringe of
alluvial and delurial fans ,on Plains or second ,third terrares
in  upper anid Inwer reaches of river.  In  Changna and Shuangta
,from south to north through deluria) inclined goldi plains in the

3.1.2.2 Soil nutrient       -                        -              ,  -
General survey of soil nutrient in thIis area is as following   g
: low content of aitrogen , phosphorius deficiencJ and adeqiuate
kalitm , relative shortage of organic matters . Average content
of orsanic uatters of cultirated land is 0.84  --- 2.23 Z  , 31.5
1- 25 PPM of alkali hydrolysis nitrosen   83.8 -- 307 PPM of            I
quick 'acting potash,  4--  16 P1N of quick acting phosphorus .
0.937  --- 0.108  PY of holonitrogen ,the ratio between carbon
and nitrogen is 8 -- 12.1 , Pit value is 8.I -- 8.5 . fain soil

3.1.2.3 Soil evolution             -
The project area is situated in lenmming dry regiont, with arid
clinate and hish evaporation .  If there is no irrigation and no
underground  rMter thie area  $il  becrne gobi desert . Otherwise
inere  water from  ;lain Jountain comes there are corridor Of
oasfr  .  Fithout  water in a  long  term  , the prosperous
aigricultulre areas al?so can become ruins . With  cultivation and
irrigaation conditions , wind blown sandy soil also can become warp
soil . that means soil is  alwva.i  changed from  one kind  into
another , conrtinuonsly from quantitative change  to qualitatire
change . Resides the comprehensire  factors , such as climate
topography , moter material , vegetation and hydrology , human
activity' also brings new affects to natural erolution of sol.
3.1.3  tljiate,
in General , climate of the project area belongs to typical
continental dry, climate , with characteristics of long and cold
winter . short hot suneer ,quick warning spring , qtuick drop in
temperature , gr-eat difference in temperature much sandy r.ind
,long sunsbine  time  .Through  classification  or climate , the
uipper reaches of Shmule River belongs to bigh cold semi - arid
zone ; the middle and lower reaches . Changia Irrisation District
and Shuangta Irrigation District east parts  belong to temper,7te
zone  : the west part of Shuansta  Irrisation District ( in the

water quantity  of downstreas river will he rediuced
Under,natural conditions , basic featture of indergrotmd stuer

On the basis of 3  main irrigation districts divtision to do
balance calculation , results refer to table 3 -- 4
3.1.5.2 Underground iater quality
In the plainis thle Main  water bearin.9 str7tnm  water-quality
has  horizontal and  rertical zones  ,according   1ler method  .
.underground  iater  in  the plains are  dirided  into  4 basic
hydrochewical zones: carbonate  --  sulphiate fresh  inter zone
,su Iphate --- carbonate fresh water -- slight saltr rantrw zone
sulpha te ---  chloride   ---- slight saltry water -- salty wafter
zone ,chloride --- sulphate salty witer zone . See table 3-5.
In the north  part of Changma basin and Anxi ,Rluahli  basin
,mineralization of underground  water  is  decreased  brth depth
increase .this  is obrious in Anxi basin
Undergrdund water quality. alteration law  of surface strattm
basically confotus with that of main water beraing stratum . Its
horizontal  distribution from  soutth to north ( for Ani bhasin
from east to west ) mineralization degree from 170 ks/L arontd is
increased over 10 kolL  in  the  north part of the basin . In
general iater qualitr of bottom underground rater conforas with
Pressure  anter  ,  the nearer  to  the suirf.ace  the higher of
mineral7izat!ionn
Irrigation water quality is up to affect on crop and soil by
water temperature, mineralization , content of soluble salt and
PH vralue . In general . annual arerase temper?ature of underground
iwter in  this region  is 9--10  centigrade ;Ph ralue is   6 --8
,and   water  can   meet  irrigation   demand  .Therefore  .in
consideration of affect br soluble salt ,hy means-of irrigation
coeftficient metlhod and Na absorptionr specific value ,considering
total salt and chloride  contents  .coaprehensire e.aluation is
performed
The evraluation  results show   :  underground water of 5ost
arleaPs in Chang=n Irrigation  District is suitable  for irrigation
as g,vade I .J1 iater  ;onlr in north Yinma Farm . Qinshangtou and

4.7.3 Evaluation conclusion on eenrironcent4capacity:    -
Qualitative  and  quantitative   analysis  on ailmgrant,
environment capacity  shiows that. :natural physical-conditions
social econosic environment of Sbule River watershed and possible
production   techniques  .operation   rethod  .after irmigrants
resettleaent etc.   , - will not become restrictivie factors of
environment capacity .                -
In the rear of 2005 .potential population of the project; area .i
wiii be 0.3462- zillion  ,irrigated area vil  be increased hi'
46700  ha  ,in addition to 20090 ha of land occupied hr canals,
ilV lages and roads .Total barren land to he developed is 66700 hI
,accounting for T77A  of the total reclaimable barren -land of the
project area  .Therefore  .  there is no contradiction  between
populatfon and land resources  .Per capita  surface runoff'
possession is 3000 a3 , which is higher than the national average
level , and it is 2.2  times higher than provincial level .-. So         .
land and water resources can absolutely  accommodate 0.2 million
immi.rants ..
it is noticed that prerequisite  of analysis on env-ironment
capacity  is control of natural population growth  ,water saring
and  change of desert ecosystem   into   oases agriculture 
ecos.s tea .during project implementation  and 'stabilization of             -
immigrants . degree of deroting attention to these aspects vili
decisivelr influence change tendency of environment capacit.-
4.7.4 Environment effect on resettlement :
a. Fith full utilization of land and water resources of Hexii
Region .iszisrants'  resettlement not only can reach  the goal of
enou.gh food and clothes  for immigrants  , but  it also will
provide  the  society. a great deal of commodity  to create
conditions for immigrants to get rid of porerty mand.become rich
at the same  tife it  will alleviate financial  burden of the
government , and have positive social environment significance
for flourishing  development of  iesional politics . economry,
cultutre . even for nationalities  unity and social stabilit.-
b. Effect on ecolosical environment:
A steat amount  of population  viII immirrate  and cause
herefromLproduction and living activities mar result in damase on       -
vegetation , which are mainlr indicated in 3 aspects :gathering
fire wood  demanded  enormously due to inmigration . excessive
herdins  to be cauised by? increased livestock  and excavating
medicinal materials driren by economic interest. Althorugh the
project overall plan has planned to constrtuct 1000 ha of fuel
wood forestry  , to nevlr increase 62D0  ha of irrigated pxasture
and improve 90000 ha of desert granny land . certain vesetation
wfll possibly be damaged  due to following  potential factors :

Table 4  -20 shows that      besides elect ri city atd coal as
commercial enearg    biological enerav accountts for half of rural
energy . it can be more than self '-adequacyv at low leivel elthbr

consumption of rural energyr  will reach middle level  .1t can be
seen thant a   large numAber of imui grants will inot cauise shortage
of fuel in the pr-dject area ,n and will not damage vegetation and
shock ecological system.
It is noit recomNended that firing straw is as main energy .If

c. Change of living conditions : In terms of iani.gration,
chang of natural . social and econoxic conditions is aJso oneof  -
the reasons to affect people's health .
4.0.2 tnaLvsis concerning affect on human health
*113-



a. Prevailing9 tendency of disease:
The project area has no high incidence of cancer .As far ats
endemic goiter and local fluorine disease ar-e concerned . locali
hfedical and anti-epidemic units are rnpable to prevent then . [IM
gradual sufficient supply of  food, people's health  are in good
conditi on. In the project-period , vith lap)lementation -ofimediceal
health pro gram  people's health can he ensured.
b. Prediction and analysis on several disea:ses;
injury and poisonin-g  : most voluntary immigrants are from
poverty areas ,      hith poor  edication  .After resettlement ri'th
increase ofr cutivated  land and  farm  machinern. therelobre
training on operators must be  performed, to prevent Injury and
toxic bacillar.r dysentery.
codigestive infectious disease : table 4 -- 23 shows at present
d .senterv   and hepatitis   Aong   digestive diseases  are
relativelyu coomon  in the immigrated areas .    These 2 diseases
closely relate  with manure end sooth propagation  ,that shoes
necessityu to protect water s orces and-- improve individual
traine and food Argysie   in tbe immirrated ares .At preseant
prevention against the 2 diseases in the immigra ted areas rust
.be extensively  carriled out  to create a good environment- for
enter of immigrants  in great batch
rn immi gsrted area incidence of scarlet fever is decreased in
recent years with large fluctuation . Bursting prevailing is
common . The disease belongs to . streptococus infection acute
respiratory  infectious diseatse , vict  difficulty in prevention
.In order to reduce disease affect , it is planned to strengthen'
propagnda  on immigrants  to prevent respiratory infectious
disease ,and to strengthen treatmvent on patients.
coe isting disease in people and animal: Slack fever exists, in
forn of canine prevailing in the etiorated areas s has Jin An
ZWouqu ,langchang   fudu ;-prevention results. are not-good due
to ill dogs and sand fli  ( a kind of propagati on ) wi th
characteristics of resate  and wild star  with a few new
incidence  China sand fly has 4 -  4.5 monthspgrorth periodin
Giansu and Qinhaf proviBnes . therefore ft will be possible for
prevailing as soon as patients and ill dogs enter the project
area . So in order to prevent disease froz pre;wsiling ,before
immigration  fromr epidemic areas  , patients mutst be cuired
,quarantine must be put on dogs, to prevent epidemic sources-
from enitering .
Anthrax exaists in emigra ted areas  such as Jin An Jishishang
C County. Linila  and lfezheng county  -in  these areas isindic
oinorities are majority :ricing cattle and sheep is one kind of'
family sidelines   lerblvorous animals are most sensitire to
'114                                 N



anfthrar bacterium .infection through touching . food' and dust.
Therefore before entering, quarantine- inust be strictly, put on
animls in these areas .
Hydatidosis is not reported in emigra ted areas .but it exists
in iasgrated  areas .According -to  case statistics br Jiuquan  1
Prefecture  Hospital and Fumen City Hospital , -in the year 1983
-- 1590 , 39 Jydatidosis patients were cured . 166200 animals  -
and rabbits were dissected ,positive rate accounting for 7.41X1
eliaination   of disease  canine epidemic- sources-: aiust be
strengthened ; with advocacy of individual hygiene ,buman health
cani he protected.
* endemic goiter- and local fiuorine -: With iodine to cure and -
prevent against endemic goiter has special effect . Blut in:recent
yrears ,sale of self Jade salt shocked salt with iodine in the
project area .which made sale of salt with  itdihe decreased fro
64.121 of 1984 to 50.941 of 1989 in rural areas of Tunen , and-
also decreased from 20.301  to 5.74 1 inAfAnri County at same time
T These obviously affected peoples' Iealth andmale increase oft
new. incidence . Therefore anti - epidemic departments shouldr
cooperate with industrial ad conercial administrations to take
action to force-local salt manufacturers to add iodine in salt
,so this disease could be quickly elminated in the "project area
Local fluorine .with relative bigh incidence in Anai and Fumen
,is a key disease  being cured in  the project ar   Through
inrestigation on potable water sources ,surface water and shallow
underground water has feature of high fluorine   but deep  -
undierground water has feature of low fJuorine  .Since 1980's ,by
means of disging deep wells to prevent  fluorine disease ,there
are 40 beneficiarjr rillages ;fluorine spotted teeth incidence of
etildren at f   were decreased from  previous 23-39- to 2--Bd
,with outstanding results .It is planned to provide potable water
from tube wells for immigrants  , so fluorine disease will nt
menace immigrants' health.     -
4.9.3 Analysis concerning favorable affect on human health:
At present, 851 or land in Ym en and Ansi rural a res are
cultirated by farn  machinery  .rsich greatly  reduced labor
intensity .per capita income is 1000 yuan , the area is one of
highest income areas of the province . The project wilt greatly
inprore Ifving standards of imigrants.
In resettlment with consideration of administration and
various nationalities in the emigrated areas and immigrated areas
,livins habits and religion of imnigrants in communities will be
respected.  adaptability  procedure  of  home  sick  and
interpersonalityr in communities can be narrowed;

Jii uranfts from southern  GMnsU Province  can  get rid of
Menace of greater tuberoistr ,Jeshan disease and endemic goiter
due to shorta.r of Iodine
4.9.4 Evaluation conclusion:
a. Peopie's health Or immigrated areas are in good. cotrdi tion
,and  rarieties Or infectious  diseases  are less than  that in
emigrted areas .During implementation  or immigration  . health
and anti - epidemic departments will surk out practical easures
on prerention and quarantine according to relerant infectious
diseases in  the areas concerned  . to prevent bursting  of.
infectious diseases..
b. As far as  wain  local diseases area  concerned-, the
successful experience concerning  wa ter  qualitv  improvement
against fiuorine bY dissing deep vells can be applied in the nev  -
resettlement areas,  to prevent burting- or  local fluorine
diseases .  rmeans of using  salt witf iodine  . local fluorine
disease can be prevented . Authority- concerned zust strensthen
management on monopoly salt sales , and protride iodine agent to
individuals and local salt manufacturers , and eliJmination of the
disease can be exTpected soon in the project area ;
C. Potable water sources with high content of sulphate  in     .
the project area mar cause temporar.r diarrhoea. , some .explanation
will be giren to immigrants  , and  certain, Mredicine  vill heb

4.13 Brief analysis ori social econoMy:
Resettlement will  rely on the principle  of igras tion for.
development ,inigrants  vill provide output and  income after,
receirin.q gorernwent support anod input to derelop  econoi.r and
rebuild their homes . Investment of the project includes costs on
rater resources  works  ,pover  works          land  reclamation
.resettleaent . social serrice , rural enterprises .education etc
Rlut benefits of imigration includes  income  or new settlers
throughl economic   activity  in immigrated  area  and reduced
economic burden being taken by the State  -
Under the prerequisite of full watching internal fund and
good circulation of ecological environment, withont consideration
of lund profit and investment duration . by the Year of 2005 .per

4.14  Risk analysis
'4.14.1 Risk analysis on earthquake and flood
In  accordance  wiith  checked conclusion  of  Risk analysis   |
report on earthquake   and  seismic basic  intensity- of Ciangma  -
Reservoir dam site - bx Lanzhou Seismric Research Institute or the-
State Seismic Bureau in Jtne  .1892  : n Basic seistic intensit.X

are complicated here  ,slopes around  dam site  is  stable .,ault  |
zone is not actire  .It is allowed  to construct dam  vith 54-   t
leLqh t   and  using  local materials  under the   seismic and
geological conditions -       In the future 100 years .earthquake
to be caused by regional active fauJt zone  will produce 8 degree
of maxrimumr intensity on Chansma dam site  . Stochastic earthquake
around daw site  will produce maximum  of  7 degree intensity
.kithin 250 ks range or 2 sides of Changea earthquake  fault zone
,  earth quake over 9  degree will  not occur  .That  is Cha n     ''-
Reservoir dat site is located in the range of I degree strong
earthquake and shock absorption
In the running period ,beca use water storage will cause local
ground  stress  unbalanced  and load  of the dat . according to
roi agonal geological  tectonic  , in future  10  years there is
Possibility for CLhanwqua Reservoir to  occur stochastic earthquake
affect below 7 degree of maximum intensity .In reservoir running
period, possibility  of induced earthquake  , bel)orv 7 degree
maxrimum  intensity .can not be  ruled out .Vith flood exceeding
standard ( flood over 2000  years  encorntered once, with flow
of 2670 x3/s  J  . possibilftr of overfloir aid dam  collapse to
endanger dowenstream areas will exist .
Earthquake in Chansgia Reservoir area is below  7 degree :dao;
site basic intensitr is 8  degree .In the desisn ,anti-earthquake
measures were considered .  With little chance of extree flood .
even if occur flood  encountered pnce 2000 years ,soue temporarl
prevention measures can be taken   to prerent flood from orerflow;
* If construction qualitr or operation management is  poor , dam
collapse with sudden flood will be caused . Affects on downstream

9. Public participation
.9.1 Public invtolvement in the areas concerned
*9.1.1 Inrestig.atin methods
The Population Research Institute  of Lanzhtou t/ni versi tL
carried ouit extensive investigation on public of the pr-oject . by
means off paper investisation & visiting , 200 papers were sent
to the emsrated areas ,received 86 -;150 papers  were sent ton
fiigrawted'artas , receired 90 ;and  150 papers  were sent to
immigrants in lexi since 1880 ,received 71  .And 47 households
were visited.
9.1.2 Response from iuigrants in Sexi resions:
.lu,ierants fro,l 1983 to 1989 in Jexi are satisfied *Oth new
environmsent ,and think that:
a. haring cansiderable land with sood 7'ua1itr and high rield
per capita has 0.267  a . hich is ) -- 4 tines higher- than
their hosetown ; with fertile land grain yieldd is fi60  kg lbs .:
Kewcoaer Vi aiquan said , one rears' output in Heli is equal to
outputt ri 8 -- 9 vears output in my hoaetown             -
b. production condition is  impiroed  :   w th flat land, ligh
mechanical opera tion,. getting rid of heavy labor burden  ,it is
worthy for exchanging mountainous land into plain land.-
c. rapid improvement of liring conditions   after 3  -- 4 yvears
,imfisrants in Heni region per capita income can get 1000 yuan
arotnd , new settlers are capable for construction of new houlses
and buying tralctors and famii.r electric facilities
Sew  settlers  fror middle part of  Gansu Prorince hare
comfortable life ,and people in emigrated areas got shocked. .For
exTample in Anti County ther-e were additional 1000 immirants out
of theplan       -,
.9.1J.3 Attitude of the planned intmigrants
a. Expectation  to  the new environment:  Amons 8M  papers per
capita income is  below 400 yuan . and 100  ---2O yuian income
accountins for 66X  . They are firstlr expecting hare enough food
and easy living condition .then expecting new environment haring
flat land and convenient trAnsportation
h. thtnkinig on imigration
Question  I      Does  the State novernhent provide subsidy fisr
reset tiewent .and enbsoh 7
Question 2: Is land in MleOi fertile with timely raining 7

c. status of reluctant people -: 1  sideline income:is ensured
,such Sold seeking , doing business and construction .. A-hic -can
afford  them hliar] s  relative   comfortable life  ..  2)- in .,3
generations family . the- older is reluietant to leave . 3) hating.

9.1.4 Public involvement of imrigrated areas
a. response from  the farmers.:  opinions from  85  t of the
investigation  papers among  the -receii-ed 90  plpets are at       ..
sovernsent disposal . - Reason is that the State owns and ,harren
will be -wasted ir thre,- aref not used :iaurisrants  wil: not occup. - ;
our cultiv-ated land  .amM we are also early new settlers .e havre
no reason to reject them              -
b. responise from carders in iJUVisrated areas
*    expecting  water resources  works. and imiLgration  start in:
paral le] lpace  to  arvoid immigration failure  due- to  rater                   . -
resources svrks not meetingq demand.
i concein about worsening ecological envirornment in. irrigation
area : water regulation  of  Clianrsa A Chijin  reserioirs will
redauce underground sAter in downstream areas
A concern about population  increase  will affect long  term
inte/ests of local residents
* immigrants with poor quality can not lire on in Rexi
c. resPonse fron public representatives
After talk between Shule River Project Preparatory Division
and 10 representatives of local people  .nain response are .s
folloes:
*   Fumen & Anri are rain grain production base of Gansir Province
in irrisation  tire  there is  no ia ter ;in d Adumtn and Spring
there.is enough water .which is not useful . The areas has vast
barren l,and .  If water problem is solved  agricultrue ,frrestrr.
,.animal husbandry .tourisa and ruraI enterprises  will be greatly.
proroted.
* Resettlement developirent is favorable for development of local
economy and culture  .Total population  in  Y'ueen is only 0.1
million  .  further development  rill need more  labor  , so
immiig rats are welcome
* Anti County is the well kfown V rind reservoir of the world
* strong sandr rind endangers farmers ..Since IBM0's  we stick to
plant tree  and grass .and  sandr  rind is  relaxed at certain
extent ;due to shortage of ia ter the results of wind prevention
and sand fixins  can not be expanded . After completion of the
project ,  extensive plantation  of trees and  grass  wind
prevention and sand fixing will improve environment and tpro-oter
tourisr without danase on local_resources

participated the meeting . And opinions and surggestion  are as
follows
*158*



a. Shule Rirer r4itershed is rich in water and hand resources
,with .4oed utijization conditionJ . After operation of the project
. outstandins social,  economic and  ecolosical  effects cau be
achieved . it is n g9nod comprehenisive developijment project .
b. The project area belongs to  arid  desert nrea *so water
Pnpluitat ion mist alolowb for unforeseen circtrmstances according to
planning
c. Immigrants utist he selected . At earlv resettlemenit stage
.production condition is  not ripe  . it is  difficult to ensuIre
their living  standard  ;  theerefore  the  government support is
needed , must pasy attention to resettiement affect onj en vi jnnment
d. In  desert area  if  thlere  is  no good circuilation of
ecosystemL there will he no steady- development ;it is importatnt to
establish  stable   ecological  environment at  fringe  nf  the
devrelopment areas to protect reset.ation .
e.  The development area has large salined area .vith hard
tiusk  ror improvement ; enough attention must be siren tn this
aspect before resettleieent .
f.  Leachins drainage will afrect minerali7ation of Slnman.qta
Reservoir water , new environment prlb lea  must be prevented
g.   According  to present  regional environment featurre
.commerciai  energ- is  the   main energor supply  for I he rutral
areas
o. 3 counter measures:
a.  In the principle of extensive mobilization and ouluntarr
itmigration, t*iZ  to reduice inroluntary immigrants
b.  ro strengthen propaganda and training   with detailed
Full propaganda to iespect trutth ,to produce video tapes and soho
to people of the emirsated areas ,let theem  et to know the fuiture
erl-ironrent . Rexi region  is  a  irriga ted  a.qricul ture  area
:iami grants are   not  familii; witht cultivation  skill and
techniques  for saliniti,  prevention  and harnessing  . so after
resettlement traininy must  be put on them fo,' the pm pRose of
successful agriculture production.
c. Ouring7 pro.ject imvplejnentation , regard 67nter resources
