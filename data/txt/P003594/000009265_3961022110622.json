The principal\n            project components are: 1) Changma Dam on Shule River to\n            provide effective storage of about 100 million cubic meters\n            of water for irrigation and water supply; 2) irrigation and\n            drainage; 3) agriculture, including crop production, support\n            services, agrimachinery services and livestock production;\n            4) land settlement for 200,000 immigrant farmers; 5)\n            environmental protection and management through\n            afforestation, monitoring, soil and water conservation\n            practices; and 6) institutional strengthening and support\n            through provision of staff training, technical assistance,\n            equipment, vehicles and essential facilities."}, "docdt": "1996-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
