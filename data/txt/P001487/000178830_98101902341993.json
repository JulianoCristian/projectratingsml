The project components are: (a) consultant services\n            (107 man-months) to compile and review geological and\n            geophysical data and to supervise seismic surveys; (b) a\n            12-months program of onshore reconnaissance seismic work;\n            (c) engineering study for a heavy oil pilot plant at\n            Tsimiroro; (d) consultant services (18 man-months) for\n            energy planning and development and related training of\n            local staff. If the search for oil is successful, the\n            project would contribute to meeting part of\n            Madagascar's petroleum needs from domestic sources\n            within ten years."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
