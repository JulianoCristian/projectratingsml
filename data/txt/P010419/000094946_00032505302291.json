reluctance to proceed with privatization\n            of state banks, and insurance companies - based on the\n            strong state dominance in these two major sub-sectors -\n            raises concerns on the long term sustainability of the\n            financial sector. The key lessons address primarily, the\n            inappropriate decision making process, particularly, the\n            political weakness, and reluctance to bring about reform\n            measures, for although there was an awareness on the need\n            for reform among financial officials, the absence of\n            committed efforts hindered the opportunity to forge the\n            reform program. Furthermore, the central coordinating unit\n            within the Central Bank, with representation from the\n            Ministry of Finance and Planning, was ill conceived, and\n            inadequate to mandate reform measures. In addition, the\n            absence of a reform framework for the financial sector, was\n            conducive to a politically biased, and ad-hoc approach to\n            reform. Under these circumstances, the Bank should require\n            the government to set up a strong coordinating unit, to\n            ensure an effective, and continuous follow-up."}, "docdt": "2000-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
