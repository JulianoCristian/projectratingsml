  of cultivated upland to irrigate paddy fields in areas\n            commanded by the above canals; (c) land consolidation,\n            including construction of ditches, drains and farm roads\n            together with land leveling and boundary realignment on\n            4,600 ha; (d) development of 495 ha for irrigation of upland\n            crops, and 550 ha for orchards within the area to be\n            irrigated; (e) upland reclamation, primarily bench-terracing\n            of 1,200 ha of presently uncultivated land; (f) improvement\n            of about 80 km of river channels to increase their flood\n            discharge capacity; (g) construction of about 150 km of\n            village access roads; (h) aerial photography, surveys, and\n            mapping for the design of project works; and (i) provision\n            of technical assistance, procurement of vehicles, and a\n            feasibility study for a second-stage project in the Miho Watershed."}, "docdt":
