The Bank's\n            assistance in project preparation and formulation proved\n            useful and the appraisal was well received. The project\n            accomplished most of the physical construction works\n            specified in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) but failed to\n            provide any significant irrigation service during the life\n            of the Credit. The project has revealed the need for: (1)\n            considerable technical supervision, given the implementing\n            agency's institutional capability, (ii) training of\n            local staff, particularly at the support level; (iii) a\n            stronger institution-building effort than had been envisaged\n            at appraisal; and more involvement and participation by\n            farmers. Other components, including management of completed\n            parts of the irrigation systems, institutional building,\n            training, and farmers' involvement in Water User's\n            Group (WUG) were addressed but the results have not been\n            entirely satisfactory. The lesson is that operational plans\n            should: be specified and agreed before system design;\n            provide the basis for system design concepts and criteria;\n            and be consistent with the physical and institutional\n            capacity to implement them."}, "docdt": "1991-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
