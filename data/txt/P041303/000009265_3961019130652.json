The project will be targeted to\n            rural areas, particularly in the north and west, where the\n            drought is most severe. The project components are: 1)\n            agricultural inputs; 2) livestock production; 3) water; 4)\n            rural roads; and 5) improving future drought preparedness."}, "docdt": "1995-08-08T00:00:00Z"}
