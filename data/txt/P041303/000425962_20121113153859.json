The overall outcome was\n            excellent not only in terms of mitigating the crisis, but\n            also in establishing benchmarks and strategies to face\n            future droughts. First, a panel of experts, chosen from\n            throughout the Bank, reviewed project documents and met\n            regularly with the task team. Second, the components were\n            chosen from priority lists for which studies and other\n            documentation were already available. Third, the government\n            pre-financed contracts. Fourth, the project benefited from a\n            flexible design, where procedures were adapted to the\n            emergency nature of the operation. Fifth, the executing\n            agencies reacted quickly and efficiently. Sixth, the\n            Ministry of Finance was a close partner in designing and\n            preparing the project and was the executing agency which\n            made sure the necessary budget was allocated in time. At the\n            sectoral level, the national livestock inventory was\n            maintained to allow a quick reconstitution of the herds\n            after the drought; and the price of animal feed and\n            livestock products was stabilized and a regular market\n            supply insured. The government quickly exempted animal feed\n            imports from taxes and advanced funds for efficient feed\n            distribution and construction of water points. The Ministry\n            of Finance subsidized farmers for the higher seed prices.\n            Finally, the sustainability of community-based systems was\n            greatly enhanced by being demand-based."}, "docdt": "1998-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
