PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Seventh Railway
Project for which Loan 1836-KO was approved in April 1980 for the sum of
US$94.0 million.
The PCR was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Transportation I
Division, based upon a review of the project files and data supplied in August
1984 by the Korean National Railways. Bank staff who worked on the project
have also been interviewed.
The loan clo;ing date was December 31, 1984.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments. Comments received are shown
as an annex to the report.

SEVENTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1836-KO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
i.        The Seventh Railway Project continued the Bank's assistance to the
Government of Korea in improving its transportation network. The project was
designed to meet increasing passenger and freight transport volumes and also
to strengthen the Korean National Railways (KNR) as an institution and prepare
it for full autonomy by January 1, 1987.
ii.       The project achieved most of its objectives despite several delays
and reductions in the investment plan. KNR successfully and efficiently
executed all civil works. The commercial accounting, costing, marketing and
management information systems implemented under the project had a significant
effect on KUR as an institution. These were not the only institution building
achievements, since a start was made under the project on introducing a man-
agement improvement program. In addition, extensive urban, regional and
corridor multimodal transport studies have led to significant improvements in
transport planning in Korea as well as the identification of viable new
investment opportunities. Finally, due to lower than expected traffic growth
and government tariff policies, the economic and financial returns were not as
high as expected.
iii.      The outstanding feature of this project is its extensive institution
building and the development of a more market-oriented KNR. Also, the land-
mark transport studies carried out mainly by local consultants in joint
ventures with foreign firms have significantly helped to build Korean consult-
ing firms and introduce a multimodal approach to transport planning.



KOREA
SEVENTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1836-KO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND SECTORAL SETTING
The Transport Sector
1.01      Korea's export-led industrialization has been among the most
successful examples of economic development in recent history. During
1962-78, real GNP grew by 10% p.a. and per capita income more than tripled in
real terms. Coupled with industrialization and urbanization, major develop-
ments and changes in the transportation sector complemented and supported the
transfotmation of Korea's economy. Passenger traffic tripled between 1964 and
1971 and then tripled again by 1981; freight traffic increased nine times and
five times during the respective periods.
1.02      The Government of Korea's (GOK) basic transport planning objective
in the past has been to increase transport capacity in line with projected
traffic growth and to avoid major bottlenecks. This objective has been
largely achieved. Furthermore, the transport system as developed is
reasonably balanced, as there is no substantial uneconomic allocation of
traffic among the various modes.
1.03      Large investments in transportation infrastructure have been comple-
mented by a considerable effort to improve the efficiency of the transporta-
tion system through the establishment and strengthening of institutions to
plan, construct, maintain and operate the facilities ant services. This is
true both in the public sector, with the establishing and strengthening of
institutions such as the Korean National Railways (KNR) or the Transport
Coordination Bureau (TCB) in the Ministry of Transport, and in the private
sector by the successful development of many contractors capable of handling a
wide range of public works in Korea and abroad.
1.04      The Bank has played an active role in advising and assisting the
Korean authorities in pursuing their transport objectives. A summary of
investments follows.

The Railway Subsector
1.05      With the modernization of its network which was assisted by the Bank
through seven projects, the KNR remains the most economic means of land
transport for moving bulk traffic over medium and long distances. KNR now
operates a well maintained 3,100 route-km network of standard gauge including
610 km of double track and 47 km of narrow gauge. About 370 km of single



-3-
track industrial lines serving the northeast coal and cement producing areas
are electrified, as well as about 100 km of the Seoul Metropolitan Electric
Suburban Railway System (SMESRS) linking Incheon and Suweon. Staff comprises
38,000 people, with 33,500 permanent employees. Productivity is high in terms
of traffic units (pass-km plus net ton-km), and was 847,000 per staff member
in 1983 compared to 500,000 for European railways; dense urban and intercity
passenger traffic and heavy bulk commodity traffic contribute to this.
1.06      KKR's freight traffic is substantial and concentrAted on a few bulk
commodities. In 1983, it carried 50.3 million tons of freight, an 8% increase
p.a. since 1966, on a 1,222 km average distance, amounting to 11.2 billion
ton-km. Traffic exceeded 14 million tons on the most heavily used section of
the northeast industrial line (Taebaek). The next heaviest used sections, the
Jung-Ang line south of Jecheon and the Seoul-Busan line, carry around 4 mil-
lion tons annually. The main commodities transported include coal with 20.8
million tons p.a. which doubled sinze 1966, and cement with 11.1 million tons
p.a., quadrupling since 1966. In addition, other bulk commodities (ore, oil,
fertilizer, and grain) accounted for 78X of KNR's total freight ton-km in
1983, up from 66% in 1966.
1.07      KN's main revenues come from passenger traffic but competition with
road transport is severe. The opening of the Seoul-Busan and Daejon-Gwangju
expressways in 1970-73 marked the beginning of intense road competition by
long-distance bus transport. The rise in personal incomes increased people's
mobility, and their demand for greater comfort resulted in a shift to higher
class trains. Also, with the opening in 1974 of KNR's electrified suburban
lines connected to the first Seoul subway line, a new era of rapid transit
started. After a serious decrease in the early 1970s, passenger traffic grew
at a rate of 7% p.a. from 1975 to 1980, but has since leveled off. The
proportion of passengers riding lower class (ordinary) trains has declined to
35%, with the balance riding limited express and special express trains which
increased over five-fold since 1972. In 1983, 136 million long-distance
passengers were transported; passenger traffic on the SMESRS also grew
rapidly, exceeding 315 million passengers that year. These trends indicate
the areas in which KNR should increase its services.
1.08      Operating efficiency remains high and in general continues to
improve. KNR earned positive returns until 1971; its financial situation then
deteriorated as inflation increased costs faster than tariffs and required
annual government subsidies. Historically, tariffs for freight and ordinary
passenger trains were much below costs and were cross-subsidized by the
profitable long distance passenger services. However, covenants in successive
Bank railway projects emphasized the need to increase freight tariffs in real
terms which were raised by over 150% between 1975 and 1983 despite rapid
inflation. Freight revenues now cover total costs excluding debt service.
Also, since 1978 passenger fares have been raised somewhat faster than the
cost of living, with the exception of fares for ordinary trains which KNR
intends to raise gradually.

II. PROJECT FORMULATION
2.01      The project was identified by the Korean Government a.d prepared
with the assistance of consultants financed under the Sixth Railvay Project.
The project directly focussed on the goals for Bank participation in the
transport sector set jointly by the Bank with the Korean Government, namely to
increase capacity of the transport system in the most economically efficient
way and to develop and strengthen the institutions dealing with the transport
sector.
2.02      During the mid-1970s in Korea, the combination of increasing incomes
and Government's policy of restricting the ownership and use of private
automobiles led to sharply increasing demand for express train services, with
the number of passengers transported on these trains increasing fivefold
between 1974 and 1979. The Seventh Railway Project therefore offered an
opportunity to the Bank to support two key Government policies: (a) to
discourage the use of private automobiles by improving public transport; and
(b) to concentrate the country's physical development around five cities:
Daejon, Daegu, Masan, Gwangju and Jeonju, by improving passenger transport to
these cities from Seoul and Busan. There were also energy saving considera-
tions which were important at what was then a period of recurrent oil
crises. With their high occupancy, passenger trains consume less fuel per
passenger-km than expressway buses on long distance routes such as Seoul-
Busan, and the Government wanted to promote energy conservation.
2.03      The project appraisal mission, composed of an engineer, an economist
and a financial analyst, visited Korea in September 1979 and reviewed the
project documents. These included the investment plan, economic evaluation,
engineering plans, bid documents, traffic data and other information requested
by the Bank and prepared by KNR. The project essentially consisted of (a) the
investments which KNR planned for 1980-82; and (b) technical assistance for
implementation of management reforms as well as for transport and urban
transport feasibility studies.
2.04      Major issues raised at appraisal were:
(a) Doubling of the Chung Bug Line. Section 3.12 of Loan Agreement
1542-KO (Sixth Railway Project: KNR's 1978-79 Investment Plan)
provided that "the Borrower shall take or cause to be taken all
action necessary to ensure that substantial changes in KNR's
Investment Plan shall only be made with the concurrence of the
Bank," substantial changes meaning an increase or a decrease of more
than W 10 billion. Despite this convenant the Government undertook
in 1978 and 1979 several investments exceeding W 10 billion without
Bank concurrence. Most of these investments were technically and
economically justified and the Bank agreed to add them to the
original plan. The only investment to which the Bank objected was
the double tracking of the entire Chung Bug Line (113 km) instead of
the 8.6 km section for which double tracking was originally
envisaged. In its letter of September 4, 1979 the Bank suggested
that the Government, which undertook these works for political and



- 5 -
military reasons, should not include them in KUR's 1978-79
Investment Plan but rather consider them as a "special line" to be
operated by KKR. This impLied that the Government would itself
finance the double tracking of the additional 104.4 km and provide
KNR with subsidies as necessary to make up for any loss KNR would
suffer as a result of operating the line. The Government agreed to
follow up on the Bank's suggestion, and the appraisal mission
recommended that confirmation of the Government's plans on the
financing of this investment should be a condition of loan
negotiations.
(b)  Loan Amount.  The loan was to finance part of the project's foreign-
exchange expenditure (estimated at US$167 million). KNR requested
to raise the loan amount to US$100 million - as opposed to the US$75
million then earmarked in the Lending Program. The mission noted
that KNR was probably not capable of raising money directly frona
foreign commercial sources because (i) it had not yet acquired
corporate status and (ii) it functioned as a government department
and depended for its financial viability on an annual budgetary
grant. Even with a loan amount increased to US$100 million, the
Bank's contribution to total project cost would still be propor-
tionally lowe: than in past railway loans to Korea.  A US$100
million loan would represent roughly 15Z of the cost of the seventh
project while the US$120 million Bank loan for the Sixth Railway
Project financed about 30% of the corresponding total project
cost. The mission recommended that the loan amount be raised to
approximately US$100 million.
(c)  KNR's Organization and Management.  Under Section 3.08 of Loan
Agreement 1542-KO the Government had agreed on the execution of a
management study as part of the Sixth Railway Project and on
implementation of the study's recommendations "as shall be agreed
with the Bank." The study was completed and the appraisal mission
had the opportunity to review it and to discuss its major recommen-
dations with KNR, the Ministry of Transport and the Economic
Planning Board (EPB). The study's main conclusion was that KNR
should be gradually transformed from its present status as a semi-
autonomous government agency to that of a public corporation. KNR's
managerial functions should be delegated to three deputy administra-
tors respectively in charge of Planning, Coordination and Control;
Operations; and Administration. Short-term measures would focus on
the establishment of a management information system and a marketing
organization within KNR. The latter's main function would be to
conceive and carry out an aggressive marketing policy with immediate
action toward obtaining a higher share of Korea's long distance
container traffic for which the railway has an economic advantage.
Mid-term action would aim at strengthening KNR's capability in the
fields of planning, -aainly economic analysis of investment planning,
and of financial management and accounting procedures with special
emphasis on introduction of performance budgeting, backshop
accounting and incremental long-term variable costing. The mission
recommended that the Government be asked to prepare a draft time-
phased plan for implementing the measures suggested by the study.



-6-
(d)  Tariffs.  The mission noted that in recent years the Government
increased KNR's tariffs several times in order to meet or at least
approach financial objectives agreed with the Bank. However,
freight rates were generally raised across the board rather than
cost based. KNR's tariff structure needed to be revised to ensure
that passenger and freight rates will be at least equal to the
variable costs incurred by KNR, but not higher than comparable
competitor's tariffs or KNR's total costs including a reasonable
rate of return on investments. The mission recommended that the
Government and KNR propose and finalize during negotiations, a time-
phased plan for implementing a new cost-based tariff structure.
(e) Sector Studies. The comprehensive transport study then being done
by Korean consultants (KIST) under the Sixth Railway Project was to
be available in June 1980; it would give a general indication of
investments needed in the transport sector. One of the likely major
issues concerned ways and means to increase transport capacity in
the Seoul-Busan corridor; one possibility being considered was a
high speed railway line. The mission recommended that following up
on the KIST study, a more detailed analysis of possible alternatives
should be made and that such a study be financed by the project.
Another related issue concerned the proper planning and design of
the large transport investments under way or planned in the Seoul
metropolitan area and possibly soon in the Busan metropolitan
area. It had become necessary that proper urban transport studies
be made of the two metropolitan areas and not just of the special
cities, as was done in the past. The mission felt that agreement
should also be reached on these studies at negotiations.
2.05      Loan negotiations were held in Washington from March 17 to March 21,
1980 and the above issues were discussed. On the Chung Bug line, Government
proposals to fully reimburse KNR for the capital cost (about $14.0 million)
over a 2-3 year period were accepted. On project cost, the Bank agreed, in
view of substantial oil price increases in 1979 and revisions to the GOK's
foreign borrowing plans, to increase the loan amount by US$15.0 million plus
an additional US$4 million to finance transport studies; these additions
brought the loan amount to US$94.0 million. On organization it was agreed
that KNR should be converted from a government entity to a fully autonomous
corporation no later than January 1, 1987. Also, a series of short- and
medium-term managerial measures together with timetables for their implemen-
tation were agreed upon and included in a Supplemental Letter to the Loan
Agreement. On tariffs, it was agreed to set them at a sufficiently high level
to ensure that KNR's revenues meet its operating expenditures, debt service
obligations and a reasonable proportion of capital costs.
2.06      The project as finally agreed at negotiations had the following
major components:
(a) completion of the quadrupling of the 32.3 km section Seoul-Suweon;
(b) expansion of the West Seoul freight terminal at Susaeg;



- 7 -
(c) installation of a centralized traffic control system (CTC) on about
270 km of lines;
(d) rail or track renewal on about 320 km and provision of 70,000
concrete sleepers and 70,000 cu m of ballast;
(e) bridge and tunnel strengthening and right-of-way improvemtents;
(f) separation of road and rail at level crossings;
(g) provision of track maintenance equipment and track material workshop
machinery;
(h)  the acquisition of 10 main-Iiue diesel locomotives, 12 diesel and 16
electric railcars for intercity traffic, 130 electric railcars for
Seoul urban traffic, 246 passenger cars and 100 freight cars and
repowering of 40 diesel locomotives and 40 diesel railcars;
i)  provision of subsidiary shops for the new Daejeon passenger and
freight car shop and improvements to existing workshops and sheds;
(j) improvement of telecommunications and power facilities;
(k) construction of housing for emplcyees and provision of hospital
equipment; and
(1) provision of training, technical assistance for implementation of
the recommendations of the management study carried out under the
Fifth and Sixth Projects, and feasibility studies for transport
sector investments selected upon completion of the national
transport study being carried out under the Sixth Railway Project.
2.07      The loan was approved by the Board on April 29, 1980, the Loan
Agreement was signed on May 21, 1980 and became effective on August 29,
1980. The conditions of effectiveness included the execution of a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement between the Government and KNR whereby US$88.2 million of the
Bank loan was onlent at similar terms and conditions as between the Bank and
the Government. The Bank loan carried a term of 17 years including 4 years of
grace at 8.25Z per annum.
2.08      The total foreign exchange component was estimated at US$160 million
equivalent. The Bank loan of US$94 million would cover the costs of about
33,800 tons of rail, track maintenance equipment, 2 breakdown cranes, 246
passenger cars, 100 freight cars, workshop equipment, technical assistance and
training. The remainder of the foreign expenditures was to be met through
borrowing from other sources. About US$8.0 million were to be provided by the
U.S. Export-Import Bank and US commercial banks, mainly for diesel engines, at
an interest rate of 9% repayable over 9 years; about US$38.0 million was
expected to be obtained from a foreign source, possibly with the involvement
of a national export credit guarantee agency, for signalling equipment; about
US$5.0 million for hospital equipment was to be provided through a loan from



-8-
the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF); a further US$15.8
million would be provided by the Korea Exchange Bank at an interest rate of
7.5% repayable over 20 years.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
Overview
3.01      In 1980 both passenger and freight traffic were slightly below their
respective 1979 levels, with passenger traffic reaching only 87% and freight
traffic 96Z of appraisal projections. The Korean economy was suffering a
downturn and accordingly several capital investment programs were scaled down
in early 1981, including that of the railways. The railway plan reductions
were in items not financed by the Bank, and total project cost declined from
the appraisal estimates of US$604 million to US$367 million. Due to overall
budgetary constraints at that time, project implementation was initially slow
but once underway it was implemented efficiently. Most civil works were
completed with minimal delays, but the loan closing date was postponed by one
year to December 31, 1984 mainly to allow completion of the multi-modal
transport studies. KNR was the executing agency for all project works.
Civil Engineering Works
3.02      Following the downturn in traffic and the generally poor economic
climate, KRR with Bank support decided to cut back its investment plan in
early 1981 by deferring some items and reducing the quantities for others.
Accordingly the following items were deferred to the 1982-86 investment plan:
1981 Cost (Won billion)
Industrial sidings (POSCO and Gwangyang)               10.84
By-pass line, Jecheon                                   1.68
Freight terminal, West Seoul                           10.29
CTC, Yeongju-Gyeongju (163.5 km)                       32.79
CTC, Jecheon - Baegsan (106.7 km)                      21.32
Tokenless block signalling                              1.78
Other items                                             1.46
Total                                              80.16
Also, major quantity reductions were made for the following items:



-9-

shops and sheds                     -       -      30       8.44   2.78    33
Housing and hospitals                  -      -       70      7.85   5.76    73
As a result of these measures the total project cost estimate was reduced to
W 239 billion or 32% below the appraisal estimate.
3.03      In addition, there was one new item when the Government for
political reasons decided to double track the 101 km Iri-Songjeongri section
of the Ho Nam line. Construction started in February 1981 and should be
completed by mid-1985. The total cost was estimated at W 152 billion (about
US$234 million) of which about W 9 billion were spent in 1981. Since the
amount spent during the 1977-81 investment plan period was less than W 20
billion, the Government's decision was not interpreted as a violation of
section 4.06 of the Loan Agreement.
3.04      All of these rearrangements made project implementation initially
slow. However, once underway the project works were efficiently executed and
essentially completed by late 1983. KNR demonstrated an excellent implementa-
tion capability.
Procurement
3.05      Procurement was handled by the Office of Supply (OSROK).  Most items
were procured through international competitive bidding with Korean suppliers
winning many of the contracts. Some items were procured on schedule, e.g.,
contracts for the rails and breakdown cranes but there were some delays in
others, e.g., the freight cars. As a whole, delays were due primarily to
planned slowdowns in the investment plan; there were no significant problems
with the conduct of the procurement process itself. Table 3.1 has details for
all items procured.
3.06      The only Bank/Borrower procurement controversy revolved around the
purchase of 2,052 tons of special heat-treated rails from a Korean supplier
who was the lowest evaluated bidder. The Bank was concerned since KNR had in
September 1983 requested an extension of the loan closing date because, among
other reasons, they needed to perform a seven-month test of the Korean
supplier's heat-treated rails before they could place an order. The Bank felt
that the supplier may have been technically unqualified and withheld approval
of the bid until a mission could fully investigate all available evider:e.



- 10 -
3.07      Accordingly, all documents were reviewed during the December 1983
mission to Korea. It was found that the said Korean manufacturer had been
producing rails for more than six years. Its domestic customers included KNR,
the Seoul and Busan metropolitan rail systems and several coal mines. KNR was
satisfied with the rails it had received from this supplier in the past.
Heat-treated steel for the rails in question was manufactured under a
licensing arrangement from a large U.S. company, and the Korean manufacturer
was apparently using similar technology to manufacture specialty steels for
other users in Korea as well as for export to the U.S. Although the Korean
manufacturer could produce only 15 m lengths of heat-treated steel rails, it
was already planning to expand facilities to handle the 25-m long rail that
KNR needed. All other technical specifications, e.g., hardness distribution,
tension, bending drop, chemical composition, etc., were satisfactory. The
mission therefore recommended approval of the contract with the Korean
supplier which was done in early 1984.
Feasibility Studies
3.08      Several major studies were financed under the Railways VII loan.
They were mostly intermodal and covered urban, regional and intercity
transport. A brief description of studies under each category follows.
Urban Transport
3.09      Seoul City Transport Improvement Program Feasibility Study. The
basic objectives of the study were to (a) assist the city government in estab-
lishing effective traffic management and traffic planning units; and (b) to
develop traffic management, pedestrian facilities and road construction pro-
grams to relieve traffic congestion in the city. A team of American consul-
tants with Korean partners was selected to conduct this 12-month study and
contracts were signed in April 1982. The study was well executed and the
final report was issued in September 1983. Its recommendations formed the
basis for the current Seoul urban transport project which will try to complete
major missing links in the Seoul road netork and introduce Transport System
Management (TSM). TSM mostly includes the application of low-cost improve-
ments to streets in major corridors which will significantly enhance capacity.
3.10      Busan City Transport Improvement Program Feasibility Study.  This
study had objectives similar to the Seoul study and was carried out by mostly
Korean teams with selected foreign specialists. It was completed in August
1984 and its recommendations formed the basis of the Busan urban transport
project which is about to be preappraised. The project will mostly focus on
locating terminals and other improvements to public transit as well as use of
the TSM concept.
3.11      Public Transport Operations Study * The study's objectives were to
further develop Ministry of Transport (MOT) capabilities in evaluating
transport policies, regulations on public transport and in setting fare
structures, route assignments and licensing. The study was conducted by
Korean consultants, took about eight months and was completed in August
1984. The study analyzed the problems Seoul City has experienced with public
transit in certain arterial roads and also difficulties in bus/subway



- 11 -
interchange. In its recommendations the study suggested improvements to
regulatory systems, particularly for buses and taxis. These findings form the
basis for current Bank/MOT dialogue on regulation and fare setting for the 90
odd bus companies in Seoul (which are all privately operated and profit-
able). Some of the study's routing and fare setting recommendations are
currently being implemented while others will proabably be components of the
proposed second Seoul urban transport project.
3.11      Training Requirements in Transport Planning.  The objectives of the
study were to (a) identify types of training needed for urban transportation
personnel (both in traffic management and transport planning); and (b) develop
the organizational plan and personnel qualifications needed to carry out the
training. The nine-month study was conducted by a Korean consulting team
assisted by Seoul National University and was completed in September 1984.
The study suggested establishing a national training institute for transporta-
tion personnel and outlined a syllabus for transport courses that should be
offered as well as proposals for a research program. Current Bank/MOT
discussions are exploring the possibility of implementing these findings.
3.12      Secondary Cities Transport Improvement Program.  The study had
objectives similar to those of the Seoul and Busan studies, but as applied to
the cities of Daegu, Daejeon and Gwangju. Korean consultants assisted by
selected foreign specialists are conducting the nine-month study, and issued
an interim report in October 1984. The final report is expected in mid-
1985. Study recommendations should form the core transport improvement plans
for the cities.
Regional Studies
3.13      The project financed the multimodal Kyeonggi (Seoul) region
integrated transport study, the objectives of which were to study land
transport requirements (road/rail) and to conduct feasibility studies for
proposed new links to determine the most cost-effective transport system for
the region. The two-phase study, conducted by French consultants in associa-
tion with a Korean firm, started in early 1984. The Phase I report was issued
in December 1984 and identified specific road/rail segments which should be
studied further. The Phase II (feasibility) study is now in progress and is
due for completion in November 1985. Since this is after the closing date of
the Railways VII loan, arrangements have been made for continued funding of
the study under the Coal and Cement Distribution Project (Loan 2267-KO). The
results of the feasibility study will be to identify the exact road network
components (probably a Seoul beltway and major feeder arteries) and rail
linkages (mostly suburban light rail) which will form the basis of the
Regional Transport Project tentatively scheduled for FY87.
Intercity (Seoul-Busan Corridor) Transport Study
3.14      The study's objective was to review the long-term transport
investment needs in the Seoul-Busan corridor and to examine the feasibility of
a High Speed Train (HST) between Seoul and Busan. The two-phased study by a
team of American, Korean and Danish consultants started in March 1983. Phase I,
which reviewed the multimodal alternatives, was completed in April 1984. It



- 12 -
recommended expanding and upgrading several highways in the Seoul-Busan corri-
dor and introducing a high speed trair (like the French TGV or Japanese
Shinkansen) by 1997. The Phase I repoit was subject to detailed reviews by a
steering committee before approval was given to proceed to Phase II which was
a detailed feasibility study of the high speed train; this was completed in
February 1985. The Phase I study also recommended the immediate installation
of a Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) system on the rail lines from Suweon to
Daegu to improve signalling and train handling capacity. This is needed to
meet the capacity requirements of the growing express passenger train traffic
and also as an interim step until the HST can be built. The CTC system forms
the major component of the Seoul-Busan Corridor project which will be
presented to the Bank's Board for approval in June 1985.
Technical Assistance
3.15      This project component largely included providing consulting
services for implementing commercial accounting, costing and management
improvement programs. Its objective was to improve KNR itself and prepare it
for full autonomy by January 1987. Implementation of the various programs is
discussed under "Institutional Development" in paras. 6.01-6.04.
Training
3.16      The loan included funds for overseas training of staff, particularly
in the field of investment planning and computerized commercial and cost
accounting. This component was well executed. Several trainees were selected
and sent overseas, mostly to the U.S. and Japan for intensive courses. They
have all completed their courses, returned to KNR and have made significant
contributions to KNR, especially in implementing the commercial accounting
program.
Project Cost
3.17      The cost of the total project as originally approved in 1980 was W
350.5 billion (US$604.3 million). After the reductions in project scope in
1981, the total cost of the revised project was W 239 billion. The final cost
was W 277 billion (US$410.8 billion), representing an increase of 16% in Won
(or 12X in US$) above the revised estimate. The difference in cosq,overrun by
currency is due to extensive and repeated devaluations of the Won -/ during
the project period and the fact that cost estimates were based on the U.S.
1/   The Won was devalued five times in 1980 alone, from W 485 in January 1980
to an eventual W 682 to the US$ by November 1980. Annual Conversion
averages were W 485 at appraisal, W 607 in 1980, W 681 in 1981, W 720 in
1982 and W 783 in 1983, to the US dollar.



- 13 -
dollar. However, given the rampant inflation 2/ prevailing in Korea during
the early project implementation period, it is commendable that costs were
contained to this extent. Overall the costs of project quantities were some-
what higher than the appraisal estimate, with unit prices substantially higher
than estimated for permanent way works, locomotives and railcars (except for
railcars for Seoul suburban traffic) while unit costs for double tracking,
crossing loops and station yards were below estimates. Details of actual and
appraisal costs are given in Table 3.3.
Loan Disbursements
3.18      Cumulative disbursements (detailed in Table 3.4) compared to
appraisal estimates were as follows:
FY81         FY82          FY83         FY84          FY85
(US$ million) ---
Appraisal            52.0          89.5          94.0           -             -
Actual                 9.8         75.3          86.1         92.0          93.0
Even though there was a slow start, most of the XKR portion of the loan
(US$88.2 million) was disbursed by end-FY83 as originally planned. Disburse-
ment of the remainder was delayed mainly by the urban transport studies
(US$2.6 million), the multimodal transport studies (US$3.0 million) and tech-
nical assistance and training (about US$0.2 million) where implementation took
more time than expected. As discussed (para. 3.05), there were also some
minor procurement delays which affected disbursements. A small, undisbursed
portion of the loan ($1.039 m) was eventually cancelled. It should be noted
that even though slower than appraisal estimates, disbursements were much
faster than the standard country profile which suggests a seven-year schedule.
Reallocation of Loan Funds
3.19      At KNR's request, the Bank loan funds disbursement by category was
changed on May 29, 1981 and on December 14, 1982 so as to utilize the unallo-
cated funds. The following table shows the original, reallocated and final
allocation of loan proceeds:
2/   The wholesale price index was:  1976-100, 1977 = 104.4, 1978 - 116.6,
1979 - 138.4, 1980 - 192.3, 1981 * 235.5, 1982 - 247.6, 1983 - 249.

Fulfillment of the Main Loan Covenants
3.20      Compliance with covenants (other than those relating to financial
issues) was generally satisfactory. Problems affecting the financial cove-
nants are discussed in Chapter V and were more a result of macroeconomic fac-
tors and government policy than any actions/inactions by KNR management. In
areas of relative autonomy, KIR has fully and fairly complied with all cove-
nanted requirements. Table 3.5 details all major covenants and their degree
of compliance. It should be noted that many of the covenants in the Loan
Agreement for the Seventh Railways Project were superseded by new provisions
in Loan Agreement 2267-KO for the Coal and Cement Distribution Project.
IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
Freight Traffic
4.01      Freight traffic data for the period 1966-1984 are given in Tables
4.1-4.3. In making traffic forecasts for this project at appraisal, a growth
rate of 31 to 5X per annum was used. This represented a conservative estimate
and an attempt to more accurately predict freight traffic because forecasts
under past projects were much too optimistic. Three scenarios for 1980-86
were made at appraisal, using high (5X p.a.), best (41 p.a.) and low (31 p.a.)
growth rates in freight ton-kilometers. The actual growth rate so far has
averaged 2X p.a., hence the low growth scenario was the closest to reality.
The following table compares actual ton-km with the three forecasts.

1984    12,033    14,085    13,329    12,589
4.02      The data show that freight traffic was adversely affected by the
economic downturn of 1980-81 and only recovered by early 1983 to its 1979
level. Following the Presidential assassination in 1980, the economy
stagnated and there was a nationwide downturn in construction as well as
industrial activity. There was little growth in demand for coal and a sharp
decline for cement, the two commodities on which KUR freight forecasts were
mainly based. The recovery since 1982 has been fairly strong, averaging 3.4%
p.a.; if such a growth rate is maintained, actual freight traffic will exceed
the targets set for 1986 under the low growth scenario. In future, KKR should
probably count on a 2-3X p.a. long-term growth rate in freight ton-km. For
the ten years 1975-1984 inclusive, it has averaged 2.91 p.a. growth in freight
ton-km.  This period has included downturns, upturns, slow growth, rapid
growth and modest growth as shown on Chart 1 overleaf. It is probably repre-
sentative of the dependence of KNR freight traffic growth on the performance
of the economy as a whole.

Passenger Traffic
4.03       Passenger traffic forecasts at appraisal were based on annual growth
rates between 5% and 7% in passengers and between 7% and 10% in passenger-
km. There was an underlying assumption of a continued 7% to 8% p,a. growth in
GNP and also that the Government would continue to maintain a restrictive
policy on the ownership and use of private automobiles. While the latter
assumption was correct, the actual GNP growth rate, still fairly high on a
long-term basis, suffered a brief decline in the early 1980s. Railway inter-
city passenger traffic then went into a decline, especially ordinary passenger
traffic, and has not fully recovered. It is expected that passenger traffic
will eventually recover, just as it did from the only previous major downturn
in 1970/71. The latter was caused by the 1970 opening of the Seoul-Busan and
Daejeon-Oaangju expressways and the resultant intense competition from buses
for intercity passengers.
4.04       Passenger traffic statistics are shown in Tables 4.4 to 4.6; data on
long distance passenger traffic are summarized overleaf:

The table shows actual figures compared with the low growth forecast for
passengers (51) and for passenger-km (71). A few trends are immediately
obvious. KNR has lost about 34 million passengers from its peak ridership of
approximately 165 million in 1980. All of the loss is due to a continuous
decline of 41 million in ordinary passenger patronage from its peak of 116
million in 1980 to a 15 year low of 75 million in 1984. The reverse of this
trend occurs in the case of the limited express service which gained nearly 17
million riders in the 1980-84 period. Most of the express passengers probably
transferred from ordinary trains as the rising income levels and mobility in
Korea led to an increase in the value of time. People are therefore more
willing and able to pay for higher levels of service. Ironically, this trend
of passenger growth (91 p.a., 1980-84) in the more profitable express train
services coupled with a decline (average 81 p.a., 1980-84) in ordinary train
services may prove ultimately to be beneficial to KNR profitability even
though total passenger patronage has declined.
4.05      In terms of passenger-km, a similar but somewhat modified trend
occurred. Overall passenger-km declined by only 7.31 over the period 1980-84
versus the 201 decline in the actual number of passengers. This again was due
to the qualitative change in KNR ridership - the partial substitution of
express passengers who traveled an average 206 km in 1984 for ordinary passen-
gers who only averaged 47 km. Hence the decline in overall passenger-km
actually masks a very important trend - that is, KNR has had a 7A p.a. growth
in passenger-km during 1980-84 for express train service. Chart 2 overleaf
shows actual and forecast intercity passenger traffic during 1967-86.

4.06      The special express service (Saemaul trains) did not do as well as
expected, but is still a profitable service. Data on operations during 1979-
84 are summarized below:

1980      2.5       3.0        797       975        319      325
1981      2.2       3.5        722     1,120        328      320
1982      1.9       4.0        641     1,260        337      315
1983      1.9       4.5        607     1,395        319      310

This service's higher fares relative to express trains or buses probably partly
explain the siowdown in patronage over the period.  However, the average
distance has increased; this is the only passenger rail statistic to exceed
appraisal projections. If this continues and KNR ridership stabilizes, then
the decline in passenger-km may cease.
4.07      KNR's Seoul urban service (SMESRS) which started in 1974 grew at an
annual rate of 7.5Z p.a. in terms of passenger-km during 1980-84. This repre-
sents a considerable slowdown from previous growth rates, though in itself is
a good, sustainable rate of growth. It shows that the period of initial
acceptance and rapid growth in this service is over, and though there may be
occasional periods of return to past super-growth levels (usually whenever new
lines are opened), long-term growth may more likely match the recent 7%
figure. Some statistics follow:

Traffic Levels by Mode
4.08      For the transport sector as a whole, the railroad's market share has
been declining since 1966. Highway transport is the dominant mode in terms of
volume with an 82.8% share of the 430 million tons of domestic freight in
1982, a tremendous increase from its 47% share of 51 million tons of freight
in 1966. The railways managed only an 11% share in 1982, down from its 46.9%
share in 1966. The maritime share has increased to 6% during the period, up
by 1%. As indicated in the following table, the modal split in terms of ton-
km showed similar developments.

During 1966-82 total ton-km have more than quadrupled, but the railway has
only doubled the amount it carried. Highways handled the majority of the
growth in freight traffic, causing the railway market share to decline sub-
stantially. It is estimated that by end-1984 highway transport had the
absolute largest market share in ton-km.
4.09      A similar development occurred in passenger transport in which high-
way transport had a much higher growth rate than that of rail. As shown in
the following table, highway transport had the dominant share in both
passengers and passenger-km since before 1966; in the subsequent years the
dominance continued. To be sure, there was enough traffic growth overall
(13.7% p.a. average) in passenger-km from 1966 to 1982 to support all modes of
transport.

/a   Figures may not add up due to rounding.
Railway passenger traffic growth averaged 7.6% p.a. overall during the period
1966-82; this is a little more than one half of overall traffic growth. The
railway has lost traffic share, perhaps irreversibly. However, as discussed
above (paras. 4.04-4.05), this is not necessarily a negative indicator because
the traffic actually lost (ordinary trains) may be more efficiently served by
other modes. The most important question now that KNR seems to be shedding
its uneconomic ordinary train traffic is will the growth in express trai
service demand be stable and continue at current levels.
KNR Operations
4.10      Selected operating statistics for KNR during 1975-83 are shown in
Table 4.7. Analysis of these performance indicators supports the well-known
fact that the level of KNR's operational efficiency is remarkable. The avail-
ability of most rolling stock remained high at around 90%. Due to the slow
growth in traffic, the average freight train load increased only slightly from
491 net tons in 1979 to 509 net tons by 1983. On the other hand due to the
intercity passenger downturn, the average number of passengers per train
decreased from 515 in 1979 to 496 in 1983. Overall there was an increase in
the total number of traffic units from 32.5 million in 1979 to 33.3 million by
1983; most of this increase was due to the growth of suburban rail (SMESRS)
services. Employee productivity increased over the period from 808,000
traffic units in 1979 to 846,500 in 1983; this was accompanied by a 2% drop in
total employees between 1979-89. Turnaround for freight cars also improved
from 5.0 days in 1979 to 4.76 days in 1983.

V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
5.01      In the five years prior to the start of project implementation, RNR
experienced a consistent 10% p.a. growth in traffic units. This performance
largely resulted from the tremendous growth in passenger-km (12% p.a.) during
that period. KNR therefore embarked on a large capacity expansion investment
program under the Seventh Railway Project in order to keep up with expected
traffic demand. KNR borrowed extensively, and to service the related debt had
counted on (a) a continuation of traffic growth leading to full utilization of
the additional capacity; &nd (b) a slowdown in inflation that would help to
control costs. Instead there was high inflation and a stagnation in traf-
fic. This led to underutilization of the new investments as overall traffic
at first declined slightly and only surpassed its 1979 level (32.5 billion
traffic units) in 1983 (33.3 billion-traffic units); hence overall growth for
the 1979-84 period averaged a mere 1.1% p.a. At the same time, operating
costs for these investments increased and also debt had to be serviced. The
combination of these factors led to a financial performance that was somewhat
below expectations. These results were reflected in KNR's income statement,
cash flow and balance sheets which form the background for the following
analysis.

The data show that KNR gross operating revenues increased each year from W 208
billion in 1979 to over W 524 billion in 1984 even though there was little
change in the total number of traffic units during this period. This was due
to increased tariffs and the growth of the more profitable express passenger
services. Revenue per traffic unit averaged W 15.46 in 1984, up significantly
from W 6.41 in 1979. However, the rest of the income statement shows that
while close to covering operating costs, KNR revenues could not cover interest
payments and therefore it had substantial losses. Most of the losses can be
attributed to ordinary train service, for which the Government provides a
partial subsidy. Hence an otherwise good performance by improving the quality
of its ridership mix and increasing unit gross revenue was obscured by factors
beyond the control of KNR management such as the setting of appropriate
tariffs for the ordinary train services.
5.03      When examining these results it should be borne in mind that KKR's
financial performance is analyzed by overly conservative methods. This occurs
because Section 4.08 of the Seventh Railway Loan Agreement specifically prohi-
bits the inclusion of Government subsidies in KNR's operating revenues. In
reality, this means that KNR is penalized by factors beyond its control
because it is forced by Government to operate certain loss making services but
then cannot consider the Government subsidies it duly receives as part of its
operating revenue. In recognition of this paradox, it was decided during
recent negotiations for the Seoul/Busan Corridor Project to include Government
subsidies In operating revenues, a practice which is endorsed by the
International Accounting Standards Committee. This change in the method of
measuring operating revenues will be reflected in the loan agreements for

future projects as well as for ongoing ones such as the Coal and Cement
Distribution Project. Using it will make a positive difference in KNR's
financial performance; for example if financial statements under the Seventh
Railways are thus restated the main indicators would be as follows:

This table reinforces the fact that while performance is still below the Loan
Covenant requirements (rates of return of 3.12in 1980, 5.5% in 1981 and 1982,
and 6% thereafter) the railways have actually made progress during a period of
little traffic growth.
Tariffs
5.04      The following table shows that, over 1977-81, passenger tariff
increases slightly exceeded inflation every year except in 1980, and that by
December 1981 they had been increased 6% more than the consumer price index
(CPI) during the 4-1/2 year period. Freight tariff increases were below
inflation through mid-1980 but then exceeded the CPI substantially for the
rest of the period. Coal tariffs, which were historically lower than other
freight tariffs, were increased by over 90% between mid-1980 and the end of
1983.

However, these increases were generally applied across the board. As a result
some rates were still far short of covering costs. The most striking case
relates to ordinary passenger trains, tariffs fot which were even short of
covering variable costs.

5.06      From this table it can be seen that express train services have
continued to be the major source of total KNR gross operating revenues by
starting at 34.6% in 1979 and rising to 37X of these revenues in 1983.  At the
same time their costs rose slightly from 19.4% in 1979 to 22% of total costs
in 1983. The most improved service in terms of profitability and the best in
terms of total cost coverage was the Air Conditioned (A/C) express. Its con-
tribution to total revenue improved from 2.7% in 1979 to 10.7X in 1983;
furthermore these revenues exceeded total cost of providing the service by
67%. Ordinary train service has continued to be the major loss maker. In
1979 it contributed 8.9% of total revenues but incurred 17.71 of total costs;
this increased over the period and by 1983 it provided 6.5% of total revenues
buit was responsible for 20X of all costs. In 1983 ordinary train service had



- 27 -
abysmally low cost covemges - only 54% of variable operating cost and an even
worse 28Z of total costs. Ordinary train service also has the worst unit cost
structure in that fixed operating costs and interest charges comprise almost
48% of its total unit costs. Its unit variable operating cost, at 52% of
total cost, is the lowest of all services; this stems from the costly, expen-
sive infrastructure needed to maintain this service to so many locations. As
a whole, passenger traffic suffered a mild decline both in contributions to
gross revenues, from 60% in 1979 down to 58% in 1983, and in terms of total
cost coverage from 97% in 1979 down to 85% in 1983.
5.07      Freight traffic has shown considerable improvement.  On average,
freight traffic revenue covered 87% of total cost in 1983, up considerably
from 73% in 1979. Most of the major commodities - coal, cement and ores - had
coverages of total costs of over 90% in 1983, and reportedly after the 1984
tariff increases these coverages reached 98%. Coal is still the largest
freight contributor to gross revenue; in 1983 it contributed 17% of gross
revenues (up from 12% in 1979) and covered 96% of total cost. Container ser-
vice is very small, contributing about 1.2% of total revenue but highly
profitable as it covers 141% of total cost. Freight service as a whole has
also gained in total share of KUR revenues up from almost 40X in 1979 to over
42% in 1983. At the same time its contribution to total cost has declined
from just over 44% in 1979 to less than 42% in 1983.
5.08      Hence, except for ordinary train service, the overall trend of
profitability by service is good. Eventually, ordinary train service will be
less of a problem for KNR as it is declining in use. Even though losses on
this service will still be incurred, they will have a reduced impact on KNR
profitability as increasing shares of total revenues will come from the more
profitable services which are experiencing moderate to high growth.
Financial Situation
5.09      KNR operated at a net loss for about 4 years up to 1983; this has
resulted in the progressive deterioration of its working capital from a
negative Won 3.7 billion in 1977 down to negative Won 80 billion by 1981.
Working capital has since improved to an estimated negative W 44.5 billion in
1984, due mainly to tariff increases and the increases in revenue per traffic
unit. To cover the deficits in working capital, KNR had to increase its long-
term borrowing from local sources which led to substantial interest charges.
KNR was therefore not able to achieve the 1.5 ratio of current assets to
current liabilities provided for under Section 4.05 of the Loan Agreement.
5.10      The additional borrowing explains the gradual decline of KUR's debt
to equity ratio which fell from 32/68 in 1979 to an estimated 38/62 by 1984.
This ratio is not expected to decline much further as the KNR investment
program will not grow substantially in the near term. In the long term some
improvement is expected since, if current trends persist, KNR earnings will
continue to grow.

Remedial Action Taken
5.11      At the time of negotiations for this project, the Government had
agreed to establish a revised cost-based tariff structure for KNR by
December 31, 1984. The agreement has only been partially met but the overall
efforts by Government in raising tariffs faster than increases in the consumer
price index have helped to curtail KNR losses. The investments included in
this project, by providing capacity increases for SMESRS and express services,
have also had a pronounced positive effect on KNR revenues. In future, the
best strategy for KNR seems to be the one it has already adopted, i.e., the
reduction in ordinary trains coupled with the expansion and aggressive
marketing of its profitable services.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.01      At the time of appraisal, it was felt that KNR's status as a semi-
autonomous agency prevented its management from enjoying the freedom in
planning, organizational and financial decision-making needed in dealing with
increasingly fierce competition and adapting to abrupt changes in traffic
demand and/or economic conditions. Full autonomy seemed to be the solution
and a study on how best to prepare KNR for this was carried out under the
Fifth (Loan 1101-KO) and Sixth (Loan 1542-KO) Railway Projects. Accordingly
agreement was reached at negotiations of the Seventh Project on a timetable
for implementing the short- and medium-term measures recommended by the study,
with the objective of making KNR a public corporation no later than January 1,
1987. These short- and medium-term measures were to focus on: (a) the estab-
lishment of a management information system and an aggressive marketing orga-
nization; (b) the strengthening of KNR's capabilities in economic analysis,
investment planning, financial management and accounting procedures, with
special emphasis on the introduction of performance budgeting and incremental
long-term variable costing; and (c) progressive re-organization of KNR's
managerial structure in order to ensure a smooth transitior to a public
organization.
6.02      At negotiations it was also envisaged that the same consulting team
(an American firm with Korean partners) who conducted the original study would
implement the study findings by 1982. However, KNR and the consulting team
disagreed over contract costs and KNR spent the next 20 months trying to con-
vince the American firm to lower its offer. Finally negotiations were broken
off in late 1981, and KNR decided to invite bids from other firms. After an
eight-month selection process, the contract with the lowest evaluated bidder
(another American firm in partnership with a Korean one) was signed on May 24,
1982 and work commenced shortly thereafter. The new consulting team initially
made a systematic review of its predecessor's plans and recommendations. This
took about six months. They then suggested implementing some of the measures
as originally envisaged but also proposed major changes in other areas.
6.03      Implementation of institutional development measures therefore
started in 1983, some two and one half years behind schedule. There were
still other problems within KNR itself which led to further delays and slowed



- 29 -
implementation. The period from mid-1982 to the end of 1983 was one of insta-
bility at KNR with four changes in Directors. This made it difficult for the
consulting team to get needed cooperation as the new managements were busy
establishing and organizing themselves. The institutional building part of
the technical assistance component therefore could not gain full momentum.
6.04      Despite all this, some progress was made and the following measures
were fully or partly introduced: (a) the costing system; (b) commercial
accounting; (c) electronic data processing; (d) investment planning and bud-
geting procedures; and (e) periodic seminars for management training. Some
actions were postponed by the consulting team (e.g., incremental variable
costing) and others were redesigned (the management information system) to
suit the changing environment. Finally, in August 1984, the consulting team
prepared a new timetable for introducing the management improvement program
which will consist of the following among other things: (a) strategic plan-
ning; (b) implementation of a cost-based tariff system; (c) performance
budgeting; and (d) a management information system. The program will be
implemented under the ongoing Coal and Cement Project and the Seoul-Busan
Corridor Project. Implementation of the phased, long-term plan should proceed
smoothly, given the current relative stability within KNR.
VII. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
7.01      The evaluation at appraisal analyzed separately the economic return
on capacity expansion investment in: (a) freight services, (b) passenger
services, and (c) suburban rail services. The appraisal's economic evaluation
focused on project i2vestments globally and on particular items when possible.
The largest investment group, accounting for nearly one half of all project
costs, consisted of investments which were primarily intended to increase
railway carrying capacity for the types of traffic best suited economically to
rail transport. The second group, amounting to 32% of project costs and also
consisting of capacity-increasing investments was for suburban passenger
services in the Seoul metropolitan area. The remaining project items were for
way and structures renewal (10%) and miscellaneous investments (12%).
7.02      The methodology followed for economic re-evaluation was the same as
that at appriasal. For ease of comparison, cost and benefit figures were com-
puted in end-1979 prices. The appraisal and recalculated rates of return are
listed below; details are given in Tables 7.1 to 7.3.

7.03      The re-evaluated rates are lower mainly because of traffic short-
falls and the use of lower growth rates than at appraisal. As discussed in
paras. 4.01-4.07, there was a significant downturn in traffic and hence the
newly in3talled facilities were not fully utilized. In the long term it is
expected that all investments will prove worthwhile.
7.04      The benefit streams were computed according to the various
categories of investments. For freight, the capacity expansion benefits were
measured in terms of the transport cost savings for the overall economy,
calculated as the difference between the economic cost of rail transport and
the economic cost of the next best (highway) mode. For passenger service, the
capacity increase provided better quality special and limited express train
services. The economic costs of these services are slightly lower than bus
costs because rail services, when used to capacity in Korea, consume less fuel
per passenger-km than buses. The benefits of increasing the capacity of the
better quality passenger services were therefore measured in terms of people's
willingness to pay for the services over and above their financial costs. For
the suburban services, the benefits of increasing service were expressed in
terms of transport cost savings from the alternative mode, mostly buses and
cars. This benefit calculation was particularly conservative because it does
not include the higher costs of some diverted trips which may be made by taxis
or private cars, nor savings in road passenger time which would be affected by
the increased congestion which a bus transport alternative would impose on the
already busy streets.
VIII. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
8.01      The project continued the dialogue between the Government and the
Bank, which had been ongoing under the previous six projects. This has
resulted in further growth and development of KNR as an institution. Project-
assisted studies and technical assistance have also enabled the Government and
KNR to begin addressing financial issues as well as to better define KKR's
role in a future to be dominated by a multimodal transport outlook.



- 31 -
8.02      Regarding KNR's financial performance, although there is an
accumulated deficit, the deficit is due to the ordinary trains which KNR is
forced to run on social service grounds. In areas where more managerial
freedom is allowed and more appropriate tariff policies are followed, KNR's
efficiency and productivity have grown to new highs. The Bank has been a
catalyst for change in these areas, specifically by assisting in the use of
traffic costing syscems to identify which services to encourage or discourage
and then placing an emphasis on investments for services in the first
category. This should lead in the long-term to a profitable, well run
organization.
8.03      The multimodal approach is a product of rapid changes in the Korean
transport situation and the overall loss in market shares by KNR to highway
transport. KNR had proposed building a new High Speed Train (HST) from Seoul
to Busan as a way of providing frequent, high quality service in this corridor
and hopefully offset the losses in market shares (para. 3.14). The Bank was
able to persuade KNR to conduct multimodal studies which examined the least-
cost alternative of providing mass passenger and freight transport in the
Seoul region as well as the Seoul-Busan corridor. Out of these studies have
come a more balanced approach to transport planning in Korea as well as
proposals for specific road and rail investments. The Bank's role has
therefore been critical to development of transport policy in KNR and Korea as
a whole. Since this was a first effort at a multimodal approach in Korea,
there were of course problems in coordination between all of the agencies
concerned in setting terms of reference, selecting consultants, reviewing the
various phases of the studies, etc. But it can be judged as well done and
such studies will form important parts of subsequent projects.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      The project has achieved its overall objectives of increasing KNi's
capacity to handle growing express passenger and freight services and
curtailing losses on ordinary trains. It has also paved the way for extensive
changes in KNR itself, with its emphasis on management, planning, costing and
economic analysis. The KNR implementation capability was excellent, and
although the economic and financial returns from the investments were not as
high as expected, this was due to problems in the economy as a whole and, to
some extent, Government's social policy. The project was probably most
valuable in providing the impetus for a turnaround in KNR's financial and
managerial performance.

Rate of Return is 19%
/a Includes investment (in 1979 prices) in lines, motive power and rolling stock, new
repair facilities, telecommunications and power.
/b This is taken conservatively as two thirdp of the freight traffic increase. The
remaining traffic increase is assumed to be handled by improvement in use of existing
facilities.
/c Difference (in 1979 prices) between transport cost by rail and the least costly alter-
native. This is generally road transport since coastal shipping is only competitive
for traffic with origins and destinations at or near ports and this has already been
taken into account when forecasting railway traffic. An average of W 20 per ton-km is
assumed as the cost difference. This assumes a terminal cost for rail operations of
W 1,200 per ton, and a road cost which is a weighted average of heavy truck costs on
paved and gravel roads (3/4 paved and 1/4 gravel).

Rate of return is 16%
/a Includes investment for the entire quadrupling of the Seoul-Suweon line,
started under the sixth project and completed under this project, and the
electric railcars acquired.
/b Difference between cost by rail and cost by bus. This is conservative as,
without the project, some trips may divert to taxis and cars at higher
costs. Cost by urban buses in Seoul were some W 10/passenger-km while
costs by SMESRS were W 4/passenger-km.
