The Amazon basin covers an\n            area of approximately 7,000,000 km, of which about 58\n            percent (4,100,000 km) is located in Brazil. From a\n            biodiversity perspective, the Amazon basin is unparalleled;\n            it is home to the world's richest assemblages of\n            freshwater flora and fauna, including approximately one\n            third of the world's entire freshwater ichthyo fauna.\n            Many of the region's economic activities are based on\n            the use of aquatic resources, which are increasingly at risk\n            due to the uncontrolled and poorly planned expansion of high\n            impact activities in the basin. The project sought to\n            address various issues that directly or indirectly affect\n            the sustainability and conservation of aquatic biodiversity\n            and water resources in the Brazilian Amazon, operating on\n            three major fronts that were identified as constraints for\n            long-term conservation and sustainable use of aquatic\n            resources: (i) strengthening the institutional capacity of\n            various stakeholder groups to participate in decision-making\n            processes; (ii) supporting the creation or strengthening of\n            discussion fora at the local, regional (sub-basin),\n            national, and international levels and; (iii) learning from\n            the testing, on a demonstrative basis, of new methodologies\n            and technologies for the restoration and sustainable use of\n            natural resources, and proposing the implementation of\n            successful ones on a larger scale. The project was approved\n            by the Board on June 13, 2006. The Global Environment\n            Facility (GEF) Grant agreement was signed on September 15,\n            2006 and became effective on February 28, 2007. The project\n            closed on March 26, 2012, 5 months before original date of\n            August 31, 2012, with the undisbursed amount of USD 6.47\n            Million, equivalent to 90.1 percent of original project\n            funding. Critical factors that led to the decision to\n            proceed with cancellation includes: 1) Ministry of\n            Environment (MMA's) low level of capacity, commitment\n            and leadership significantly delayed the establishment and\n            functioning of the project coordination unit; 2) a lengthy\n            project restructuring negotiation to transfer implementation\n            responsibilities to Brazilian Institute for the Environment\n            and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) further delayed the\n            beginning of project implementation; 3) project\n            implementation was further hindered by IBAMA's own\n            internal reorganization and change of leadership that\n            occurred just after the project restructure was approved;\n            and 4) conditions of effectiveness of the amended grant\n            agreement were not met."}, "docdt": "2012-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
