The war, which lasted from\n            1998 to June 1999, and the ensuing period of instability\n            that ended with the election of a new government in December\n            1999, combined with the one-year suspension of the IDA\n            credit, impeded project implementation and compromised some\n            of the project's results. In fact, the war paralyzed\n            the entire health delivery system and contributed to the\n            serious deterioration of health indicators particularly in\n            the capital city of Bissau as documented by National Health\n            and Development Program supervision mission of March/April\n            2000. The key lessons learned from the project are as\n            follows: 1) Project ownership and community engagement must\n            be ensured. 2) Human resources development should not be\n            limited to training. 3) Public/private partnership and the\n            contracting-out of services is a prerequisite for expansion\n            of health care services. 4) The success registered under the\n            social fund component demonstrated that nongovernmental\n            organizations can be and should play an important role in\n            expanding primary health care and prevention and reaching\n            the poorest segments of the population. 5) Donor\n            coordination and complementarity are most effective when\n            Government is committed and leads and owns the health\n            planning and implementation process."}, "docdt": "2001-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
