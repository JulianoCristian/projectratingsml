3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The Project Objectives as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) were to:
(a) improve the delivery and quality of primary health care (PHC) services for a wider base of the
population; (b) strengthen the health sector human resource base; (c) strengthen and develop institutional
capacity; (d) improve the dissemination, content and co-ordination of health information, education and



communication messages to the general population, with a special focus on the most common diseases and
AIDS education; (e) support NGOs development of targeted micro-social action programs; and (f) impiove
donor coordination and dialogue among entities working on social sector issues.
Assessment of Objectives.
The above project objectives were appropriate and responsive to the Guinea Bissau Government's
circumstances and priorities and in full accordance with development priorities as presented in the Bank's
country Assistance Strategy (CAS FY 1993-96) for Guinea Bissau. The project evolved from two prior
IDA Projects: (I) the Population, Health and Nutrition (PHN) Project (Cr. 1 800-GUB), which was
approved in the amount of US$4.2 million equivalent in 1987 and closed in December 1991, aimed to
improve the institutional capacities of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Action (MPHSA); and (2)
the Multi-Sector Social and Infrastructure Relief Project (SIRP) (Cr. 2020-GUB), which was approved in
the amount of US$8 million equivalent in May 1989 and closed in 1993, provided essential inputs in the
improvement of physical structures. As a follow-on operation, the SSP was designed to consolidate and
expand the gains and outcomes of these two projects, with a special focus on improving the human resolurce
base in the sector, developing the primary health care system and increasing the involvement of
beneficiaries and the civil society (NGOs, local associations) in health care and social activities at
grassroots level.
The project functioned as a precursor to a health sector investment program (SIP) operation, i.e., the
National Health Development Program (NHDP). Departing from earlier top-down approaches, the SSF'
solicited the involvement of stakeholders and the MOHSA staff to better define the needs and priorities for
Bank intervention. While ambitious and diverse, all project objectives were instrumental in dealing with the
improvement of health care service delivery in Guinea-Bissau and establishing social protection activities in
partnership with other dono;s and the civil society. However, The project operated against a backgrouncl of
rapidly deteriorating political environment which led to armed conflict and a breakdown of public
administration. While the project physical outputs have had a positive effect in improving the delivery of"
essential primary health care for a greater proportion of the population, real progress in improving the
country's health indicators was adversely affected by war. A Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS)
recently conducted under a joint UNICEF/WHO/IDA initiative indicated that 34% of births are attended by
skilled personnel and that 34% of children under one receive full vaccination. Although still very low, these
indicators confirm that provision of basic health care services remained operational throughout the conflict
period largely as a result of the project's investments.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Not applicable
3.3 Original Components:
The project consisted of the following components:
- 2 -



Comprehensive Training for Health Workers. This component provided three health training programs
including: (a) in-service training refresher program, (b) local training upgrading program, and (c)
short-term training for medical specialization.
The refresher program targeted nine specific courses with a specific number of students expected to attend
each: Management in Health Services (120 students), Computer Training (20 students), Statistics for
Health Center Nurses (175 students), Information Systems and Statistics for Technicians (25 students),
Training of Trainers (25 students), Financing of Health Care (50 students), Management of Drugs (15),
Introduction to drug Management for Auxiliary Nurses (50 students), and Environmental Sanitation (25
students).
The in-service training program to up-grade the skills of the health workers targeted seven sub-programs to
upgrade 150 auxiliary nurses to nurses, 50 auxiliary mid-wives to mid-wives, and about 160 auxiliary
nurses to specialized technicians including 30 social technicians, 40 laboratory technicians, 50 technicians
pharmacists, 20 environmental sanitation technicians, and 20 auxiliary anesthetic technicians.
The short-term training program for medical specialization to assist: (a) the National Medical School by
supplying books, journals and technical reviews; (b) the Simon Mendes Hospital by providing medical and
other equipment required for the training of doctors and other health personnel, and (c) Guinean doctors
with at least two years' experience to undergo specialized training in the field of pediatrics, obstetrics,
general surgery and public health training.
Information, Education and Communication (lEC) This component dealt with: (i) the provision of
short-term technical assistance to support the development of national strategies and a medium-term IEC
Program; (ii) the establishment of an IEC Division in the MPHSA to oversee the implementation of the
national IEC Program and coordinate the interventions and support provided by various donors and NGOs
throughout the country; (iii) training and seminars on IEC for health personnel; (iv) the equipment and
supplies of the Information and Education Division; and (v) the production of two serial albums on "Health
in the Tabancas", and "Maternal and Child Health".
Improvement of Health Facilities/Community Participation in three regions (Bafata, Biombo and Oio)
included: (i) upgrading, rehabilitating, repairing, equipping, furnishing and maintaining about 10 village
heath centers, 2 regional health centers, 29 houses for nurses, and 3 drug storage units, (ii) providing
roofing and flooring materials and furnishing about 240 basic health units, (iii) installing wells in 12 Health
Centers (HCs) and solar panels in 22 HCs, and (iv) purchasing 600 bicycles with tool repair kits and
transistor radios for all the Basic Health Units (BHU), as well as vehicles including pick-up trucks,
ambulances, and motorcycles for the three regions.
Social Action Fund helped Government set up a funding entity that could work with Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs) and community associations to carry out social services through cross-sectoral
micro-projects. This component also included training and support for the institutional development of local
NGOs. The success of this component is attributable to an active participation of communities and the civil
society
Assessment of Original Components
Training component (US$2.5 million). This component was well formulated as it included the three levels
of training required to improve health personnel skills and career development: training/refresher courses,
- 3 -



upgrading programs, and medical specialization under one coordinating and management training unit.
Although training was provided to many medical and paramedical personnel, the limited success of th Is
component is attributable to the lower level of education of candidates which, coupled with the high
requirements for admission into the training programs, resulted in a reduced pool of potential participants
and made it difficult for the project to reach its intended target in terms of number of trainees per category
of health worker.
IEC component (US$375,000). This component was well designed to meet the project objectives of
health service delivery and prevention; its targets, strategies and activities were clearly stated and
complemented effectively activities conducted by other donor institutions such as the Canadian NGO
(CECI) which carried out substantial ground work at the design and early implementation stages. In
addition, the establishment of a National Council for IEC with an appropriate mechanism to ensure
co-ordination and support from a number of international agencies and NGOs was well conceived and
proved very useful to a successful implementation of the variety of IEC activities called for under the
project. However, the component underestimated the seriousness of the AIDS epidemic and did not provide
enough resources to implement activities aimed at improving access to and use of condoms and the
dissemination of messages to encourage behavioral change in order to limit HIV Infections.
Improvement of Health Facilities/Community Participation(US$3.3 million). This component was
well designed to meet the project objectives of improving primary health care facilities at community,
district, and regional levels. The project contributed to the extension and improvement of health service
coverage through the rehabilitation and equipping of nearly all primary health care facilities and distri zt
health centers. The repair and equipment of health facilities combined with the construction of simple
houses for nurses helped to attract qualified personnel to rural areas and maintain health care provision at
adequate level. The support provided by communities in all regions of the country, in the form of labor and
construction material, was instrumental in expanding the number of USBs and keeping community
participation active.
Social Action Fund component (US$1.2 million). This component was financed by IDA in the amoint of
US$393,399 (32%) and by a Dutch Grant of US$851,713. Its design was limited in scope and inadequate
to meet the project's objective of improving social indicators. The Fund's very modest targets (only 40
micro-projects were planned) had limited impact and affected only a small proportion of the country's poor
population. In addition, the institutional arrangement proposed did not prove efficient enough and did not
address the institutional needs of the NGO community adequately. Under this component 46% of the
available resources went towards financing 59 micro-projects, while 54% was utilized for technical
assistance and management.
3.4 Revised Components:
During the course of the project, the IEC component was reinforced to include the social marketing of
condoms. An additional amount of US$1,012,680 was provided by a Dutch Grant for the period October
1996 - December 1997, bringing the total cost of this component to about US$1.5 million. Because of
delays in the execution of the Social Marketing sub-component, the implementation period was extended to
April 1998.
Also, with the NLG 1.5 million provided under the Dutch Grant to the Social Action Fund, the initial IDA
support of US$730,000 for the micro-projects was decreased to US$393, 699 and the balance reallocated
to the other components of the project, mainly IEC and health activities.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
The Quality at entry was satisfactory. Project preparation took place during the implementation of SIRP
(Cr. 2020-GUB) and the project received full Government support, except during the civil war from June
1998 to June 1999. Each project component had an implementation unit; a Project Co-ordination
Committee composed of representatives of implementation units as well as a Project Co-ordination Unit to
ensure the overall management of the Project. The Bank also committed substantial staff efforts for project
preparation and supervision. There was little delay between approval by the Bank's Board of Directors
(March 1993) and project effectiveness (July 1993), and co-financing was mobilized without delay.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The objective of assisting the Government in improving the delivery capacity and quality of primary health
care for a wider population base, with special focus on the most vulnerable groups particularly those at the
urban periphery and in rural areas of the country was substantially achieved. The project strengthened
selected institutions at the central level of MPHSA and supported the MPHSA's policy in setting a
nation-wide PHC system through a coordinated effort with donor agencies. Until the start of the war, all
the facilities were providing quality affordable PHC services and essential drugs to their patients, and
communities began to play a greater role in health facilities management. The project also helped pave the
way for broader health sector reform through the introduction of decentralization in health system
management and innovative approaches enhancing NGOs and community participation as well as donor
coordination and complementarity.
The objective of strengthening health sector human resources was fully achieved. Unfortunately, many of
the gains were lost due to the war situation and the ensuring period of political instability which resulted in
the departure abroad of many of the staff trained under the project. Overall, the training component helped
alleviate some of the most pressing staffing problems of the MPHSA. The Human Resource Division of the
Ministry of Health which was substantially supported under the credit had become a more reliable and
proficient entity. However, in order to achieve long-term sustainability of the progress made during this
project, continuing attention and additional investments to train new medical and paramedical personnel are
required.
The Information, Education and Communication (IEC) component led to a much increased awareness at
community level of health care needs and preventive actions throughout the country. Many sensitive issues
related to reproductive health, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections were extensively discussed
even in the rural areas and continue to feature among the top priorities on the Government's agenda.
The Social Action Fund targets were met. Because the number of interventions was very modest to achieve
the project stated objective, the outcome of the component is considered as modest. However, the project
has demonstrated appropriate approaches and mechanisms to reach the poor that the Government can
capitalize on when defining its poverty alleviation program.

4.2 Outputs by components:
The status of achievements of project components as against SAR targets is summarized in Annex 1-Table
B
Training component. A comprehensive training of health workers' program was completed. Regarding
the in-service training/refresher courses, although only 505 participants were targeted in the SAR, more
than I 100 attended the various courses, both in the capital and in the various regions of the country. For
the in-service upgrading programs, out of the 360 persons expected, 207 were trained. This gap was due
to the fact that there were not sufficient auxiliary nurses with the necessary knowledge and skills to pass the
entry test. Those who did pass the test and were trained, were able to be promoted from their original
auxiliary status to that of technical staff or state nurse. Finally, for the in-service medical specialization,
out of 60 expected, only 39 attended (17 in the horizontal clinical courses and 22 in the public health
one-year course).
Even though this component did not totally meet its targets, impact of the program was substantial. The
training provided contributed significantly to improving the quality of health care services by staffing
health centers with more qualified personnel. Also, the project excelled in providing better trained
laboratory and radiology technicians and public health nurses.
LEC component. All activities under this component were carried out, with some exceeding their target.
A country IEC framework has been developed and the national strategy formulated and validated during a
seminar that regrouped all key actors. An IEC Coordination Unit was rehabilitated and equipped with
computers, furniture, materials and vehicles. Although only 544 manuals had been projected in the SAR,
5,000 manuals, 2,500 guides, 5,000 flipcharts and 2 films were produced and distributed in USBs in two
serial albums on Health in Tabancas and Maternal and Child Health. Instead of the 30 participants
targeted in the SAR, 150 health staff and 15 NGO staff attended the IEC and interpersonal communication
training sessions. Under the contract with PSI, funded through a Dutch Grant, the Social Marketing of
condoms was implemented throughout the country and contributed significantly to increase knowledge
about AIDS and access to condoms at an affordable price. However, no evaluation was made to determine
the impact of the program on behavior, attitudes or practices changes. Also, because of the civil war that
broke out in 1998, some of the achievements of this component were lost. The IEC equipment of the IE C
production unit was stolen, and the Social Marketing of Preservatives was discontinued for about two
years.

Improvement of health facilities/community participation. The objective of rehabilitating and improving
the health infrastructures in the regions of Bafata, Biombo and Oio was substantially achieved. The project
supported the construction/rehabilitation of 6 health centers, 3 new drug storage units and 31 housing units
for nurses. Other infrastructures such as the Bolama Maternity, not included in SSP planning, were
rehabilitated. To improve access to water and electricity, 44 Solar panels and 7 mechanized wheels were
installed. All these physical outputs have brought considerable improvement to the quality of health
services and created better working conditions that helped to retain staff in rural areas. At the community
level, 518 USBs were roofed and 303 floored as against the SAR targets of 474 and 345 respectively;
these interventions contributed significantly by increasing the number of USBs and motivating the
Community Health Workers thereby strengthening the primary health care services throughout the country.
The 600 bicycles provided to the USBs and the 34 motorcycles, 3 vehicles and 2 ambulances purchased for
the health centers allowed for more supervision and outreach activities. Most infrastructures renovated in
the interior of the country did not suffer war damage and remain operational, although with minimal
staffing.
Social Action Fund component. The objective of financing 40 micro-projects, was largely achieved. In
fact, 59 micro-projects were financed by IDA (10) and the Dutch Grant (49) and covered all 9 regions of
the country. The sectoral distribution was as follows: nutrition and income-generating activities (14),
health, family planning and AIDS (6), literacy education (23) and water / sanitation (16). On the whole, a
large number of the micro-projects achieved the planned objectives (92%) in a timely manner. About
94,000 persons benefited from the component's activities, 29% directly and 71% indirectly. Among the
beneficiaries, 66% live in rural areas and 51% are women. All of this was accomplished before the war.
Owing to the suspension of donor contributions during the conflict period (June 98 to July 99), the planned
evaluation to measure the impact of activities and beneficiaries' satisfaction, was not done. In addition,
with the departure of the SAF Unit's key staff, there was no supervision of activities as of May 1998.
4.3 NVet Present Value/Economic rate of return:
No attempt was made at appraisal to estimate net present value (NPV) or economic rate of return, therefore
there is no baseline against which to compare current estimates. Furthermore, no parameters were given at
appraisal to cost effectiveness.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
(Not applicable)
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The housing and equipment provided by the project to basic health units and health centers were
instrumental in promoting decentralization and attracting qualified personnel in rural areas. Moreover, the
project provided MPHSA implementation units, at the national level, with the tools and skills needed to
enhance their performance, and demonstrated the appropriateness of the approaches and strategies used,
which could be replicated for similar interventions in the future. Many of the current National health
Development Program (NHDP) strategies and institutional arrangements were inspired by the project.
However, the project had a modest institutional development impact on decentralization to the extent that
only 36% of the financial resources were used in the regions, and interventions by the NGOs and
micro-projects were not strong enough, in terms of scale and scope, to create the critical mass necessary to
empower local governments and communities in the health system management and reforns.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The war, which lasted from June 1998 to June 1999, and the ensuing period of instability that ended with
- 7 -



the election of a new government in December 1999, combined with the one-year suspension of the IDA
credit had a negative effect, impeded project implementation and compromised some of the project's results.
In fact, the war paralyzed the entire health delivery system and contributed to the serious deterioration of
health indicators particularly in the capital city of Bissau as documented by NHDP supervision mission of
March/April 2000.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Of major importance are: (a) the MPHSA's weak management and technical capacity as well as the laclc of
experience with Bank procedures which caused a slow start of operations -- there was a delay in acquiring
equipment for the basic health units and health centers; (b) the failure to make timely release of counterpart
funds for the training component led to delays in component start-up; (c) changes of personnel in the
training and infrastructure component also led to delays in implementation; (d) delays related to the
identification of building sites for the installation of basic health units and health centers; (e) insufficient
incentives to health providers also delayed, to some extent, the implementation, monitoring and evaluation
systems for all project components.
However, the project implementation unit proved to be extremely effective particularly during the second
phase of project implementation and this enabled the project to run smoothly. More than 90% of the credit
was disbursed and substantial outputs were achieved.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
They include: (a) delay in contracting services for the implementation of the training component; (b)
difficulties in organizing community participation in the cost recovery system; (c) delay in preparing
bidding and technical documents for the rehabilitation component.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The total original cost of the project was US$9.65 million equivalent, including US$0.42 million in duties
and taxes. Out of the total project costs, 84% was investment costs and the remaining 16% was
incremental recurrent costs. Out of US$9.31 million equivalent, excluding duties and taxes, US$7.32
million was in foreign costs and US$1.99 million in local costs.
The project was financed as follows:
(a) IDA US$8.95 million, (96%, excluding taxes and duties);
(b) US$0.3 million of Government's contribution (3.4%), representing the total costs of living
allowances for participants and travel allowances for trainers under local training, salaries of support staff
in the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) and the Social Action Fund Unit (SAFU), and part of the civil
works;
(c) US$0.04 million as in-kind labor for community participation (0.5%) in the
construction/rehabilitation of staff houses and for the replacement of roofs and floors at basic health units;
(d) The Dutch Grant of NLG 1.5 million, equivalent to US$0.85 I million was used to finance the
Social Action Fund for micro-projects, technical assistance and operating costs of the SAF Unit. NLG
depreciation against the dollar decreased the total estimate equivalent of US$ from 1.0 million to US$0.85
million, thereby reducing by 6 projects the number of proposals approved by the Technical Committee. As
at Oct 19, 2000, SDR 6,334,010, i.e. 99.0% of the credit of 6,400,000, had been disbursed.

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability of the project is considered unlikely, because of continued dependence on the availability of
external financing and loss of human resource investments due to massive departures of trained health staff.
Many of the sub-projects stopped operating during the civil war conflict, however, all the health
sub-components of the project have been kept under the ongoing National Health Development Program
(NHDP) and are being expanded and strengthened in a more stable although still very fragile political
environment. More needs to be done to consolidate management capacity, decentralization, cost recovery of
essential drugs and community participation through the Bamako Initiative. Bank support is being provided
under the NHDP for that purpose.
Capacity building. The understanding of the training component participants was that they would be
promoted after attending training; this expectation was not fully met and as a result, many have left the
civil service for employment with international organizations and NGOs. In addition, many of the trained
personnel have also fled the country because of the war and have not returned since. The capital city of
Bissau was hit hardest by these departures; the situation is less critical in the regions where health care
facilities financed under the IDa Credit are still operational although with minimal staff and equipment.
Ownership. At the MPHSA level, ownership was substantial, since staff of the various management units
(training, IEC and planning) were nationals and chosen from among the Ministry of Health personnel. The
participatory approach initiated before the civil war needs to be reactivated and expanded.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Primary health care facilities and district health centers established under the project have been fully
integrated in the public health system. They have now become part of the regional health departments,
which have oversight responsibility for their overall performance.
Prior to the closing of the SSP, a new IDA credit in support of the health sector (NHDP) was approved and
became effective in May 1998. Drawing upon the SSP, the NHDP's main objectives are to: (i) increase
the use and effective coverage of primary health care services and referral centers; (ii) strengthen the
institutional capacity at all levels; (iii) improve the quality and management of human resources; and (iv)
reinforce intersectoral co-ordination and action in health-related activities in order to promote better health
anong the population. This operation is appropriate for the consolidation and expansion of the activities
initiated under the PSS and will re-launch those that were discontinued during the war.
Also, as a direct result of the social fund component, a Social Action Foundation is being established and
its by-laws and statutes have been prepared and are being reviewed by the Government for approval. The
Government is envisaging other Bank-supported operations in the area of Social Protection to be developed
as part of its PRSP.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
The Bank prepared this project in full consultation with the Borrower and in close cooperation with the
Netherlands, a major bilateral contributor to the project. The Bank's performance in project identification,
preparation and appraisal was generally satisfactory. The project responded to various clearly identified
needs. It adopted a highly participatory approach, communicating intensively with the Borrower. The
project incorporated lessons learned from SIRP, especially with respect to monitoring and evaluation,
-9-



financial management and procurement.
7.2 Supervision:
During the initial stages of implementation, there was an average of three supervision missions during the
first three years. From 1996 onwards, there were two formal supervision missions per year. When the task
manager moved to Senegal, the project was continuously supervised from Dakar until the war broke oul in
June 1998. Then the project was suspended for almost one year. After the war in June 1999, a supervision
mission took place, the suspension was lifted, and later the project was extended until December 31, 19999.
Overall, 10 supervision missions were carried out over the project period, often utilizing Bank staff and
outside experts from co-financing partners such as the Netherlands. Task management responsibility fo-
the project changed three times over the entire project cycle (appraisal through project closure), but there
were no significant problems with continuity or coherence between the project's objectives and the
implementation strategies, since the same task manager supervised the PSS during about 90% of its
duration.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
On the whole, Bank performance was satisfactory. Eight missions were planned in the SAR but the Bank
undertook 10 supervision missions, including a mid-term review and an implementation completion (ICR-)
mission. The Bank team was flexible and maintained good policy dialogue with Government and the
community of donors, and consequently able to resolve problems and implementation issues that might
have otherwise slowed down the project, especially during the difficult period after the civil war.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance during project preparation and appraisal is considered satisfactory. There
were no delays from the highest level of Government and a committee composed of the Ministry of Health
and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation led project preparation through negotiations, board
presentation and effectiveness. The Project received considerable support during its preparation phase.
7.5 Government implementationperformance:
Two main risks were identified during appraisal: (i) the limited managerial and implementation capabilities
of the Government and the primary institutions involved; (ii) the lack of sufficient counterpart funds and the
overall financial sustainability of the project. The first risks did not translate into reality but in the case of
the second, the Government experienced continuous difficulties in meeting counterpart funds requirements.
Less than half of the total amount estimated at US$850,000 including community participation was paid.
There were regular delays in the completion of reports and covenant compliance. The overall modest rating
for Government performance is largely a result of this situation.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
To implement the activities, a Management Unit was established for each component of the project and a
Project Coordination Unit was also established under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation to
coordinate the various components and handle the procurement and financial management.
The PCU, as the lead implementation agency for the project with overall procurement, financial
management and reporting functions, performed well throughout the life of the project. The PCU, ensured
compliance with project covenants and submission of progress and audit reports on a timely basis, with the
exception of FY98 accounts. It was also responsible for liaison between the Government and the financiers
of the project (IDA and the Netherlands). Management stability guaranteed a reasonably efficient
administrative and financial capacity during the project implementation. The experience gained by the staff
- 1 0 -



in the execution of both this and the previous project (SIRP Cr. 2020-GUB) enabled them to prepare the
ongoing PNDS Cr. 3010 GUB.
Department of Infrastructure: This unit was responsible for the technical identification, preparation of bid
documents. It was headed by an engineer who was changed midway through the project, having been
recruited as AGEOPPE Administrator. Foreign technical assistance was provided at the initial phase of the
project to help with preparation of the technical documents and specifications. Failure to define the
construction sites on the part of local authorities delayed civil work start-up. The Dl was supported by the
PCU in all administrative matters. The performance was significant and the experience gained by the staff
was integrated into Servitas and AGEOPPE.
Training Management Unit: The unit was established in 1994 to manage the training courses and
provided the liaison between the Ministry of Health and the PCU. Implementation performance was
satisfactory until October 1997 but declined when the manager was appointed to the Ministry of Health and
his successor experienced some difficulties. Quarterly reports were prepared on time and submitted to the
PCU.
IEC Management Unit: The coordination of the IEC activities was done by the forner Director of
Planning. Performance as regards project implementation was satisfactory. Quarterly reports were
regularly prepared and submitted to the PCU. Activities carried out between 1992 and 1997 were
presented in a detailed comprehensive report.
SAFU-Social Action Fund Unit: The SAFU Unit was headed by a Director and a small management team
working closely with national NGOs, and supported by a technical assistant who oversaw the
micro-projects, and an accountant who managed the financial aspects of the contracts with NGOs and
liaised with the PCU. A separate SAFU account was created, which was regularly reconciled with the
PCU data. The performance was satisfactory. The team worked closely with national NGOs. The
technical assistant left the project in 1998 and the Director was appointed to the post of Coordinator of the
Poverty Program (Social Sector Development Project) in Cape Verde. The unit's responsibilities are being
mainstreamed within the newly created Social Action Foundation.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The performance of each implementing agency is considered satisfactory. Key staff of implementing
agencies showed commitment to the objectives of the project and worked hard to improve their own skills.
The diverse nature of the project demanded a level of skills and co-ordination that were not always
available. Bank procurement procedures were followed and a high standard of reporting was maintained
throughout the project. There was no major difference between the procurement plan as estimated in the
SAR and that actually implemented. With the experience gained by staff in the implementing agencies, it
was possible to prepare and implement other projects such as the current PNDS and the Transport and
Urban Infrastructure Project.
8. Lessons Learned
Key lessons learned from the project are as follows:
1. Project ownership and community engagement must be ensured. It is important to assess specific
conditions in both urban and rural areas as part of the health infrastructure planning process. The
process must be inclusive of communities and the civil society; all concerned parties should be
involved in the decision-making process to ensure sustainable management of health facilities at the
- 1 1 -



district and village levels. Community participation is key to ensuring successful delivery of
preventive services and increasing the use of health facilities.
2. Human resources development should not be limited to training; a comprehensive process to
address issues such as incentives, career development, public/private partnership and
decentralization needs to be initiated as part of the project design, evaluated during project appraisal,
and addressed throughout the project cycle. It is important for this type of project to ensure a
sustainable plan for the deployment of personnel based on a comprehensive multi-year human
resource development strategy encompassing training and curriculum development as well as hum lan
resources management
3. Public/Private partnership and the contracting-out of services is a prerequisite for expansion of
health care services; in the context of limited institutional capacity of public sector agencies, local
private sector firms and civil society organizations can provide altemative competitive design and
help manage, implement or monitor a wide range of activities. Projects need to be supportive of
these principles and build on them to encourage delegated management contracts whenever possible.
4. The success registered under the social fund component demonstrated that NGOs can and should
play an important role in expanding primary health care and prevention and reaching the poorest
segments of the population. The creation of NGO funding mechanisms strengthen NGO capacitie s
and can contribute effectively to the process of health care decentralization. Dispersion of impact
due to the diversity of approaches and multiple NGOs can be mitigated by providing support and
monitoring through a single agency or Fund. The Social Action Foundation that is emerging as a
result of the project is a good example of effective collaboration between the govemment and the
civil society.
5. Donor coordination and complementarity are most effective when Govemment is committed and
leads and owns the health planning and implementation process. Through the consistent involvement
of partners in activity design and implementation the project has helped pave the way for a
broad-based approach to health sector development embodied in the ongoing follow-up sector
investment operation (NHDP).
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The Borrower has reviewed the draft ICR and agrees with its content as indicated in their letter of Augus.t
22, 2000 listed in Annex 7.
(b) Cofinanciers:
A copy of this report was sent to the Dutch Cooperation, for their review as a major co-financier in the
project. No particular comments were received.
(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
Because of the war situation and the departure of the SAF unit key staff, NGO comments could not be
obtained.
