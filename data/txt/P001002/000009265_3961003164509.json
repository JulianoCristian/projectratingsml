      a special focus on the most vulnerable groups, particularly\n            those at the periphery in rural areas of the country. In\n            order to achieve this objective the project will finance\n            high priority investment, through coordinating efforts with\n            other donor agencies, strengthening institutions and\n            developing human capacity building measures. The\n            project's design should enhance dialogue and create\n            synergy among various social sector institutions and\n            nongovernmental organizations. In health, the project will\n            finance: (a) rehabilitation and equipping of health centers\n            in three regions, and health posts, through community\n            participation, throughout the country; (b) comprehensive\n            support for in-service, local and short-term training\n            programs for all levels of health workers and professionals;\n            and (c) technical assistance and institutional strengthening\n            inputs to coordinate and strengthen the delivery of\n            information, education and communications (IEC) activities,\n            develop an IEC policy framework, and suggest targeted\n            programs. The project will be cross-sectoral, and support\n            international and national nongovernmental organizations\n            through the establishment of a Social Action Fund to help\n            expand and/or develop social sector micro-projects\n            throughout the country."}, "docdt": "1993-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
