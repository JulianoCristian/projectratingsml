Northeast Rural Development\n            Program Maranhao Project is one of a series of projects\n            within the new Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP).\n            The project objectives are to: (a) increase agricultural\n            production and productivity in the State of Maranhao; (b)\n            generate employment opportunities for low-income rural\n            families; and (c) promote water development and technology\n            generation and diffusion to increase small farmer\n            productivity. It also aims to (d) increase community\n            participation in all phases of the development process; and\n            (e) strengthen the State of Maranhao's institutional\n            capacity to provide efficient agricultural services for\n            small farmers. In order to meet its objectives, the project\n            supports water resource development for both agricultural\n            and domestic use, fish hatcheries and inland fisheries,\n            agricultural research, agricultural extension, and\n            investment credit. Further to this, the project supports\n            marketing services, funding for community subprojects,\n            environmental protection and project administration and training."}, "docdt": "1987-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
