The\n            project will include specialized equipment to be financed by\n            the Bank for technical, commercial and agricultural\n            vocational high schools.

The project will also include\n            policy studies to be financed by the government, which will\n            address problem areas in vocational education and make\n            appropriate recommendations for their solution."}, "docdt": "1992-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
