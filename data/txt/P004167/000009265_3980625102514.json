The project design was straight forward,\n            including only policy work and the provision of equipment to\n            the Vocational High School (VHS). The two project components\n            (studies and equipment provision) were combined to encourage\n            and support major reforms in a wide variety of areas\n            including: curricula, teacher training, instructional\n            methods, introduction of new technologies and course\n            offerings, and better linkages with industry and enhanced\n            student placement (better trained graduates and more\n            relevant job placements)."}, "docdt": "1998-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
