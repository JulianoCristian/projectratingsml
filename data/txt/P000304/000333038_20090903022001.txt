IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.

About this Report
       The Independent EvaluationGroup assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Banks self-evaluationprocess and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and proceduresthrough the
disseminationof lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Banks lending operations. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are
innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons. The operations, topics, and analytical approaches selected for assessment support larger
evaluation studies.
       A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the ImplementationCompletion
Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by IEGWB. To prepare
PPARs, IEGWB staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases
visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with staff of the Bank and the government, other stakeholders,
and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well
as examine issues of special interest to broader IEGWB studies.
        Each PPAR is subject to peer review and IEGWB management approval. Once cleared internally, the PPAR
is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then sent to
the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of
 Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
     The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEGWB are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following
is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is available on the
IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance of objectives, efficacy, and efficiency.
Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's current
development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals
(expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be
achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is
expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to
alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings: Highly
Satisfactory,Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings: High, Significant, Moderate, Negligible to
Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loankredit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievement of development objectives and sustainability. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency performance. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
        This i s the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on an education
project in Burkina Faso.

       The first Post-Primary Education Project (Cr. N0070) was approved on December
24, 1996 for a credit o f US$26 million equivalent. The Credit closed on April 30,2004 after
two extensions totaling 22 months, and US$0.34 million were canceled.

        The PPAR was conducted to assess the outcomes o f Bank policy and investments
in a low-income country that underwent a period o f civil conflict and political upheaval.

         The document i s based o n the following sources: Implementation Completion
Reports (ICR), Project Appraisal Document (PAD) Development Credit Agreement, and
project files, particularly the supervision reports. Also, IEG consulted the research
literature, reports on Burkina Faso, and data on schooling trends. An IEG mission visited
Burkina Faso in April 2009 to interview officials, donors, and beneficiaries, observe
instruction in schools, and collect other pertinent information. Field visits took place in
the regions o f Bulkiemde, Bazenga, Oubritenga, Kunveogo and the cities o f
Ouagadougou and Koudougou. The author thanks the government officials who received
the mission for their extensive cooperation.

       Following standard IEG procedures, a copy o f the draft report was sent to
government officials and agencies for their review and comments. Their comments are
presented in Annex E.

Summary
       This document reviews the performance o f the Post-Primary Education Project
(Cr. N0070) approved in FY97. Overall, the project aimed to have more and better-trained
students graduated from secondary schools at reduced scholarship costs, with increased
equality between genders and income levels. It also provided library facilities to
universities.

         The project reflected a government commitment to expand access to secondary
education while still in the process o f expanding primary education access. The
investment was oriented towards the inputs needed to enable an additional 8000 students
attend lower secondary schools: construction o f 63 secondary schools in underserved
areas, training o f educators, textbook acquisition, curricular studies, and a private-public
partnership to enhance private-sector capacity for admitting more students. Despite
limited implementation capacity and delays, most activities were carried out. An
innovative public-private partnership helped increase capacity in private schools. Thus,
project inputs resulted in substantial enrollment increases overall, as well as in lower-
income areas and for girls. The access and equity objectives, as well as associated targets
were attained.

        The project had limited success with imparting to students knowledge that would
enable them to pass examinations and meet labor market demands. About 1.7 million
textbooks were procured and rented at affordable rates to students. A revolving fund was
established for textbook replacement, but funds remained unused. Textbook acquisition
during a follow-on post-secondary education project (currently under implementation)
was delayed by two years due to pricing and curricular issues. As a result, few textbooks
remained available in schools by 2009. The IEG mission found that the vast majority o f
class time i s spent in blackboard copying and verbatim dictation o f the contents in the
missing textbooks. Thus, it i s uncertain whether graduates are better trained as a result o f
the project.

        Overall, the number o f students who stay in school and transition to higher
secondary education has increased. Contrary to expectations at project appraisal,
however, repetition rates have stagnated instead o f dropping. Low pass rates at the
Baccalaure'at examination mean that most students fail in their efforts to graduate from
secondary school. However, increasing efficiency for secondary schools may conflict
with higher education management needs. Policies may be needed to separate secondary
school graduation from university admission.

         The outcome o f the Post-Primary Education Project i s rated satisfactory. Almost
all targets were met, and access to secondary education substantially increased, though it
i s uncertain that graduates were better trained. Risk to development outcomes i s rated
moderate; although there i s much demand for secondary education, the maintenance
status o f the new buildings and sustainability o f expenditures are uncertain. Bank
performance is rated moderately satisfactory, due to delays in approvals and poorly
articulated communications with government staff. Borrower performance i s rated
satisfactory because, despite many challenges, most project activities were carried out.

       This assessment provides a number o f lessons for the education sector:

    To obtain job-relevant skills from school enrollment students must first and foremost
    acquire pertinent and suitably organized knowledge. If secondary education does not
    impart the necessary knowledge, the labor market may be unable to use the graduates
    when demand arises (paras. 4.12,4.16-4.18).

0   In low-income countries where substantial numbers o f students fail to acquire basic
    skills, application o f the available curricula and textbooks may be more important
    than development o f new curricula. N e w curricula may be in principle desirable, but
    they should be realistically implementable in low-income classrooms (para. 3.5,
    4.19).

    Subsidizing private secondary education may help increase access in countries where
    secondary education i s constrained. Where student demand is high, increasing the
    availability o f private schools may enable the government to concentrate public
    resources on lower income and underserved groups (para. 3.1 1).

0   Textbooks or systematically reproduced materials are a prerequisite for knowledge
    management at all levels o f education. Their availability should be a policy priority.
    Without textbooks and training o f teachers in their use (particularly where teachers
    themselves have studied without them), knowledge becomes constricted, and
    systemic efficiency i s low. The cost and availability o f Francophone textbooks has
    been a long-standing problem, for which clear solutions have not emerged (para.4.15,
    6.3).

        1. Background

    1.1      Burkina Faso i s a landlocked, sparsely populated country o f about 14.4 million
    people with a US$440 per capita income.' The mainly agricultural population has an
    adult literacy rate o f only about 24 percent. About 62 languages are spoken, and though
    the Moor6 i s spoken or understood by about 75 percent o f the people, the official
    language o f instruction i s French.


    1.2     This country, known as Upper Volta until 1983, was a former French colony that
    became independent in 1960. At that time it was decided that universal primary education
    would be unaffordable, so formal schools would mainly exist in towns, and rural
    residents would get nonformal education at ages 12-14. The Bank in the 1970s supported
.   this policy (through credits 430-UV and 956-UV) but started to promote formal education
    in the 1980s when the nonformal policy proved unfeasible (OED 2001).

               SECTOR IN BURKINA FASO
    THEEDUCATION


    1.3     For formal education, Burkina Faso follows the traditional French system.
    Burkina Faso has a six-year primary school followed by 7 years o f secondary.2(The 7
    grades have inverse names in French, i.e. 66me, Skme, 4bme, 3kme, 2bme, premikre,
    terminale). Lower secondary education comprises grades 7- 10 (6kme-3kme), and upper
    secondary comprises the rest. At the end o f grade 10, there i s an entrance examination to
    senior secondary education. At the end o f grade 13, students take the Baccalaureat
    examination, which i s administered b y the university and simultaneously serves as a
    secondary education leaving certificate and a university entrance examination. Because
    countries cannot afford to admit all graduates to the university, availability o f university
    space influences secondary education completion rates in Francophone c ~ u n t r i e s .Most
                                                                                            ~
    Francophone countries have had difficulty developing a clear strategy for dealing with
    this issue (Chapter 6).


    1.4          Due to the recent establishment o f formal education in Burkina Faso, enrollments
    are s t i l l low (Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The primary gross enrollment rate that was about 5
    percent in 1960 had increased to 38 percent by 1996 and to 81.3 percent by 2007.4 Still,
    quality o f education i s very limited, and many students at all grades fail to learn sufficient
    material; only about 45 percent o f school leavers are literate, compared with 68 percent
    o f other sub-Saharan Africa countries (Figure 4-3). Primary completion rate has been

     There are two ministries o f education: Ministry o f Basic Education and Literacy (MEBA) for primary
    education, and the Ministry o f Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research ( (MESSRS) for
    post-primary education. Curricula are decided by the respective ministries in the capital and are taught

about 3 1 percent. Girls have had very limited access to schooling and perform worse
than boys at all levels o f education. One reason for the poor results i s limited knowledge
o f French; the language is treated as if it were students' mother tongue rather than a
foreign language, so students receive no dictionaries, and the textbooks contain early on
vocabulary expected o f native speakers. Another reason i s a short academic year. In
secondary schools it extends from the second week o f October to the end o f May, when
the rainy season starts.

1.5      The country has two ministries o f education: Ministry o f Basic Education and
Literacy (MEBA) for primary education, and the Ministry o f Secondary and Higher
Education and Scientific Research (MESSRS) for post-primary education. Curricula are
decided by the respective ministries in the capital and are taught with few variations
throughout the country. Education i s primarily public; private schools in 2006/07
accounted for 14 percent at the primary level, about 35 percent at the secondary, and 76
percent in technical education, and 17 percent in higher ed~cation.~  Primary education is
free, but secondary education requires modest tuition fees. (See subsequent sections.) To
facilitate enrolment in secondary and higher education the government in earlier years
gave scholarships, which consumed a substantial amount o f i t s budget. Alleviating this
burden has been challenging.

BANKSECTOR STRATEGY

1.6    In 1996, the government was determined to increase access to secondary
education. Primary education access was s t i l l limited. However, secondary education was
deemed crucial for the production o f teachers and for an improved response to the

demands o f technically oriented labor market. The Government developed a Post-
Primary Education Strategy to: (a) restructure the sector to use resources more efficiently;
(b) increase the participation o f the private sector in secondary education to free up
resources for the expansion o f public primary education; and (c) improve quality and
efficiency. The strategy was accompanied by an investment plan for 1996-2005. The
government asked for Bank support, and the Post-Primary Education Project (PEPP I       ,
projet d'enseignement post-primaire) was formulated to respond to the post-primary
education strategy.

 1.7    This project was only a starting point. In 2004, more than half o f the 125,000
 students completing primary education were s t i l l unable to enter into secondary
 education. The demand for places in public secondary schools was far greater than the
 availability o f places, especially in urban areas. The Bank therefore agreed to finance a
 follow-on investment project that started in 2006 and will complete in March 2010 (Table
 1.1). This operation supports a large increase in enrollment, especially at the junior
 secondary level, with a planned increase in the intake ratio from 22 percent o f students in
 2004 to 40 percent b y 2009. The IDA funding o f US$22.9 million i s supplemented by
 cofinancing from the Netherlands o f 22 million euros. A Development Policy Loan
 (DPL) was being prepared in March 2009 as a follow-on project. Other donors involved
 in secondary education are Austria, Denmark, the African Development Bank (AfDB),
 which also finances vocational education, and the Islamic Development Bank.

1.8     The education sector also benefited from policy and financing inputs from
structural adjustment loans and eight Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs; FYO1-
09). These mainly targeted primary education, but secondary also received some
attention. The Structural Adjustment Credit I11 (Cr. 3299; FY 2000) helped shift six
ministries, including the Ministry o f post-secondary education (MESSRS) to performance
budgeting with outcome indicators to monitor efficiency, and increased accountability for
line managers. The 5th and 6th PRSCs also supported increased resources for lower
secondary education.

RELEVANCE


2.1     The relevance o f objectives is high. The project development objectives have
been consistent with the Government's Post-Primary Education Strategy and long-term
objectives as defined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) o f June 1996, which
emphasized promoting poverty reduction through increased economic growth and
support for human resources development. They continued to remain relevant with the
2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan (PRSP) and 2007 CAS.

2.2     Overall, the design was substantially relevant to project objectives. There was a
need to invest in secondary education because this level o f knowledge i s necessary for the
preparation o f primary teachers and workers o f other professions. Also there was a need
to reduce the scholarship bill that often financed the studies o f the wealthier students in
order to invest in areas with more limited coverage. Although the project name hinted at
investments in post-secondary education, the university investments were limited to a
library building and books (Annex Table A-1). PEPP I      was oriented towards the
acquisition o f hardware and goods, the basic infrastructure needed to provide secondary
education services and expand access. As an initial project in a subsector o f limited
capacity, the design also had to remain relatively simple. Yet, it included innovative
components that proved realistically implementable, such as a rental scheme for
textbooks and a private-public partnership. To facilitate secondary school completion,
however, the project could have included textbooks for the higher secondary grades and
clear actions for increasing the amount o f information students acquire in schools. The
short academic year and need to use instructional time efficiently was raised as an issue
in the PAD, but no plans were developed for monitoring or increasing it.


  3. Project Implementation

3.1      The project started with a 10-month delay due to limited implementation capacity.
Staff turnover and limited expertise in procurement led to initially l o w disbursements,
and civil unrest related to political events circa 2000 also delayed the execution o f
various activities. Nevertheless, the implementers worked fast and to some extent caught
up; the midterm review documents show satisfactory performance given the difficulties
o f the country. After extensions totalling two years, most planned activities were
eventually carried out. (Outcome indicators to be attained by 2002 are shown as attained
in 2004.) The project benefited from a project implementation unit (PIU), staffed partly
by private-sector staff. The Bank had promoted the use o f Faso Baara, a national
implementation agency that built schools in earlier projects. This agency built 10 schools,
and local contractors built the rest. Local communities were to be involved in the
construction, operation, and maintenance o f the schools, but their capacity proved to be
limited.

3.2    The section below discusses the implementation o f the most important activities
o f this project. For a complete l i s t o f inputs, outputs, and outcomes see Annex Table A-
1.

ACCESS LOWER
     TO    SECONDARY EDUCATION


3.3     To increase the number o f students graduating from secondary schools, the
project was to build 80 new schools and 160 additional classrooms, mainly in the 10 least
covered provinces. The timeframe needed to carry out the building program was
underestimated, so infrastructure targets were scaled down. However, 63 new lower-
secondary schools were built and equipped, many with water wells and teacher housing.
The project also helped the private sector increase capacity, given that about 35 percent
o f lower secondary schools in 2007 were private; 54 classrooms were built in
overcrowded private secondary schools that had land available and could build additional
classrooms on a matching basis. These 108 new private classrooms enrolled an
additional 3,780 students in lower secondary school in 2003-2004.

QUALITY    IMPROVEMENT

3.4      Teacher training and deployment. The project included training o f teachers,
school directors, and inspectors. I t financed in-service training for more than 2,200
teachers in all subjects, 90 pedagogical advisors, and more than 440 headmasters.
Preservice training was reformed by introducing a 3 O-week training program composed
o f two-thirds subject matter and one-third practice in a school setting under supervision.
With bilateral aid, 2 1 staff went for study abroad and returned to become inspectors. The
project also financed training and preparation for improved inspections and school-based
help. Before the project, all inspectors were based in Ouagadougou, and provincial
schools were rarely supervised.

3.5     Curricular Reform. The curricula had changed l i t t l e since 1960. They were to be
reformed o n the basis o f labor market needs, applicability, examination results, and new
courses such as information technology, would be introduced. According to the PAD, the
project would analyze the skills needed in various occupations held by secondary school
graduates working and educate students accordingly. These curricular changes were
ambitious and did not take into account the stringent course content needed to pass the
Baccalaure'at for university entrance nor the desire o f the elites to ensure their children's
admission to universities abroad. It was also unclear how new curricula would differ,
given that some o f textbooks to be procured were based on standards developed in the
sub-Saharan countries. Eventually, activities were scaled down. Two curriculum studies
were carried out with foreign technical assistance (one for general and one for technical
secondary education). There was a limited follow up o f recommendation^,^ and the
follow-on project also has carried out few curricular reform activities (Annex B).

3.6    Textbook acquisition. The project financed the purchase o f 1,766,000 million
textbooks in 2000 and 2003, surpassing anticipated targets. The books were printed
overseas and imported. Some had been authored by Burkinabe educators, while others
were written by teams o f educators from various sub-Saharan countries. The
textbooWstudent ratio improved from four students per book to one per student in French,

                                                                                             .
 Despite efforts, the IEG mission was unable to obtain these curricular documents from PEPP I Also, draft
curricular documents were unavailable during the IEG mission.
                                            7


grammar, physics and chemistry, mathematics, sciences, history and geography.
Teacher's guides were issued free to staff in public schools, and private schools received
the books at cost. Textbooks were expected to last about four years. To ensure continuous
availability, a rental scheme was developed and students rented the books for o f FCFA
500 (about U S $ l ) per book.

      STRENGTHENING
INSTITUTIONAL

3.7      Considerable training was delivered to MESSRS staff for upgrading management
skills in MIS, exams, school mapping, and performance monitoring. As a result, data
became available for monitoring indicators on a timely basis.

3.8      Secondary and higher education students had been receiving scholarships which
had represented nearly half o f the Ministry budget. Between 1995 and 2003 these were
reduced from FCFA 4.8 billion to FCFA 1.5 billion (exceeding the target o f FCFA a 2.2
billion reduction). Also the government introduced fees at the university, a policy that
was implementedin 2002 despite student disruptions. The restaurants at the universities
o f Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso were transferred to private management, and the
number o f students' grants was drastically reduced (from 3,407 to 500 students). Also in
1998-1999, about 200 under-utilized teachers were redeployed to schools in the
provinces.

3.9     Financial sustainability. Through the PEPP I   project, the government took
measures to strengthen cost recovery in secondary and higher education. To mitigate the
effects o f reducing scholarships, school fees were reduced to about 20,000 FCFA (about
US$40) for the first registration, and 5,000 FCFA (about US$lO) for subsequent
registrations. (These had gradually increased again to an average o f 40,000 FCFA -
about US$SO - for schools visited by the IEG mission). Schools keep 75 percent o f the
tuition collected as budget for various needs.

Private sector involvement

3.10 Appraisal documents showed expectations that non-public education was to
absorb 40 percent o f the enrollment by the year 2001 as a result o f increased capacity to
facilities managed by private owners, NGOs, and municipalities. PEPP I     constructed
seven new secondary schools for lease-purchase. These schools, whose average cost was
75,000,000 FCFA (about US$160,000), were rented to private owners on a 12-year
amortization basis. At the end o f this period, the owners who paid for them would own
them. (PEPP I1has been in the process o f building another 20 private schools.)

3.1 1 At the Bank's suggestion, MESSRS established a formal partnership with the
private sector, including secondary schools with religious affiliations; schools owned and
operated by individuals, nongovernmental organizations, or voluntary associations; and
evening classes operated by associations and teachers unions. Agreements with the
Catholic Church, the Association o f Private Secondary Schools, and individual private
secondary general and technical schools have been signed. These agreements allowed the
private providers to establish secondary schools reflecting their specific objectives, to
                                                       8


recruit staff and students, to provide religious instruction, to benefit from public
subsidies, and to charge the fees necessary for their operation-provided they respected
national legislation. They were to implement the national curricula, ensure quality o f
instruction, and accept pupils assigned to their schools by the government. New lower
secondary schools would be provided with two government-paid teachers, and the
communities would contract for additional teachers as needed (Verspoor and SEIA Team
2008). By financing private secondary schools, government was to withdraw from daily
management, and thus decentralize secondary education. (ICR p. 8).


  4. Achievement o f the Project Objectives

4.1     The project had a single objective with multiple parts. For greater clarity each part
is discussed separately. Thus, the report assesses the objective o f Table 2-1 as four
subobjectives: (a) more students graduating from secondary schools; (b) increased
equality between genders and income levels; (c) better-trained students graduated from
secondary schools; and (d) reduced subsidy costs. To facilitate discussion, the order o f
subobjectives has been changed. (Relevant targets are in Table 4-1). To provide
continuity to present conditions, the pertinent activities o f the follow-on project PEPP I1
are briefly presented in Annex B.

OBJECTIVE PART (A): MORE STUDENTS GRADUATING FROM SECONDARY SCHOOLS
(SUBSTANTIAL)

4.2    The World Bank (Annex Table A-1), but also the AfDB and some NGOs made
investments in school construction. As a result, the number o f secondary schools in the
country rose from 220 in 1996 to about 520 in 2004, and 662 in 2007(Figure 4-1 ).lo

4.3      The availability o f infrastructure greatly helped increase access to secondary
education (Annex Table A-1; also see below). The gross enrollment rate increased from
7.2 percent to 12.2 percent between 1996 and 2004, thus meeting the project target o f 10
percent (Figure 4-4). The proportion o f primary school graduates continuing to lower
secondary education increased from 27 to 42 percent between 1997 and 2003, surpassing
the initial project target o f 30 percent. In fact, demand far exceeded supply o f student
places; the student-teacher ratio in lower secondary education rose from 42 to 86 students
per teacher between 2002 and 2006 (Annex Table C-4).
4.4    The number o f students enrolled in private lower secondary schools rose by 85
percent between 1996 and 2003. The proportion o f girls enrolled in private schools more
than doubled during the same period, to 33,719 in total (PEPP IImplementation
Completion Report - I C R p. 8).

4.5     An evaluation study, however, found that many o f the schools built had
significant construction issues that included code violations and use o f low-quality
materials (AGEM Development 2004). Also about 72 percent o f the classrooms were
smaller than the expected norms, 63 m2. The IEG mission visited two schools with
significant structural problems and early failure o f materials. l1 It was unclear how much
the repairs would cost and how they would fit into the limited budget o f MESSRS
(Figure 4-2 and Figure 4-3).




l1The mission visited 16 secondary schools in a radius o f about 100 km from Ouagadougou. Most schools
were in poor rural areas, and they were: Philippe Zinda (Ouagadougou), Bangre Noma (private
Ouagadougou), Lycee professional de Kadiogo, SOGPELCE (Thyou), Lycee departmental de Sabou,
Secondary school o f Surghumbila, College de Niou, College Yennenga (NGO), College de fraternite
(Kombissiri), Ecole municpale de Kombissiri, College de Lumbila, College des Nations (Ouagadougou),
College Nabonswende, Lycee Communal Rimvougre, College Hadja Koutouga Diallo, Lycee Municipal
Ziniare. The mission also visited the Yarogo ecole primaire and Ecole Normale Superieure (Koudougou).

OBJECTIVE PART (B): INCREASED EQUALITY BETWEEN GENDERS AND INCOME LEVELS
(SUBSTANTIAL)


4.6     The construction program helped increase access for the poorer students and for
girls. The number o f additional students enrolled between 1995 and 2003 in the ten
provinces with the highest incidence o f poverty and lowest coverage rose by 85 percent,
from 13,353 to 24,738; that is 11,385 new students enrolled compared t o the project
target of 8,000 (PEPP IICR, p. 6).

4.7     The effort t o increase girls' enrollment in l o w coverage areas proved successful.
Out o f 194,705 new students registered in lower secondary, 78,855 (40.5 percent) were
                                                 11


girls. O f these new female students, 7,821 were from the t e n provinces with the lowest
enrollment rate, accounting for 3 1.6 percent o f students enrolled in these ten provinces.
Overall, the proportion o f girls enrolled in secondary schools rose from 35 t o 40.2
percent, achieving the target outcome o f 40 percent. Girls' enrolment rates continued to
climb in the years after the project ended, reaching 14.5 percent in 2006/07 (Figure 4-4).
4.8     To promote girls' education, 60 percent o f the student rooms in secondary and
university dormitories were to be reserved for girls. Girls also became the exclusive
recipients o f secondary school scholarships beginning in 1996, with priority placed on the
10 provinces with the lowest enrollment. The trends o f girls' enrollment suggest that the
project may have had the desired effect; the gender parity index rose steadily from 0.60 in
1997 to 0.73 in 2006 (Figure 4-4, Annex Table C-1).

4.9     With respect to socioeconomic equity in access, the picture i s somewhat mixed
(Figure 4-5). The enrolment rate o f the poorest students more than doubled (from 2 to 5
percent o f enrolment in 2003-2007), whereas the increase among the better o f f students
was less dramatic percentage-wise (from 47 to 63 percent in 2003-2007). Numerically,
more students from the higher socioeconomic quintiles enrolled in secondary education,
but this difference i s at least partly due to eligibility; students from better o f f families
have had greater access to primary education. N o studies have been conducted to find
out the extent to which qualified low-income students are barred from attending
secondary school due to tuition requirements, knowledge levels or distance from the
already crowded schools (also see para. 4.26).

OBJECTIVE PART (C):      BETTER-TRAINED
                                      STUDENTS GRADUATED FROM SECONDARY
SCHOOLS (MODEST)

4.10 T o fulfil this objective, the project provided several inputs aimed at improving the
quality o f education and increasing learning outcomes. These included plans t o revamp
curricula, acquisition o f textbooks, and training o f educators. Overall, there is little direct
evidence that graduating students were better trained, partly because due to a lack o f data
on learning outcomes.

4.1 1 Teacher training and deployment. Teacher training programs were implemented
as expected, but there has been no evaluation o f student-teachers' learning t o inform on
their effectiveness. Inservice training has expanded under PEPP I1(Annex B). Some
under-utilized teachers were redeployed to schools in the provinces during PEPP Ibut  ,
new non-teaching teachers have joined the system. The government has expressed the
expectation that regionalized recruitment, which started in 2008, will produce tighter
controls. Furthermore, attrition from the front lines is frequent, with teachers becoming
pedagogical advisors and inspectors. These only need to have five and eight years o f
teaching experience respectively. A rationalized use o f teachers i s critical, because in
2009, there was a deficit o f about 1700 for existing schools.

4.12 Curricula and labor market responsiveness. The P A D had indicated that 65
percent o f lower secondary graduates would find employment as a result o f the project,
though employment type was not specified. Labor market surveys show that about 82.5
percent o f persons with lower secondary education work, but they tend to be occupied in
unqualified labor rather than in work demanding knowledge from their studies. And
lower secondary education graduates may be unemployed more often than primary
education graduates, while university students have the highest unemployment rate
(Table 4-3 and Annex Table C-2; draft country status report 2009). Curricular reform
was expected to improve employability but it was not carried out during PEPP Iand i s a
long-term goal under PEPP I1(Annex B). Existing data do not indicate h o w much
demand there i s for highly skilled labor. But regardless o f demand, even updated
curricula as taught in Burkinabe schools, may fail to prepare students for such
occupations (paras. 4.15-4.1 8).

4.13 Textbooks and instructional materials. The books were received in 2003 and were
distributed. A project-financed evaluation found widespread acceptance and positive
comments from teachers and students (SN-EFRAC 2004). The effects o f textbooks at the
                                                    13


secondary level have not been evaluated, but in primary education textbooks have been
linked to higher test scores.'2

4.14 The government did not procure any books after 2003. The follow-on project
experienced a two-year delay in textbook acquisition (Annex B). l3     Textbooks could have
been procured through the revolving fund established for stock renewal through students'
rental fees, but disagreements arose regarding the uses o f the fund. l4 the time o f the
                                                                        At
IEG mission in 2009, a consultant company was to be hired to write a procedures manual
for the use o f the fund. Thus, the revolving fund for book replenishment proved feasible,
but governance-related issues prevented it from being used for students' benefit.

4.15 During school visits the IEG mission found that textbooks procured in 2000-2003
were becoming scarce. They are not printed in Burkina Faso, so there is a continuing
need to import them. Since students lack basic materials for study, teachers give word for
word dictation or copy on the blackboard for students to transcribe. Furthermore, there i s
a total lack o f textbooks in grades 11-13, higher education, and teacher training colleges.
Therefore all post-primary classes spend most o f the instructional time transcribing
information rather than contemplating it. In fact, every day the textbooks get reproduced
thousands o f times in Burkina Faso (Figures 4-6 and 4-7). Teaching a course by
transcription takes at least twice as long, according to one informant, and courses such as
math and physics become too complex to be taught by dictation. Schools or universities
might be expected to hand out stenciled or photocopied notes, but equipment and paper
are expensive and scarce, so few if any handouts are given at any level o f education.

4.16 If project inputs were to result in better trained graduates, some teacher training
effects should be observable in classroom. For example, teachers would be observed to
link new topics to previously taught topics, engage students in questions and answers,
and monitor their work. However, the textbook scarcity leaves l i t t l e time in the school
hour to contemplate material, even if teachers knew what to do. All that could be
observed besides transcription was repetition o f disjointed items in a series. As human
cognition i s structured, serially encoded items cannot be easily retrieved to answer
examination questions or to make decisions in life. Also very little information was
encoded, given the amount o f time students spend in class. l5


l2Draft country status report, table 4.10,2009. The mission asked some teachers how their practice
differed during the period when everyone had textbooks, but responses were unclear. Some teachers had
not been teaching at that time, while in a number o f schools some textbooks were missing, and students
again had to copy verbatim.
l3                                                                                               n
  French-speakingtextbooks have production and distribution issues that have not been dealt with i a
global fashion. Imported secondary textbooks cost about five times as much as primary textbooks, that are
produced locally. One problem i s that local companies cannot effectively compete with Canadian and
French companies in international competitive bidding (ICB).
l4 it s response to the PPAR, the government noted that the funds remained unused at the advice of the
  In
Bank.
15
  Knowledge i s cumulative, and without a close match o f previously learned items, students cannot easily
retain new information. To be retrievable, informationshould be contemplated and classified in long-term
memory on the basis of meaning. Items memorized serially are retrievable only when that specific series i s
requested. Advanced readers and writers reorganize material during note-taking and thus may retain it, but
                                                      14


4.17 Nevertheless, it is unclear whether textbook availability would result in more
contemplation o f information during class. Transcription has been a long tradition, and
teachers find i t normal; some students mentioned t o the mission that textbooks are meant
to be cultural enrichment and are not needed in class. (The technical education teachers
interviewed said that some students are practically illiterate and could not read the
textbooks even if they had them.) One concern is that teachers at all levels have
themselves been trained with a very limited amount o f material, and they may not know
or understand the subject well enough to discuss it, even if they had the textbooks and the
opportunity.'6

4.18   For the textbooks to impart knowledge, the students should be able to read them
and understand them. But the IEG mission gave informal oral reading tests to a
convenience sample o f students and found slow reading rates (about 98 words per
minute) and in many cases limited text comprehen~ion.'~ f the approximately 4 1
                                                        O

slow readers may be unable t o process meaningful sentences within the limits o f their 12-second working
memory (See Abadzi 2006, Annex B for a review.) Students are more likely t o recall sentences that are
complex and would be found in textbooks than brief and disconnected notes (e.g. Stein et al. 1984). For
more information o n instructional time use see Abadzi 2007.
l6 The effects o f teacher training should be expected t o be observable in classrooms. But textbook deficits
left few activity options for teachers, so it was impossible t o assess whether teaching behaviors had been
influenced by training.
l7Students should read a text fast enough t o contain it within their working memory and thus comprehend
and encode the meaning in long-term memory. Reading rates for secondary education are available only in
the US, where the 50" percentile o f students in grades 6-8 reads at about 150 words per minute (Hasbrouck
and Tindal2006); 98 words per minute corresponds t o the 25" percentile at the end o f grade 4. Lack o f
textbooks restricts reading practices, so students' reading speed does n o t rise, and they remain perennially
less capable o f processing a large amount o f text efficiently. However, public schools have n o plans for
remedial instruction, as do some Catholic schools. Since most students lack sufficient knowledge t o do the
work, they may not be able t o answer questions. The IEG mission observed that the little time given t o
questions and answers was spent only with those students w h o volunteered. Perennial neglect i class may
                                                                                                  n
result in failure and subsequent dropout (Llambiri 2007).

students tested informally, t w o seventh graders were found to be illiterate. Some others
simply lacked sufficient knowledge o f French vocabulary to understand what they read.
It appears, therefore that a number o students enter secondary school without the
                                      f
necessary language and reading skills necessary to understand textbooks and to build
organized knowledge networks with the information provided to them in class. A
standardized test given to primary school students showed that only about 25 percent o f
them had acceptable scores (PEPP I1P A D p. 21). Further evidence is provided by a 2003
demographic survey which showed that only about 45 percent o f primary school
graduates could read (Figure 4-8). Also, if textbooks had been efficiently used when
available, dropout or repetition rates might have been lower between 2003 and 2006, but
such a trend i s not obvious.18

4.19 Project documents noted limited instructional time use but did not provide a plan
t o improve it. Loss o f instructional time is considerable. In every school visited by the
IEG mission there was at least one teacher missing. A study showed that only about 40
percent o f the instructional hours are used (MESSRS 2008). The study focused o n late
openings and early closings o f schools during the academic year, but sources o f
instructional time loss are multiple. Considering the wage bill o f secondary education
teachers, each instructional hour in each school costs about 4500 F C F A (US$9) per hour.
If class i s held in that hour, students mainly receive a dictation or blackboard copy o f the
                                           1
already published books. Under PEPP 1 , curricula were expected to become competency
-based rather than objective-based (Annex B). Given these circumstances, it matters little
whether curricula are competency-based or objective based. Very l i t t l e content is

18
  The high student teacher ratio (about 83 in lower secondary schools) means that teachers can do n o more
than one evaluation per student per trimester. Thus students have very limited opportunities to show the
extent o f their knowledge, and any,personal difficulties may count against them.

covered in class, and curricular changes alone would not make students more active or
better able to use the information given in class for income generation.

Effects on Quality o f Education and Learning Outcomes

4.20 L i t t l e i s known about actual students' learning outcomes. The PEPP Iproject
financed the development o f achievement tests in fundamental subjects (Mathematics,
French, Biology, History and Geography), which could have served as indicators o f
quality improvements, but the follow up tests were not completed prior to project closure.
(The PEPP I1project has been piloting tests in 30-50 schools, but it has not yet produced
results from representative samples.)

4.21 Overall, pass rates have increased in the last decade. Transition from grade 10 to
grade 11 has increased from 55.7 to 61 percent between 1998 and 2007 (Annex Table C-
7). The lo* grade school leaving examination (BEPC) pass rate increased from 35
percent to 50 percent over time. About 32 percent o f students passed the Baccalaurdat
examination in 2007, and 38.4 percent in 2008, according to MESSRS staff interviewed
by the IEG mission. However, the project had expected to reduce repetition to 20
percent, and this target was not reached. The repetition rate essentially remained constant
(Table 4-3).19

4.22 Overall repetition rates have been high (average 25.9 percent in 2006-07; Annex
Table C-5). Projections suggest that o f 100 students starting grade 1, only about 14
percent may reach the final secondary grade (14.7 percent in 2004-05, vs. 13.9 percent in
2006-07; Annex Table C-6). There are no clear trends o f improvement. And in terms o f
gross enrollment rates, the drop i s precipitous from 13 percent to 4.8 percent (cohort
2000-0 1; Figure 4- 10).




  The ICR states that the overall repetitionrate from 25 to 3 1 percent by the end o f the project, but
subsequently MESSRS issued figures different than those reported in the ICR (Table 4-3:).

4.23 Repetition may be due in part to poor time use, which results in little knowledge
being acquired during school attendance. Students have no time during class to process
the information and lack materials to study and pass examinations. But the rising
repetition rates also suggest that students who enter the system may not be well prepared
for the work. Only about 48.5 percent o f primary school graduates can read,20partly due
to a perennial lack o f textbooks in the system, limited French knowledge, and poor
classroom time use. (As o f 2007, every primary student has a reading book, so reading
achievement may improve.). Starting in 1997 the government took measures to increase
officially the instructional time to 36 weeks or 180 days, compared to 108 days that were
given before the project. However, no action plan was established for the
implementation o f the policy and no clear actions have been taken.

OBJECTIVE PART (D): REDUCED SUBSIDY COSTS (SUBSTANTIAL)

4.24 Cost recovery and scholarship reduction measures allowed the MESSRS to reduce
social expenditures significantly, and to allocate more resources to instructional
expenditure (from 15.9 percent o f the secondary education budget in 1998 to 30.5 percent
in 2003). Eventually scholarships were limited to 500 per year and eliminated for all but
female students (Annex Table A-1). I t i s unknown whether this policy led to dropouts.

                                 ,
4.25 After the end o f PEPP I the government eliminated scholarships for secondary
school, though some NGOs, such as Promo Femmes give them to girls. However, the
government provides subsidies o f about 30,000 FCFA (US$63) to private schools for
admitting students who cannot attend public schools. This scheme has been implemented
with about 2000 students, but since 2007, financial restrictions have thwarted the
program. Existing students are allowed to graduate, but new ones may not apply. There
has been no evaluation o f this specific program to estimate its impact on the poor, and
also there has been no independent verification o f student attendance.

4.26    In public and rural private schools visited by the IEG mission, tuition was found
to be 50,000-70,000 (US$103-144) per year. It i s unclear whether the amounts are
sustainable for the government and affordable for poor students who are qualified to enter
secondary education. It i s uncertain to what extent dropouts face performance difficulties
or inability to pay school fees. Many o f the very poor also perform poorly, so this issue
was confounded. O n the other hand, most schools visited by the mission were congested
with students; the average student-teacher ratio in lower secondary education i s about 83
(Annex Table C-4). This means that those able to pay for them filled them to capacity. If
qualified students who are unable to pay cannot attend, there would also be n o space for
them.

4.27    Private sector involvement. The project strengthened the capacity o f the private
sector to serve secondary education students. The percentage o f secondary students
attending private schools has risen from about 32 percent in 1997-98 to 34 percent by
project end and to 36 percent by 2006-07 (Annex Table C-9). However, the experience
with privatized buildings has been mixed. Three NGOs agreed to take over schools, but
two were unable to carry out the tasks, and the schools reverted to the government. A
number o f municipalities are managing schools, reportedly successfully. However, the
government has faced various problems with schools given for lease-purchase. Private
owners pay annual leases late and may do so after repeated warnings. T w o individuals
interviewed by the IEG mission found the buildings to be o f poorer quality than expected,
and they expected the government to maintain the newly constructed buildings.

4.28 Also, the policy has been controversial, partly because it had not been presented
to the public in sufficient detail. N o study has been done o f costs and savings involved in
this approach. Furthermore, there i s potential for conflicts o f interest in purchase prices
and payments. Some schools are being constructed on private land, and it i s unclear to
whom they will belong. This method may expand private education in cities, but has
limited potential in rural areas. The owners who buy the schools are not obligated to
keep them operating as schools; as cities expand, the terrain and buildings could be used
for other private purposes. Thus, the long-term benefits and costs o f this innovative
arrangement are unclear.


  5. Ratings o f the Post-primary Education Project

      OUTCOMES
PROJECT

5.1      The objectives o f the PEPP I   were highly relevant to the needs o f the country,
given the need for large increases in the provision o f secondary education. The relevance
o f the design i s rated substantial. The project focused on sustainable means to increase
the provision o f secondary education while maintaining a realistically implementable set
o f activities.

5.2     Project efficacy i s rated substantial. Despite serious implementation difficulties,
the project increased the availability o f school infrastructure and obtained necessary
inputs, such as textbooks and essential training that would enable school operations.
                                                 19


Nevertheless, there is l i t t l e evidence that the project resulted in better trained students
graduating from secondary schools.

5.3    Overall, efficiency i s rated substantial. Serious efforts were made to reduce
expenditures, increase cost recovery, and find means that would reduce the government
burden o f managing and paying for secondary education. These have succeeded in
expanding access to secondary education, though the quality o f some c i v i l works may be
modest and require repairs.

5.4     Work carried out in Burkina Faso on the rates o f return to education concluded
that a positive relationship exists between the educational level o f a workforce and the
national income level (Kazianga 2004). The average gross return to education in Burkina
Faso had been estimated during appraisal to be 16 percent at secondary level, compared
to 9 percent for primary education (Net present Value o f $3.2 million equivalent, using a
discount rate o f 10 percent and an IRR o f 29 percent; P A D p. 10). The economic rate o f
return was recalculated in the ICR and indicated a net benefit o f US$7.5 million, a net
present value o f US$3.6 million and an IRR o f 36 percent. However, the assumptions
were unrealistic. They included reduced secondary teacher salaries (who have become
very scarce), reduced repetition and drop-out rates, and higher earnings by graduates
(PAD p.14). The latter assumption i s questionable, since students learn a very limited
amount o f information during class. The analyses suggest that expenditures may be
affordable, but the country may not be getting all the expected benefits from secondary
education. T o specify realistic rates o f return more extensive analyses are needed.
5.5     Given the ratings o f substantial relevance, substantial efficacy, and substantial
efficiency, project outcome i s rated satisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT
                 OUTCOME

5.6                  ,
         For PEPP I the risk to development outcome i s rated moderate. Demand from
students has increased since the project was completed, and students able to pay the
necessary fees have filled many schools to capacity. However, the sustainability o f
inputs i s not ensured. The prices o f imported textbooks are high and the government i s
not able produce all o f i t s textbooks locally. Also, the lease-purchase program o f schools
remains o f uncertain sustainability. Financial issues aside, there may not be many private
operators able to operate new secondary schools, as was shown by the problems faced by
existing NGOs. The scarcity o f qualified teachers exacerbates risks.

5.7    Furthermore, the modest school construction quality has created maintenance
needs earlier than expected. This means that the government may face significant repair
expenditures with secondary schools while it i s trying to build primary schools.

BANKPERFORMANCE

5.8     Overall, Bank performance i s rated moderately satisfactory. Quality at entry i s
rated satisfactory; the need for hardware inputs and the importance o f financial
sustainability were correctly identified as policy priorities. Also targets and monitoring
indicators were included in the PAD. Nevertheless, the appraisal documents show
                                             20


limited insight regarding o f the amount o f information students were learning in class and
their limited language skills. Though instructional time was included as an issue, there
was no measurement o f it or plans for improving it. The subsequent discussions o n costs
did not include this variable.

5.9       Quality o f supervision i s rated moderately unsatisfactory. The donor and
government staff interviewed by the IEG mission expressed a high regard for the Bank's
financial management policies. They also stated that specialist consultants who visited
the country o n supervision missions were knowledgeable and satisfactorily discussed the
state o f various components. However, several officials reported to the IEG mission that
the Bank had often delayed responses to no-objection requests for weeks at a time,
blocking action by the project implementation unit (PIU) and delaying the
implementation o f planned activities. Also Bank staff had poorly articulated
communication with government staff, and a number o f their decisions appeared to be
arbitrary or unilateral. For example, disputes arose regarding the size o f the
complementary classrooms to be built, with the Bank insisting that they should be smaller
than norms. According to officials, the delays and disputes sometimes made it hard to
                                                                I
execute activities and achieve project goals. As one said, " wish they could just leave us
alone, with our small means we would s t i l l do better.'' These concerns had also been
expressed during a 2000 PPAR (OED 2001).

       PERFORMANCE
BORROWER

5.10 Borrower performance i s rated satisfactory. The government showed
commitment and willingness to pilot innovative policies such as private-public
partnerships. It proved willing to undertake work that was complex given i t s
implementation capacity in 1999, and after some false starts, staff were appointed whoc
could carry out the work. The government also developed a plan for secondary education
that has remained under implementation. Overall, government performance i s rated
satisfactory.

5.1 1 The performance o f the implementing agency i s also rated satisfactory. During
the execution o f the project the P I U had difficulty supervising civil works, and many staff
and consultants lacked qualifications for the positions they held. Lack o f experience
made it hard to deal with procurement issues. Through the difficulties o f the first project,
however, MESSRS learned to manage complex projects and could thus manage the
follow-on project more effectively.

                    DESIGN,
MONITORING EVALUATION
        AND               IMPLEMENTATION, AND UTILIZATION

5.12 Though the project was appraised before monitoring indicators were required in
the Bank, the P A D has several monitoring indicators and targets (Annex Table A-
l).Project documents do not show the development o f an evaluation design to establish
cause-effect relationships, and no systematic means was put in place for data collection
during the project. Nevertheless, five evaluative studies on various components were
undertaken upon project completion. Though these were partly reports on activities
carried out during the project, they also included focus groups and interviews regarding
                                                     21


the execution quality and sustainability o f various activities. There has been n o broad
dissemination o f evaluative findings, but the information was used for the appraisal o f the
follow-on project. Overall, monitoring and evaluation are rated substantial.

     6. Issues: Curricular Reforms, Time Use, and Privatization

AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WITH A VERY RESTRICTED KNOWLEDGE BASE

6.1      The brave efforts o f the government to expand secondary education are conducted
within a system that makes very little knowledge available to students (paras. (4.13-4.18)
Students attending secondary schools, universities, and teachers' colleges go through
their studies without textbooks. If an educational institution i s run without textbooks,
class time has to be spent in copying and dictation. There i s no time either t o cover the
curriculum or to contemplate i t s contents in class. Also, optional readings in university
libraries do not fulfill the need for structured information, particularly for low-income
countries where the population has limited education.

6.2      Due to a lack o f reading practice, a number o f secondary students in Burkina Faso
(as in other sub-Saharan Africa countries) read at second- or third-grade level and may be
unable to learn material from complex secondary-level textbooks." Many professors
reportedly also have limited knowledge and may give insufficient explanations. Because
knowledge i s cumulative and instructional time i s poorly used, students may learn little
additional material in school. Thus, certificates may have mainly social value rather than
attest to preparation for higher-level work.

6.3     Educational institutions have to have ample sources o f information, and since
computers with internet connections are not broadly available, textbooks must be
acquired. The provision o f feasible and affordable sources o f information must drive the
design and supervision o f future lending. The IEG mission heard at all levels that
Francophone textbooks are simply too expensive to procure, and the institutions
concerned could not manage the expense or logistics. However, the government has
proved i t s ability to manage textbook rental schemes. These could be expanded to
teacher training colleges and the university. For example, a nonprofit subsidiary could be
set up to manage textbook rentals at the university. Overall, concerted efforts should be
undertaken to obtain Francophone textbooks at affordable prices for all levels through
rentals, cheap international editions, and potentially local printing. Up-to-date textbooks
o f broad international circulation are likely to have material organized in ways that
students can understand and retain. This priority seems higher than curricular
development within a single country, particularly when there i s l i t t l e evidence that
alternative curricula would improve learning outcomes, given the realities o f Burkinabe
education.

                               EXAMINATION
REFORM OF THE UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE        SYSTEM

6.4     As in much o f the Francophone world, the Baccalaurkat examination i s a
secondary school leaving certificate and a university entrance certificate at the same time.
All students who pass it may enrol in the university. As a result, the university cannot
regulate i t s enrollments and has swollen to 40,000 students by 2009 and crowding has
resulted in civil unrest.22 The goal o f keeping university enrollments at manageable
levels clashes with the goal o f expanding secondary graduation. Efforts are made to limit
pass rates at the end o f grade 10 as well as access to the actual e ~ a m i n a t i o n .Knowledge
                                                                                          ~~
issues aside, the system may have to maintain inefficiency in order to manage university
enrollments.

6.5      This issue also creates a vicious circle with respect to teacher availability for
secondary education. Graduation from secondary school i s required for teaching some
secondary education subjects. However, the majority o f students fail early on and cannot
graduate because they do not meet the requirements. The scarcity o f secondary education
teachers i s particularly severe in math and science, where knowledge at the BaccalaurCat
level i s required. Schools compete for a small pool o f candidates who have many other
options.

6.6    PEPP I   included as a condition o f effectiveness that the BaccalaurCat
examinations would stop being conducted by the university, but university authorities did
not agree at the time, and the condition was dropped. Therefore the problem o f the
Baccaulareat as a school leaving examination remains in need o f resolution. The
government could consider reforms to increase selectivity based o n separate
examinations or differential use o f scores for university a d m i s ~ i o n s .Given government
                                                                                ~~
commitment to quality improvement, ultimately it should become possible to expand
secondary education to the extent expected.

     7. Lessons
7.1        This assessment provides a number o f lessons for the education sector:

       To obtain job-relevant skills from school enrollment students must first and foremost
       acquire pertinent and suitably organized knowledge. If secondary education does not
       impart the necessary knowledge, the labor market may be unable to use the graduates
       when demand arises (paras. 4.12,4.16-4.18).

       In low-income countries where substantial numbers o f students fail to acquire basic
       skills, application o f the available curricula and textbooks may be more important
       than development o f new curricula. New curricula may be in principle desirable, but

created in 1974 with 533 students and had expanded to 9,400 students by 1996.

separate examinations (World Higher Education Database

    they should be realistically implementable in low-income classrooms (para. 3.5,
    4.19).

0   Subsidizing private secondary education may help increase access in countries where
    secondary education i s constrained. Where student demand i s high, increasing the
    availability o f private schools may enable the government to concentrate public
    resources o n lower income and underserved groups (para. 3.1 1).

    Textbooks or systematically reproduced materials are a prerequisite for knowledge
    management at all levels o f education. Their availability should be a policy priority.
    Without textbooks and training o f teachers in their use (particularly where teachers
    themselves have studied without them), knowledge becomes constricted and systemic
    efficiency i s low. The cost and availability o f Francophone textbooks has been a long-
    standing problem, for which clear solutions have not emerged (para.4.15,6.3).

Project management. The follow-on project, PEPP 1 , was to be fully integrated in
MESSRS under the oversight o f a steering committee and a technical committee o f 13-18
members.25   However, it became difficult to locate and obtain approvals o f various
activities from multiple officials, and disbursements were slow. To improve

often in the execution o f the project. The deliberations o f the Piloting Committee were not taken into
account or were secondary to the advice o f the World Bank. This caused a coordination problem m project
implementation.

implementation rates, the government separated the procurement and administration
functions into a separate cell that would recruit some private-sector staff. The secretary
general o f MESSRS became the project director. Thus, it has been possible t o focus o n
project objectives and obtain approvals o f activities from a small number o f people able
to act quickly.

School construction. The ongoing project i s continuing the construction program with
about 110 additional school buildings. The gross enrollment ratio o f secondary education
has continued to climb, although it was only about 14 percent in 2006-07 (about 20
percent in lower secondary and about 8 percent in upper secondary; Annex Table (2-1).

                                  1
Teacher training. Under PEPP 1 , more extensive training has taken place. Almost all
schools visited by the IEG mission reported that training seminars o f 3-4 days' duration
had been given in the year 2007-08, but none in 2008-09 and rarely earlier. Also,
pedagogical advisors were reportedly visiting schools, particularly where there were
teacher trainees. (In 2005-06, inspectors conducted 8499 visits, 58 percent o f those
programmed and 1755 training sessions, 66 percent o f the sessions that had been
programmed.) Inspectors in four o f the schools visited had sent messages indicating that
they would come to inspect. This function has become better organized with time, but the
criteria, outcomes, and overall effects o f inspection visits are s t i l l unclear. Also the
pedagogical advisors get a card describing their duties and are asked to make school visit
plans and carry them out. Similarly performance contracts are given to directors,
describing their duties and agreeing to the tasks that must be carried out in school.


Under PEPP 1 , training was to take place on topics that inspectors had identified as
               1
frequent issues. One such topic has been the management o f large classes. (Student-
teacher ratios are about 83 in lower secondary schools; Annex Table C-4). One school
reported that training took place in 2007-08 o n this topic but the informant could not
identify efficient practices and advice given by the trainers. It i s unclear whether the
training modes that are usually provided modify teachers' behaviors, but given the lack o f
materials, they limited options regarding the activities they may implement. Thus,
competency-based curricula may not result in the expected improvements in labor market
responsiveness.

Curricular reform. The goal o f reforming curricula continued in the follow-on project,
PEPP 1 . To make the schooling more useful for the labor market, MESSRS decided to
        1
replace objective-based curricula with competency-based curricula.26A general curricular
framework was slowly developed, and the Ministry held broad consultations with
officials and citizens starting in January 2008. In March 2009, the plan was to be
presentedfor ministerial approval, and then i t s financial feasibility would be evaluated.

26 Competency-based curricula (Bums and Klingstedt 1973) are focused on outcomes that are linked t o
workforce needs, as defmed by employers. Rather than teaching individual low-level objectives that
educators believe students should know, outcomes are increasingly complex. Large skill sets are broken
down into competencies, which may have sequential levels o f mastery. Competencies reinforce one another
from basic to advanced as learning progresses. Competency curricula often necessitate complex
assessments, involving portfolios, experiential learning assessment in field experiences, demonstrations in
varying contexts, and role play.

Revisions would start from grade 7 (66me). During interviews, officials expressed the
desire for students to be active during class and to synthesize complex knowledge.
However, it was unclear how competency-based curricula would be applied given the
resource limitations o f the Burkinabe system.

Textbooks. The ongoing project was t o finance about 2 million o f secondary education
textbooks, but multiple problems delayed this activity. The Bank initially did not agree
to the purchase o f additional textbooks, stating that since new curricula were to be
developed, new textbooks should be written according to competency based approaches.
(However, the process would take several years, and it i s unclear h o w competency-based
textbooks would be written realistically.) Textbook prices had been underestimated
during appraisal, and the Bank found the new prices too high. The government was asked
to compare prices with those obtained by neighboring countries from French and
Canadian publishing companies. Bank insisted o n protracted price negotiations with
publishers who had won International Competitive Bidding (ICB) o f the first project and
reportedly negotiated o n behalf o f the government to increase discount from the l i s t price
to 65 rather than 60 percent. This process took about six months. The result o f these
complications was a two-year delay in the delivery o f new textbooks to schools, during
which prices rose further. Textbooks should have been procured in 2006 for use in 2007-
08 school year but may only be available in the fall o f 2009.

Decentralization. An important strategy for improving education quality has been
decentralization. According to the P A D o f PEPP I1(p. 9) the Government has agreed to
implement i t s decentralization policy, delegate school management to municipalities and
support partnerships with private investors, develop low-cost pedagogical materials,
reduce repetition, and manage more efficiently the total education budget. The regional
directors were to play a role in preparing regional authorities to manage education. A
                                                   ,
number o f them received training during PEPP I but there i s n o evidence that regional
staff would have greater knowledge or insight o n improving achievement levels, given
the Burkinabe resource limitations.

Project management. The follow-on project was to be integrated fully in the Ministry and
involve few if any private-sector employees. Procurement was decentralized to regionss,
whose officials could contract locally for civil works and other purchases. Early on,
however, it became evident that execution would face problems. Multiple persons were
responsible for various decisions and they could not always be located to sign needed
documents. Also, different officials had different priorities regarding h o w the money was
to be spent. The piloting and technical committees were large (13-1 8 people) and could
not easily make decisions. As a result, in the first year o f work, the project had disbursed
only about 5 percent o f the funds. At the suggestion o f the Bank, MESSRS established a
small PIU to expedite procurement and disbursements and maintain financial
management. The staff are a mix o f public and private-sector employees, whose terms o f
reference include ensuring that the funds are not merely used as public funds but are
expended for the specific activities outlined in project documents. There i s considerable
emphasis o n preventing mismanagement, such as dispatches o f funds to regions in
instalments.

        C o m e suite aux instructions de monsieur l e SecrCtaire gCnCral du ministere des
Enseignements secondaire, supCrieur et de l a Recherche scientifique, j 'ai l'honneur de
vous transmettre des observations sur 1'Cbauche du (( Rapport d'dvaluation rktrospective
de projet )) du groupe d'kvaluation indkpendante (GEI) Banque mondiale, du 9 juin 2009.

    1. Les manuels scolaires

     L a situation like a l a rupture des stocks de manuels scolaires et a l a pCnurie constatee
dans les etablissements d'enseignement secondaire, de m6me que l e retard de deux ans
enregistre pour l'acquisition de deux millions de nouveaux manuels dans l e cadre du
         1
PEPP 1 , a CtC bien ddcrite. I1 est de m6me des consequences de l a penurie de manuels sur
l a qualite de l'enseignement et des apprentissages.

    On peut cependant relever au point 5.6 que l'affirmation selon laquelle (( les prix des
manuels import& sont ClevCs et l e gouvernement n'est pas en mesure de faire produire
ses manuels localement ... )) demande a &re nuancde parce que le C E N A M A F S a dCja
produit des manuels d'anglais (6e et 5e), d'allemand (Ihr und wir I e t 1 ) et s'apprete a en
                                                                         1
produire d'autres. I1 en est de m6me de l'affirmation du point 6.1 selon laquelle (( les
eleves inscrits au college, dans les universites et dans les collkges de formation des
enseignants font leurs Ctudes sans manuels scolaires D.
                                                42                                 Annex E


   2. L'examen du baccalaurCat

    L'auteur lie malencontreusement l e succtts au baccalaureat a une politique de
regulation des inscription a I'universite ; ce qui est errone parce qu'il s'agit d'un examen
et non d'un concours. (Voir v i i rCsume executif. 36 paragraphe). L a meme idee est reprise
au point 1.3 (le secteur de l'enseignement au Burkina Faso).


   3. RCforme du systkme d'examen d'entrCe a I'universitC

      Au point 6.4, on apprend avec surprise que (( l e manque d'infrastructures et de
   materiel scolaire ainsi que l'incapacite a payer les enseignants ont CtC l a cause de
   manifestations populaires D et que (( des efforts sont donc men& afin de limiter l e
   taux de reussite a l a fin de l a 3e et l'acctts aux examens. Compte tenu des politiques
   d'admission, l a majorit6 des &ves du secondaire doivent Cchouer. ))
       Au point 6.5, l'expression fait croire que l e baccalaureat est l e dipl6me requis
   pour enseigner au secondaire, ce qui est inexact.

        En conclusion, s i nous adherons aux leqons tirees du PEPP I l e GEI (voir point
                                                                       par
    7. 1)' nous pensons que l e rapport doit prendre e n compte les observations ci-dessus.

       (( D e plus, les demissions d'enseignants sont constantes, e n raison des promotions

que cinq et huit ans d'experience en enseignement D.

        On ne peut pas assimiler l a promotion d'enseignants a une demission. I1 y a une
politique en matittre de recrutement d'enseignants et de formation d'encadreurs.
