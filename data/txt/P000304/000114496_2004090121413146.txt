Post-Primary Education Project- Credit No N007-BUR Amendment of 
Development Credit 
Agreement Procurement by Autonomous Agencies
Excellency:
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement between Burkina Faso and the 
International Development Association (the “Association”), dated January 24, 1997 as 
amended.
As a result of a recent internal review of all AGETIP-type projects, it has 
become apparent that the above-referenced Agreement needs to be amended to provide 
explicitly that any procurement delegated to an autonomous agency, shall be carried 
out in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Association.
We are therefore amending the Agreement as follows (with changes indicated in 
bold):
1.
A new paragraph is added at the end of Part A of Section I of Schedule 3, as 
follows:
Any procurement under National Competitive Bidding procedures delegated to an 
autonomous agency, shall be carried out in accordance with procedures satisfactory to 
the Association, as defined in the agency's Manual of Procedures which has been 
reviewed and found acceptable by the Association.
All other provisions of the Development Credit Agreement except as amended 
herein, shall remain in full force and effect.
Please indicate your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing and 
dating the confirmation form on the attached copy of this letter and returning it to 
us, while keeping the original for your records.
         This amendment will become effective as of the date of countersignature of 
this letter.
