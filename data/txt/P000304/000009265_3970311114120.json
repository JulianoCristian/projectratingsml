    Post-Primary Education Strategy (PPES).  It aims to have\n            more and better trained students graduate from secondary\n            schools at reduced subsidy costs, with increased equality\n            between genders and income levels.  The project consists of\n            the following components: a) access to lower secondary\n            education - construction of new public schools, operation of\n            schools by nonprofit organizations, and expansion of private\n            schools; b) quality of post primary education - reforming\n            and improving teacher training, textbook availability,\n            curricula, and testing; and c) institutional strengthening\n            of MESSRS (Ministry of Secondary and Higher Education and\n            Scientific Research) improving the sectoral planning and\n            managerial capacities of MESSRS at the regional and central levels."}, "docdt": "1996-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
