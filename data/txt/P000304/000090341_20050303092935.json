The\n            lessons learned indicate building capacity requires more\n            than resources and technical assistance; it requires also a\n            motivated and stable staff. Civil works managed by the\n            Government need an independent oversight mechanism to ensure\n            transparency, and to ensure that entrepreneurs comply with\n            the planning, and norms. Ownership and participation from\n            local communities is stronger and more meaningful when\n            communities are consulted and participate in the\n            decision-making process.
