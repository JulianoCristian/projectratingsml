                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall project management continues to improve, notably monitoring, procurement planning and disbursement. These improvements in project management indicate a clear and
                         continued effort by the MoET to make progress in the implementation of project activities. Overall, project implementation progress continues to be moderately satisfactory. In spite of
                         considerable progress, challenges remain. Procurement and implementation of activities need to be further accelerated, in particular school construction and textbooks, to ensure
                         completion of activities before the closing date.
