                         Progress on Project Development Objective (PDO) indicators continues to improve. Five of the seven PDO indicators have either already been achieved or are close to achievement.
                         Three, including enrollment in reception classes, repetition rates, and number of direct beneficiaries have been reached, and two PDO indicators on qualified teachers in difficult
                         schools are nearly achieved. The remaining two PDO indicators, both related to the number of additional classrooms built by the project, are progressing towards the end target.
                         Overall project implementation progress continues to be moderately satisfactory. Considering advancement in achieving the project's results indicators and fiduciary ratings, as well

                         address the delays in school construction in order to ensure completion of activities before the closing date.
