Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project will close on April 30, 2015. All project activities have been completed and four project development objectives have been fully achieved or
 exceeded their targets. The major activities completed under the project include:(i) construction and furnshing of 143 new classrooms, and the
 construction of 90 latrine blocks at remote mountainous schools; (ii) support for the establishment of 140 pre-primary reception classes, allowing over
 3,600 children the opportunity for quality early childhood development in preparation for primary school; (iii) the development of a new simplified
 curriculum for early grade reading and math, incuding the delivery of over 940,000 new textbooks and training of over 7,000 teachers, principals, and
 district resource teachers; (iv) over 1000 qualified teachers enrolled in a monetary incentive scheme and just under 400 under-qualified teachers
 receiving a bursary to upgrade thier qualifications in order to retain qualified teachers in remote mountain schools; and (v) several important evaluations
 to allow for evidence-based decision making and feed into the next Education Sector Plan.
