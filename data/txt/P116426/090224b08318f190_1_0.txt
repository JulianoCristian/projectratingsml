1.1 Context at Appraisal


1.      Lesotho, a small landlocked country in Southern Africa, had an estimated population of
1.9 million at the time the Basic Education Project (BEP) was appraised. It is one of the poorest
countries in Southern Africa, and one of the most unequal in the world. The Gini coefficient was
63.2, higher than other countries in the region.

2.      Lesotho is the only country in the world with all its territory above 1,000 meters. Large
parts of Lesotho’s remote rural areas are sparsely populated, with long distances between villages.
Lesotho’s unique geography and low population density makes the provision of basic services
logistically challenging and very costly. The country had a history of uneven economic growth
and had been going through a recession. Government expenditure was the main driver of the
economy; budget estimates for 2009-10 showed government expenditure at 73 percent of GDP.

3.      Lesotho’s performance on human development was poor – it ranked 156th out of 182
countries on the human development index (HDI) in 2007, which had been falling since 1995,
driven largely by the negative impacts of HIV/AIDS. In 2005, Lesotho had the third highest HIV
prevalence rate in the world (23.2 percent).

4.     In the years leading up to the Project, education outcomes of the country had improved
substantially. The government had introduced free primary education (FPE) in a phased manner
beginning in 2000, leading to an increase in net enrollment from 60 to 82 percent between 1999
and 2006. Lesotho had almost achieved gender parity. In 2007, 49.4 percent of primary school
pupils were girls, and there was a female majority in secondary education.

5.      Despite the progress, significant challenges remained. The cohort survival to grade 7 (the
last grade of primary school) fell with the introduction of FPE, and although improving, had
reached only 55 percent by 2007. Repetition was high, with a 29 percent repetition rate in grade 1
and an overall repetition rate at the primary level of 21 percent. While Lesotho had an average
pupil teacher ratio of 36:1, over 40 percent of primary teachers were unqualified. Less than half of
the primary school classrooms met the required standards, and the remainder operated in a mix of
huts of local construction, church halls, tents and other structures.

6.      The Ministry of Education and Training (MoET) had developed a 10-year Education Sector
Strategic Plan (ESSP) in 2005, which was endorsed by the development partners and the Education
for All (EFA) Fast Track Initiative (FTI) Partnership. The education sector had received support
from the International Development Association (IDA), Irish Aid and the multi-donor Education
for All Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund (EFA-FTI 1 and 2). In 2009, the MoET prepared a
Medium Term Education Sector Plan (MTESP), consistent with the ESSP, providing more detailed
projections for the years 2009-2012. The main priorities in this medium sector plan were (i)
expanding access to Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) in a pro-poor manner; (ii)
ensuring that all children had the opportunity to complete a good quality primary education; (iii)
expanding access to secondary education, with particular support to Orphans and Vulnerable

                                                 1
Children (OVCs); and (iv) improving the quality and relevance of tertiary education. This medium
term plan was endorsed by the development partners, including IDA. The Lesotho Basic Education
Project (Education for All Fast Track Initiative, EFA-FTI 3) financed by the multi-donor
Education for All Initiative (now Global Partnership for Education, GPE), provided support for
the government’s Medium Term Education Sector Plan 2009-2012. IDA was the supervising entity
for this grant.

7.     Rationale: In the context of Lesotho’s location and paucity of natural resources,
opportunities for growth centered on its labor force. Improving the level of education and
employability of the workforce was an essential prerequisite for sustained economic development.
Education was one of the main mechanisms for social mobility, and presented opportunities for
allowing the poor to partake of the economic growth of the country. The support was consistent
with the Government of Lesotho (GoL) Poverty Reduction Strategy (2004) which noted that
‘government is convinced that investment in appropriate education is the single most important
contribution that it can make to the long-term socioeconomic development of the country’. It also
contributed to the World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (2006-2009) objective to
improve human development outcomes and build skills for shared and sustained growth.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
8.     The Project Development Objective was to provide improved facilities at existing primary
schools, support and contribute to expand access to pre-primary education, and support
improvement in quality of teaching.

9.       Success in achievement of the PDO level indicators was tracked through the following
seven PDO indicators (including three core indicators):
PDO level 1: Classrooms constructed by the Project meeting the agreed standards (%)
PDO level 2: Enrolment in Reception Classes supported by the Project (number)
PDO level 3: Repetition rate (grade 1) (%)
PDO level 4: Qualified teachers (from total number covered by the Project) retained or attracted
to ‘difficult’ schools (number)
PDO level 5: Decline in shortfall of classrooms at primary level (%)
PDO level 6: Decline in shortfall of qualified teachers at primary level (%)
PDO level 7: Direct project beneficiaries (number) (teachers and pupils) of which female (%)

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.     The PDO was not revised during the lifetime of the BEP. However, at Restructuring 1 in
May 2013 which followed a comprehensive midterm review of project implementation, some PDO
indicator targets were revised (see Table 1). The changes addressed implementation performance
and challenges. The initial design of the Project had attempted innovation in implementation
arrangements to promote efficiency and sustainability of results. It had proposed to do this through
mainstreaming implementation and bringing project implementation under the purview of the
MoET rather than having a separate implementation unit. The second major change was in the
proposed approach to handling school classroom construction. The initial Project design
decentralized procurement of school classrooms to the district level, opted for smaller contracts

                                                 2
rather than contracting in lots, and encouraged smaller and weaker contracting firms to participate
in the bidding process with the objectives of enhancing efficiency and at the same time building
up capacity in school construction. Although promising, the two approaches led to delays mainly
due to weak capacity both in the MoET and at the district level. The scope of construction was
scaled back at Restructuring 1 and the end targets reduced. At the same time, the activities in the
second and third components were increased. The targets for the number or reception classes, the
numbers in the quality of teaching interventions and for textbook production and distribution were
increased. This re-alignment of activities under the project not only addressed the capacity issues
at the MoET, but was also in line with the view of the MTR mission that investing in quality of
teaching, through curriculum development and textbooks, teacher training and reception classes
(and less spending on infrastructure of classrooms), would be an effective use of the project
resources and in keeping with international evidence on outcomes.

11.     Under the second restructuring, henceforth Restructuring 2, undertaken in October 2014,
the results framework (RFW) was simplified and the link between PDO and the project’s indicators
(both PDO and intermediate) was strengthened. Three PDO indicators were dropped and two PDO
indicators were revised under this simplification of the RFW. Table 1 below summarizes the
changes to the PDO indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
12.     The primary beneficiaries were the students and teachers targeted by project interventions.
Targets were disaggregated by gender and tracked throughout Project implementation. By Project
closing, 384,810 students enrolled in project supported schools and 13,046 teachers had benefitted
from Project activities. A secondary beneficiary of the Project was the MoET which received
intensive capacity building support. The targeted beneficiaries of the Project did not change over
the life time of the project, although their numbers increased due to the expansion of project
activities.

1.5 Original Components
13.     Component 1: Improve the quality of primary school infrastructure (Appraisal:
US$ 9.1 million; Actual1: US$ 9.2m). Activities under this component aimed to improve facilities
at existing primary schools. This component was to provide approximately 330 additional, fully
furnished, primary, gender and disability friendly classrooms at existing schools, along with
approximately 100 toilet blocks in a total of 64 schools.

14.    Component 2: Support and contribution to the expansion of pre-primary education
(Appraisal: US$ 1.5 million; Actual: US$ 1.2m). The goal of this component was to support and
contribute to expansion of access to pre-primary education. This component supported the
government’s aim to maintain and expand access to reception classes especially for the poorest
children, through provision of care givers, learning materials, and catering services to
approximately 100 existing and approximately 20 additional reception classes, with a capacity of
approximately 3,600 children.

15.     Component 3: Contribution to improvements in quality of teaching (Appraisal:
US$ 7.8 million; Actual: US$ 9.2m). The goal of this component was to improve the quality of
teaching. Under this component, the government planned to improve learning outcomes in primary
schools through (i) conducting analytical work to understand the conditions of education service
delivery, teaching, and learning through school resources surveys, classroom-based observation,
skills profiles and training needs, and assessment of student outcomes measurement; (ii) assisting
in increasing the qualification level of the teacher force in ‘difficult’ schools (schools located in
the most remote and/or difficult to access areas of the country) by attracting and/or retaining more
qualified teachers in targeted schools and/or upgrading the qualifications of teachers working in
these areas; (iii) providing additional in-service teacher training aimed at improving literacy and
numeracy teaching; and (iv) providing textbooks in core subjects and grades where there were
deficits and learning materials for the implementation of the new curricula.

1.6 Revised Components
16.    There was no change in the agreed components during implementation. However, the
scope of the project components was changed over the course of implementation as were some of
the activities. Table 2 outlines the changes in scope of the components as modified under
Restructuring 1 (also discussed in section 1.3 above).

1.7 Other significant changes
18.     The project closing date was extended twice: (i) for 18 months to November 2014 at the
time of Restructuring 1; and (ii) for 5 months to April 2015 at the time of Restructuring 2. The
justification for the first extension was to allow the Project to meet its revised targets by: (i)
streamlining PDO indicator targets and (ii) restructuring the scope of components in keeping with
MoET technical and management capacity. At the time of Restructuring 2, there had been
significant improvement in project implementation as a result of MoET making a concerted effort
to accelerate implementation pace and performance. The extension in closing date was requested
to allow adequate time to implement remaining civil works and address any environmental issues.

19.     Parallel funding through Irish Aid (Appraisal: US$ 6.8 million; Actual US$ 4.9 million)
discontinued. At appraisal US$ 6.8 million was committed by Irish Aid to support project
activities as parallel financing. After the Mid-Term Review (MTR), Irish Aid discontinued its
support with a total disbursement of US$ 4.9 million.

    2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes  
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
20.     The project design was and continues to be in alignment with key education sector
priorities of the GoL. At the time of project preparation, the MoET had prepared a medium term
sector plan and diagnostics (2009-2012) aligned with the Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP)
of 2005-2015. Project design was also informed by analytical work conducted by the World Bank,
especially the teacher incentive program, a pilot implemented under the Project2.

21.     The terrain and climate in Lesotho make provision of adequate shelter for schooling an
important factor in the attendance and retention of pupils. Even so, less than half of the primary
school classrooms met the required standards, and the remainder operated in a mix of huts or tents
and other structures. The shortage of adequate classrooms was acute, but provision of new
classrooms had been constrained by both resources and implementation capacity. Thus the focus
of the Project on improving the physical condition of existing primary schools was appropriate.

22.    There is a strong geographic pattern to poverty incidence in Lesotho, as more than half of
the population lives in mountainous areas. Education outcomes of these areas lagged significantly
behind others. Although the average pupil teacher ratio in Lesotho was 36:1, over 40 percent of
primary teachers were unqualified, and the unqualified teachers were over-represented in the
mountainous or difficult to access schools, many of which had no qualified teachers at all. The
Project design had a sharp focus on these areas including interventions to upgrade quality of
teachers in mountainous regions through provision of monetary and bursary incentives and through
improving quality of curriculum and assessments.

23.      Further, the focus on early childhood development was an appropriate design choice given
the experience in Lesotho that suggested that reception classes encouraged children to attend
school earlier, start grade 1 at the correct age, and have positive impacts on behavior and
performance in grade 1. Given that provision of reception classes is likely to have the greatest
impact on children suffering from malnutrition, and on children from families where the adults are
illiterate, this was also a pro-poor intervention.

24.     Given the above considerations and the strong alignment with Government priorities, the
areas on which the Project focused were appropriate. Together these activities were aimed at
improving retention and the quality of education, however the Project documents do not make a
clear connection of these planned activities with this overarching objective and no indicators to
measure progress against these were included in the Project. The PDO and the linked indicators
focused on outputs and did not propose to measure the overall outcomes the three sets of activities
would achieve.

26.     The implementing arrangements proposed for the BEP included innovation and reflected
experience of past interventions in the sector, however, adequate analysis was not undertaken to
check feasibility of the proposed innovations. As a result, the decision to decentralize procurement
of classroom construction to the district level proved a key challenge during project
implementation. A key factor in the consideration of the design of the project was the limited
technical and management capacity of the MoET, particularly for construction activities. In
December 2008, the Project Support and Coordination Unit (PSCU), which previously had
managed all donor related projects in the education sector, was dismantled by the GoL. The MoET
had subsequently decided that all project implementation capacity would be mainstreamed
internally within MoET with the objective to build in-house capacity for project related tasks. To
address this limited capacity at the center, a key design decision was made to decentralize
procurement for school construction to the district tender panels as well as to use standardized
designs for construction and support this with the hiring of consultants to ensure limited pressure
at MoET. This was a drastic change from past practice and required additional background work
to ensure adequate risks were identified and appropriate mitigating measures put in place to ensure
there was adequate capacity for implementation given the changes. The challenges of
decentralizing were flagged in Annex 8 of the PAD on Procurement Arrangements but the
mitigation plan proved inadequate for the complexity of the task.

                                                     8
27.    The project duration also proved to be a challenge. GPE guidelines did not permit an
implementation period longer than three years which proved to be insufficient for implementing
the proposed activities given the challenging operating environment. A number of studies were
planned to measure the impact of interventions to provide information, allow for refinement of the
interventions and for the design of other future support.

28.    Overall the objectives and choice of project activities chosen at entry were sound.
However, there were key weaknesses in the design of the results framework and implementation
arrangements. On the results framework, there was inadequate attention on defining the outcomes
and linked indicators for the Project. On implementation arrangements, although they were
innovative, insufficient consideration was given to the institutional challenges the new
implementation arrangements would pose which negatively impacted Project performance.

2.2 Implementation
29.     Challenges of classroom construction in remote rural areas. The project focus of
classroom and latrine construction in remote rural areas was highly relevant and appropriate given
lack of access, poverty and inequality in rural areas. However, the logistics of undertaking civil
works in remote rural areas such as mountain tops proved to be highly challenging. For example,
one contractor had to build a road just to get the building materials to the site. Others had to
transport material using mules. Challenges in the implementation of Component 1 impacted the
overall implementation rating up to the MTR. School construction had been divided into three
batches at the onset of the Project (batch 1: 67 classrooms in 16 schools; batch 2: 113 classrooms
in 24 schools; batch 3: 113 classrooms in four schools). At MTR, of batch 1, only eight classrooms
had been completed at 100% and four latrines at 100% in five schools. In total 11 contracts had
been signed for latrines and 11 contracts in 11 schools. This was partly explained by project
specific factors including decentralizing of procurement to the districts and limited capacity at
MoET (procurement, M&E, World Bank procedures) in areas related to school construction and
the lack of internal coordination within MoET to overcome these gaps.

30.     An external factor to this project, a misappropriation of funds in a previous education
project, the Education Sector Development Project II (ESDP II) financed by a previous FTI grant
(FTI 2) was flagged a year after BEP became effective. In November 2011, IDA was made aware
of a misappropriation of funds for civil works under the former project. Subsequently there was
an investigation conducted by IDA’s Department of Institutional Integrity (INT). Although civil
works under BEP had not yet begun, due to the reasons indicated above, the investigation impacted
implementation of civil works under BEP in several ways. First, the implementing agency’s time
was diverted to resolve the crisis in ESDP II3 while still being responsible for implementing BEP.
Second, activities under Component 1 slowed down as the IDA team awaited findings of the
investigation in order to assess if similar challenges were affecting the civil works in this project
and integrate the findings into the implementation of civil works. By November 2012, at the mid-


3
  The team carried out a physical verification of 10 schools and 12 classrooms financed under ESDP II which
allowed INT to open an investigation and for a calculation of funds that needed to be reimbursed. The GoL
reimbursed the funds and also completed the pending civil works in ESDP II.


                                                        9
term review mission disbursement stood at 7% or (US$1.4 million). The INT investigation also
led to some tension in the relationship between the Bank and the GoL.

31.     At the MTR stage, critical corrective measures allowed a turnaround in project
performance. Three specific factors contributed to the turnaround of the project. First, during
Restructuring 1, the decision to scale down activities under Component 1—specifically classroom
and latrine construction—and scale up activities in Component 2 and 3—supporting reception
classes and curriculum and assessment development and publishing of textbooks— in light of
MoET capacity increased the likelihood of achieving the revised PDO indicator targets. Second,
the revision of an earlier approach to civil works was critical for the project to meet the revised
targets for school construction. The revised approach involved centralizing procurement of civil
works at the MoET; consolidating lots for bids so that all classrooms and latrines at one school
were offered in one lot for procurement; realigning roles and responsibilities at the MoET making
the Education Facilitation Unit (EFU) more accountable and enhancing its role to undertake these
activities; active supervision with the hiring of five construction supervisors at the EFU with the
specific task of undertaking M&E on school construction; and increasing capacity by hiring
technical advisors in the area of finance, procurement, and contracts. Third, the efforts by a new
World Bank team that came on board after restructuring proved critical in mending the relationship
with the Government. A new team, not associated with the previous history and challenges of the
project, allowed for the establishment of a new working relationship between the GoL and the
World Bank team. Also to be credited is the proactive supervision undertaken by the new team as
well as the additional support and resources it received from both the Practice and Country
management units to turn the project around.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
32.     Design: The strength of the original RF, PDO level indicators and accompanying
intermediate indicators was that each of the indicators was directly aligned with each PDO sub-
objective --improve facilities at existing primary schools; support and contribute to expand access
to pre-primary education; and support improvement in quality of teaching—and the associated
component for ease of monitoring. However, a few of the PDO level indicators were not clearly
defined and it was unclear what was being measured. Indicators that were measuring percentage
change in shortfalls PDO 5: Access - Decline in shortfall of classrooms at primary level (%) and
PDO 6: Quality of teaching - Decline in shortfall of qualified teachers at primary level—were
particularly difficult to measure as no baseline was provided to measure the change. The poor
definition of the PDO level indicators and the challenges they posed for data collection only
became evident late because of project delays and Restructuring 2 was partly undertaken for this
purpose.

33.     An impact evaluation was included in the project to measure the impact of the teacher
incentive program. There were a number of challenges in the collection of the baseline data and
revisions were made to the design and data collection to address this problem. A side benefit of
these revision was that the MoET, specifically the Teacher Services Unit, was included in the data
collection exercise in the subsequent design of impact evaluation, and in the process enhanced
their M&E capacity. Furthermore, MoET trained newly recruited District Resource Teachers to
conduct the data collection. According to the DRT’s feedback, this built their capacity to undertake
field research to inform their future work at the school level.

                                                10
34.     Restructuring 2 simplified the RFW. The objective behind restructuring the RWF was to
simplify data collection process and reporting and strengthening the link between the Project’s
intermediate indicators, key PDO level indicators and the PDO itself. Three PDO level indicators
were dropped and two PDO level indicators were revised under this simplification of the RFW.
As the revision of the RF was undertaken late (five months before project closing in April 2015)
the targets were revised after most of them had already been achieved which explains why many
of the project outputs so perfectly match the targets set.

35.    Implementation: An M&E consultant was hired after the first restructuring to enhance the
technical capacity of the MoET to improve performance in this area. In addition, the World Bank
also increased their technical support on M&E to increase the MoET’s understanding of the
importance of strong M&E framework to improve project performance.

36.     After the first restructuring, a special provision was also made to undertake an intensive
M&E of the civil works through the additional hiring of five supervisors in the EFU who were
tasked to monitor each school construction site bi-monthly. This played a critical part in meeting
the revised school classroom construction targets by the end of the project.

37.     Subsequent to Restructuring 1 when project activities picked up, reporting on the PDO
level indicators and intermediate indicators improved and the challenges in reporting on the
indicators became evident leading to a second restructuring to simplify the results framework.

38.     Utilization: Active monitoring and its use in supervision of the construction activities
under Component 1 were critical in ensuring timely completion of activities. Bi-monthly
monitoring of construction sites with the use of the helicopters and the additional five vehicles
purchased for this task, allowed the construction supervisor to ensure more timely completion
despite the non-performance and termination of the supervision firm.

39.     The Impact Evaluation of the teacher incentive program is providing key lessons for
teacher performance management which are being used to inform the design of the follow on
Project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
40.      Safeguards: Before Restructuring 1, there was limited capacity in the MoET to undertake
activities around safeguards and there was little understanding in the MoET of what was required
to complete the World Bank’s safeguards requirements. Certain activities had been undertaken by
the MoET such as community stakeholder engagement on civil works and soil erosion assessments
but they were not systematic or adequately recorded. Until the MTR there were no ratings offered
for safeguard in the ISR. Post MTR, the new World Bank team took corrective measures to resolve
previous lapses to bring the project in line with World Bank guidelines. The following actions
were taken: an engineering firm was hired to undertake an environmental and social audit of all
civil works sites under Phase 1 and 2 and remedial safeguards actions were identified. The MoET
undertook and completed the remedial works as identified, and ensured that any accompanying
social corrective actions were also implemented, and finalized the documentation of social
safeguards to IDA’s satisfaction.

                                               11
41.     Fiduciary: The new implementation arrangements put in place for the project at appraisal
posed several challenges on the fiduciary front. The Project Support and Coordination Unit had
been disbanded and implementation and tasks handled by project implementation unit in the past
such as financial management, procurement and monitoring and evaluation for specific projects
were mainstreamed into the MoET itself. Turnover was high and over the course of the project
more than four different teams from the MoET Procurement Unit were assigned to the project.
Each team only had basic procurement experience and required continuous handholding and
extensive capacity building. Between 2010 and 2013, the Procurement Unit was usually under
staffed and mostly operated without a Procurement Manager. Only in 2013 was the MoET able to
hire a procurement consultant to support its Procurement Unit and this arrangement led to a
significant turnaround in the disbursement rate.

42.     At Appraisal, the Project proposed the use of district tender panels to decentralize the
procurement close to challenging geographical locations and to use smaller procurement lots for
school construction in order to encourage competition. Most district tender panels had little
experience in procurement and some had never met to review / approve any procurements. The
use of small procurement lots led to a wider market for contractors but didn’t necessarily reduce
the cost and delivery time of the construction or improve the quality of construction. For these
reasons, the use of district tender panels and use of smaller procurement lots was discontinued in
2013.

43.     MoET Education Facilities Unit which is charged with the management of infrastructure
was mostly understaffed and without leadership for prolonged periods. This led to the failure to
timely hire a supervision firm to support EFU. When a supervision firm was eventually hired, the
contract was terminated for poor performance. The initial implementation arrangements of the
BEP without a designated project implementation unit stretched MoET’s project and contract
management capacity due to understaffing of key implementing MoET departments amid other
capacity constraints. Once the MoET and IDA agreed on hybrid implementation arrangements,
i.e. a small, but full time project coordination unit integrated into the MoET and reporting to the
Director of Planning with a full time project coordinator and technical support on fiduciary, civil
works and M&E implementation progress improved.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
44.     Although the BEP made considerable gains in ensuring improved access to quality
education in Lesotho, challenges remain in ensuring all students complete high quality primary
education and transition to higher levels of education to contribute to Lesotho’s economic growth
and address its social challenges. Enrolment in grade 1 in the country is close to universal,
however survival, although improving, is still low. In order to achieve universal primary
completion and improve transition to junior secondary, efforts to reduce drop out, especially for
the most disadvantaged students, are essential. It will thus be important to focus on the schools
and groups most at risk, identified as remote rural schools and boys from lowest socio-economic
quintile respectively.

45.   To address these remaining challenges, the GoL has requested a credit in the amount of
US$ 25 million for follow-on support to the education sector with the overarching objectives of

                                                12
improving completion of quality primary education, enhancing access to lower secondary
education and improving the quality of education. The Bank has agreed on a concept and main
objectives of the follow-on support with the government which have been endorsed by both the
Bank and the GoL.

46.    Several activities conducted under the GPE financed Project are contributing to the design
not only of the Bank’s follow-on support to Lesotho’s education sector but also the Government’s
own strategy development for the medium term4. A pilot evaluation of early grade literacy and
numeracy recently completed with the Project’s support will serve as a baseline for later
evaluations of learning quality. An analysis of the data from the teacher incentives scheme has
commenced and will be completed under the successor project. A Teacher Qualifications
Framework study is helping to improve the current 2009 Teacher Salary structure and inform the
next Education Sector Plan regarding teacher qualifications and remuneration.

47.     The successor project proposes to utilize the implementation arrangements established
under the GPE financed Project. It will focus on further enhancing the capacity of the MoET for
sector planning, implementation and monitoring.

48.    Continued support to the country to strengthen the education sector will be critical for the
country to achieve its goals. There is strong momentum for transitional changes in the sector
which can help boost the achievement of results. Currently, the Bank is the only major partner of
the Government to support education sector development. It will be important to increase the scale
and scope of interventions to overcome the challenges described above.

    3. Assessment of Outcomes  
49.     This ICR employs a split methodology for evaluating Project performance. Given the
significant changes introduced at the time of the first restructuring and the stark difference in
project performance before and after this restructuring, the ICR team has assessed and rated
performance for these two phases separately with an overall rating capturing achievement of
objectives at the end of the Project.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
50.    The Project’s relevance is rated substantial in all phases given that the Project’s objectives
and design remain relevant today. There were weaknesses in the design of the implementation
arrangements at appraisal but these were effectively identified and modified at the MTR stage to
enable the Project to achieve its objectives.

51.      Lesotho’s National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2012-2017 continues to place
emphasis on human capital development as being central to the country’s growth and economic
transformation. In the aforementioned document Pillar III focuses on Enhance the skill base,
technology adoption and foundation for innovation. One key set of strategic objectives under this
pillar relates to “improve the foundation for skills development through improvement of access,

4
    A new Medium Term Education Sector Plan 2015-2020 is currently in the early stages of development.


                                                        13
quality of education and infrastructure, including ICT literacy.” Specifically, this strategic
objective highlights the following items: (i) Develop ECCD Policy and establish a multi-sectoral
approach to ECCD; (ii) Fast-track construction and/or rehabilitation of schools and classrooms in
areas with inadequate school infrastructure; and (iii) Strengthen curriculum, train and deploy
qualified teachers at primary, secondary and high school level to improve competencies of
learners, and reduce wastage (drop-out and repetition) especially in Lesotho. Project activities
focused on all the above mentioned areas as reflected in the PDO.

52.    The current Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2015-2020 is under preparation and a
key CPF pathway is strengthening individual and group assets. A central element of strengthening
individual assets is by improving education outcomes—specifically by raising and aligning skills.
Similarly the Lesotho Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCD) also places emphasis on the critical
needs of the education sector and the challenge that despite high levels of spending in education
(20% of the overall budget), education outcomes continue to be poor. The SCD emphasizes that
human development is essential for individual well-being and contributes significantly to ensuring
the sustainability of economic gains. Further the SCD, in its push for a new growth model,
emphasizes the critical role of improved human capital to enhance the productivity of firms in
Lesotho.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
53.     Overall efficacy for the project is rated as substantial despite the early challenges that
faced the project. In the first phase efficacy was Modest but it improved substantially post-MTR.
The impact of the project can be seen at the school-level, in particular at schools in very remote or
mountainous areas. Students and teachers in all primary schools are using just under a million new
textbooks, teachers’ guides, and assessment materials based on a new simplified curriculum
focused on early grade reading and math. Field visits have confirmed schools are using the next
textbooks and anecdotal feedback from primary school teachers is very positive on the new
curricula and textbooks. A pilot assessment of early grade literacy and numeracy was recently
completed to serve as a baseline for later evaluations of quality of learning. 140 pre-primary
reception classes were established and supported by the project, doubling the availability
nationwide and allowing 3,682 children the opportunity for quality early childhood development
in preparation for primary school. Since the start of 2015, these reception classes have been fully
absorbed by the MoET budget, indicating sustainability beyond the project.

54.     The teacher incentives scheme to retain qualified teachers in remote areas and improve the
qualifications of under-qualified teachers also appears to contribute to improving the learning
environment. Principals and teachers at remote schools have noted that the incentive scheme has
made their school a more attractive place to work, although there is a risk of attrition with the close
of the incentive scheme in November 2014. The results several studies financed by the project will
continue to support the MoET in future strategic planning. For example, the forthcoming results
of an impact evaluation on the teacher incentives scheme as well as a Teacher Qualifications
Framework study will help to inform the next Education Sector Plan. As school construction is
now complete in all project schools, overcrowded classes are relocated into weather resistant new
classroom blocks with new classroom furniture significantly improving the learning environment
of these schools.



                                                  14
55.     The following paragraphs provide an assessment of achievement of the three stated
objectives of the Project to: (i) provide improved facilities at existing primary schools; (ii) support
and contribute to expand access to pre-primary education; and (iii) and support improvement in
quality of teaching.

PDO 1: Improve School Facilities at Existing Primary Schools

56.     The Project aimed to improve the physical quality of primary schools through classroom
and latrine construction in existing schools that did not have sufficient or adequate quality
classroom facilities that could be used year-round, i.e. even during the rainy season and in winter.
All newly constructed classrooms were equipped with desks and benches. The Project exceeded
its revised target of 135 classrooms by 8 classrooms and increased the number of schools who
benefited (from 18 to 30). It also exceeded the revised target for construction of toilet blocks. This
component faced challenges (see Section 2.2), and the target for construction of classrooms was
reduced to 135 in a total of 18 schools, compared to the original target. At project approval, 330
classrooms were to be built in 64 schools. This activity promoted achievement of the objective of
improving the school environment/facilities. Although the number of classrooms built was lower
than initially expected, the number of beneficiaries for the whole project benefitting from the
revised scope was higher than the approved targets for the Project. This was because the funds
saved from school constructions were spent in Component 3, specifically for textbooks for all
students in Grades 1-4, and increased training. Hence, the total number of project beneficiaries
exceed the original targets, despite the challenges of classroom construction in the remote rural
areas.

57.     Classroom construction under the project also likely contributed to increased school
operating and learning time for the children enrolled. Schools without buildings or in structures
that cannot withstand rain and the winter are unlikely to operate for the entire school year, leading
to loss in learning time. Visits to the targeted schools during showed that classrooms were not
allocated for all grades and despite sharing classrooms between multiple grades, some classes had
to operate in open air or very inadequate structures. Since most of the project-funded schools were
completed in 2011, the project likely contributed to reducing the above share of open air
classrooms, thus increasing the amount of students’ instruction time throughout the school year.

58.     The project activities constitute a good practice package that has been demonstrated from
international experience to improve access to education. The EMIS school-level data reveals that
enrollment has started to increase in the targeted 30 schools5 where 143 additional classrooms were
built under the project. The number of pupils has been trending upwards from 5,834 in 2013 to
5,948 in 2014 in schools benefiting from new classrooms and latrine construction. This is contrary
to the enrollment trends in other primary schools, which did not benefit from school construction
under this project. Indeed, the enrollment in non-target schools has decreased over the last five
years in the country (on average declining 1.3 percent annually between 2009 and 2014), whereas
the annual growth rate of school-age population is estimated to have grown 1.3 percent (UN

outcomes the Project.

PDO 2: Contribute to Expand Access to Pre-primary Education

59.     The project objective of supporting expansion of access to pre-primary education was
achieved. In addition to the government’s own support of reception classes, the project supported
an additional 140 pre-primary reception classes, doubling the availability for early childhood
development in preparation for primary school and helping reduce grade 1 repetition Specifically,
the project funded a package of interventions for these reception classes, i.e. appropriate learning
and play materials for small children, support to the caregivers and cooks, and food stuff. By
Project closing, both the original and revised targets (3,600 and 3,220 children enrolled in
preprimary reception classes) was surpassed with an enrolment of 3,682 students in reception
classes. The Project financed approximately 60 percent of all students enrolled in reception classes
in 2014.

60.      At the time of Project appraisal, Lesotho’s repetition rate in Grade 1 was one of the highest
in the region (in June 2010) at 19 percent. In 2014, the repetition rate had been reduced to 9 percent
largely due to the government’s policy of limiting repetition in the primary cycle. However, it is
likely some improvements in the decline in repetition rate can be attributed to the introduction of
reception classes. Global evidence shows that pre-primary education can have a substantial impact
on success at the primary level and beyond (World Bank, STEPs). Increased access to pre-primary
education supported by the Project is likely to have contributed significantly to this outcome. At
the time of Project appraisal, repetition rate for grade 1 was included as an indicator for the quality
of teaching. This indicator was later dropped It is important to note that at the time the indicator
was dropped in 2014, the Project end target of 23 percent had been achieved.

61.     The decision by the GoL to continue to support these additional 140 reception classes with
the potential space of 3,220 pre-primary students each year is likely to have a sustainable impact
on a number of children entering pre-primary in Lesotho and in the longer term, their economic
well-being.

PDO 3: Support improvement in quality of teaching

62.    The Project aimed to achieve its higher level objective of improved student learning
through improving the quality of teachers and thus teaching. In terms of achieving its stated goal
of improvement in quality of teaching, the Project made significant gains. The pupil to qualified
teacher ratio improved from 59:1 in 2010 to 45:1 at project closing in 2015.

63.    Survival rate can be used as a proxy indicator for measuring outcomes of the interventions
implemented under the Project to improve quality of teaching. In 2014, 65 percent of children
were still in school by the end of primary school (Grade 7), up from 41 percent in 20066, a
considerable increase. Data on promotion and drop-out rates for 2001 and 2012 indicate that these

  Cohort survival rate as reported in EMIS 2014. 41 percent refers to the cohort that started Grade 1 in 2000 and
completed primary in 2006.


                                                         16
improvements are paralleled in drop-out rates and promotion rates. Promotion rates have improved
across all grades and particularly strongly in certain grades (for example grade 2 and grade 3.)

64.     Given that lagging schools (mostly in remote, rural areas of the country) faced more acute
challenges in maintaining teaching quality, the BEP aimed to attract and retain qualified teachers
at these ‘difficult’ schools to raise outcomes. Achievements in this area were considerable with
nearly 1,100 teachers receiving incentives for serving at challenging locations.

3.3 Efficiency
65.     Overall efficiency of the Project was Modest. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted in
order to examine the returns of the Project in terms of improved completion rates and learning
outcomes due to the activities of the project. The analysis estimates a Net Present Value
approximately of US$ 5.4 million, corresponding to an estimated internal rate of return (IRR) of
11.3 percent. However, this return is an underestimation, as the calculations only account for two
streams of benefits, which are from classroom construction and textbooks distribution. The
benefits from the expansion of pre-primary reception classes are not calculated and neither is the
benefit stream of improved quality of teachers and its impact on learning outcomes of students.
Both these benefit streams were difficult to measure due to insufficient data.7

Cost Effectiveness Analysis for School Classroom Construction
66.     A cost-effectiveness analysis for classroom construction was carried out for the ICR.
Although data was limited, the team was able to make a comparison with four other
projects/programs with similar activities implemented in Lesotho (details in Annex 3). Compared
to 2 contracts from 2 other MoET’s managed projects financed by the Government and Ireland
Aid respectively, the unit cost performance of BEP was either better or consistent. Compared to
similar constructions by an NGO, World Vision (670 US$/m2 in 2014), the performance of BEP
(555 US$/m2 in 2014) was cost-efficient given that construction by World Vision was 15% more
expensive. Compared with construction under a project financed by another bilateral donor, JICA,
costs were slightly higher. The average unit cost of the JICA-financed classrooms in 2011 is 401
US$/m2 (value actualized 2014) in the Districts of Leribe and Berea. In the same district of Leribe,
the unit cost of classroom by BEP in 2014 was 420 US/m2. However, the difference at only 5%,
which is not substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
67.     Rating: The table below summarizes the overall outcome rating for the project for the
different phases before each restructuring and before project closing. The combined Overall
Outcome Rating for the Project is Moderately Satisfactory.

  Data related to pre-primary school is not available in the Lesotho Skills and Employment Survey in 2011. An
estimation of the impact of pre-primary school on wage is in that case not possible, and neither is the estimation of
an eventual impact of pre-primary school on the cognitive skills of students. The final data on the impact of the
incentive scheme for teachers is also not available.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
68.     Investment in school infrastructure combined with the teacher incentive pilot aimed to
improve educational attainment through a better classroom environment. The evidence for
Lesotho is clear that each additional year of schooling results in an additional return of 5. 6 percent.
In total 143 classrooms were built in remote areas which in a given year provides better school
infrastructure for 6100 students. Evidence on qualified teacher to pupil ratios shows a significant
improvement. Both factors will contribute to create a better school environment, better educational
attainment and in the longer run better returns to education, positively impacting poverty. The
project also successfully met its gender targets. The project exceed the percentage of female
teachers who were targeted (77 % vs 60%) via but slightly short of the target for female student
beneficiaries for the project (49% vs 50%).

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening
69.     Recentralizing procurement for civil works: The decision to recentralize procurement post
the MTR led to the development of additional technical capacity in the EFU, procurement and
contract management in the MoET. Institutionally, realigning roles and responsibilities at the
MoET and enhancing EFU’s authority and holding them to greater accountability has been critical
to better delivery on civil works.

70.    Monitoring and Evaluation: M&E has been enhanced in two key areas: 1) M&E of civil
works progress which has happened because of the hiring of five construction supervisors at the
EFU with the specific task of undertaking M&E on school construction only; and 2) Enhanced
capacity to undertake M&E because of the training provided to the Teachers Services Unit to
support the impact evaluation data collection process.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

71.     A Beneficiary Survey was administered to key stakeholders involved in the project. The
results are presented in Annex 5.

 4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome  
Rating: Significant
72.     With respect to the first intended outcome of improved physical environment of schools,
the restructuring half way through Project implementation and extension of the Project period
ensured that the revised targets were fully completed. Funds were shifted to provision of textbooks
which were provided on time and contributed to improvement of the school learning environment.
Lessons learned during the early phase of implementation were proactively included in revisions
to implementation modalities (centralization of procurement). Through the experience of the
Project, the Ministry has increasingly gained capacity to better manage and supervise contractors.
Progress in Phase 2 of school construction was more consistent. Contract management was more
rigorous and well-enforced, quality of construction was better, and supervision and maintaining
information systems more timely. This points to residual capacity in the Ministry which will also
have an impact on future construction undertaken by the Ministry. A database on contractor
performance has been created through this project for future reference as well as used by other
ministries which reduces the risk of low quality, inefficient construction activities going forward.
An environmental and social audit firm completed visits to all civil works sites, and made
recommendations for minor remedial works at most of the sites which have been completed
ensuring safe buildings. For the remaining works, the Government has taken over financing
responsibilities to ensure all works are completed. This hints towards strong ownership of project
activities and a commitment to provision of a good learning environment to Lesotho’s students.

73.     The risk to the second development outcome of provision of pre-primary education to
children is low. Expenses related to continuation of classes established under the Project have
been incorporated in the MoET budget since the beginning of 2015. This activity is fully owned
by the Government of Lesotho. In fact, the Government developed and approved a policy for
Integrated Early Childhood Care and Development (IECCD) highlighting the GOL’s continued
prioritization to early childhood care and development in 2014.

74.     On improvement of teaching quality, the risk to retention of qualified teachers in ‘difficult’
schools is High. The teacher incentives scheme, was a pilot scheme, to retain qualified teachers
in remote areas and improve the qualifications of under-qualified teachers met the intended targets.
Principals and teachers at remote schools have noted that the incentive scheme has made their
school a more attractive place to work. However, it is likely there will be attrition with the close
of the incentive scheme in November 2014. Nevertheless, the early results indicate that the pilot
was successful in improving the qualification of teachers in remote areas as reflected in the
improved qualified teacher to pupil ratio. It is possible that the GoL may consider returning to this
policy intervention once the finalized results of the impact evaluation are complete.

                                                 19
75.      The overall operating environment of the country remains fragile. Although elections took
place successfully and the new coalition government is in place, the security issues are not yet
resolved. At the same time, although there have been improvements in the capacity of the MoET,
issues related to understaffing, weak technical, project management, M&E and fiduciary capacity
put the development and implementation of a sector strategy based on the lessons of this operation
at risk.

76.     The Government’s continued focus on development of the sector demonstrated by its
request for support from the Bank under the Lesotho Education Quality for Equality Project
currently under development, to mitigate some risks. However the GoL’s macro-fiscal position
continues to remain critical and this potentially can impact continued service delivery in the sector
and sustainability of results achieved by the project. Expenditure on education as a percent of
GDP has been trending downwards from about 10.6% in 2009 to 8.4% in 2013. Concessional
lending and grants from development partners are critical for sustainability in the education sector
and a key partner in education in Lesotho, Irish Aid is no longer active in Lesotho. The Bank’s
continued engagement, particularly the new upcoming project, will ensure that outcomes achieved
under the Project are maintained and lessons learned incorporated to the extent possible for
improved performance. On balance, however, the overall risk to development outcomes is rated
Significant.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance  
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
77.     The development objective framed for the Project and the activities designed to support the
achievement of the PDO were both relevant for improvement in Lesotho’s education sector
outcomes. A QER was held in July 2009 and these recommendations were reflected in the project’s
final design. However, there were several weaknesses in the design of the implementing
arrangements and the results framework that was developed to track progress toward achievement
of the PDO. Risks given the proposed implementing arrangements were not adequately identified
and there were weaknesses in ensuring adequate measures were in place to overcome some
anticipated implementation challenges. The targets set under Component 1 were ambitious,
particularly given Lesotho’s previous capacity to deliver on civil works. This was flagged in the
GPE’s external quality review (EQR) held in October of 2009. On the whole, the rating of the
Bank in ensuring quality at entry is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
78.     The team was highly proactive in learning from implementation bottlenecks during the first
phase of implementation and turning around the performance of the Project by taking necessary
actions and restructuring the Project to reflect operational challenges. The team enhanced their
supervision of the project post Restructuring 1, particularly the number of missions undertaken
and also regularized weekly video conferences with the MoET to ensure timely implementation of
the project.


                                                 20
79.     Team composition was updated frequently to provide high quality implementation support
to the client. A social and environmental audit was also conducted for the construction undertaken
under the Project and the remedial actions identified tracked carefully by the team to ensure
compliance. The team’s performance in a challenging operational environment was exemplary,
especially after the midterm review.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
80.     Although the Bank’s support to the client in achieving the objectives of the Project was
satisfactory during implementation of the Project, the gaps at quality at entry, specifically on
defining a results framework warrant an overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
81.     The Government of Lesotho demonstrated a high level of commitment to achieving the
objectives of the Project especially after the early challenges before MTR. After the MTR,
commitment was high and evident from the: (i) policy to institutionalize and expand early
childhood care and development; (ii) providing adequate provisions in the MoET budget for
continued operation of the reception classes established under the Project; (iii) taking
responsibility for the provision of a high quality learning environment for its students through
adequate provision of resources to the Implementing Agency for completing the remaining (minor)
works to address environmental issues related to the construction under the Project; and (iv)
providing support for implementation of politically difficult reforms such as incentives to teachers
to serve in ‘difficult’ areas so the lagging regions of the country receive quality education.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
82.     The performance of the Implementing Agency (IA) was mixed. The implementing
arrangements for the Project had changed significantly from the preceding project in the sector
with the disbanding of an implementation unit and mainstreaming of the responsibility for
implementation of Project activities with the line ministry. In the initial years of Project
implementation, it is evident that the IA did not have capacity to implement the activities agreed
under the Project, especially as they related to civil works. Its capacity for managing procurement
and overseeing implementation at the district level was especially weak. At the same time, it was
also slow in taking adequate measures to enhance its capacity. There was a turnaround after
Restructuring 1 and the Ministry was able to improve performance significantly, also due to
significant commitment of and monitoring by MoET management. This improvement post MTR
was significant particularly at the highest level. On the whole, performance of the IA was
Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
83.     Although performance of the IA in the first phase of the Project was weak and the pace at
which it filled the identified gaps to achieve project goals was slow resulting in a delay of over
two years in completion of Project activities, especially as they related to construction activities,

                                                 21
performance in other aspects, specifically establishment of reception classes was satisfactory. It
was also able to improve performance significantly in the second phase with support from the
Bank team to successfully achieve the revised scope of Project activities. On balance, the overall
performance of the Borrower is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned  
84.     This Project presents the case of significant turnaround in performance and outcomes in
the face of numerous operational challenges. The experiences of the Project provide rich examples
of the approach both the Bank and the client can adopt to diagnose and resolve issues in a proactive
manner. A few key important lessons learned from the experience of the Project are as follows:

   Intensive preparation and support when introducing innovation: Innovative institutional
    changes are essential, however, they require more intensive analysis at the preparation stage,
    especially in areas of procurement and financial management. Risks need to be identified and
    adequate mitigating measures put in place before innovations in implementation modalities are
    pursued. Where necessary, a phased approach should be planned which ensures lessons learnt
    are quickly and easily incorporated.

   Building trust with the Government: Extra effort and close collaboration with the client in a
    high stress situation (such as one with a fraud investigation) can strengthen partnership and
    positively impact project implementation to achieve outcomes.

   Background analysis: Institutional Assessments to gauge the capacity of not just the
    Implementing Agency but all involved players in implementation of Project activities is critical
    to assessing the realism of project targets.

   Construction: A centralized procurement strategy for peripheral civil works, although counter-
    intuitive, was more effective as it consolidated small and scattered bids, resulting in all
    classrooms and latrines at one school being adequately managed in one lot for procurement.

   Creating an enabling environment for the Implementing Agency: Mid-course corrections,
    when done using strong evidence that align the scope of project activities and targets with IA
    capacity are critical once implementation challenges become visible and is a strong
    justification for changing the course of a project.

   Bank’s role in project success: The Bank can play an important role in turning around project
    performance through intensive and proactive support when the situation requires.

   A dedicated project implementation unit is critical in countries with low capacity: The
    projects implementation experience from the project indicates that mainstreaming PIU
    activities is challenging when an implementing agency is weak and there continues to be a
    need for a dedicated project staff or project implementation unit.

                           Annex 2. Outputs by Component 
85.      The PDO of the project: According to the Catalytic Fund Grant Agreement (henceforth
“grant agreement”) the Project Development Objective (PDO) was to: (i) provide improved
facilities at existing primary schools; (ii) support and contribute to expand access to pre-primary
education; and (iii) support improvements in the quality of teaching in the Recipient’s territory.
The PDO as described in the PAD is similar and states to “provide improved facilities at existing
primary schools, support and contribute to expand access to pre-primary education, and support
improvement in quality of teaching.” There was a total of seven PDO indicators, and ten
intermediate indicators at Appraisal. At Restructuring 2 the original RFW was simplified and
three PDO indicators were dropped and two PDO indicators were revised and strengthened. The
PDO indicators and accompanying intermediate indicators were structured so that each of the
indicators was directly aligned with each PDO sub-objective -- improved facilities at existing
primary schools; support and contribute to expand access to pre-primary education; and support
improvement in quality of teaching—and the associated component for ease of monitoring. The
weakness of the original results framework (RFW) was that many of the PDO indicators were
poorly defined and it was unclear what was being measured.

86.     The PDO was not revised during the project lifetime. However, under Restructuring 1
some of the PDO indicator targets were revised in alignment with the capacity of the MoET. Under
Restructuring 2, the RFW was simplified to facilitate monitoring. The objective was to simplify
data collection process and reporting and strengthening the link between the Project’s intermediate
indicators, key PDO indicators and the PDO. Three PDO indicators were dropped and two PDO
indicators were revised under this simplification of the RFW. The project consisted of three
components with a total project costs of $20,000,000. There was no changes in the agreed
components during the project life but the scope of the project components were changed over the
project lifetime as discussed in greater detail below.

Component 1: Improve the quality of primary school infrastructure (At Appraisal US$ 9.1
million).

87.      The goal of this component in line with the PDO’s first sub-objective was to provide
improved facilities at primary schools. At Appraisal, this component was to provide
approximately 330 additional, fully furnished, primary gender and disability friendly classrooms
at existing schools, along with approximately 100 toilet blocks. Construction was to be developed
using a new approach, using smaller contractors, de-concentrated procurement and subcontracting
of technical supervision of civil works and the approach was expected to speed up the pace of
construction and reduce costs. At Restructuring 1, the target was revised and lowered to
completing 135 classrooms and 87 toilet blocks. Also the new approach to doing school
construction was revised, and construction was again centralized with a focus on class A and B
contractors rather than class C contractors (as in the PAD) to undertake the work.

88.      Achievement of Component 1 Indicators: The project successful met the PDO indicator
revised at Restructuring 1 - Number of additional classrooms built by the project (total number).
The revised target set at Restructuring 1 was 135 classrooms in 18 schools. By project closing a
total of 143 classrooms had been built and the target set was exceeded by 8 additional classrooms
built in an additional 12 schools (in a total of 30 schools). The project achieved 105 percent of the
revised PDO indicator target at Restructuring 1 and 42 percent of the original target set at
Appraisal. In parallel, the project also met the intermediate indicator—classrooms furnished
(number)—and the project also furnished 8 additional classrooms. Also, the project successfully
met and exceeded the target set for the intermediate indicator-Toilet blocks constructed (number).
The revised target set at Restructuring 1 was 87 latrine blocks. At project closing, 93 latrine toilet
blocks had been built. The project also exceeded the revised indicator target by 6 additional
latrines. The project achieved 106 percent of the revised target at Restructuring 1 and 93 percent
of the original target set at appraisal.


Component 2: Support and contribution to the expansion of pre-primary education (Pooled
Fund: US$ 2.0 million; FTI CF: US$ 1.5 million).


89.     This component supported the government’s objective to maintain and expand access to
reception classes especially for the poorest children, through provision of care givers, learning
materials, and catering services. At Appraisal the objective was to extend these services to
approximately 100 existing and approximately 20 additional reception classes, with a capacity of
approximately reaching 3,600 children. This expansion would support the continued inclusion of
an estimated 5.2 percent of the age five population in reception classes over the duration of the
project. At Restructuring 1, this was extended to an additional 20 reception classes bringing the
number of reception classrooms supported to 140.

90.     Achievement of Component 2 Indicators: The PDO Indicator - Target enrolment in
reception class – was set at 3,600 students at Appraisal and revised to 3,220 at Restructuring 2. At
Project closing, enrolment in reception class exceeded the revised target set in Restructuring 2 by
380 students and the Appraisal PDO indicator target was exceeded by 82 children. The Project
achieved 114 percent of the revised target and 102 percent of the target set at Appraisal. The
revised intermediate target-supporting reception classrooms was also met. At Appraisal the target

                                                28
was to support 120 reception classrooms and this was revised at Restructuring 1 to 140. This target
was met early in the project. The project achieved 100 percent of the revised target at Restructuring
1 and 116 percent of the original target set at Appraisal.

Component 3: Contribution to improvements in quality of teaching (Pooled Fund: US$ 10.6
million; FTI CF: US$ 7.8 million)


91.     The goal of this component in line with the PDO’s third sub-objective was improvements
in the quality of teaching in the Recipient’s territory. There are three sub-component in this
component: Sub-Component 3.1 on Qualified teachers in ‘difficult’ schools schemes; Sub-
Component 3.2 on Improving literacy and numeracy teaching in the early grades and Sub-
Component 3.3 Provide textbooks in core subjects and grades in primary schools. At Appraisal
under Sub-Component 3.1 two types of incentives were offered to teachers to ensure retention in
“difficult“ areas; monetary incentive was offered and a bursary incentive was offered to upgrade
skills of unqualified teachers located in difficult areas. In total 1,600 teachers were to be offered
incentives (800 target for the monetary incentive and 800 for the bursary incentive) in 400 remote
schools. At Restructuring 1, the number offered the monetary incentive was increased to a 1,000,
and the number offered the bursary decreased to 600 and all in 540 remote schools.

92.     At Appraisal under Sub-Component 3.2 a number of activities were flagged including
training of teachers and preparation and provision of teaching materials to support improved
teaching of literacy and numeracy in primary schools; review of literacy and numeracy material in
use; development and reproduction of updated and localized teaching materials for grades 1-3;
training of 4,500 teachers in improved methods for literacy and numeracy teaching and an early
grade reading assessment. At Restructuring 1, the number of teachers to be trained on improved
methods was increased from 4,500 to 6,515; the additional development and reproduction of
updated and localized teaching materials for grade 4 was included; and also the development of
textbooks for new grades 1-3 curricula based on the curricula and assessment materials developed
under this sub-component was included. A number of studies were also included in this sub-
component at Appraisal. This included: (i) establishing a baseline data on teaching and learning
and (ii) impact evaluation of the scheme to attract and/or retain qualified teachers in remote and/or
difficult to access schools. At Restructuring 1 a number of additional items were added including
the development of the teacher’s qualification framework, an evaluation of the Distance Teacher
Education Program (DTEP) as well as other analyses which may inform the development of
materials for formative assessment and support of the development of the teacher performance
system.

93.     The final, Sub-Component 3.3, focuses on the provision of textbooks in core subjects and
grades in primary schools. At Appraisal 13,300 core-subject textbooks were to be provided across
deficit core subjects. However, at Restructuring 1, the developed curricula and assessment for
developed for grades 1-3 under component 3.2 was published as textbook for up to 913,000 units.

94.     Achievement of Component 3 Indicators: The PDO Indicator for Component 3 is pupil
teacher ratio added at Restructuring 2 and the target set at 45 to 1. At Appraisal, the baseline ratio
was 59 to 1. At project closing the pupil teacher ratio target was achieved but not necessarily
directly due to the project, but because of a government policy to eliminate repetition in
classrooms.

95.     Under Sub-Component 3.1 there are two intermediate indicators linked to the incentives
schemes for teachers in “difficult” schools -- Teachers in ‘difficult’ schools targeted by the project
receiving a grant (number) and Teachers in ‘difficult’ schools targeted by the project enrolled in
training programs (number). The project outperformed on the first and underperformed on the
second. The project revised the intermediate target for grants for teachers in “difficult” school in
Restructuring 1 to 1,000. By project closing, the number of teachers who received the grant
equalled 1,096 and the target of a 1,000 was exceeded by an additional 96 qualified teachers. The
project revised the intermediate target for bursary for teachers in ‘difficult’ school in Restructuring
1 to 600. By project closing, the number of teachers who received the bursary was 380, 220 below
the target of 600. The inability to meet this target was external to the project, as the bursary
supported teachers in the DTEP, which was discontinued by the Government in 2014. Another
intermediate indicator for sub-component 3.1 is teachers, principals, DRTs, and inspectors targeted
by the project that were trained in teaching methods adapted to the new curriculum Grades 1-3.
The original target at appraisal was set at 4,500 and this was revised in Restructuring 1 to 6,515.
At project closing, the project had exceeded this target for Grades 1-3 by 4,643.

based on the new curriculum and assessment tools developed under the project. By project closing
the total number of books purchased equaled 1,100,000 and the number distributed equaled
928,276. These numbers exceeded the revised targets set in Restructuring 1. For the number of
textbooks purchased the number achieved exceeded the target by 187,000 and the number
distributed exceeded the target by 15,276. The project also achieved the target of setting up a
learning assessment tool.

97.     The principal benefits expected from the project are improved facilities at existing primary
schools, support and contribute to expand access to pre-primary education and support
improvements in quality of teaching. Together these activities are aimed at improving retention
and the quality of education. The Project development objectives were pursued through a number
of activities including building classrooms in remote areas, supporting pre-primary classrooms, in-
service teacher training aimed at improving literacy and numeracy teaching, upgrading the
qualifications of teachers working in difficult schools and strengthened teaching incentives to
remain in remote areas, and through providing textbooks in core subjects for grades 1 to 4. Section
1 examine evidence on internal and external efficiency; Section 2 undertakes a cost-benefit
analysis of the project; and Section 3 examines issues of fiscal sustainability.

1. Internal efficiency

98.    Overall internal efficiency is improving in the primary education sector. Repetition rates
have been trending downwards since 2005 but have been consistently falling since 2010. Data on
promotion and drop-out rates for 2001 and 2012 indicate that these improvements are paralleled
in drop-out rates and promotion rates. Similarly, between 2011 and 2014 the period that overlaps
with the project, there are similar improvements. Promotion rates have improved across all grades
and particularly strong in certain grades (for example grade 2 and grade 3. The drop-out rates are
broadly trending downwards.

99.     The EMIS school-level data reveals that enrollment has started to increase in the targeted
schools9 of 30 where 143 additional classrooms were built under the project. The number of pupils
has been trending upwards from 5,834 in 2013 to 5,948 in 2014 in schools benefiting from new
classrooms and latrine construction. This is contrary to the enrollment trends in other primary
schools in Lesotho which did not benefit from school construction under this project. Indeed, the
enrollment in non-target schools has decreased over the last five years in the country (on average
declining 1.3 percent annually between 2009 and 2014), whereas the annual growth rate of school-
age population is estimated to have grown 1.3 percent (UN Population projection 2009 to 2014).

100. Turning to the improvements in quality of teaching, the national average ratio of primary
school pupils per qualified primary school teacher has declined from 59:1 in 2009 to 45:1 in 2014.
As part of the project, and in order to improve the qualification level of the teaching force in
schools located in remote schools, a teacher incentive scheme was introduced in the project with
two components. The first is a monetary incentive paid out monthly to teachers (for up to three
years) to newly qualified teachers who accepted positions in difficult or remote schools. The
second is a bursary offered to unqualified teachers already teaching in one of the targeted remote
schools, allowing them to upgrade their qualifications by completing a teaching degree offered by
the Distance Teacher Education Program (DTEP). In the 540 difficult schools targeted by the
project the improvement in pupil-teacher ratios seems significant. The pupil teacher ratio that does
not distinguish between qualified and non-qualified teachers is 37:1 at the onset of the introduction
of the incentive scheme in the difficult schools. By 2014 it was 33:1. However, the pupil to
qualified teacher ratio has improved significantly more from 93:1 in 2011 to 54:1 in 2014. This is
a key achievement of the project.

101. In order to estimate the impact of the teacher incentives pilot scheme in those difficult
schools, almost 400 schools took part in a randomized impact evaluation10. The preliminary results
of the teacher incentives impact evaluation survey highlight that unqualified teachers in training
have increased over the years whereas only 21 percent of teachers without any qualification
attended the training in 2011. This figure reached 41 percent in 2013 and equaled 36 percent in
201411. The share of teachers enrolled in the DTEP program and with no qualification receiving a
bursary increased from 1 percent in 2011 to 79 percent in 2013 and 54 percent in 2014.

102. On learning outcomes, the National Assessment indicates that the trend on learning
outcomes has been decreasing over time. Between 2006 and 2010 before the advent of this project,
the trend for pass rates for grade 3 had declined particularly for English and Mathematics.
Comparative figures for grade 3 do not exist for the project period (2010-2014)12. However,
National Assessment results for grade 4 over the project cycle also indicate a downward trend.
The average score on English has declined from 52 in 2012 to 40 in 2014, whereas the score for
Mathematics has declined from 51 to 35. The project components-both the revised curricula and
accompany textbooks and the introduction of better qualified teachers, particularly in the difficult
schools-are likely to have an ameliorating impact on these results. The introduction of new
textbooks for grades 1-3 were gradually introduced in January 201313 while a similar introduction
began in January 2015 for grade 4. The impact of the project interventions are unlikely to be
evident at the current time even if the data was available. However, these figures will serve as
baseline against which learning outcomes can be measured in the future as the usage of the new
curricula and textbooks increases.

  In total 392 schools took part in the evaluation and were randomly assigned to 4 groups: (i) control group
comprising 98 schools where no teachers participated, (ii) monetary bonus only group with 97 schools where
qualified teachers receive a monetary incentive of 1000 Maloti, (iii) bursary only group with 98 schools where
unqualified teachers were offered a bursary to enroll in Distance Teacher Education Program, and (iv) monetary
bonus and bursary group with 99 schools where qualified teachers received the monetary incentive and unqualified
teachers were offered a bursary.

  This data does not exist as the National Assessment stopped testing grade 3 and targeted assessment at grade 4
beginning 2012.

13
   The preliminary results in the difficult schools survey suggests that 35 percent of the schools surveyed received
textbooks in 2013, and 41 percent received teachers’ guide. Furthermore, in grade 1 and grade 2, the share of students
having textbooks varies between 30 and 52 percent in 2014, whereas the percent is lower in grade 3 and grade 4 (less
than 30 percent). However, these results may underestimate the national level results as they are from the difficult
schools initially in deficit of textbooks.

103. As to external efficiency, in Lesotho, as in other countries, higher education is associated
with higher earnings. Based on the most recent household survey (2011) each additional year of
education results in a rate of return of 5.6 percent. The differential in rates of return between levels
of education indicates that the gap between those with lower secondary compared to those with
some upper secondary is 18.4 percent, and 32.5 percent between those with upper secondary
compared to those with some higher education. Investment in additional years of schooling is
beneficial.

2. Cost-Benefit Analysis

104. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted in order to examine the returns of the project in
terms of improved completion rates and learning outcomes due to the activities of the project. The
analysis estimates a Net Present Value approximately of US$ 5.4 million, corresponding to an
estimated internal rate of return (IRR) of 11.3 percent. However, this return is an underestimation,
as the calculations only accounts for two streams of benefits which are from classroom
construction and textbooks distribution. The benefits from the expansion of pre-primary reception
classes are not calculated and neither is the benefit stream of improved quality of teachers and its
impact on learning outcomes of students14.

Program benefits

105. The provision of new classrooms in the remote schools is expected to improve the access
and the completion rates at the targeted schools. In addition, providing textbooks and learning
materials in core subjects are expected to rise the education quality and therefore the learning
outcomes. In order to more precisely quantify the scope and size of these effects, the number of
students who are likely to be impacted by the project is calculated, and the degree to which the

14
  Data related to pre-primary school is not available in the Lesotho Skills and Employment Survey in 2011. An
estimation of the impact of pre-primary school on wage is in that case not possible, and neither is the estimation of
an eventual impact of pre-primary school on the cognitive skills of students.

learning outcomes and school enrolment survival rate of these students responds to this two
subcomponent of the project. In order to convert these estimates into monetary terms which are
comparable to estimated costs, the economic returns to an additional year of education is estimated.
These estimates require a number of assumptions, which are described in what follows.

                            Table 12: Assumptions for the analysis
 Assumptions
 Students enter labour market at               17 years of age
 Students leave labour market at               60 years of age
 Population growth rate per year (2015-2025)   0.73% per year
 Depreciation of textbooks per year            10%
 Scope of return for construction              12 years
 Return to educational quality                 10% to the labour market returns
 Discount rate                                 10%

106. Based on EMIS school-level data, there are about 5,948 students in 2014 in the 30-targeted
schools benefiting the classroom and latrines construction and 369,469 students in all primary
schools in 2013 benefiting the textbooks distribution. Investment from the project is limited and
projected to fade out, so 10 per cent of purchased textbooks are estimated to depreciate every year,
and the scope of return for construction is about 12 years. During those 12 years, the population
growth of total student enrolment is estimated to be 0.73 per cent per year (in line with population
projections for Lesotho). All students are assumed to enter the labour market at 17 years of age
and work up until the age of 60.

Survival and completion rates

107. In order to estimate the effect of increased schooling attainment (years of completed
schooling) on private returns to education, we examine firstly the predicted effect of classrooms
and latrines construction on attainment, and we estimate secondly the economic returns of the
additional years of education. A regression of school and classroom characteristics on student
survival rates for each level in primary was estimated using EMIS data of 2013 and 2014.
Coefficients on permanent classrooms and latrines suggest that these inputs correlate with higher
student attainment at all education levels (see Table below). These coefficients are then
apportioned to the appropriate subset of students in the targeted schools. The translation of these
point estimates into survival rates suggests that school and latrines construction will increase
survival rates for approximately 5,500 students. In order to estimate the economic returns, Lesotho
Skills and Employment Survey in 2011 was used suggesting that an additional year of education
is associated with an increase in monthly income of Maloti 147, or approximately US$240 per
year. Over work life of those students who benefit from the additional year in education attainment
because of better facilities, the Net Present Value of additional earning is estimated to be
US$13,308,982 at a discount rate at 10 percent.

Learning outcomes

108. On textbooks and learning materials, the Net Present Value of labour market outcomes as
a result of higher learning is also estimated by two steps. Firstly, the predicted effect of textbooks
on learning outcomes is calculated, and secondly the returns to educational quality are estimated.
The first point of estimates is obtained by using National Assessment data for Grade 4 by
regressing test scores on a range of pupil-textbook ratio on Mathematics, English and Sesotho15.
Textbooks in English and in Sesotho appear to increase performance on test outcomes. For the
second step, given that we are unable to estimate the labour-market returns to higher quality
education, we make an assumption regarding its private payoff of additional textbooks. It is
assumed that a one standard-deviation increase in test scores will result in a 10 percent premium
to the labour market returns estimated from the Lesotho Skills and Employment Survey in 2011.
The Net Present Value of the additional income from improved learning via textbooks is estimated
at US$45,637,934.

Program Costs

109. The cost streams consist of the total investment costs and recurrent costs of the project over
the five years, and the opportunity costs for the same group of students who were estimated to
survive one year longer in school in the benefits calculation above. The opportunity costs are
calculated based upon the average yearly income of a working child under the age of 16 who had
not completed primary schools. This cost is estimated as a monthly income of Maloti 89, or
approximately US$147 in 2011. Therefore, the Net Present Value of the economic costs is
estimated to be US$18,193,840.

Cost and Benefits

110. Based on the previous results, the Net Present Value for this project and the IRR is
estimated by comparing the entire flow of costs and benefits over the life of the project and the
working life of students affected by the program. Students are considered to enter the labour
market at 17 years old and leave at 60 years. Using the above estimates, the NPV of the project is
calculated to be US$5,438,027 which corresponds to an IRR of 11.3 percent. Despite the
challenges and the restructuring of the project, the project was a worthy investment.

111. It is worth comparing the IRR for achieved targets in the project with IRR based on targets
stated in the PAD. Based on the same assumptions used for the earlier CBA, and assuming that
the targets of 330 classrooms and the 100 latrines in the PAD were constructed and 13,300
textbooks were purchased, the IRR would have been 11.4 percent.16 The difference between the
two IRR is small (see Table below). The small difference is explained by how the number of
beneficiaries of the project was actually larger despite the fewer classrooms constructed but
because of the larger number of students receiving textbooks.

3. Financial Analysis

3.1. Classroom Construction Unit Cost Analysis17

112. An understanding of classroom construction unit cost analysis is critical particularly for
this project given the following: (i) the significance of Component 1 which accounts for almost
half of the total grant (US$ 9.9 million); (ii) the delays generated by Component 1 early on in the
project; and (iii) the decision at MTR to restructure the implementation arrangements of this
Component which would have had implications for costs. Cost efficiency in this component would
contribute significantly to overall cost efficiency in the project.

113. Unit cost analysis of classroom construction undertaken on this project18 indicates that the
average investment per school was US$230,000 (including taxes) and on average included 4.8
classrooms and 6.5 block of latrines per school. The average unit cost per classroom is US$36,800
and latrine cost for staff, girls, and boys, are respectively 21 percent, 15 percent and 18 percent of
the cost of the classroom. Average unit cost per gross meter of classroom is equivalent to
US$555/m2. Comparatively, the average investment per school (U$230,000) is of a similar range
of previous projects in Lesotho. In the Second Education Sector Development Project (SESDP),
the average cost per SESDP primary school was US$227,000.

114. Certain features stand out about school construction in Lesotho and indicate to the
relatively higher cost of school construction in the region. There is a significant difference between
apparent vs adjusted unit cost in Lesotho. Adjusted cost which include “preliminaries and general
items” and “schedule rates and contingencies” result in a sharp increase in costs by 50 percent.
This is exceptional compared to other countries. Floor gross areas per classroom in Lesotho is
generous and average net unit area, based on a class size of 34, is 1.75m2, which is one of the
largest by international standards. Finally, average unit prices per classroom hide huge differences
between contracts and between districts. Between districts prices can vary up to 250 percent while
within districts prices can way by 168 percent between the minimum and maximum prices for
classrooms. There is a tendency for unit prices for classrooms to increase from north to south.
These variations in districts and between districts and region likely arise from transport of non-
local material and the lack of road but cannot explain all the difference in unit costs.

115. A cost-effectiveness analysis for classroom construction was carried out for the ICR.
Although data was limited, the team was able to make a comparison with four other
projects/programs with similar activities implemented in Lesotho. Access to the corresponding
information was limited during the ICR preparation because most of the contracts of MoET’s staff
involved in school construction had already expired. The four other projects with available
information are the following:

   A parallel program by MoET that financed not only classrooms and latrines, but also school
    kitchens. The sample of this program is limited to one single contract for Poriking Primary
    School in Qabane Community Council in Mohales’ Hoek District (February 2012).
   An Ireland-financed program, also implemented by the MoET as the BEP. The sample of this
    program is also limited to one single contract. Moketeng Primary School in Mafeteng District
    (No Ireland Aid MOET/317/10/11) dated 2010/10/12.
   A World Vision-financed program. World Vision (WV) is an international Christian NGO
    that implements operations financed from child sponsorship funds. Established in Lesotho in
    1987, it is now one of the largest international NGO in the country. In 2013, World Vision was
    operating in 1000 villages in 7 districts out of 10, but is mainly involved in Mohale’s Hoek.
    On the basis of its annual report, it is assumed that the standard model is the MoET’s one.
   JICA is also a long term player in Lesotho as regards to school construction. Its current project
    supports the construction of lower secondary schools. It follows the Project for Construction
    of Primary Schools (2004-2009).

116. Compared to the 2 contracts from 2 other MoET’s managed projects financed by the
Government and Ireland Aid respectively, the unit cost performance of BEP is either better or
consistent. Table 4 summarizes the analysis’ outputs while Annex 6 provides the detailed
calculations.

117. Comparison of unit prices of classroom construction by MoET through BEP and through
another parallel program in 2012 (this program includes not only classroom and latrines but also
kitchen). The comparative contract is for the school of Poriking in Mohales’ Hoek District. The
unit price of BET in the same District Mohales’ Hoek is one fourth cheaper (571 US/m2 vs. 726
US/m2).

118.     Comparison of unit prices of classroom construction by MoET through BEP with funds
from Ireland Aid in 2010. The comparative contract is for the school of Mokekeng in Mafeteng
District. Although the BEP was not operating in Mafeteng, the cost-comparison can be made with
the next District (Maseru). On this basis the unit cost of BEP is about the same as this of the
comparative contract. (334 US/m2 vs. 364 US/m2).

            Table 16: Classroom unit cost comparisons between BEP and other projects

119. Compared to similar constructions by World Vision (670 US$/m2 in 2014), the
performance or BEP (555 US$/m2 in 2014) is cost-efficient. World Vision is actually 15% more
expensive. Table 17 provides the detailed calculations. The limitation on information also limits
the possibilities to provide lights on the rationale of this difference.

                  Table 17. Classroom unit cost comparisons between BEP and projects
                       financed/managed by World Vision between 2013 and 2015




              Source. Author’s calculation with data from contracts in MoET


120. Comparison with the JICA-financed school constructions. The current JICA project
finances the construction by the MoET of lower secondary schools comprising 10 classrooms in 3
blocks (2 blocks of 4 classrooms and 1 block of 2 classrooms), one block combining a science
laboratory and administration offices, a staff house and 2 blocks of latrines respectively for boys
and girls. The reviewed contracts were signed in 2011; the average contract cost was about ML
4,5 millions equivalent to about US$ 615,000. As shown in below Table 18, the unit cost of a
combined administration-science block is about ML 1,5 million equivalent to about 8 classrooms.
This is striking: one single unit of such block is almost equivalent to the cost of all the classrooms.
Annex 7 provides the detailed calculations.

         Table 18. Unit costs of various school facilities in the 2011 JICA-financed school

Source. Author’s calculation with data from contracts in MoET


121. The average unit cost of classrooms financed by JICA is 5% lower than this of BEP. As
shown in Table 18, the average unit cost of the JICA-financed classrooms in 2011 is 401 US$/m2
(value actualized 2014) in the Districts of Leribe and Berea. In the same district of Leribe, the unit
cost of classroom by BEP in 2014 was 420 US/m2. However, the difference is only 5%, which is
not that substantial.

3.2.       Fiscal Sustainability

122. Public expenditure on education in Lesotho is high by international standards. It
consistently represented 11 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2012. However, it slightly
decreased to 9 percent in 2013. The share of education in all public expenditures varied between

                                                                        45
17 percent and 19 percent between 2009 and 2011. Capital expenditures represented 12.5 percent
of the public expenditure on education in 2009, but it has declined over the years with a bottom at
5.5 percent in 2012. Conversely, the external funding remained involved in the investment
expenditures and its share increased between 2011 and 2012, representing 85 percent of the capital
expenditure.

                          Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results 
123. In early 2014 a beneficiary assessment was carried out to assess specific interventions
under the EFA Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Grant. The objective of the assessment was “...to
provide feedback from project beneficiaries to inform project implementation as well as to
potentially inform policy dialogue on key sector issues” (p.1). The report gathered stakeholders’
perspective on three specific intervention funded by the EFA FTI III grant:

   1. The incentive scheme for qualified teachers
   2. The training bursaries for unqualified teachers
   3. The pre-primary classrooms

The methodology employed a qualitative approach to gather stakeholders’ perspectives on these
interventions.

124. The assessment sample included 16 schools in three districts of Leribe, Thaba-Tseka and
Quacha’s Nek. Schools were non-randomly selected on the following criteria: (i) Type and the
number of activities funded by the grant in each school and the distribution of those activities; and
(ii) school size, school performance and school’s geographical location, specifically remoteness
of school. . In total 178 individuals were interviewed including principals/deputy principals,
teachers, community leaders/school board members, school feeding staff, students and parents.
The summary of the assessment by activity is given below.

125. The incentive scheme for qualified teachers. The incentive scheme was effective in
attracting teachers to remote schools and enhanced the capacity of remote schools to recruit
teachers. However, at the time of the assessment-early on in the program incentive payments were
late which made teachers participating nervous about payments The random assignment of
incentive payments (as per the requirement of the randomized control trail) created some ill-will
among teachers of schools who were not selected for the scheme. Despite a sensitization
component about the incentive scheme and the research design accompanying the incentive
scheme, teachers not selected remained unhappy.

126. The training bursaries for unqualified teachers. The training bursary for unqualified
teachers in remote schools was effective in bringing new skills to the classroom and these skills
were subsequently shared with other colleagues not benefiting from the training. Participating
teachers were very enthusiastic about the experience, despite some quality concerns by some of
the principals. In view of the latter, the distance teacher education program was evaluated by the
project and is currently being revamped.

127. The pre-primary classrooms. The expansion and support of the pre-primary classroom
has improved the preparedness of those children who were able to attend a reception class before
entering grade 1. Teachers report a marked difference in those children who did attend reception
classes as compared to those who did not. Nevertheless, the program in implementation did
struggle with insufficient space for these classrooms and at the time of the assessment there were
challenges in implementing the food feeding program.

PDOs & Indicators
128. The ICR found that all three PDOs were fully reached, and four of the five intermediate
indicators were achieved as well. The effectiveness of the project activities was rated as
Satisfactory. However, due to delays and capacity constraints over the course of the project’s
implementation, the project’s duration was significantly extended by 23 months.

Overall Implementation
129. At the close of the project in April 2015, overall implementation was at a very advanced
stage towards completion; activities including construction, teacher incentives, and curriculum and
assessment were almost entirely complete (except for a few contracts on civil works to address
environmental and social safeguards). The scope of each component was changed over the course
of the project; some aspects were expanded due to excess capabilities, and some aspects were
scaled back due to capacity constraints and other challenges. By component:

130. Component 1: The scope of the recipient body and measured outcomes was reduced from
330 to 135 classrooms, from 100 to 87 toilet blocks, and from 64 to 18 targeted schools, due to
contractors’ implementation capacity constraints to deliver on time.

131. Component 2: All project targets were met. The scope was revised upwards from 120
reception classes to 140, with an estimated enrolment of about 3,682 children. GoL has decided
to take over and finance the cost for foodstuffs, caregivers and cooks, activities which were earlier
supported by the project.

132. Component 3: Achievements exceeded some project targets and fell short in others.
Qualified teachers receiving retention and attraction incentives were 1,096 against a targeted
1,000. A teacher qualifications framework study and DTEP evaluation study were successfully
completed. However, the DTEP (Distance Teacher Education Program) bursary program
benefitted only 380 unqualified teachers, instead of the targeted 600.

Overall Project Management, Financial Management and Procurement
133. Overall project management, financial management and procurement were rated
Satisfactory. However, due to initial implementation constraints, the project failed to attract
additional performance-based resources totaling to US$10million. The project satisfactorily
fulfilled all financial and other reporting obligations.


                                                 51
Continuation of Project Activities
134. GoL will take over some project financed activities past project closure, including:
unfinished remedial works, mobile monitoring program, tuition for DTEP students, caregivers and
cooks’ salaries, development of curriculum and assessment packages, teacher training, and
provision of textbooks beyond grade 4.

Challenges in Implementation
135. Project take-off was substantially delayed due to various challenges. These challenges
included the large scope, the design complexity, difficult physical access, and capacity constraint
by project managers and contractors. These issues later caused a project extension, technical
assistance, and a restructuring of each components’ scope at mid-term review in April 2013. The
project was closed 30 April 2015, two years later than the original closing date.

Conclusions and Lessons Learnt
136. Project Design: Project design needs to carefully map out the entirety of the project; some
unmet targets and failures to meet deadlines could have been avoided if the scope and design were
more realistic from the outset.

137. Management and Communication: Roles of and relationships between parties (partners,
funding agencies, GoL, etc.) should be clearly articulated, periodically reviewed, and enforced.
Training needs to be provided for key project staff, and their abilities should be assessed to avoid
performance issues. Monitoring and evaluation should be more effective to help the project
managers detect problems ahead of time, rather than retrospectively.

138. Contractors: It is not always appropriate to select the lowest bidding contractor; most of
the selected contractors did not have financial capabilities to complete the work. Contractors
should be evaluated to ensure the quality and timeliness of their deliverables. However, the project
successfully familiarized the selected local contractors with the World Bank’s procurement rules
and regulations, enabling them for future contracts with the Bank. Further, these companies have
benefitted from general growth in business and financial resources since beginning the work.
