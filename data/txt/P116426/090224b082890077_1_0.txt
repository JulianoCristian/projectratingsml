                         The Project Development Objective is to provide improved facilities at existing primary schools, support and contribute to expand access to pre-primary education and
                         support improvements in quality of teaching.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A five month extension of the project closing date was approved on October 14, 2014, extending the closing date from November 30, 2014 to April 30, 2015. This extension allows
                         MoET sufficient time to complete in an orderly manner the ongoing activities, especially the remaining civil works and provide adequate time to undertake remedial works.
                         Implementation of project activities has advanced considerably in the period of July 2014 to date. Project disbursement has increased from 72% in July to 88% as of October 2014.
                         The majority of project activities have been completed, and the remaining activities are close to completion. Four of the five Project Development Objective (PDO) indicators have

                         In addition to the June delivery of the Grade 1-3 primary textbooks and teachers' guides based on the new simplified curriculum focused on early grade reading and math, the
                         260,000 Grade 4 textbooks and 1,446 teachers' guides were delivered by the publishers to the Ministry of Education and Training in early November and are expected to be

                         distributed to schools in November-December. Field visits by the WB team in August confirmed that the Grade 1-3 textbooks are indeed available in schools and being used in the
                         classroom. Anecdotal feedback from primary teachers during school visits has been very positive on the new curriculum and textbooks. In particular, they mentioned that it made it
                         much easier for them to teach. The roll out of this new curriculum has been funded to a considerable extent by the project. Student assessments are under way to provide a baseline
                         to allow for later evaluation of quality of learning based on this new early grade curriculum. 140 new pre-primary reception classes have also been established supported by the
                         project, allowing 3,682 young children an opportunity for quality early childhood education to help them get ready for primary education. The teacher incentives scheme to retain
                         qualified teachers in rural areas and improve the qualifications of unqualified teachers also appears to contribute to improving the learning environment. Principals and teachers at
                         remote schools have noted that the incentive scheme has made their school a more attractive place to work. With the school construction nearly completed in all project schools,
                         overcrowded classes that were crammed into one-room crumbling school buildings are happily transitioning into nicer and weather resistant new classroom blocks with new
                         classroom furniture.
