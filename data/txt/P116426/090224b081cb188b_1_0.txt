                         The Project Development Objective is to provide improved facilities at existing primary schools, support and contribute to expand access to pre-primary education and
                         support improvements in quality of teaching.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is the first to be prepared after project restructuring. This was the first restructuring and it included an extension of the project closing date by 18 months, from May 31, 2013
                         to November 30, 2014. The restructuring became effective on May 20, 2013.

                         Overall project management has improved in the period from January 2013 until the current date, notably procurement planning and monitoring. These improvements in project

                         management indicate a clear effort to make progress in the implementation of project activities. Overall, project implementation progress continues to be moderately satisfactory.

                         Progress to achieve the project development objective still posed important challenges, although some progress has been made. This is primarily due to the relatively slow progress
                         in the construction of school facilities (Component 1). Although tangible progress has been made regarding school construction, this is not yet sufficient to catch up with all the delays.

                         However, progress in PDO achievement has been made regarding the availability of qualified teachers in remote rural areas and improving education quality through strengthening
                         teacher and school principal qualifications. Progress towards reaching the project development objective has also been made in children's enrollment in pre-primary reception
                         classes.
