                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall project management has further improved in the period of June 2013 until the current date, notably monitoring, procurement planning and disbursement. These improvements
                         in project management indicate a clear and continued effort by the MoET to make progress in the implementation of project activities. Overall, project implementation progress
                         continues to be moderately satisfactory. In spite of considerable progress, challenges remain. Procurement and implementation of activities need to be further accelerated, in
                         particular school construction and textbooks, to ensure completion of activities before the closing date.
