     Project: (a) to reallocate the loan proceeds that remain\n            uncommitted because of the cancellation of two consultancies\n            to finance additional activities (mainly civil works) within\n            the same scope of the project and to modify the project\n            outputs accordingly; (b) to extend the loan closing date to\n            June 30, 2010 (which would be the third extension of the\n            closing date); (c) to address the slight discrepancies in\n            the formulation of the project development objective (PDO)\n            between the project appraisal document (PAD) and loan\n            agreement; and (d) to make amendments to the loan agreement\n            accordingly. The restructuring is mainly to address the\n            project implementation problems caused by the failed\n            procurement processes for the two consultancies and to make\n            productive use of the uncommitted loan funds for achieving\n            the project outcomes. An additional financing to the project\n            is being prepared in parallel to this restructuring. The\n            additional financing will mainly support the widening of\n            five priority national highway stretches, totaling 216 km.\n            Given the uncertain timing of the parliamentary approval of\n            this additional financing, it has been decided to process\n            the restructuring first as the Department of Highways (DOH)\n            is ready to use the uncommitted loan proceeds for the\n            much-needed periodic maintenance works, which are also\n            expected to be helpful for the businesses of small- and\n            medium-sized construction enterprises at the time of\n            economic downturn."}, "docdt": "2009-07-08T00:00:00Z"}
