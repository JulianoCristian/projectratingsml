2.     The project implementation progress for activities under Loan 4721-TH is near
completion, the project is rated unsatisfactory due to slow procurement process for activities
under the additional financing (Loan 7775-TH). All civil works have been completed with the
remaining fund of US$441,283 under this category. All periodic maintenance works were
completed by September 2011 and the International Procurement Consultant (IPC) has been
hired since March 9, 2011. The only remaining activity is Consultancy for the Design of
Performance-Based Contracts (PBC), estimated at US$350,000.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to complete the remaining consultants’ services
per client’s request.
