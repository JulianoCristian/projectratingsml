﻿1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1 At the time of appraisal of Thailand Highways Management Project (THMP) in
July 2002, the country had a population of about 63 million and total area of 514,000 sq.
km. Thailand had made significant progress since the economic and financial crisis in
1997-98, and in 2002 the real GDP growth had accelerated to 5.4% from 2.1% in 2001,
and in 2003 real GDP grew further to 6.7%. The recovery was driven mainly by
consumption growth, prompted by rising consumer confidence, low interest rates, and
fiscal measures to stimulate consumption.
1.1.2 Thailand was facing increasing competition both in its major exporting products
and markets, and needed to reduce its logistics costs to retain and increase its relative
competitive advantages. Road transport accounted for about 94 percent of domestic
freight transport at the time of appraisal. A large part of transport cost was made up of
road freight. The national strategy to increase competitiveness of both domestic and
international trade by reducing transport costs thus needed to focus on road freight,
particularly along key corridors linking Thailand with neighboring countries.
1.1.3 A number of issues had emerged from the ongoing engagement between the
Royal Thai Government (RTG) and the Bank, both through project-related activities and
through the Country Development Partnerships (CDPs), knowledge-based partnerships
which set out medium-term integrated frameworks for reform programs. The CDPs were
led by the Government, with the Bank and other partners supporting the development of
the overall reform framework, analytical work, capacity building, and provision of
technical assistance. The key issues in the transport sector were: (i) sustainable road and
transport sector management; (ii) improving the competitive landscape; and (iii) road
safety.
(i)   Sustainable road and transport sector management
Department of Highways (DOH). The construction, improvement and maintenance of
the national highway system were the responsibility of the Department of Highways
(DOH) within the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC). DOH's
administration comprised 27 bureaus (12 at the center and 15 in regional areas) and eight
divisions. It was recognized that DOH was overstaffed, with about 19,000 permanent
staff (including civil servants) on its payroll plus 20,000 temporary staff (laborers).
Nearly 75 percent of routine maintenance and some emergency repairs were carried out
by force account. A system needed to be put in place for programming annual works on
the basis of rational planning and economic criteria.
Road Maintenance. Thailand's road network consisted of about 52,000 km of national
and trunk roads under the jurisdiction of DOH, of which about 150 km were multi-lane
motorways, 2,000 km were four-lane divided highways and the remaining were two-lane
highways. The network was in relatively good condition, with an asset value estimated at
between US$40-$50 billion. Although annual budget allocations for routine maintenance,
which was around US$360 million on annual average, met the estimated requirement,
periodic maintenance of the national road network was under-funded by about 23
1


﻿percent. As a result, there was a significant backlog of critically needed periodic
maintenance.
Road Financing. Road user charges comprised part of total government revenue so
there was no direct link between revenue and expenditures on roads. Allocations to the
road sector were insufficient to fund both the proper maintenance of the network and the
provision of additional capacity to cope with continued motorization growth of 7-8% in
early 2000s. There was an urgent need to put maintenance funding on a sustainable basis,
spend maintenance resources effectively, and increase private sector funding of road
transport facilities and infrastructure.
Public-Private Partnership. Most of the issues in the implementation of public-private
highway projects in Thailand were derived from the absence of a sector-specific legal and
regulatory framework that addressed the sector's needs as well as the role of all public
and private parties involved.
(ii)   Improving the Competitive Landscape
Access to Remote Areas of the Country. High domestic transport costs inhibited access
of the more remote parts of Thailand to the major national areas of consumption around
Bangkok. Most export industries were concentrated in the Bangkok region, largely
because the cost of transport to and from other regions was very high. The continuing
relative attractiveness of the Bangkok area had many implications, among them migration
from the rest of the country, growing income disparities between Bangkok and other
regions, and increasing environmental and social problems.
(iii)  Road Safety. Thailand had been experiencing a high incidence of road accidents
and fatalities. According to a study carried out by the Transport Research Laboratory
(UK), data from 1996 indicated that about 20,000 people died and over 100,000 were
being injured annually in road accidents. According to official statistics, the accident rate
was about 12 deaths per 10,000 vehicles, which was about six times the rate in developed
countries. About 30 percent of these accidents occurred on national highways and trunk
roads. Increased efforts by the DOH and MOTC had reduced the number of accidents and
fatalities toward 2003, but lack of reliable data, especially due to under-reporting,
continued to be a problem.
1.1.4. Rationale for Bank involvement. In response to the above sector constraints and
Government's sector strategy, the Government requested that the Bank design a project
which helped improve quality of roads network and reduce transport cost. The project
was in line with the overall policy of the government and the 2003-2005 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) of the Bank, which was to support the government in
stimulating and sustaining economic growth and reducing poverty. The CAS goal of
stimulating economic growth through enhanced competitiveness was supported through:
(i) upgrading the quality of the road infrastructure and reducing transport costs; and (ii)
expanding the role of the private sector - particularly small and medium-sized enterprises
- in road asset maintenance, management, and operation. The CAS goal of improving
governance and public sector performance was also supported through: (i) modernizing
DOH planning and management information systems; (ii) adopting e-procurement
methods and intemet-based advertising, to ensure greater competition, transparency, and
2


﻿accountability; (iii) introducing more stringent financial management systems; and (iv)
piloting long-term road maintenance performance-based contracts with the private sector.
The project was also aligned with the Bank-assisted program of public sector reform
being undertaken by the government, which aimed at improving public sector
management through: (i) improved performance-based resource management; (ii) better
service delivery; (iii) greater transparency and accountability; (iv) de-concentration of
operations; and (v) sound regulation for private sector involvement.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
1.2.1 There were slight discrepancies (marked in italics) in the formulation of the PDO
between the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and Loan Agreement (LA). According
to the PAD, the PDO was to enhance the efficiency, productive use, and management of
the road network, through: (i) the commercialization of the road sector by introducing
better business principles and increased private sector participation in the delivery and
management of roads; (ii) the strengthening the operations of the Department of
Highways (DOH) through improved use of information technology and computerization;
(iii) preserving road assets through sustainable maintenance programs including long-
term performance based contracts; and (iv) improving the competition and transparency
in the award of contracts by using e-procurement. Furthermore, reducing traffic
accidents and fatalities on national highways and decentralize the implementation of
periodic maintenance to the districts.
1.2.2 As per the LA, the objective of the Project was "to assist the Borrower in
enhancing the efficiency, productive use and management of the Borrower's road
network, through: (a) the commercialization of the road sector by introducing better
business principles and increasing private sector participation in the construction and
maintenance of roads; (b) the strengthening of the institutional capacity and
modernization of DOH; (c) sustainable road maintenance programs to preserve road
assets; and (d) the enhancement of road safety aimed to reduce traffic fatalities and
injuries."
1.2.3  There were originally four Key Performance Indicators (KPI): (i) reduce, in real
terms, average unit cost/km of maintenance; (ii) increase (or reversed decline) asset value
of the road network; (iii) reduce vehicle operating costs; and (iv) establish a national road
database, updated annually, and use for planning, programming, budgeting, and
monitoring of highway investments and maintenance expenditure. Fifteen additional
intermediate results indicators to monitor output from each component were originally
established, as per the LA.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
1.3.1 To address the slight discrepancies in the two formulations of the PDO, the
project restructuring in July 2009 reverted to the PDO version used in the LA for its
simplicity.
3


﻿1.3.2 Key performance and outcome indicators were not revised in the 2009
restructuring; however, the following output indicators specified in Schedule 7 of the
Loan Agreement were modified to read as follows:
*  Output Indicator 1.2 (Periodic maintenance of about 960 km of project roads
completed using conventional contracting methods with SME's);
*  Output indicator 1.3 (Pilot long-term  performance-based management and
maintenance contract designed for 150 km motorway); and
*  Output indicator 4.2 (i.e. Web-based procurement, business-oriented performance-
based contracting system established and operational by end of project) was dropped.
With approval of Additional Financing (AF) in March 2010, the following indicators
were added: (a) road user costs reduced by at least 10% on target roads funded by the AF
(PDO Indicator #5); (b) additional 216 km of priority national highways widened for four
lanes (Intermediate Outcome Indicator #15); and (c) public-private partnership (PPP)
financing for the proposed Bang Pa-in to Nakhon Ratchasima Motorway reached bidding
stage (Intermediate Outcome Indicator #16).
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
1.4.1 The Department of Highways (DOH) was the direct beneficiary of the project
activities in terms of physical works and institutional strengthening. Other beneficiaries
included users of the national highways and trunk roads, including those involved in
regional and international trade; cities and towns directly served by the project roads,
especially in the economically weaker Northeastern region; and small- and medium-sized
enterprises engaged in road construction and maintenance.
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
1.5.1 The original project had four components and 14 sub-components, as follows:
A. Highway Rehabilitation and Maintenance: (US$45.26 million IBRD; total
project cost US$79.68 million): (i) periodic maintenance of about 700 km of
priority national highways; (ii) three long-term (five year) pilot contracts for
performance-based maintenance of about 900 km of national highways; (iii) the
supervision of periodic maintenance and road safety improvements; and (iv) the
study, design, and supervision of performance-based maintenance contracts. This
component was to contribute to the sustainable road maintenance programs to
preserve road assets.
B. Highway Upgrading and Intersection Improvement: (US$28.52 million
IBRD; total project cost US$50.32 million) (i) widening three selected sections
(73 km in total) of highway network from two to four lanes; (ii) construction of
three overpasses at critical intersections; and (iii) the supervision of the widening
and overpass civil works. This component was to contribute to the sustainable
road maintenance programs to preserve road assets.
C. Road Safety Improvement: (US$6.88 million IBRD; total project cost
US$11.50 million) (i) improvement of 10 hazardous locations; and (ii) support for
4


﻿the implementation of the road safety action plan in collaboration with the Global
Road Safety Partnership, and the establishment and operation of a roads accidents
research center. The component was to contribute to the enhancement of road
safety aimed to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries.
D. Institutional Strengthening: (US$3.63       million  IBRD; total project cost
US$4.05 million) (i) institutional strengthening of the DOH through (a)
development of a centralized road database, road asset maintenance and
management system, and a bridge management system; (b) development of a
framework for and a case study on public-private partnerships in highways; (c)
technical assistance (TA) for project coordination; and (d) introduction of e-
procurement system; and (ii) external audit. This component was to contribute to
the strengthening of the institutional capacity and modernization of DOH.
1.6 Revised Components
1.6.1 After the second order restructuring in July 2009 and the AF in March 2010 (see
section 1.7 below), the original components and sub-components were revised as follows:

1.7 Other significant changes
1.7.1 JSDF Grant on Thailand's Community Youth Helmet Use Program (2007). A
grant of US$834,200 for a helmet promotion program supported by the Japan Social
Development Fund (JSDF) was approved in 2007. The activities started in late 2007 and
included an awareness-raising campaign, helmet subsidies, and enforcement of helmet
use in poor communities near national highways.
1.7.2 2008 - Closing Date Extension. The loan closing date was extended by 12 months
(from June 30, 2008 to June 30, 2009) to allow time for the completion of remaining
activities and new activities under the AF, but the AF was not approved until March 20 10.
1.7.3  2009 -         Second Order Restructuring and Closing Date Extensions. In order to
process the second order restructuring, the loan closing date was extended by three
months to September 30, 2009. The project was restructured in early July 2009 to (i)
reallocate available Loan proceeds that resulted from the cancellation of two
consultancies to finance additional activities (mainly civil works) and to modify the
project outputs accordingly; (ii) extend the Loan Closing Date to June 30, 2010; and (iii)
address the slight discrepancies in the formulations of the PDO as noted above.
6


﻿1.7.4 2010 - Additional Financing (AF). Originally the second order restructuring and
AF were intended to be presented in one package for Board approval. However,
uncertainties emerged regarding the timing of Parliamentary approval of government
borrowing from the Bank. As a result, the Bank first proceeded with the restructuring
approved on July 8, 2009; and after the Parliament approved further borrowing, the
Board approved the AF for US$79.30 million on March 25, 2010 and extended the Loan
closing date to June 30, 2013.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1.1 The project was prepared in about two-and-one-half years from the first
identification mission (June 2001) to the Board approval (December 2003). Positive
aspects of project preparation and design include the following:
*  The PDO and design were in line with overall government policy and the 2002
Thailand-World Bank Group Partnership for Development, which was to support the
government in stimulating and sustaining economic growth and reducing poverty,
through improving the quality of road infrastructure to reduce transport cost.
*  The substantial commitment of RTG at the project entry was reflected in a number of
critical actions. On October 1, 2002 the Government embarked on the restructuring of
the MOTC as part of the overall Public Sector Management Reform Plan approved by
the Cabinet in May 1999.
*  The key issues in the road sector were thoroughly assessed, and the project was
designed to: (i) help reduce the backlog of periodic maintenance and stem further
degradation of the network and loss of asset value; (ii) promote private sector
involvement in periodic and routine maintenance, pilot more cost-effective ways of
performing road maintenance activities, and chart new ways to improve public and
private partnering in road concessions, with or without private funding; (iii) support
enhancements of the information technology system in road asset management; (iv)
upgrade portions of the national road network that give access to new and improved
border facilities and ports; and (v) enhance road safety at critical locations to reduce
the number of accidents, property damage, injuries and fatalities.
*  Inclusion of long-term performance-based maintenance contracts (PBC) on a pilot
basis intended to take advantage of the Bank's accumulated knowledge and
experience in using such contracts seemed to add value at entry, although later this
sub-component was cancelled due to the failure of procurement for its preparation in
sub-component A-4.
*  All designs for Component B, the draft bidding document and pre-registration of
qualified contractors for the periodic maintenance (part of Component A) were
satisfactorily prepared.
2.1.2 However, some aspects of project preparation and design could have been
improved. These include the following:
7


﻿*  Capacity assessment of DOH. DOH was an experienced road organization and
implemented a total of 11 Bank-financed highway projects from 1961 to 1995.
However, the Highways Management Project was initiated five-and-one half years
after the last highway project closed, and there had been limited influence of external
assistance/funding (in this case IBRD) on DOH's internal system and processes
during that period. Since significant time had elapsed, DOH's institutional capacity
and internal processes should have been more carefully revisited as many of the
delays that occurred during implementation were due to DOH's lengthy internal
processes.
*  Assessment of DOH Commitment. The appraisal overestimated DOH's interest and
ownership in performance-based maintenance contracts (PBC). As a result, the pilot
PBC maintenance failed due to the failure of procurement for its preparation in sub-
component A-4, while DOH performed well on other periodic maintenance contracts.
*  Preparation Delays by RTG. It took about two-and-one-half years from the first
identification until the Board approval to prepare the project. Although the project
was originally negotiated in in October 2002 - within one year from the concept
review -subsequent RTG approval of the negotiated loan agreement was not provided.
Nine months later, DOH provided a revised version of the roads proposed to be
rehabilitated in 2004 and 2005, and RTG decided to reduce the project scope and loan
amount from US$100 million to US$84.29 million. The project was re-negotiated in
September 2003 (11 months after the original negotiation), and from there the project
was processed at a normal pace.
*  PDO Discrepancy between PAD and LA. The discrepancy in the PDO between the
PAD and the LA (see para 1.2.1 and 1.2.2) caused a confusion in establishing the
project's results framework, and the logframe did not include the baselines or
annualized targets, even though the baseline and annual targets were not required in
2003 and that documentation met standards in vogue at the time.
*  Project Scope. The project also experienced a classic design issue where excessive
time was spent in identifying all the key sector issues and trying to address them with
the project. The project ended up with an ambitious design, particularly for inclusion
of the very long (900 km) pilot PBC sub-component (A - (ii) and (iv)). This project
scope should have been discussed with the client more thoroughly before inclusion.
*  Assessment of risks. The assessments of the critical risks and overall risk rating as
"moderate" were inadequate. The project did not properly identify all critical risks
nor prepare mitigation plans for those identified risks, which later materialized as
obstacles to project implementation: (i) DOH's existing implementation and
management practices particularly in terms of procurement management; (ii) the
design and quality control procedures of the various Regional Bureaus engaged in the
periodic maintenance work; and (iii) governance risks.
*  Procurement Capacity Assessment. The overall procurement capacity of the project's
implementing agencies and units was assessed as "good" and the associated risk was
"average". This seemed optimistic considering:
8


﻿o  It had been about seven-and-a-half years since DOH implemented the last Bank-
financed highway project.
o  The project activities were spread across divisions within DOH and sub-national
level, resulting in management coordination complexity.
o  The 15 DOH Regional Bureaus assigned to undertake the entire civil works
program were not familiar with the Bank's procurement procedures and
guidelines.
o  The Bureau of Highway Maintenance Management and Bureau of Safety,
responsible for two main components of the project, were not familiar with the
Bank's procurement procedures and guidelines.
Given the above shortcomings, Quality at Entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
2.2 Implementation
2.2.1  Despite a slow start, the project implementation progress was rated satisfactory
until April 2007 when it was downgraded to moderately satisfactory. The reasons for the
downgrade related to cancellations of procurement processes for two major
consultancies: (a) the study, design and supervision of PBC; and (b) development of a
centralized road database and management system and a bridge management system as
discussed in more detailed below.
*  Failed procurement processes for consultancies A-4 and D-1(a). In mid-2006 the
Bank received allegations of improper influence to the procurement processes for two
consultancies, A-4 (study, design and supervision of performance-based contracts for
maintenance); and D-1 (a) (development of a centralized road database, road
maintenance and management system and a bridge management system). The
allegations were investigated by the Bank's Department of Institutional Integrity
(INT), which substantiated the allegations in the consulting service (A-4). Because of
the failed procurement processes, the ratings for PDO and Implementation
Performance (IP) were downgraded from Satisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory in
April 2007.
In order to address these problems, DOH decided to use its own funds to support the
development of a pavement management system (PMS) and a bridge maintenance
and management system (BMMS), which were formerly under D-1(a), and rebid for
A-4 using the Bank's loan. However, A-4 continued to be problematic. After the
second round of advertisement failed to result in the selection of suitable consultant,
the Bank team recommended an experienced consulting firm for single-source
selection. However, Thai regulations did not permit government agencies to use
government budget to hire private sector consultants through single-source selection.
Finally the consultant was hired in December 2012 after a third round of bidding,
which eventually took 3.5 years in total.
*  Implications of  changes in the government's procurement and funding
requirements. The RTG decided to use its own funds to finance the following
activities either because of unsuccessful procurement or changes in RTG policy. In
total these activities represented US$5.1 million in Loan savings.
9


﻿a. Development of a pavement management system      (PMS) and a bridge
maintenance and management system (BMMS), formerly D-1(a). Initial
procurement processes were cancelled after the INT investigation; later DOH
decided to use its own funds to support the development of PMS and BMMS.
b. e-Procurement system (sub-component D-4). The MOF eventually required that
RTG line agencies use the e-procurement system developed by MOF, so this sub-
component was dropped.
c. PPP financing transaction advisory services were not hired because RTG
decided to use its own funds to finance the proposed Bang Pa-in to Nakhon
Ratchasima Motorway.
d. Overpass Contract TH4 was delayed when the contractor suffered a cash
shortfall. DOH terminated the contract in June 2007 and resumed the remaining
works of some US$ 1 million using own funds; the overpass was opened to traffic
by the end of 2007.
e. Road Safety Improvement (C-1). Out of total of 66 small road safety packages,
37 packages were completed. Since the DOH had its own road safety work
program, DOH decided to implement the remaining 29 packages (US$1.66
million) in their program, and reallocate that amount of the Bank loan to finance
additional periodic maintenance works. That amount of the Loan was used mainly
for enhancement of A-1.
Among the above, this ICR considered activities (a), (d) and (e) above were
implemented as an integral part of the project as they were implemented by the
government's own funds even though that was eventually not part of the Bank
finance.
2.2.2 The primary focus of the additional financing was to widen five selected sections
(216 km in total) of national highway network. These AF activities were not implemented
due to the following factors:
(a) Factors beyond the control of the government or DOH
Impact offlooding on widening offive national highways under AF loan. Thailand
experienced its worst flooding in 50 years during the 2011 monsoon season. The
flood emergency lasted from July through December. About 83% of the provinces
were affected, some severely. Over 800 people were killed, and 10% of the rice crop
was destroyed. The World Bank estimated economic losses at US$45.7 billion,
making this flooding one of the top five costliest natural disasters in modern history at
that time. The North Region of the country was the hardest hit. Fortunately, the
flooding had a minimal impact on the roads completed under the original loan, which
were largely located in the Northeastern Region. Roads near Bangkok were not
severely damaged by the floods as the water passed through quickly there. During this
time, the prequalification process for nine civil works contracts under the AF was
underway. The bid submission date was postponed to allow contractors more time to
assemble bids. Nevertheless, despite the fact that all pre-qualified bidders except one
purchased the bid documents, none of the pre-qualified bidders submitted bids before
10


﻿the new bid closing date of October 16, 2012. According to DOH investigation and
analysis, the amount of government-funded civil works in the market amounted to
approximately THB 25,000 million (US$800 million). This level of flood-related road
reconstruction and rehabilitation nearly fully absorbed the capacity of the Thai road
construction industry. Costs of road construction materials increased substantially and
became volatile. As a result, the pre-qualified bidders were reluctant to take on more
projects as they feared being subjected to financial penalties if they were unable to
complete the projects in a timely manner. DOH proposed a re-bid with bid
submission and opening scheduled in January 2013. However, another extension of
the project closing date for three years would have been required to ensure sufficient
time to complete these civil works. As there was no clear assurance that the re-
bidding would be successful and that the civil works implementation would be
completed within the additional two year time frame specified in the contracts, the
Bank declined the request to re-bid. The project closed on June 30, 2013 and the
entire AF loan was cancelled.
(b) Factors within the control of the government
Delays due to delayed loan signing and effectiveness and changes in government.
As discussed above in Section 1.7, the processing of the AF was delayed due to the
delays in Parliamentary approval which was required for the Government to sign the
Loan Agreement and a major management change at DOH between July 2009 and
February 2010. The effectiveness of AF was further delayed from June 30, 2010 to
September 8, 2010 as the Government was unable to provide the legal opinion
necessary for loan effectiveness within the required timeframe. DOH was heavily
affected by an outbreak of violence in Bangkok in 2010 and changes in all the
government departments.
(c) Factors within the control of DOH
DOH's lengthy internal processes. Most implementation delays occurred due to
DOH's lengthy internal procurement processes. The Bank identified this bottleneck
early in project implementation, and regularly alerted the DOH that any further delays
would jeopardize the overall performance of the project. It suggested ways to shorten
the length of its procurement processes and organized procurement training for DOH
staff. However, no significant improvement was noted. As part of the project
restructuring and additional financing, further project-specific strengthening measures
that built on DOH's existing procedures and practices were suggested to strengthen
the procurement system.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
2.3.1 M&E Design. The original Results Framework had four PDO outcome indicators
and 15 intermediate outcome indicators. Design included specific indicators for each
component and covered physical as well as institutional results. The data collection
requirement was linked with the legal covenant in Schedule 5, para 5(b) of the original
Loan Agreement that required the borrower to "prepare and furnish to the Bank a report
integrating the results of the monitoring and evaluation activities and setting out measures
achievement of objectives by December 15, 2005". The project coordination consultant's
11


﻿(PCC) terms of reference (TOR) included collecting baseline data which were not
provided for all indicators at appraisal, and monitoring progress against each indicator
until the end of the project. The Results Framework in the PAD employed the
"Logframe" presentation and thus did not provide annual targets.
2.3.2 M&E Implementation and Utilization. Baseline values were not established for
any of the key indicators until 2005 (over a year after effectiveness) due to slow hiring
and mobilization of the PCC. The PCC was recruited on April 1, 2005 but by June 2006
baseline values were collected for only one key indicator and one intermediate. The
reliability of the provided data was uncertain as the baseline values for some indicators
were not consistent among the different ISRs.
2.3.3 The progress towards achieving all PDO-level and intermediate indicators of the
original project started late and was incomplete. As a result, LA covenants 5(a) and 5(b)
(Schedule 5) that covered monitoring, evaluation and reporting on the project monitoring
indicators were not complied by the specified deadline. In 2010, DOH terminated the
PCC and the monitoring indicators were not updated for some time. As a result, M&E
was rated "unsatisfactory" between June 2010 and January 2012.
2.3.4 As reported in Section 1.3 above, with the 2009 restructuring and the AF, the
output indicators were modified, resulting in five outcome indicators and 16 intermediate
indicators. However, no annual targets were introduced to tighten monitoring. Monitoring
of all indicators in the ISRs was not consistent. In ISR # 13, the core sector indicator
"Roads rehabilitated non-rural" was added to comply with a Bank corporate mandate to
include core sector indicators, and recorded as "achieved under original loan". Due to the
lack of baseline values, ownership and proper monitoring, M&E implementation and
utilization were unsatisfactory.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
2.4.1 Safeguards policies were satisfactorily complied with for all activities under the
original loan. DOH funded the social and environmental capacity building (sub-
component D-4) from its own budget and implemented the agreed action plan to
strengthen its social and environmental safeguard capacity.
2.4.2 Environmental Safeguards. The     project was  correctly  classified  as
Environmental Category B as the impacts and risks identified were mostly known and
manageable. The Project triggered three safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment
(OP/BP/GP 4.01); Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20); and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP
4.12). DOH prepared an Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (ESSF) to be
applied to the works to be carried under components 1 and 3 and the ESSF was made
public on July 31, 2002. DOH also prepared an Initial Environmental Evaluation Report
for the six subprojects under component 2, as well as Environmental Management Plans
(EMPs). To achieve the objective of mainstreaming the environment and social aspects
into DOH operational procedures, the Road Environmental Policy Committee was set up
and Operational Policy Guidelines on Environment and Social Aspects were prepared.
Specific requirements were included in all bidding documents to ensure effective
execution of the mitigation measures during construction. The EMPs were implemented
12


﻿satisfactorily as confirmed by field and supervision engineers in project progress reports.
Under the AF, the project remained a Category B project with Environment Assessment
and Involuntary Resettlement triggered. EMPs for all five national highway sections were
prepared with specific requirements included in the bidding documents, in which the
ISDS was disclosed in February 2010.
2.4.3 Social Safeguards. A Resettlement Action Plan was not required as there was no
land acquisition or resettlement associated with Project activities. The widening of three
road sections (total 73 km) and construction of overpasses on three road junctions were
carried out within the established rights of way (ROW) and on land owned by DOH. As
noted above, the ESSF was prepared to ensure compliance with safeguard policies on
Indigenous Peoples and Involuntary Resettlement in case any adverse impacts were
identified during implementation.
2.4.4 Under the AF, social safeguards screening for all five selected national highway
sections was done. Since the proposed widening of selected road sections was to be
carried out within the established ROW, no land acquisition and no significant demolition
and displacement of population was required. Therefore, no resettlement action plan was
prepared. However, a Resettlement Mitigation Plan (RMP) was prepared to address the
limited resettlement impacts within the ROW to 21 temporary shops, and temporary use
of 2.4 hectares of land areas by three households for planting paddy and sugarcane. The
RMP summarized the in-kind rehabilitation measures to be provided to the 24 affected
households. The RMP was not implemented due to bid failures as noted above.
2.4.5 Procurement. As already reported, the AF was cancelled due to procurement
failures for nine civil works contracts, a major part of the AF activities. All procurement
activities remaining after the 2009 restructuring under the original project were
completed and fully disbursed by March 2012, eight years after effectiveness. Under the
original project, DOH handled procurement of civil works contracts effectively, but not
for consultancy services. The procurement processes for most consultancy services
(including design of performance-based maintenance contract, independent procurement
evaluator, independent procurement consultant) suffered from the INT investigation for
the allegations of improper influence to the procurement process for A-4 and D-1 (a),
inadequate interest from qualified consultants, DOH's lengthy internal processes and
uncertain timing of Parliamentary approval of the negotiated loan. As a result,
procurement was downgraded to "moderately satisfactory" (MS) on June 14, 2006 and
subsequently "Unsatisfactory" (U) on April 3, 2007. The project was restructured to
make productive use of the uncommitted loan funds. In order to address future
procurement risks, an Anti-Corruption Action Plan was put in place and training
workshops for DOH staff on Bank procurement and anticorruption guidelines were held.
2.4.6 Fiduciary risks were re-assessed for the 2009 restructuring and the AF, in light of
the above problems. Based on the updated assessment, follow-up mitigation measures
were agreed with DOH and acted upon. However, procurement continued to suffer.
Hiring of consultancy services remained challenging because of inadequate expressions
of interest, lack of qualified consultants, and delays, which brought down the
procurement rating to "MS" and later "U" after unsuccessful procurement of civil works.
13


﻿The project went through a number of changes but only one procurement plan dated
December 2007 was made available to the public.
2.4.7 Financial Management. There were no major issues in the Project's financial
management. DOH, through funding provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
hired a consulting firm to install and implement the accounting software, trained the
financial staff and developed a financial management manual. The quarterly interim
financial reports, together with a detailed discussion of project progress, were submitted
regularly by DOH. All audits received had unqualified (clean) opinions, and with only
one exception in 2010, all audit reports were submitted on time. (The 2010 audit was
submitted about five months late due to delays in appointing the auditor.) This was the
only time the financial rating was downgraded to "unsatisfactory". Overall, financial
management was reviewed regularly through the periodic supervision missions and found
satisfactory.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
2.5.1 The post-completion operation of the completed civil works will be the
responsibility of DOH. The asset value of the national highway network after the
completion of the original loan was increased. The historic floods of 2011, which
affected many parts of the country, did not affect the national highways improved under
the original loan. RTG is expected to continue using force account to carry out reasonable
levels of routine maintenance of the national road network to sustain the project benefits
for the anticipated life of the road. DOH has adequate staffing with technical know-how
and adequate budget, and with the improved road asset management systems.
2.5.2 DOH did not yet provide plans to finance the widening of the priority national
highways selected under the AF after loan closing.
2.5.3 The Thailand Accident Research Center (TARC), which opened in 2002 and was
supported under the loan, has been operational under the umbrella of the Asian Institute
of Technology (AIT). It is well-staffed with university professors knowledgeable and
specialized in crash investigation and road safety. TARC has been funded by various
domestic funding sources to cope with road accidents (e.g. Thai Health Promotion Fund)
as well as providing services such as accident investigation and reconstruction, road
safety audit, road safety training and seminars, and other road safety consultancy.
TARC's activities and reports can be found on their website at www.tarc.ait.ac.th.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High
3.1.1 During the long period of preparation and implementation of the project from
2001 to 2013, there were two major country assistance strategies issued by the Bank.
These were namely (i) the 2003 Country Assistance Strategy for FYO3-05, and (ii) the
2010 Interim Strategy Note for FYI 1-12. The project has been highly relevant through
these major Bank strategies for Thailand. For (i) the 2003 Country Assistance Strategy,
the project directly supported the pillar for Competitiveness - Support for Infrastructure
14


﻿Development with a direct quote of this project; and for (ii) the 2010 Interim Strategy
Note, the project directly supported the second Prong: Improving competitiveness, and
inclusive and sustainable growth; Cluster III: Infrastructure and climate change with a
direct quote of this project's AF components.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
3.2.1 The PDO was to assist the Borrower in enhancing the efficiency, productive use
and management of the Borrower's road network, through: (a) the commercialization of
the road sector by introducing better business principles and increasing private sector
participation in the construction and maintenance of roads; (b) the strengthening of the
institutional capacity and modernization of DOH; (c) sustainable road maintenance
programs to preserve road assets; and (d) the enhancement of road safety aimed to reduce
traffic fatalities and injuries. The following discussions describe the assessment on each
specific objective.
Specific Objective (a): Commercialization of the road sector by introducing better
business principles and increasing private sector participation in the construction
and maintenance of roads
The achievement of this specific objective is unsatisfactory. This specific objective was
clearly indicated to be achieved by the implementation of the PBC pilot maintenance in
the original Component A - (ii). Due to the cancellation of the PBC pilot maintenance
(but yet this specific objective remained without modification in 2009 restructuring), it
was not achieved. The Intermediate Outcome Indicator #5 (Output Indicator #1.3
discussed in para 1.3.2) was revised in the 2009 restructuring (Pilot long-term
performance-based management and maintenance contract designed for 150 km
motorway) and achieved, but the achievement of this indicator does not represent the
achievement of this specific objective, as the commercialization of the road sector was
not warranted by the achievement of the feasibility study and design only.
Specific  Objective  (b): Strengthening  of the  institutional capacity  and
modernization of DOH
The achievement of this specific objective is moderately unsatisfactory. The project
intended to support (a) the development of a centralized road asset maintenance and
management system (implemented by DOH own funds), (b) the development of a
framework and case study for PPP in highways (completed), (c) technical assistance for
project coordination (completed), and (d) strengthening of DOH capacity in procurement
(not implemented). The AF intended to support PPP financing transaction advisory (AF
Component 2) and Independent Procurement Evaluator and Financial and Technical
Audits (AF Component 3), but neither component was implemented (see Annex 2 for
details). In terms of achievements, the national road database was established, and is
being updated and used (PDO Indicator 4 and Intermediate Outcome Indicator #12 were
achieved), Intermediate Outcome Indicator #13 (PPP framework and case study) and #14
(environmental annual report disseminated) were achieved. However, Intermediate
Outcome Indicator #16 (PPP financing Motorway reached bidding stage) was not
achieved.
15


﻿Specific Objective (c): Sustainable road maintenance programs to preserve road
assets
The achievement of this specific objective is moderately unsatisfactory. This is measured
by two parts, the original project and its related indicators, and the AF project and its
related indicators.
The original project improved the sustainability of the road maintenance program
primarily through the successful implementation of Component A - (i), B - (i) and (ii).
The project achieved the periodic maintenance of 960 km of priority national highways,
73 km of national highway widening, and construction of three overpasses as intended
(see Annex 2 for details). These achievements contributed to the reduction of average
unit cost of maintenance (PDO Indicator #1), the intended increase of the asset value of
road network (PDO Indicator #2), and 1,556 km of roads rehabilitated (PDO Indicator
#6), but the intended VOC reduction target of 10-15% on target roads was only 9.7%
achieved with a final VOC savings estimated at June 2013 (PDO Indicator #3). The
related Intermediate Outcome Indicators #1 (average roughness target), #2 (73km
national highway widened), #4 (periodic maintenance of 960km), #6 (three overpasses
constructed), #7 (average travel time reduction), and #8 (reduction of average delays)
were also all achieved. So the contribution of the original project activities to this specific
objective was moderately satisfactory.
The AF project failed to contribute to this specific objective as AF Components 1, 2 and
3 were never implemented (see Annex 2 for details). Hence, neither of the intended road
user cost reduction (PDO Indicator #5), nor Intermediate Outcome Indicators #15
(widening of additional 216 km priority national highways) were achieved. So the
contribution of the AF project activities to this specific objective is unsatisfactory. It was
not rated highly unsatisfactory due to the fact that the delay in the AF civil works
components (failure of civil works procurement) was partly caused by the factor outside
of control of the implementing agency (see para 2.2.2 (a) for details).
Specific Objective (d): Enhancement of road safety aimed to reduce traffic fatalities
and injuries
The achievement of this specific objective is moderately satisfactory. The project
enhanced road safety by the partial achievements of Component C - (i) and (ii). The
project achieved the improvement of 37 hazardous locations out of the intended 66
locations, and support of the implementation of the road safety action plan and the
operation of the Thailand Accident Research Center (see Annex 2 for details). These
contributed to the achievements of Intermediate Output Indicators #3 (road fatality
reduction), #10 (safety awareness campaign), #11 (ARC established), and #9 (37 out of
66 hazardous locations were improved). DOH implemented the remaining 29 locations
with their own funds and more locations as part of their programs, and #9 is considered
achieved.
3.2.2 The overall achievement of the PDO is rated "Moderately Unsatisfactory". The
rating takes into account the achievements of the key associated outcome targets set at
appraisal and AF. In overall, the project did not perform well in terms of "enhancing the
efficiency and management" since the key TAs were not delivered. The "productive use"
16


﻿of the network was partially achieved with the completion of the intended road widening
and rehabilitation subprojects. The completed activities led to only limited improvements
in efficiency and productive use of Thailand's national highway network represented in
the reduced average unit maintenance costs and reduced vehicle operating costs. The
asset value of the national highway network increased as targeted. However, the
activities under the additional financing loan were never implemented.
3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Satisfactory for completed physical works
3.3.1 The project ex-post economic evaluation for the completed physical road
improvements was conducted based on the project monitoring indicators data and using
spreadsheet calculations. Since the additional financing was not disbursed, the analysis
focused on the physical works under the original loan only.
3.3.2  The ex-post overall EIRR of the original project was substantial, 56%, which is
only about 3% less than the estimated EIRR at appraisal. The post NPV was THB 37,345
million. Although it is about THB 10,500 million less than the estimated NPV at
appraisal is still substantial for the completed works.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
3.4.1 The PDO and the project design remained relevant to the Government of
Thailand's priorities and consistent with the Bank's country assistance/partnership
strategies throughout the period of implementation. However, the overall achievement of
the development objectives is considered Moderately Unsatisfactory based on the
combined relevance rating of High; the PDO achievement of MU, and the rating for
efficiency of Satisfactory for the original loan.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
3.5.1 Poverty alleviation and gender issues were not specifically addressed in the
project. Although no data on poverty reduction attributable to the project was collected, it
is likely that the rehabilitation and improvement of the highways contributed to poverty
reduction through job creation and improved access to social and economic opportunities
for people living in the project areas. Improving the national road network was the
country's economic development agenda, and its social development impacts were
demonstrated by the growth in vehicle traffic in the project areas, as maintained and
improved transport infrastructure contributed to increasing mobility and access to
services.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
3.5.2 The institutional strengthening component is rated "Moderately Unsatisfactory".
Not all activities under the original loan and after restructuring were completed (see
Annex 2 for details). DOH struggled from the beginning of the project in hiring
international consultants needed to achieve this component. The PPP advisory services
17


﻿were not hired due to changes in government policy, and for other consultants (PMS,
BMMS) DOH decided to use its own funds and completed. The project moderately
contributed in strengthening DOH's institutional and procurement capacities.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
3.5.3 The community youth helmet use project, supported by a JSDF grant of
US$834,200, was successfully completed in the 4th Quarter of 2011. The program
complemented the road safety actions supported under the project and anecdotal evidence
suggests that it reduced head injury and injury-related deaths due to motorcycle accidents
in Thailand, through the increased use of motorcycle helmets and awareness of road
safety issues. Using sub-grants to penetrate communities through schools, local
authorities, and policemen, the program was seen as effective and replicated with funding
from local insurance companies in other areas.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant
4.1.1 The risk to sustainable road sector management is moderate. DOH has sufficient
technical and financial capability of maintaining the road network covered under the
project with sustainable budget arrangement.
4.1.2 However, the risk of damage to DOH's road network as a result of climate change
and/or natural disaster is significant as was observed in the recent 2011 large scale flood,
although the 2011 flood did not specifically affect the completed project roads.
4.1.3 DOH's internal system to cope with governance risks remains significant for
likely affecting the future priorities. Because of recent political turmoil and shifting
policy directions, political influences may also contribute to the risk of sub-optimal
allocation of budget for road sector management.
4.1.4 The risk to improved competitive landscape is moderate. RTG has a priority to
improve the domestic transport to the remote area of the country, so that the concentrated
industries in the Bangkok region can be diversified for improving the competitive
landscape. That is expected to continue with DOH's sustainable road maintenance and
management. The risks related to the unexpected and adverse market behavior is
moderate.
4.1.5 The risk to road safety measures introduced in the project is moderate. The
achieved improvements of hazardous locations are limited by the number of locations,
and DOH is continuously working to further expand it. The TARC is achieving a
sustainable operation mechanism, and expected to contribute to the articulated road
accident data analysis and dissemination for country level awareness of the issue.

﻿5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.1.1 The rating of Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is "Moderately
Unsatisfactory". The key sector issues were thoroughly assessed in the Project design,
and the preparation was managed well including the identification of safeguards and
assistance with the preparation of the ESSF, in spite of the change of the Task Team
Leader at the late stage of the preparation. However, the project design was very
ambitious particularly in terms of introducing PBC pilot without thorough discussion
with DOH for its ownership and interest, and also the controls for a number of identified
critical risks were inadequate. The Bank appraisal of DOH's ownership of PBC was too
optimistic. The original project was designed with a primary focus on maintenance as
opposed to new construction, and overall PDO were closely aligned with both
Government and Bank strategies. The successful use of safeguards and fiduciary staff
from the Bangkok office to move the project along was efficient. However, delays in the
effectiveness, institutional and procurement arrangements of the implementing units
should have been properly identified as potential risks from a number of indicative
factors, as they eventually influenced the project outcome significantly. The monitoring
aspects were not well controlled; baseline values were not established for any of the key
indicators until 2005 (over a year after the project effectiveness) and as the old
"logframe" results framework was used, no annual targets were established to facilitate
monitoring. There was no formal review of quality at entry by the Quality Assurance
Group in the Bank.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.1.2 The rating of Bank performance in ensuring quality at supervision is "Moderately
Unsatisfactory." Formal supervision mission were carried out twice a year on average,
and the team members were largely based in the Bangkok office which allowed the team
to follow up regularly with reduced mission costs. The Bank team helped DOH tackle
technical issues by fielding additional experts specialized in key activities on an as
needed basis, such as road pavement design, PMS and BMMS technical issues, and
procurement capacity assessment related to the procurement misconduct and preparation
of the additional financing. Safeguards monitoring were adequately conducted. The
Bank was flexible in helping DOH manage delays by carrying out two restructuring and
three extensions of the closing date. The quality of these restructuring design was
reasonable and appropriate to address these design flows, except for the insufficiency of
the modified indicator (Intermediate Outcome Indicator #5) for measuring the
achievement of commercialization of the road sector (see assessment of Specific
Objective (a) achievement in para 3.2.1).
5.1.3 However, given the project was implemented over a decade and experienced
several major issues, the number of mission records (total 14 aide-memoires and 14 ISRs)
were limited and the documentation in file was not fully sufficient. The PDO and IP
19


﻿ratings did not properly detect the seriousness of delays associated with the PBC
consultancy (A-4), and they were kept consistently "S" to "MS" range even with the
significant delays caused by the termination of procurement processes of the two
consultancies (see Section 2.2.1), although the procurement rating was made "U" once
after the incident. Although the Bank provided additional resources in FY12 and FY13
to address these underperforming situations, the Bank did not put in place proper timely
measures to mitigate identified risks, such as DOH's internal procurement processing
system, weak procurement capacity, and governance. Although governance issues were
flagged from the implementation of previous Bank-financed projects in Thailand, it was
not identified as a critical risk, nor was mitigation measures put in place until the INT
investigation for two consultancy services started.  After the termination of the
consultancy procurement, the Bank team conducted a procurement capacity assessment,
based on which the mitigation (anti-corruption) measures were agreed and put in place in
the AF Project Paper in February 2012. However, its monitoring process was not
adequately documented.
5.1.4 The AF Project Paper also did not specify the annual targets for the results
framework which prevented adequate monitoring.   One of the objectives "the
commercialization of the road sector by introducing better business principles and
increased private sector participation in the delivery and management of roads" was
linked with the sub-component A - (ii), PBC contracts implementation. Without
successful implementation of PBC contracts, the above objective would not have been
achieved. The sub-component A - (ii) was cancelled during the restructuring but the
objective was kept in the restructuring. The focus of the additional financing, widening
of five selected sections (216 km in total) of national highway network was not
implemented due to the bid failure. The Bank's decision not to grant an extension beyond
June 30, 2013, for another round of bidding was correct. Retrospectively, the Bank would
not have done this as the AF. Notwithstanding the bid failure which occurred in the AF,
these activities could have been processed as a new project to avoid being linked to the
original project, which was already experiencing critical length and delays.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.1.5 The overall Bank performance is rated "Moderately Unsatisfactory" based on the
Bank's moderately unsatisfactory rating both at Quality at Entry and Quality at
Supervision.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
5.2.1 The Government's commitment to the project was not fully demonstrated with a
number of delays in the procedures during the preparation and implementation of the
project. The indecision of the Government on approval of the first negotiation results
conducted in October 2002 delayed the project preparation until the re-negotiation which
took place in September 2003. The signing of the AF loan was delayed due to delays in
obtaining Parliamentary approval, and effectiveness of the AF was further delayed when
20


﻿RTG was unable to issue the standard legal opinion necessary for effectiveness within the
required timeframe. While counterpart funding remained available as a part of the
government budget, the project also suffered some delays due to processing requirements
of using national budget.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.2.2 During the preparation, DGH effectively conducted the preparation activities with
close coordination with the Bank team with a strong commitment with the periodic
maintenance. However, DGH's commitment to performance-based maintenance was not
very clear, although the MOF encouraged the enhancement of new methods of more cost
efficient operations, i.e. PBC.
5.2.3 The DOH effectively implemented the main part of the original project, i.e. the
periodic maintenance works in Component A (except for the cancelled PBC sub-
component), highway upgrading and intersection improvements in Component B, part of
the intended road safety improvements in Component C, and some of the institutional
strengthening in Component D. The safeguard compliance was satisfactorily managed.
The key legal covenants were all complied with. The direct cause of the failure of PBC
sub-component was the termination of the procurement of consultancies, and it showed
governance weakness in the internal control in DOH. However, from the start of the
project, DOH was not interested in nor committed to the implementation of the
performance-based maintenance contracts. In spite of that, they accepted the PBC, which
was linked to the achievement of the PDO. The failure of the PBC sub-component
adversely affected the achievement of the overall PDO. Most of the failed procurements
during the implementation were due to the lengthy internal processes of DOH.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
5.2.4 In line with the harmonized evaluation criteria, the overall borrower performance
is rated "unsatisfactory" because of the government's unsatisfactory performance as a
result of weak commitment, the number of changes in the government and changes in
their requirements, DOH's moderately unsatisfactory performance due to lack of interest
and ownership in PBC sub-component and lengthy internal processes as discussed above.
6. Lessons Learned
6.1   The Bank should assess the interest of the borrower for proposed activities
carefully, and should not push its own agenda. The implementing agency also should
assess its own interests and ownership of project activities seriously and convey them
clearly.  The inclusion of the performance-based maintenance in this Project was
proposed by the Bank during preparation and supported by MOF, but DOH did not have
interest and ownership, leading to the eventual failure of the PBC component. Sub-
component A-(ii) (three long-term pilot contracts for PBC maintenance of 900 km on
national highways) was too ambitious for a first time pilot PBC for a client who had no
previous experience. PBC is a method for more private sector-oriented road maintenance,
which has proved to be more efficient in terms of managing road assets efficiently and
21


﻿effectively, and advocating for the usage of PBC in road contracts is generally right.
However, when these activities are proposed in a project, the status of the sector in the
country must be studied carefully. The PBC, i.e. public-private partnership in road asset
management, is desirable when the country's public road agencies suffer from a shortage
of public sector engineers or where public sector asset management practices are
inefficient. In a country like Thailand, where traditionally strong public sector oriented
road asset management is still prominent and working, the client's interest or incentive
for introducing more private sector led asset management practices is very low. Even if
such a new scheme is proposed, a pilot activity should be much more modestly designed.
6.2    Usage of Additional Financing for "scale up" (enhanced scope of work) should
be examined carefully. The AF for scaling up the four-lane highway widening of
additional five national highway sections (216 km) was approved as an enhanced scope
of work of Component B-(i) (original length: 73km). At the time, both the client and the
Bank thought it would be faster and simpler to process it as a scale-up AF; however, it
ended with failure due to the unavailability of contractors caused by the 2011 flood. This
AF was processed in 2010, after the original project experienced three different closing
date extensions of totaling 24 months. The additional finance gave a restriction of 3 year
closing date extension up to June 30, 2013 as the implementation period of the additional
finance activities (due to the Bank rule of 3-year maximum closing date extension for AF
activities). Even though the 3-year maximum closing date extension rule for AF activities
was no longer applicable by the time the project closed, the delays in the AF activities
when the original project has experienced substantial delays would affect its assessment
adversely. If these activities were processed as a new project, the Bank's tolerance about
implementation delays associated with the 2011 flood would have been quite different,
and the project might have survived longer for implementation. The Bank did not agree
to exceptionally extend the closing date further as the decision was clearly influenced by
the much delayed original project. The easy usage of additional finance, particularly for
scaling up, needs to be examined whether it would be the best financing modality. When
processing the AF for scaling up, it needs to ensure that the works financed by the AF are
doable in an appropriate time against the remaining life of the project. The age of the
project needs to be taken into account so as not to push the project into overage status.
6.3   Performance Indicators and targets should be clearly defined and the
monitoring process should be agreed firmly at appraisal The performance indicator
selection and target-value setting are critical to measure the effectiveness of project
interventions. Inadequate indicators and the lack of its monitoring mechanism distort the
project's performance results and lower the confidence on evaluation system. When
designing the project's outcome indicators, the indicators should be simple and
measurable, and should not be too many. This project had too many Intermediate
Outcome Indicators (16). While many indicators may help assessing each element of the
specific objectives, too many indicators diluted the overall evaluation of whether or not
the project was satisfactory in its intended achievements. Also the lack of monitoring
system without annual targets represented the lack of serious M&E mechanism
establishment at appraisal. The indicators should be carefully designed so that its
correlation with the project interventions is clearly identified and should avoid too much
external factors (outside of the project's control) coming into play.
22


﻿6.4   Improving road safety needs continuous efforts. Statistics show that road
accidents in Thailand still have high incidents and fatalities compared with those of the
developed world (see para 1.1.3 (iii) for details). Several key road safety improvements
were implemented during the project, particularly the improvement of hazardous
locations. Effectiveness of road safety improvements should recognize that: (i) there are
normally not sufficient details in road safety features provided in the engineering
drawings, and (ii) adequate technical knowledge is still required to ensure that roads can
achieve the maximum safety despite the recent major progress in the understanding of
road safety issues among professional staff in DOH. This lesson suggests that the road
safety improvements in hazardous locations requires that all safety measures are
specifically identified in the engineering drawings; and that continuous training and
dissemination is required on road safety design which should take into account local
behavior factors.
6.5    The fiduciary requirements for middle income clients need to be monitored
carefully. The project was initiated after long time lag (5.5 years) from the previous
Bank engagement in the sector. Although significant time had elapsed, the assessment of
DOH's capacity and internal processes to cope with Bank's fiduciary requirements was
concluded with an expectation of a reasonable level of their general capacity. While
many middle income countries have established their own fiduciary system, it may turn
out to be inflexible to cope with the external requirements, such as the one with
international lending institutions. The fiduciary assessment for middle income countries
like Thailand should be carefully assessed, particularly for procurement requirements, so
that their adaptability and flexibility to cope with the Bank's system are known in
advance.

﻿Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
3.1 Methodology at Appraisal Estimate
The economic evaluation for the original project at appraisal was carried out for four
categories: (i) periodic maintenance, (ii) performance based maintenance, (iii) highways
upgrading, and (iv) intersection improvement. The cost-benefit analysis was carried out
in 2003 using the Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4), which
simulates highway life cycle and vehicle operation conditions and costs for multiple road
design and maintenance alternatives. The appraisal evaluation was based on the key
assumptions: (i) an opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent; and (ii) an analysis period of
20 years; and (iii) economic costs on average 80 percent of financial costs.
A similar methodology and model were used for the economic analysis of the AF, but
since it was not disbursed, the analysis focuses on the original loan only.
3.2 Methodology for Post-Project Economic Analysis
Some components changed during the decade long implementation of the project and
performance-based maintenance contracts funds were shifted to regular maintenance.
Therefore, the ex-post economic analysis of the project using the same methodologies
and the HDM-4 model as in the original project could not be used. Therefore, the post
economic analysis was conducted based on the project monitoring indicators updated
during implementation and calculations were done in Excel spreadsheet. The original
project was mostly completely by 2009.
3.3 Assumptions
Some of the assumptions follow the methodology at appraisal, such as a 20-year
evaluation period and economic cost being 80 percent of financial cost.
Prices. The evaluation was conducted in THB on the conventional basis of constant
prices; that is without including the impact of inflation on prices. Prices in 2004 were
used as the base year. However, passenger time values are likely to increase in real terms
as the economy develops. The passenger time values are assumed to grow at 4 percent'
Traffic. Traffic data is assembled from actual traffic growth on project routes. The annual
traffic growth rate ranges from 2 to 19 percent, with the average of around 7 percent. Due
to fluctuations that may occur in the future, a conservative assumption of 5 percent is
used in this evaluation.
Some of the indicators, such as travel time, delays at intersections, road accidents, and
asset values, were collected up to 2008, as the consultancy contract for the project
coordinator expired. Although they were expected to improve further, taking a
Average real GDP growth during 2000-2011 is 4.2 percent, source: Bank of Thailand.
28


﻿conservative approach, the economic benefits of 2008 were used for subsequent years.
However, based on time series data collected as one of the indicators, the improvement in
asset values (both from maintenance and construction) was assumed to decline over time.
3.4 Evaluation Results
The results of the evaluation are summarized in the following table in terms of EIRR and
NPV of the original project.

*Additional Financing was not disbursed
At appraisal, the overall NPV was THB 47,925 million with an overall IRR of 59 percent.
The estimated EIRR post-project is marginally less than the appraisal estimate. The only
component where the EIRR and NPV are above the appraisal estimate is highway
upgrading. All other post-project estimates for NPV are below appraisal estimates. It
appears that the benefits were over-estimated, especially for intersection improvement, at
appraisal stage. While the intersection improvements can reduce traffic congestion and
delays, they also induce more traffic in other directions. The exchange rate at appraisal
was 40 THB/USD, but was around 30 THB/USD at closing. Appreciation of the THB
was a constraint in terms of budget and increased opportunity costs of the project.

﻿1. Project Background
The Highway Management Project is a loan project under apart financing of the World Bank.The Highway
Management Projects comprises of two phases, the Highway Management Project (Loan 4721 - TH) and the
Highway Management Additional Financing Project (Loan 7775 - TH). Loan 4721 -TH was signed between
Kingdom of Thailand and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) on 16
December 2003 and Loan 7775 - TH was signed on 11 June 2010.
The original loan amount set forth in the agreement is 84,290,000 USD and additional supporting by the
government fund about 61,260,000 USD therefore the total estimated project amount is 145,550,000 USD. The
additional financing amount is 75,000,000 USD with 75,000,000 USD governments funding totaling
150,000,000 USD of total project amount.
DOH is the implementing agency of the project. Various divisions of the DOH have involved in project
implementation, including regional offices and central office.
2. Brief Description of the Project
The objectives of the Highway Management Project are to assist in enhancing the efficiency, productive
use and management of the road network, through
(i)    the commercialization of the road sector by introducing better business principles and increasing
private sector participation in the construction and maintenance of roads;
(ii)  the strengthening of the institutional capacity and modernization of DOH;
(iii)  sustainable road maintenance programs to preserve road assets; and
(iv)   the enhancement of road safety aimed to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries.
2.1. The original project (Loan 4721) has four components and 14 sub-components as follows:
Component A: Highway Rehabilitation and Maintenance
(1) Periodic Maintenance: To carry out of periodic maintenance of selected sections on the highway network
that comprising about 700 km.
(2) Long Term Performance Based Maintenance: To carry out, on a pilot basis of a five year program of
highway performance-based maintenance on selected sections of the highway network, where located in
the central, southern and north-eastern province with totalling about 900 km., through contracts with
private contractors.
(3) Supervision of Periodic Maintenance and Road Safety Improvement: To supervision of periodic
maintenance activities.
(4) The Study, Design and Supervision of Performance - Based Maintenance Contracts:
Component B: Highway Rehabilitation and Maintenance
(1) Widening of three selected sections(73 km in total) from two to four lanes:
A.Si Chon -A.ThaSala
The works executed under the contract converted the existing two-lane road into a four lane divided
highway, within the existing 50 meter right-of-way, they involved constructing an entirely new carriageway
alongside the existing road, and recycling and resurfacing the existing road pavement.
A.NiKhom Kham Sroi - A.LoengNokTha
The works executed under this contract converted the existing two-lane road into a four-lane divided
highway by widening on both sides of the original centerline within the original 30 meter right-of-way
using a raised median to separate the carriageways.
B.NongBuaKhok - ChaiyaPhum
The works executed under this contract will convert the existing two-lane road into a four-lane divided
highway by widening on both sides of the existing centerline within the original 40 meter right-of-way
using a raised median to separate the carriageways.
35


﻿(2) Construction of three overpasses at critical intersections:
Overpass at Intersection ofRoute 22 and Udonthani Bypass Route 2
The works executed under the contract primarily involve the construction of a prestressed concrete
girder bridge, 350 meters long and 24 meters wide carries two traffic lanes in each direction (separated by a
concreted/ barrier) over the main UdonThani Bypass.
Overpass at KM.8, Ramindra Road
The works executed under the contract primarily involved the construction, within the Bangkok
Metropolitan Area, of twin pre-stressed concrete girder type bridges, each approximately 460 meter
long and 9.50 meter wide that carry the heavily congested Ramindra Road over the intersection with
highway route 304 and 3202.
Railway overpass at Ban Pong
The works executed under the contract primarily involve the construction of a prestressed concrete type
bridge. This reinforced concrete viaduct 550 meters long and 15.60 meters wide extends over eighteen
(18) spans of varying length and provides two traffic lanes in each direction (separated by a concrete
barrier) carrying route 323 over the main road access to A.Ban Pong and the adjacent railway line. The
structure also includes two side ramp bridges; one is an entrance across the intersection while the other
gives access to A. Ban Pong.
(3) Supervision of the Widening and Overpasses Projects: To carry out the supervision of the widening
and overpass civil works under component B-1 and B-2.
Component C: Road Safety Improvement
(1) Improvement of Hazardous Locations: (a) the provision of guard rails in about 10 locations; (b) the
signalization of about 42 intersections in selected locations; and (c) the provision of pedestrian crossing
and bridges in about 14 locations.
(2) Support for Implementation of the Road Safety Action Plan with the Global Road Safety
Partnership (GRSP):
Collaboration with Accident Research Program at AIT on Partnership
Basis to Establish Thailand Accident Research Center (TARC)
This component had planned the establishment, start-up and operation of a road accidents research center
within the Asian Institutional of Technology (AIT).
The Study of Traffic Accident Cost in Thailand
This component is apart indicated in the project description on the preparation of a study on traffic
accident costs.
The Study on Black Spots Program Evaluation and Road Safety
Engineering Capacity Strengthening
This component is an additional provision of technical assistance under road safety improvement.
(3) Additional Road Safety for Technical Assistance Activities: The additional road safety for technical
assistance activities is apart from the reviewed on the project fund utilization that agreed in June 2007.
DOH proposed to use the remaining loan fund for five services in road safety component.
Development ofAccess Management Policy and Guidelines for Safety and Efficient Operation of National
Highways: The QCBS-services are required to develop good practice policy and guidelines for access
management techniques and guidelines for traffic assessment of site development for safety and efficient
operation of national highways.
Development of a National Road Classification System and Speed
Management: The QCBS-services are required to develop road hierarchy framework and corresponding
speed zone management, in order to promote a nationally consistent operation and management approach
to roadway classification.
36


﻿Study, Design and Update of Traffic Control Devices and Roadway
Lightings Manual for Department ofHighways: The QCBS-services are required to update Manual on
Traffic Control Devices for Department of Highways as well as to update standards and specifications of
traffic signals and roadways lightings.
Road Safety Audit on Pilot Routes: The QBS-services are required to study and analyze facts concerning
problem of road safety, produce the result of analysis, recommendations and practical guidelines to
improve the safety of roadways, correct road defects and prevent road accidents through the road safety
audit pilot project that conforms to universal standards and create a prototype model and guidelines of
road safety audit.
Road Safety Knowledge Development and Dissemination (TARC): The SSS are planned to continue and
supporting to TARC for 12 months services. The main objective of this project therefore is to build on the
success of the first 3 year activities and further develop, utilize, and disseminate the knowledge to address
the road safety problems in Thailand. The outcome of this extended phase will enable TARC to become a
sustainable center of research excellence in road safety with adequate resources to continue a high quality
and useful research program in the future. The project's Final Report was submitted on May 25, 2009.
Component D: Institutional Strengthening
(1)Institutional strengthening of the DOH through (a) development of a centralized road database, road
asset maintenance and management system, and a bridge management system; (b)development of a
framework for and a case study on public-private partnerships in highways; (c) strengthening capacity in
project coordination; and (d) introduction of a highway specific e-procurement system;
2.2. The additional financing project(Loan 7775) has three components as follows:
Component 1: Widening of five selected sections (216 km in total) of national highway network from two to
four lanes (same scope as Subcomponent B-I of the HMP):
(a) Civil works (US$ 144.3 million including contingencies)
(i)  Route 201: Sikhiu - NongBuaKhok, 60 km
(ii) Route 24: Nang Rong - Prasart, 65 km
(iii) Route 331: Intersection Route 36 - Intersection Route 3, 28 km
(iv) Route 4: PhangNga - Krabi Section 3, 27 km
(v) Route 408: Ranot - Sathingpra, 36 km
(b) Supervision of the widening civil works (same scope as Sub-component B-3 of the HMP), US$ 1 million
Component 2: Public-private partnership financing transaction advisory for the proposed Bang Pa-in to
NakhonRachasima Motorway (same scope as Subcomponent D-1(b) of the HMP), (US$ 1 million)
Component 3: Financial audit (US$50,000, same scope as D-2 of HMP) and technical audit (US$ 50,000).
3. Evaluation of Project Development Objectives
The main achievement of the PDO as assessed by key performance indicators are listed as follows:
*   Reduced average unit cost/km of maintenance in real terms
*  Asset value of road network increased by 0.2% by end of project (or decline reversed)
*   Reduced vehicle operating costs by 10-15% on target roads
*  National road database established, updated annually, and used for planning, programming, budgeting,
and monitoring of highway investments and maintenance expenditures
4. Evaluation of Project Design
The project design aims to promote performance-based contract in DOH's periodic maintenance to reduce cost.
However, the shift toward performance-based contracts faces several complications as DOH is still largely
responsible for carrying out their own maintenance. The design of the project was perhaps too optimistic in
expecting major changes in DOH's maintenance practice.
37


﻿5. Evaluation of Project Implementation by Components
Loan 4721 - Component A: Highway Rehabilitation and Maintenance
(1) Periodic Maintenance:
There were implemented all about 675 km out of 65 projects as reporting ended in June 2009. The periodic
maintenance had been implemented in two stages, 55 projects in the beginning stage during 2005-2006 and 10
more projects at recentness of June 2009.
The NCB (National Competitive Bidding) procurement process had been arranged for all original fifty five (55)
packages during year 2004 to 2005 for the first stage. The first contract was started in May 2005 and last
contract was completed in October 2006. The overall progresses were successive as planned. Subsequently, due
to the loan saving under the civil works category, it had agreed in principle during 2007 that DOH would be
proposed addition NCB for more periodic maintenance under the remaining loan fund for the work category. In
the last quarter of 2007, DOH was selected some out of initial proposed locations for additional Periodic
Maintenance works under the budget constraint. The procurement had been arranged in January 2008 while
some procurement packages had invalidity dated of bidding price due to some delayed on the government
support fund. Subsequently, new additional projects which more proposed to utilized of the remaining loan
fund from the cancelled of Performance Based Maintenance project. Furthermore new procurement had been
re-arranged again in the first quarter of 2009.
Since then, there were 10 projects implemented for the second stage, out of all additional proposed until June
2009. However, there were indicated to use the project cost savings and the uncommitted funds to finance the
more of 37 packages for periodic maintenance. Therefore, the implementation of outstanding additional
projects would depend on the approval process on the project restructuring and additional financing.
(2) Long Term Performance Based Maintenance:
The implementation of this civil works component would depend on the commencement of the consulting
services of the study, design and supervision of Performance-Based Maintenance Contracts (component A-4)
and result of their works. However, due to drop on the consultancy and terminated the procurement process in
May 2008 that it may not possibility to achieved this component as original planned. Otherwise, the loan
allocation of this component had reviewed for future activities in Periodic Maintenance.
(3) Supervision of Periodic Maintenance and Road Safety Improvement:
Initially, there were QCBS (Quality and Cost Based Selection) consultants' contract with the Louis Berger
Group for a service period of 24 months on supervision activities for original 55 periodic maintenance projects,
and some initiated implementing of the road safety improvement component. Then, this contract was concluded
in January 2007.
In additional to the new recently proposed on additional periodic maintenance in 2009, there were requested to
hiring the individual consultant service for three(3) Highway Maintenance Engineers to supporting the DOH on
managing and coordinating the supervision works. The term of engagement on the independent civil engineers
have been made and commenced on February 18, 2009 for the additional 10 recently implemented projects.
(4) The Study, Design and Supervision of Performance - Based Maintenance Contracts:
This consultancy component was first arranged on original QBS procurement process for "the Study, Design
and Supervision of Performance - Based Maintenance Contracts" during year 2005 and 2006, but it was
cancelled due to some obstacle in negotiation process on the draft contract. Then new TOR had been revised
and divided into two phases for new QCBS procurement processes for "the Design, Procurement and
Monitoring of Performance - Based Maintenance Contracts in Thailand" during the last quarter of 2006. The
procurement process had been continued until the proposal submission in June 2007 and evaluation process
thereafter. However, the new procurement process was failed again similarly to the first stage in May 2008.
However, there were indicated under the restructuring that proposed to use the project cost saving and
uncommitted funds to finance a consultant to assist the DOH to study the feasibility of performance-based
contract (PBC) and to design a pilot PBC for the maintenance of about 150 km motorway.

The ICB contractor was started on October 1, 2004 and scheduled completion dated on March 24, 2006. The
final construction inspection was successfully conducted on March 20, 2006 when the works were considered
substantially completed in accordance with the contract. The works were completed within budget and on

8. Lessons Learned
Project Design and Project Preparation
-  The Precise project appraisal significantly contributes a lot to the project implementation stage
-  It is time consuming to prepare all the relevant documents in English. Even though the individual
procurement consultant (IPC) was hired to assist in preparing the documents, the time for preparation such
a document which is only 5 months still not adequate. So DOH had to complete the remaining part by itself
until the bidding process.
-  An incompatible of the Bank's guidelines and the Country's system of procurement procedures. The
discussion was to be made regularly in order to only make all stake holders have the same understanding.
The in-depth details of implementation condition should be negotiated and included in the loan agreement
at the initial stage. It will be very clear to all parties how to proceed without any doubts.
-  The proportion of the loan should be 100%. It would contribute to the government budget allocation
-  The Bank can help improve the appropriateness of the project cost by considering major factors that might
affect to the project cost in the future i.e. the fluctuation of inflation, labor fare, fuel, and also construction
materials.
-  The individual procurement consultant should be hired at the beginning stage as to assist DOH preparing
all relevant documents throughout the bidding and evaluation process.
Project Implementation
-  The method of selection that consider the total lowest price is appropriate for the project which is located
not too far from the others, so that the mobilization cost of machinery and equipment also the transportation
of construction materials have slightly effect to project cost. Practically, the project location which are
scattered and far away from each other will be affect a lot from additional cost from the mobilization and
transportation. It could cause the contractor's financial crisis and consequently stop working.
