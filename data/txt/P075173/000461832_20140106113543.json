unsatisfactory outcome, with the\n            performances of both the Bank and the borrower deemed\n            moderately unsatisfactory as well. While most of the project\n            development objective indicators and intermediate outcome\n            indicators were achieved fully or at least partially, three\n            were not achieved. The reasons for the moderately\n            unsatisfactory outcome were primarily the fact that some\n            targets were not achieved, and also because certain\n            important social issues were not addressed specifically\n            during project implementation. Significant lessons learned\n            during the course of implementing the project were: 1) the\n            Bank should assess the interest of the borrower for proposed\n            activities carefully, and should not push its own agenda.\n            The implementing agency also should assess its own interests\n            and ownership of project activities seriously and convey\n            them clearly; 2) usage of additional financing for\n            \"scale up\" should be examined carefully; 3)\n            performance indicators and targets should be clearly defined\n            and the monitoring process should be agreed firmly at\n            appraisal; 4) improving road safety needs continuous\n            efforts; and 5) the fiduciary requirements for middle income\n            clients need to be monitored carefully."}, "docdt": "2013-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
