                          (i)     to contribute to the gradual reduction of road transport costs and improve access, ease of transit and safety along the central part of Georgia's East-West
                         corridor, through upgrading segments of the East-West Highway from Tbilisi to Rikoti, including the rehabilitation of the Rikoti Tunnel; and
                          (ii)    to strengthen the capacity of the government, Roads Department and the local road construction industry to plan and better manage the road network.

                         of new lining and road wearing course plus the lighting was completed in November, 2011. The outstanding works, ventilation and safety systems and completion of the works at the
                         entrances would be completed during the 2012 construction season. There is a need to close the tunnel for these works. The additional cost to be factored in to comply with the latest
                         European standards will exceed the project resources, the roads department has requested that the balance be funded under the resources of the TEWHIP, as this action is
                         consistent with the project objectives of that project and is also compatible with the project description. This will be reflected in the next TEWHIP ISR.

                         This project also has an institutional component support which is linked to the other roads projects. Agreed activities are mostly completed albeit with some delays.
