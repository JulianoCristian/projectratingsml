I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Country background. Georgia is a small country with a population of 4.5 million1
located to the south of the Caucasus mountain range. The Rose Revolution in late 2003
brought into office a reform-minded government who embarked on an ambitious program
to stabilize the economy, curb corruption, and advance social and economic reforms. As a
result of the Government of Georgia’s (GOG) prudent macroeconomic policies and
implementation of structural reforms, GDP growth was robust with 9.3 percent in 2005 and
9.4 percent in 2006, at the time of project appraisal. The GOG acknowledged that the
sustainability of strong economic growth rates in 2005-2006 would require the deepening
of the integration of Georgia with world markets, and identified the modernization and
improvement of its transport infrastructure as one of its key priorities. However, in 2005
the country’s GNI per capita at US$1,320 was one of the lowest among lower middle-
income countries.

1.1.2 Road sector background. The country is located along the shortest route between
Europe and the Caspian Sea, providing strategic links between its Black Sea Ports with
Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Central Asian Republics, as well as critical routes to Russia
and Turkey. Trade with neighboring countries, both transit and bilateral, is thus an
important feature of the economy. At the time of Project appraisal it was the second
largest sector of the economy, accounting for 13 percent of GDP and 11 percent of
employment. Transport, storage and communications tripled their contribution to the total
output, from 4.6 percent of GDP in 1996 to 11.5 percent in 2006.

1.1.3 At the time of the First East West Highway Improvement Project (FEWHIP)
preparation in 2006, Georgia’s road network consisted of a total of 20,331 km, including
1,497 km of international roads, 3,354 km of secondary roads, and 15,480 km of local
roads. The road network was under the responsibility of the Roads Department (RD).2
The international road network was in good condition (70 percent in good or fair
condition), while secondary and local road network was predominantly in poor condition
(60 percent of secondary roads and most of local roads were in poor condition). The often
rough topography, low-capacity highways (often only 7 m wide without shoulders),
inadequate maintenance regime, poor technical standards of vehicles, and other adverse
conditions were main reasons for slow traffic flow and high risk of accidents. Georgia’s
2005 traffic fatality rate of 12 per 10,000 vehicles was among the worst of eastern
European countries.

  This number does not include population of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
2
  At project appraisal, the Roads Department (RD) was the Road Department of the Ministry of Economic
Development (RDMED). In 2009, the RD was moved to a newly-created Ministry of Regional Development and
Infrastructure (MRDI). “The RD” is being used in reference to this Department before and after this reform throughout
the ICR.


                                                         1
1.1.4 Despite offering the closest maritime gateway to nearly all Central Asian
countries, the Georgian route accounted for a negligible portion of the foreign trade of
these countries. Long transit times, poor road conditions, multiple border crossings,
multiple cargo handling points, and formal and informal payments and delays, explained
the limited use of the Caucasus route. Constraints in infrastructure added to the cost of
doing business, deterred foreign investment, added time and costs to the transit corridor,
and left large segments of the population out of mainstream economic activities. Poor
transport infrastructure partly explained why almost two thirds of rural household
agricultural production is for self-subsistence and about 20 percent of rural households
depended on depend on barter trade. Poor connectivity also contributed to the weak
linkages between farmers and agro-processors as few intermediate agents, wholesalers, or
farmer-based organizations exist.

1.1.5 The GOG’s transport strategy focused on supporting market integration and
maximization of the country’s potential as a transit economy. The GOG placed a strong
emphasis on the upgrade of the East-West (E60) transit corridor. The Government started
the upgrade of the first 15 km of the East-West Highway (E60) from outside of Tbilisi at
Natakhtari to Agaiani from its own budget. The proposed FEWHIP was expected to
support the upgrade of 13 km road segment from Agaiani to Igoeti3.

1.1.7 Rationale for Bank involvement. The rationale for the Bank assistance was the
Bank’s global knowledge and sector experience in Georgia. The Bank was assigned by
the Government a leading role among development partners, i.e., KF, JBIC, ADB and
EBRD, to coordinate and lead a very significant share of the E60 Highway program,
while the other partners were planning to contribute in various ways through the
financing of short sections of the E60 or feasibility studies of other sections for future
investments. A good understanding and trust resulted from the Bank’s long involvement
meant and the Bank was able to provide substantial assistance to the GOG and the RD.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 The Project Development Objectives (PDO) of FEWHIP which was approved on
December 5, 2006 were:

(i)     To contribute to the gradual reduction of road transport costs and improve access,
ease of transit, and safety along the central part of Georgia's East-West corridor, through

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.3.1 The Project had an Additional Financing (AF) Loan, including revised PDO,
which involved a Level-1 Restructuring and was approved by the Board on November
10, 2009.The PDO was slightly expanded to finance the rehabilitation of the Rikoti
Tunnel. The revised PDO became:

    (i) To contribute to the gradual reduction of road transport costs and improve access,
         ease of transit and safety along the central part of Georgia's East-West corridor,
         through upgrading segments of the East-West Highway from Tbilisi to Rikoti,
         including rehabilitation of the Rikoti Tunnel; and
    (ii) To strengthen the capacity of the government, the RD and the local road construction
         industry, to plan and better manage the road network.

1.3.2 The results framework and the monitoring indicators were updated to reflect
inclusion of new activities. The additional indicators included:

      (A) Project Outcome Indicators:
       Rikoti Tunnel meeting safety standards4.

      (B) Intermediate Outcome Indicators:
       Rikoti Tunnel rehabilitated;

         developed to pilot test the recommended approach on the East-West Highway and
         border crossings;
        Road management system operational and populated with data;
        Road and traffic safety law drafted; and
        Laboratories for Technical University equipped and used in teaching.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The primary target group, as implied in several sections of the PAD, included
road users and communities living along the E60 Highway or connected to it through
lower-level roads. The project was expected to lead to better road quality and level of
serviceability, avoiding or deferring costly congestions expected on the basis of mid-term
traffic projections, better road safety through new alignments and city bypasses, avoiding
hazardous crossing of urban areas by heavy transit traffic, and savings derived from
shorter travel times. It was also expected to directly contribute to economic development
by reducing transportation costs and linking communities to Tbilisi, a center for
employment and outlet for agricultural products and commercial goods.

1.4.2 The secondary groups of beneficiaries included the GOG, the RD, the sector
Ministry (MOED at that time), the universities and the local road industry. The project
was expected to further the GOG’s priority to develop a transit economy and encourage
investment in growth sectors through reducing transportation costs (in terms of transit
time, accident rates and vehicle wear and tear) within Georgia in the cost of inventory for
goods in transit and the cost of goods and products manufactured in Georgia. The
FEWHIP was expected to continue and deepen the capacity building underway at the RD
through continuing the updating of design standards started under the Georgia Roads
Project (2000) 5 to ensure consistency with modern European practice. It was also
expected to initiate a program to improve the human capital in the road sector, introduce
management information systems and other new planning tools, along with transparency
and accountability initiatives in the use of public resources, and provide technical
assistance to establish road data collection so multi-year programs could be developed
and a sound financial management system be implemented. Training was also expected
to be delivered on effective road maintenance and capacity building for environmental,
social, and safety issues. The long-term objective was that after the highway
improvement projects are completed, the RD would be a more modern government entity
with proper planning and budgeting capabilities 6 and updated human resource
management. The Project was also expected to provide capacity building to universities
and private industries to broadly upgrade the technical base which would benefit Georgia
in the medium to long-term.

  Included technical assistance to review and revise the technical standards and specifications for road pavements in
Georgia.
6
  For instance, the selection of roads for maintenance was partly influenced by the volume of complaints.

1.4.4 The FEWHIP AF was designed to complement the expected benefits for the same
groups of beneficiaries targeted by the FEWHIP.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1 Component 1: Upgrade of the Agaiani to Igoeti section of the E60 Highway
from two lanes to four lanes (US$ 24.9 million): This component comprised: (i) civil
works for the upgrade from 2 to 4 lanes of a 13 km section of the E60 highway from
Agaiani to Igoeti including the rehabilitation of the existing 2 lanes where necessary; and
(ii) consultant services for the supervision of the works for this section. The widening of
the highway was expected to be mostly within the right of way already owned by
RDMED. Very limited land acquisition of approximately 3 hectares was required for the
construction of traffic interchanges. Land acquisition was expected to be financed solely
by the GOG.

1.5.2 Component 2: Road Sector Institutional Development and Capacity Building
(US$ 1.45 million): This component comprised specialized consultancy studies,
technical assistance, training, services, and equipment as needed to support the
Government, RDMED and local road construction industry to strengthen their capacities.
Discussions with entities such as the MOED, RDMED, local contracting, design and
construction companies have identified the following areas for the provision of technical
assistance, equipment and software, and training:

(i)        Road Investment and Maintenance Planning:
          Technical assistance for the establishment of road data base and the integration of
           the data to the different management information systems; and
          Technical assistance and training for RDMED on the use of the HDM4 system, its
           calibration and the industry-wide dissemination of the HDM4 system.

(ii)       Improving Road Sector Capacity:
          Preparation of standards for design and bidding documents for the maintenance,
           rehabilitation and construction of roads, including technical assistance to improve
           the contractual arrangements;
          Assistance to the Technical University to modernize the curriculum and prepare
           "tomorrow’s road engineers";
          Workshops and seminars to improve industry capacity;
          Preparation of a new road law;
          Improving the effectiveness of RDMED staff through modern human resource
           management practices and capacity building; and
          Equipment (e.g. for data collection, laboratory, cars, office computers, software,
           office equipment/furniture, etc.).

(iii)      Environmental and road safety management:
          Training to the new environmental/land acquisition unit in RDMED to integrate
           environmental, social and safety concerns in road management.



                                                5
1.5.3 The consultancy services and training under this component were expected to be
financed solely by the Government using Bank procedures.

1.5.4 Component 3: Project implementation (US$0.8 million): the component was
expected to fund consultant services for the Transport Reform and Rehabilitation Center
(TRRC), 7 project audits and finance incremental operational costs to support
implementation of the project.

1.5.5 The total project cost for all components was estimated at US$28.3, which
included an unallocated amount of US$1.2 million to cover contingencies.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 Under the FEWHIP AF, the Project’s components remained unchanged, but their
scope and titles were adjusted to reflect additional civil works and technical assistance.
The FEWHIP AF’s components consisted of following additional activities:

1.6.2 Component 1: Rehabilitation of Rikoti Tunnel (US$30 million). This
component was expected to (i) rehabilitate the Rikoti tunnel in order to: (a) restore
structural integrity, (b) improve the ventilation system, (c) improve the lighting system,
(d) provide fire and traffic safety facilities, and (ii) carry out repairs to the Rikoti tunnel
by-pass road. Financing comprised funding for civil works and equipment upgrades.
Supervision costs and technical audits of civil works were covered under a contract to be
funded by the Third East-West Highway Improvement (TEWHIP). This operation did not
require any land acquisition.

1.6.3 Component 2: Road Sector Institutional Development and Capacity Building
(US$ 1.43 million). The FEWHIP AF was expected to provide funding for technical
assistance for: (i) developing a framework for highway rest areas, (ii) implementing a
road management system, (iii) preparing a new road and traffic safety draft law8, and
(iv) scaling up support for the Technical University road transport department.

1.6.4 Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation
(US$0.34 million). It was expected to provide institutional support to the RD and the
TRRC related to Project implementation, audits and Project monitoring and evaluation.

1.6.5 The total Project cost for all components of the FEWHIP AF was estimated at
US$35 million, which included an unallocated US$3.2 million to cover contingencies.



7
  TRRC’s assistance to RDMED was funded under the on-going SLRP. The FEWHIP was expected to supplement
SLRP funding when necessary or for activities specific to the new project and not covered under SLRP and cover
TRRC’s services when the implementation of SLRP was completed. The compensation package was monitored by
RDMED.
8
  An assignment under the FEWHIP was to prepare a new road law. It was agreed to replace this earlier assignment
under FEWHIP-AF with the preparation of a road law, which also reflected the recent adoption of the National Road
Safety Strategy and Action Plan.


                                                       6
1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 As part of restructuring, the FEWHIP AF also changed co-financing shares of the
GOG and the Bank for project components. The Bank’s share became 80 percent, while
the Borrower’s share 20 percent for all project components (cf. Table 2 in Annex 2).

1.7.2 When FEWHP AF was under preparation, the TEWHIP was already under
implementation and it instituted new implementation arrangements that applied to all
externally financed transport projects in Georgia. All responsibilities for Project
implementation were transferred to the RD. The Foreign Projects Unit (FPU) was created
within the RD to be responsible for procurement, monitoring and reporting, technical
audits, and other implementation matters under all externally financed road projects. For
financial management, the RD was assisted by the TRRC, which had already performed
this function on previous projects. An updated Project Implementation Agreement was
signed on July 3, 2009, and amended on September 18, 2009, between the RD and the
TRRC. The RD technical supervision (including tunnel experts) and audit teams were
expected to support the supervision of Project implementation.

1.7.3 The original closing date of February 28, 2011 was extended by 28 months to
June 30, 2013, as part of the Level-1 Restructuring/AF in 2009. The main reason was to
allow sufficient time for completion of the new activities included as part of AF.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Soundness of the background analysis. The preparation of the FEWHIP was
initiated in late 2005. It was continuation of the Bank support to Georgia’s transport
sector since 1995. The Project preparation and Project design were built on the lessons
drawn from the on-going similar Bank-funded road projects in the ECA region and from
the completed Transport Rehabilitation Project, on-going road Roads project and SLRP
in Georgia. The four main lessons that were identified and highlighted in the PAD
included: (i) network management perspective is important for effective improvement
and maintenance of road assets; (ii) clearly defined and supported maintenance practices
aimed at improving contract management, the RD’s ability to supervise contracts and
piloting long-term performance-based maintenance management contracts; (iii) ensuring
the client’s ownership of the institutional components to achieve the objectives of the
institutional components; and (iv) implementing a phased approach to better design and
avoiding variations in complex construction projects (each phase provides an interactive
process to better design alignment alternatives, assess technical, environmental and social
impacts, cross-validate design results with engineering firms and other experts, and
benchmark investment). PBC was identified as an option but was not directly built in the
project design. Throughout implementation of FEWHIP the Bank team continued
informally updating the RD on PBC experience in various countries and helping the RD
become ready for experimenting with PBC under other follow-on road projects.




                                            7
2.1.2 Assessment of the Project design. The Project design was simple and realistic in
terms of components, geographic dispersion, novelty, involved organizations, and
safeguard policies involved. Geographically, the Project was circumscribed to a focused
area and provided the GOG and the Bank the possibility of building on preparation and
subsequent implementation of SEWHIP, SEWHIP AF, TEWHIP, TEWHIP AF, and
EWHIP-4. There were an adequate number of components (three), which were not
burdened by complex contents. The list of activities under the institutional strengthening
component and later on more activities added to the same component under FEWHIP AF
were extensive, but were integrated and demand-driven. The contribution supported by the
project was building the RD’s capacity in managing and implementing large-scale highway
projects. This enabled the RD not only to successfully implement these FEWHIP and
FEWHIP AF but in the meantime to start preparation and implementation of a series of
follow-up East-West Highway projects, in addition to other Bank-funded projects focused
on regional, secondary and local roads (SLRP, SLRP AF, KRRIP, and SLRP-II).

2.1.3 The financial arrangements were simple and only involved Bank financing. The
rehabilitation of the existing 2-lane highway section, construction of a new 2 lane
highway section, rehabilitation of the Rikoti Tunnel and the Rikoti Bypass triggered
environmental, pest management, cultural property, involuntary resettlement, and forests
policies within the project area. The implementing arrangements were not complex, with
the RD being in charge of the overall Project implementation and the TRRC providing
support to the RD in procurement, accounting, disbursement, financial reporting, auditing
arrangements, Project M&E, and coordination with WB and other financiers, if needed. It
was a cost-effective and logical approach because of TRRC’s knowledge of the Bank
policies and processes as a result of management and implementation of five IDA-
financed transport or transport-related projects since 1996. The RD benefited from
learning from TRRC’s experience, and successfully took over M&E and procurement
responsibilities from TRRC in 2009.

2.1.4 The PDO could have appeared as overly complex considering it comprised of two
sub-objectives. This was noted by some of the peer reviewers suggesting fine-tuning and
simplification of the PDO. However, in anticipation of a series of follow-up highway
projects, the Task Team and the ECA Quality worked closely to define a solid PDO that
could be applicable to all projects and at the same time encompassed anticipated project
activities/components. The revision to the PDO during Level-1 Restructuring did not add
complexity to the definition of the PDO but made it more precise. The original and
revised results frameworks reflected properly the original PDO and revised PDO, and
content of the Project components.

2.1.5 Adequacy of Government’s commitment. GOG’s strong commitment to the
project was demonstrated through efficient Project preparation, despite the RD’s weak
institutional capacity, close collaboration between the RD, the MOED, and the Bank, and
GOG’s readiness for 100 percent financing of the institutional strengthening component
(in addition to 30 percent co-financing of Components 1 and 2), and continued
availability of the GOG’s funds to support the E60 Highway Improvement Program. The
project was prepared and delivered to the Board within a year, which was a tight and



                                            8
challenging timeline for a large-scale highway project with an implementing agency that
had weak institutional capacity and was on a steep learning curve in a country going
through a series of major reforms in the public sector. The GOG also closely cooperated
with the Bank during the preparation of the relevant safeguard documentation not only to
ensure compliance with the Bank safeguards policies but also a comprehensive and sound
safeguards framework for a series of East-West Highway Improvement Projects, which
have followed up after the preparation of FEWHIP. The GOG’s also demonstrated
through support to the RD in smooth implementation of the project during the 2009
reform when a new Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI) was
created and the Roads Department was moved from the MOE to MRDI.

2.1.6 Assessment of Risks. The PAD of the FEWHIP highlighted the GOG’s priority
for a speedy project implementation, and assigned a low-to-medium rating to the risk of
failure to implement the project in a timely manner. Four main project-related risks were
properly identified during the preparation of FEWHIP and involved: (i) weak institutional
capacity of the RD to implement a large-scale highway project, (ii) risk of inefficiency
and lack of transparency in highway procurement and misuse of funds, (iii) lack of proper
maintenance for newly-rehabilitated and created assets, and (iv) the GOG’s funding
constraints. Mitigation measures were adequately developed and none of these risks had
adverse impact on achievement of the PDO or project implementation. As a result of
inclusion of new project activities, the FEWHIP AF identified a new risk related to
longer than anticipated rehabilitation of the tunnel due to unanticipated technical
challenges or traffic management issues. It was anticipated that remedial work could be
more extensive than anticipated after the tunnel lining is opened, and the Project included
contingencies to cover unforeseen technical design changes related to the tunnel.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 Implementation was rated in the Bank’s Implementation Status and Results (ISR)
reports satisfactory throughout March 2010 and afterwards moderately satisfactory,
mainly due to the implementation issues and environmental issues associated with the
rehabilitation of the Rikoti Tunnel till the end of the project in June 2013. There were a
number of key factors that affected project implementation and achievement of the PDO.

2.2.2 Weather conditions and unforeseen geological condition. One of the delays in
the rehabilitation works of the Rikoti tunnel was associated with inclement weather
conditions. The Rikoti bypass road was washed away during a severe rainstorm in 2011,
and the Rikoti tunnel had to remain open for traffic until the bypass road was again
rehabilitated. The second delay was caused by an unexpected collapse of the existing
concrete arch and soil in the middle of the tunnel without fatalities. Special geological
and geodesic surveys were carried out which suggested additional strengthening of the
tunnel walls to prevent similar accidents in future.

2.2.3 Complexity in tunnel rehabilitation relative to road rehabilitation. The
rehabilitation of the Rikoti tunnel was far more complex than that of Againi-Igoeti road
segment. The road contractor identified a few issues in the design that needed to be
addressed, and immediately brought them, together with effective solutions to the attention


                                            9
of the Employer/RD. However, execution of the tunnel rehabilitation contract experienced
some delays and cost overruns. After some delays (reasons described in section 2.2.2), the
concreting and pavement works were completed in November 2011, and the tunnel was
opened for the traffic. However, the contractor continued the ventilation, emergency and
signaling works. In July 2012, the RD made an amendment to the contract to incorporate
up to date European Tunnel Safety Standards with regards to ventilation system, lighting,
firefighting, etc. As the contractor was unfamiliar with the implementation of the European
Standards, a sub-contractor was hired to carry out these works. Overall, the contract was
extended several times and the contract price increased by 25 percent as a result of
additional electro-mechanical works to meet up to date European tunnel safety standards.

2.2.4 Continuity and commitment of the RD’s project team. The RD recognized the
importance of maintaining the same team throughout project preparation and
implementation and that continuity really made a difference. The project team was pro-
active in quickly identifying issues, bringing them to the attention of the Bank team and
jointly seeking solutions to resolve them, drawing lessons and immediately taking them
on board for other projects which were under implementation in parallel with FEWHIP or
under preparation.

2.2.5 Close collaboration between the RD and the Bank teams. Implementation of a large
road sector portfolio in Georgia since 2006 has been the foundation of a productive
relationship between the Bank and the RD, despite changes in the Bank’s TTL. This has
helped find efficient solutions to emerging issues and immediately incorporate lessons in on-
going projects or projects under preparation. When the construction delays and accidents
(described above) took place in the Rikoti tunnel, the RD and the WB acted immediately
together and an international tunnel expert was mobilized to advise on the case.

2.2.6 Mid-term review. The mid-term review was carried out during May 13-24, 2009,
time when the civil works on the road section were completed. Its main conclusion was
that the RD had to bring the technical assistance activities back on schedule. A detailed
action plan was developed for the entire technical assistance which helped the RD
implement most of activities by the end of the project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E was initially carried out by the TRRC. Since 2009, it became the
responsibility of the M&E Unit of the RD. Quarterly and annual reports on
implementation progress and monitoring indicators, which were useful for project
management, were submitted to the Bank. The Results Framework (RF) of the PAD
consisted of a list of outcome indicators and intermediate results for monitoring progress
and outcomes. The design included specific indicators for each component, and covered
physical as well as institutional results. The indicators were simple to collect. In 2009,
two Core Sector Indicators were introduced for monitoring as per the Bank institutional
requirements into the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs). The RF was updated under
the AF in 2009 to reflect changes to the project components/activities.




                                             10
2.3.2 The RF of FEWHIP and FEWHIP AF lacked two project outcome (PDO)
indicators to measure improvement in access and improvement in road safety. Because
the part related to improvement in access was dropped from the definition of the PDO of
subsequent East-West Highway projects, no relevant indicator was necessary in the RF of
either of East-West Highway projects. However, the Bank and the RD realized a need for
an outcome road safety indicator (fatality rate per 10,000 cars) and introduced it under
SEWHIP. This indicator remains in the RFs of ongoing TEWHIP and EWHIP-4. The RD
finds the road safety indicator “number of fatalities per 10,000 cars” to be very useful,
because it helps the RD determine whether it does enough to improve road safety. Most
of the same indicators are used by the RD in the monitoring of the on-going TEWHIP
and EWHIP-4. The outcome indicators of reduction in transit time and reduction in
vehicle operating costs along Bank-funded road segments are used to monitor progress
towards achievement of the CPS’s Strategic Objective 2: Strengthening Competitiveness
for Post-Crisis growth.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Environmental safeguards. This was an Environmental Category B project,
considering it consisted of an upgrade of the existing two-lane road to a four-lane road
within the existing right of way. The upgrade was envisaged in the 1980s and some
works including culverts and retaining walls were started at that time. The RD owned a
sufficient parcel of land on either side of the existing road and the existing two-lane
roadway expanded to a four-lane road within the existing right-of-way. The
Environmental Category of the project remained during the Level-1
Restructuring/Additional Financing, because it supported the rehabilitation and upgrading
of the existing tunnel and its existing bypass road and civil works were not envisaged to
transform the landscape or have a substantial or irreversible impact on the natural
environment.

2.4.2 An Environmental Review of baseline information and key environmental
sensitivities, and an analysis of alternatives, was carried out for the FEWHIP and the
SEWHIP in parallel to assist in planning and scheduling. All environmental safeguards
documentation was prepared, consulted upon and disclosed in compliance with
environmental regulations, policies and procedures of the GOG and the Bank. No significant
environmental adverse impacts were identified. The most sensitive areas were determined
around the villages of Agaiani and Okami where 11 monuments and archaeological sites
had been identified during the desk-studies and site visits, and around the village of Againi,
in the flood plain of the river Ksani where there are fragments of riparian forests which are
protected under the Forestry Code. A Specific EA and EMP were prepared in compliance
with Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01, Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04, Pest
Management OP 4.09, Cultural Property OPN 4 11.039, and Forests OP/BP 4.37 to mitigate
and manage direct and indirect impacts of the construction. The EA and EMP for FEWHIP
were disclosed in Georgia on September 15, 2006 and through the InfoShop on September
14, 2006. The final EIA for FEWHIP AF was disclosed on October 1, 2009.


9
    It was later revised into Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11.


                                                              11
2.4.3 The RD’s Division of the Project Analysis, New Technologies, and
Environmental protection under the Office of Technical Policy was put in charge of: (i)
managing the review of the EAs and EMPs for all RD projects, (ii) monitoring the
compliance of construction works and associated contractors with approved EAs, EMPs,
environmental standards and other environmental commitments — including associated
consultation and disclosure, liaisons with relevant ministries and agencies, and (iii)
supervision of the practical implementation of EMPs. A new environmental specialist
was hired in the first years of the Project and received relevant training (cf. para 2.4.9).

2.4.5 During the rehabilitation of the tunnel, there were several issues related to the
safety and health of tunnel workers (e.g., lack of adequate clothing and protective gear,
asbestos roofing used for shelters in the construction camp, accumulation of polluted
water during washing of the tunnel) and a serious environmental issue related to dumping
asbestos pipes together with the reinforced concrete waste in non-compliance with the
EMP. Under close supervision by the Bank and RD teams all issues were gradually
resolved. Tunnel workers were provided with adequate clothing and protective gear, and
asbestos roofing sheets were removed from the construction camp. Special boxes with
filters were arranged to absorb water polluted with heavy metals and toxics as a result of
washing treatment of the tunnel. In order to clear the waste in the bottom of the tunnel, a
certified sub-contractor was hired and it removed that waste material in the specialized
laboratory for further neutralization. In agreement with the local Municipality and
Georgia’s Environmental Protection Agency, the contractor designated an area where the
asbestos containing material was buried and properly informed the general public. By
closing of the project, on June 6, 2013, the RD received a letter from the Ministry of
Environment and Natural Resources confirming compliance of the burial location of
asbestos containing waste with the national legislation.

2.4.6 Social Safeguards. The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and the
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) were developed in compliance with the Georgian
legislation and the WB Social Safeguards Policy OP 4.12. The RFP, which was prepared
in 2006 as part of the FEWHIP preparation, set forth policies and principles for land
acquisition for both FEWHIP and follow-up SEWHIP. Public consultations were also
carried out during the preparation of the FEWHIP. The RAP for the FEWHIP road
segment was prepared, in consultation with the public, and disclosed through the
InfoShop on September 15, 2009. During the preparation of Level-1
Restructuring/FEWHIP AF, the same OP 4.12 was triggered as a prudent measure in the
event that: (i) additional land was required for temporary facilities during the Rikoti
tunnel rehabilitation; or (ii) further by-pass road widening was required to cater for
higher traffic flows or a different traffic management plan. A RPF which was prepared
for use only if land had to be acquired was disclosed on September 23, 2009.

2.4.7 It was anticipated that the FEWHIP would only acquire about 23 plots of private
land for a total of approximately 3 ha. During implementation phase, 8 plots were
determined to no longer be affected. However, three additional plots were identified to be
affected due to the construction of additional underpass and local roads which were



                                            12
requested by local residents. Eventually, only 18 land plots were included in the RAP and
contracts for compensation were signed with all 18 owners. All compensations were paid
to the project affected people. The total amount of compensation was GEL 55,133.85
(about US$ 33,014). No complaints were received.

2.4.8 Under the prepared detailed design for the Rikoti tunnel and by-pass road under
FEWHIP AF, the repairs of the by-pass road were expected to be done within the existing
right-of-way, which was unencumbered. Only one permanent structure and some kiosks10
existed on the top of the by-pass, none of which were affected by the civil works.

2.4.9 The FEWHIP also supported capacity-building of the RD in environmental and
social safeguards management through on-the-job training, training workshop on
mainstreaming of environmental, social and safety issues in road management, and
development of an environmental manual (cf. 3.5.1(b)). The Resettlement and
Environmental Units were separated from their parent Divisions and merged into a
separate Environmental and Resettlement Division in the RD on April 1, 2013.

2.4.10 Procurement. The procurement of works, goods and consulting services was
carried out in accordance with Bank Guidelines. The road, bypass road and tunnel works
contracts were procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). The
management of the procurement was the responsibility of the RD with support of TRRC.
The staff of the RD and TRRC were familiar with the World Bank’s procurement rules
and procedures thanks to their previous involvement in the Bank-funded SLRP-I. As of
the closing date of the Project, there were no unresolved procurement issues.

2.4.11 Financial Management. There were no major issues in financial management
(FM). The FM was handled by TRRC of the RD. The interim financial reports submitted
to and reviewed by the Bank during project implementation were found satisfactory, in a
format acceptable to the Bank, and with minor or no issues identified. Annual audit
reports were received on time and the auditor’s opinion was unqualified.

2.4.12 The total amount of the IDA Credit (IDA 4248-GE) and IBRD Loan (IBRD 7804-
GE) was US$47 million. As of December 4, 2013, US$48.15 million was disbursed,
which is a bit higher due to the exchange rate fluctuations of SDR and US Dollar for the
IDA Credit. The undisbursed balance was cancelled in the amount of US$96.86 on
March 15, 2011 under the IDA Credit and in the amount of US$3.14 on November 15,
2013 under the IBRD Loan.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 The newly-constructed and rehabilitated FEWHIP road segment, the Rikoti tunnel
and bypass road have been contracted out for routine maintenance, like all other
improved road assets in Georgia. A new Fourth EWHIP (EWHIP-4) approved by the
Board on May 9, 2013 has similar PDO as this project and other subsequent East-West


10
     Most of the kiosks had been built in anticipation of increased business during the tunnel closure.


                                                              13
Highway projects and their AFs. The new project continues supporting: (i) upgrading of
E60 to a four-lane motorway, (ii) improvement of road safety and access on E60, and (iii)
institutional strengthening to the RD and sector Ministry. The institutional strengthening
activities involve, among other activities, support for: (i) updating of a road sector
strategy, building road safety management capacity, creation of enabling environment for
the local construction industry, and improvement of manpower planning and development
by the MRDI, and (ii) organizational efficiency and manpower planning and development,
development of a strategic roadmap for development and implementation of ITS along
E60 by the RD. The new government in place since the election of October 1, 2012
recognizes the importance of sustainability of investments and newly-created road assets
and has emphasized effectiveness of the sector institutions. The current government is
considering institutional reforms of the RD during the next year.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 The PDO, design and implementation of the FEWHIP and its AF remain relevant
to the Strategic “10-Point Plan” of the Government of Georgia for Modernization and
Employment, 2011-2015, and the Bank and the IFC’s CPS for Georgia for FY10-FY13.
The PDO are closely aligned with the following objective of the Strategic 10-Point Plan:
“Improvement of Infrastructure” Point (Pillar) of the Strategy, that places an emphasis on
“developed, high quality and safe road infrastructure [….] to support the inner turnover
of goods, import-export and transit, as well as for the better accessibility to the resorts
and the regions, that will ultimately result in the creation of more jobs, and better
industrial and living environment.” Moreover, the PDO are highly relevant to the GOG’s
decision to increase transit traffic through Georgia and strengthen the country’s position
as the Regional Transit Hub. The PDO are also aligned with the following objective of
the CPS: “to support critical infrastructure improvement in order to spur foreign and
domestic investment” through “investment […] in the roads sector which is essential for
boosting the country’s potential as a transit country as well as to provide better
connectivity between rural areas and market opportunities.”

3.1.2 The designs of the FEWHIP and its AF are also found relevant because their
components were consistent with the PDO. The physical components sought to contribute
to the achievement of the first part of the PDO, while the road safety component was
designed to contribute to the second part. Implementation arrangements were
appropriately chosen to facilitate effective implementation of the components. The choice
of a lending instrument – a Specific Investment Loan — was appropriate to support
investment in the roads sector and implementation of road safety activities. The PDO,
design and implementation of the Project remain important and relevant to the global
priorities of improved road safety and prevention of road traffic deaths which are
reflected in the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety, 2011-2020 and Georgia’s current
National Traffic Safety Strategy.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 The achievement of the original PDO is rated as satisfactory. The rating is based
on the evaluation of the achievement of the original PDO, its indicators and outcome
targets as of November 10, 2009, the date of approval of the revised PDO as part of
Level-1 Restructuring as per OPCS Guidelines. The rating takes into account
achievement of the key outcome targets set at appraisal and associated with each of these
two sub-objectives:

(i) To contribute to the gradual reduction of road transport costs and improve access, ease
of transit, and safety along the central part of Georgia's East-West corridor, through
upgrading a segment of the East-West Highway from Tbilisi to Rikoti (Fully Achieved).
Around 21,40011 residents living within 5 km of Agaiani-Igoeti road section, all domestic
and international travelers using this highway were benefiting from improved access to this
highway and access to Tbilisi, ease of transit and improved road safety and reduced
transport costs as a result of improved condition of 13 km of this section. Upgrading from a
two-lane road to a four-lane motorway on this road segment led to a reduction in transit
time from 10 to 6.8 minutes (against the target of 7 minutes), and a reduction in vehicle
operating costs from US$0.20 to US$0.16 per km for cars (against the original target of
US$0.18) and from US$0.76 to US$0.69 (against the target of US$0.72) per km for
trucks12. Road safety was improved on the Agaiani-Igoeti section through implementation
of such safety measures as: (i) the installation of New Jersey barriers and guardrails; (ii) the
construction of highway accesses; and (iii) the provision of traffic marking and signs. There
is also no segregated road accidents data for the Tbilisi-Rikoti segment of the E60, and thus,
it is statistically difficult to confirm improved safety on this Agaiani-Igoeti segment. While
there was no road safety-related indicator in the Results Framework to monitor road safety
on the project section, the review of the country-wide statistics (cf. Figure 1 below)
indicates a decline in road accidents, injury rates and fatality rates in 2009. Because the RD
mainstreamed incorporation of similar road safety engineering measures in all road
construction and rehabilitation projects, which was one of the major contributing factors (in
addition to enforcement of seatbelts usage, etc.) to improved road safety country-wide, it
can be deduced that implementation of these road safety engineering measures on the
project segment contributed to improved safety from Tbilisi to Rikoti on the date of
FEWHIP AF, in 2009.

construction industry to plan and better manage the road network (Fully Achieved). This
sub-objective was achieved through regular use of RDB based on HDM-4 in multi-year
investment planning (regardless a source of financing) and regular data collection for
RDB, which was the associated outcome indicator for this sub-objective. In addition, a
number of other activities which were underway but not completed yet on the date of
approval of Level-1 Restructuring contributed to achievement of this subjective. They
included (a) preparation of Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment for
rehabilitation and construction of roads, (b) support to the Technical University in
modernizing the curriculum and preparation of “tomorrow’s road engineers” through
purchase of needed office equipment and computers with appropriate special engineering
software, laboratory equipment for testing of pavement of cement concrete and asphalt
concrete, more recent textbooks for the roads engineering sector, and (c) delivery of a
workshop for international and local contractors, supervision and design consultants on
best practices in modern engineering technologies and construction methods.

3.2.2 The achievement of the revised PDO is rated as satisfactory. The rating takes into
account achievement of the key outcome targets set at appraisal of FEWHIP AF and
associated with each of these two sub-objectives:

(i) To contribute to the gradual reduction of road transport costs and improve access, ease
of transit and safety along the central part of Georgia's East-West corridor, through
upgrading segments of the East-West Highway from Tbilisi to Rikoti, including
rehabilitation of the Rikoti Tunnel (Fully Achieved). By the closing of the project, around




                                                            16
21,700 13 residents living within 5 km of the road section and tunnel, all domestic and
international travelers using this highway were benefiting from improved access to this
highway and access to Tbilisi, ease of transit and improved road safety and reduced
transport costs as a result of improved conditions of 13 km of Agaiani-Igoeti road section,
the Rikoti Tunnel and its bypass road. Upgrading from a two-lane to a four-lane motorway
on the Agaiani-Igoeti section led to reduction in transit time from 10 to 714 minutes (same
original target) on the Agaiani-Igoeti section, and reduction in vehicle operating costs from
US$0.20 to US$0.1715 per km for cars (against the original target of US$0.18) and from
US$0.76 to US$0.71 (against the target of US$0.72) per km for trucks. Discussion on
incorporation of road safety specifications in the rehabilitation of the road section is
discussed under section 3.2.1. Higher safety standards than planned during the preparation
of FEWHIP AF were achieved in the Rikoti Tunnel through execution of up to date
European tunnel safety standards 16 . There is no segregated road accidents data for the
Tbilisi-Rikoti segment of the E60, and thus, it is statistically difficult to confirm improved
safety on this Agaiani-Igoeti segment, Rikoti Tunnel and its bypass road. Based on the
country-wide statistics a substantial decline has been recorded in road accidents, injury
rates and fatality rates over the period of Project implementation during 2008-2012
(cf. Figure 1 above; complete data for 2013 will be available in early 2014). Since the RD
has consistently been applying its approach of incorporating similar road safety engineering
measures in all road construction and rehabilitation projects and the declining trend in road
accidents country-wide has remained throughout the project implementation, it could be
deduced that implementation of these road safety engineering measures contributed to
improved safety from Tbilisi to Rikoti, including on the Agaiani-Igoeti section, Rikoti
Tunnel and its bypass road. From the moment of the tunnel opening until the ICR writing,
only one major accident (without a fatality) was recorded in the tunnel.17

(ii) To strengthen the capacity of the government, the RD and the local road construction
industry, to plan and better manage the road network (Fully Achieved). The above
discussion on the rating of this sub-objective of the original PDO remains applicable here.

   Population statistics for 2011.
14
   The difference between the actual values of this indicator at the time of AF approval (6.8 min) and at the closing of
the project (7 min) is very marginal. That marginal difference is attributed to a slight difference in the section length
used during the calculation of transit time at the time of AF approval and before the closing of the project. The section
length in the former case was determined using km post signs, while in the latter case GPS was used.
15
   The difference between the actual values of this indicator at the time of AF approval (US$0.16 for cars and US$0.69
for trucks) and at the closing of the project (US$0.17 and US$0.71) is very marginal. It is attributed to slight
differences between versions of HDM-4 used, i.e., HDM-4 1.3 used at the time of AF approval and HDM-4 2.08 at the
time of project closing.
16
   Additional safety-related works which were not anticipated at the time of FEWHIP AF preparation were included
(through amendment to the tunnel rehabilitation contract in July 2012) in order to meet more up to date European
Tunnel Safety requirements. These involved installation of transmission lines and safety systems, which still have to be
tested and made operational during the Defect Liability Period which is ongoing. This does not affect the rating of this
sub-objective because these additional systems are meant to more effectively monitor tunnel traffic and more timely
provide assistance in case of accidents in the tunnel. These systems are especially helpful to prevent minor accidents
from leading to heavy consequences.
17
   Based on the interaction with the current operator of the tunnel. No baseline data on accidents statistics in the tunnel
was provided at project appraisal because the Police did not (and still does not) segregate accidents statistics for
segments of the East-West Highway.

the approval of FEWHIP AF were completed.


3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 Efficiency in achieving both the original PDO and the revised PDO in terms of
Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) is rated Satisfactory.

3.3.2 The ex-post EIRR (21 percent) for the rehabilitation of Agaiani-Igoeti road
section which was completed before the approval date of Level-1 Restructuring/
FEWHIP AF is a bit lower than the ex-ante EIRR (24.6 percent), but is still significantly
above the 12 percent threshold (cf. Table 2). The ex-post EIRR (28.6 percent) for the
rehabilitation of the Rikoti Tunnel and the bypass road is also a bit lower than the ex-ante
EIRR (32.5 percent), but is still significantly above the 12 percent threshold.

3.3.3 Efficiency in both cases was affected by higher construction costs than estimated,
i.e., 7 percent higher in the case of Agaiani-Igoeti road section and 28 percent higher in
the case of the tunnel and bypass road. Higher construction costs were not compensated
by actual higher traffic growth rates observed from 2009 to 2012 on the project road
sections. Given the economic slowdown and the conflict with Russia in 2008, which
affected traffic growth rates, the cost overruns were not that bad and even lower than the
cost overrun experienced in SEWHIP where it was 34 percent. Overall, both FEWHIP
and FEWHIP AF yielded an EIRR of 25.0 percent, which indicates that they have a
robust economic justification. Detailed economic analysis is available in Annex 3.

3.3.4 In addition, efficiency in FEWHIP on the date of approval of FEWHIP AF and
efficiency in FEWHIP AF were also positively affected by implementation of a number
of key activities which have spread the effects of these achievements beyond the
FEWHIP’s and FEWHIP AF’s boundaries (cf. 3.5.1 (b)).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1 Since the original PDO were formally revised – through approval by the Board –
the following methodology was applied in the evaluation of the overall outcome rating.


                                              18
The overall outcome against the original PDO is rated satisfactory, because of
relevance of the original PDO, Project design and implementation to the priorities of the
Bank’s CAS and government programs, satisfactory achievement of the original PDO at
the time of the approval of FEWHIP AF/Level-1 restructuring, and satisfactory efficiency
of FEWHIP. The overall outcome against the revised PDO is rated satisfactory, because
of relevance of the revised PDO, Project design and implementation to the current CPS,
national and global priorities, the satisfactory achievement of the revised PDO, and the
satisfactory efficiency of the Project. Both outcomes are weighted in proportion to the
share of actual credit and loan disbursements made before and after the approval of
Level-1 restructuring. The final rating is arrived at Satisfactory. The summary of the
assessments is provided in Table 3.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 No specific data was collected to determine impacts on poverty, gender or social
development under the FEWHIP and FEWHIP AF. However, it is believed that the
improved condition of this road segment had a positive impact on residents living along
this road, road users, road venders, and school children in the following respects: (i)
better road quality; (ii) reduced traffic congestion time; (iii) better road and tunnel safety;
and (iv) savings derived from shorter travel times. This Project, together with the
SEWHIP, which closed in June 2012, and ongoing EWHIP-3 and -4, also contributes to
economic development by reducing transportation costs and opening economic
opportunities for communities living along E60 through better linking them to Tbilisi, a
center for employment and an outlet for agricultural products and commercial goods.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2 The FEWHIP and FEWHIP AF made substantial contribution to strengthening the
capacity of the growing local industry, RD and the government in road management
through establishment of a road database based on HDM-4 which is actively used for
cost-benefit analyses during planning and preparation of projects and evaluation of
completed project; preparation and use of an environmental manual; support to the
Technical University which trains today’s engineers (renovation of classrooms, provision


                                               19
of laboratory equipment, office equipment and computers, new textbooks on more recent
engineering technologies and construction methods); workshop on best practices in
modern engineering technologies and construction methods; and highway rest areas
management. The Framework for Development of Rest Areas prepared under FEWHIP
AF was presented at the conference with the participation of the MRDI, RD and donors.
The MRDI immediately applied it and implemented a pilot project which constructed
service areas along E60 near the city of Gori. The follow-on projects have continued
complementing the efforts of FEWHIP/FEWHIP AF in especially strengthening the
capacity of the RD (cf. Section 5.2.(b)).

3.5.3 The RD’s developed capacity in environmental and social safeguards
management under FEWHIP (until the approval of FEWHIP AF) prepared the RD’s
environmental and social staff for more complicated safeguards issues during
implementation of FEWHIP AF, SEWHIP, TEWHIP and their AFs and overall for
broader application of their knowledge and expertise. The creation of a stand-alone
Environmental and Resettlement Division in winter of 2013 demonstrates the MRDI’s
and RD’s recognition of safeguards issues in roads projects and commitment to
addressing them in compliance with the national legislation and donors’ safeguards
policies. The strengthened capacity of the Road Safety Unit under this Project and
SEWHIP is discussed in the ICR for SEWHIP.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.4 Additional 1.5 km of access roads to the Rikoti tunnel which were not planned
during the preparation of FEWHIP AF were rehabilitated under this project to ensure
better and safer access to the tunnel. As a result of the Framework for Rest Areas
developed under FEWHIP AF, the MRDI and RD successfully piloted a rest and service
area project along the East-West Highway.

3.5.5 Lessons drawn from the experience of the Rikoti tunnel reconstruction allowed
the RD to avoid any implementation problems during the construction of a new tunnel
(Gori Tunnel) under TEWHIP. The RD made sure that changes made in the design of the
Rikoti tunnel and up to date European tunnel safety requirements were incorporated in
the requirements of the TORs for the design of the Gori tunnel. The construction of that
tunnel started after the rehabilitation of the Rikoti tunnel but was finished with good
quality, on time and before the completion of the Rikoti tunnel rehabilitation.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 This is a core ICR and a beneficiary survey is not required.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.1    The risk that the achieved development outcomes will not be sustained is
moderate. The new government that came to power on October 1, 2012 recognizes the
importance and sustainability of road investments and the effectiveness of sector


                                           20
institutions in order to increase the competitiveness of the country. The recent creation of
the Road Safety Working Group comprising representatives of government and non-
government road safety stakeholder agencies to develop a Road Safety Strategy for a new
period demonstrates the country’s commitment to improvement of road safety. All these
issues continue receiving attention and support from the new government as well as from
the World Bank under ongoing projects (EWHIP-3, EWHIP-4, KRRIP, SLRP-II and
projects under preparation (SLRP-III). Provision of routine maintenance of the newly-
constructed and rehabilitated Agaiani-Igoeti road segment, Rikoti tunnel and its bypass
road has been recognized and arranged by the GOG. However, Georgia’s shrinking fiscal
space may make the GOG revise its priorities across sectors.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.1 The Bank performance in ensuring the quality at entry is rated satisfactory. This
project was the first of three projects planned under the then-CPS and more projects to
come later under future CPS in order to support the GOG’s East-West Highway
Improvement program. It was very important to determine the right approach (e.g., lending
instrument, implementation arrangements, safeguards frameworks, etc.) in supporting then
entire Program (not only FEWHIP) from the beginning to minimize possible problems and
ensure smooth implementation of all follow-on projects. The Bank has to be commended
for achieving this through applying a corridor and framework approach (cf. ICR for
SEWHIP), in addition to meeting the needed requirements for the delivery of this project.
This approach has allowed the Bank (and the Borrower/Implementing Agency) to manage
all East-West Highway projects manage in a unified and integrated way, with lessons being
incorporated immediately in on-going or new projects.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.2 The Bank performance in ensuring the quality of supervision is rated satisfactory.
Supervision missions were carried out timely and their frequencies increased once issues
related to the Rikoti Tunnel emerged. The Bank team was responsive to the RD’s
requests for advice on the tunnel related issues. It always worked closely with the RD to
jointly develop action plans either to address delays in the implementation of the
technical assistance activities, environmental or implementation issues related to the
rehabilitation of the Rikoti Tunnel.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory




                                            21
5.1.3 The overall Satisfactory rating is based on the above ratings, which are both
satisfactory, given for the Bank’s performance in ensuring the quality at entry and quality
of the supervision.


5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1 The Borrower performance is rated as Satisfactory for the entire project period.
The Borrower demonstrated strong commitment and support to the project through a
number of key actions throughout its preparation and implementation (see more detailed
discussion in Para 3.1.5). The most important is that the GOG ensured smooth
implementation of this project during the transition of the RD from the MOE to a newly-
established MRDI in 2009.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2 The performance of the Implementing Agency, i.e., the RD, is rated Satisfactory
for both its performance during project preparation and implementation and delivering
overall satisfactory project outcome. The RD experienced an important growth in
capacity especially to manage large-scale highway projects. When this FEWHIP was
under preparation, the Government indicated to the Bank its desire to move away from
free-standing Project Implementation Units and focus on building the capacity of the RD.
The RD’s project team had major English language constraints and lacked project
management skills related to large-scale highway projects. Nevertheless, the RD’s core
project team has stayed on a steep learning curve throughout implementation of this and
other follow-on projects. At some point the RD was managing six World Bank-financed
projects (including their AFs), in addition to other projects financed by other donors and
the GOG. While there were some issues related to poor compliance by the tunnel
contractor with the EMP and the national legislation, the RD was persistent with the
contractor and the compliance was eventually ensured.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.3 The overall Satisfactory rating is based on the above ratings for the Borrower and
Implementing Agency throughout project preparation and implementation.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1   A phased approach with appropriate technical controls should be applied to
complex highway construction. This lesson was rightly identified during the start of the
East-West Highway program and was incorporated in the preparation of the FEWHIP and
SEWHIP. It remains highly relevant now. In order not to underestimate the technical
complexity of highway or tunnel construction and, thus, avoid substantial cost and time


                                            22
overruns, the RD is implementing a phased approach to road and tunnel construction in
the GOG’s East-West Highway Program. Each phase is supported by an interactive
process in designing alignment alternatives, assessing technical, environmental and social
impacts and cross-validation of design results by a design review from engineering firms
(since the preparation of the FEWHIP AF to the TEWHIP), RD’s in-house additional
experts (which were hired after the completion of the SEWHIP) and international experts
mobilized by the Bank.

6.2     A corridor and framework approach should be applied in preparation and
implementation of the same type of road projects18. In this way, a corridor approach will
be followed in subsequent projects — and thus, the same framework will be applied
throughout the entire road corridor. This approach is especially valuable when resources
are limited and projects need to be done on a one-by-one basis. When projects are managed
in such a unified and integrated way, lessons can be incorporated in on-going projects or
projects under preparation without the need to wait for an ICR from which to draw lessons
and recommendations.

6.3     Construction of complex structures (large bridges and tunnels) requires parallel
support in standards, design and supervision beyond preparation of traditional design
and use of supervision consultants. Such a lesson will probably be even magnified when
the TEWHIP will be reviewed. In the case of the Rikoti Tunnel (and Gori Tunnel under
TEWHIP) safety standards were adjusted after contract signing with a view to adapt to
EU standards. This is because tunnel safety standards had been ad hoc in Georgia during
preparation and that the government later realized that given their lifespan these
structures would require upgrading. This resulted in an additional cost. Such occurrence
would now be avoided but remains a risk as long as Georgia does not have updated
standards. On the positive side, regular supervision by tunnel experts increased the
soundness of the initial design and later ensured a good final result. Specific testing at the
end of the works are more relevant for bridges (independent design and construction
checks) but provides similar comfort to the RD in a context where permanent capacity is
not easy to mobilize and keep.

6.4      Technical assistance activities which require revision of standards or practices or
legal frameworks to reach higher standards (e.g. European standards) or more modern
practices should always be designed with close collaboration between international
consultants and local consultants. This lesson was drawn from experiences of the two
activities: (i) preparation of a new road law and (ii) preparation of standards for design and
bidding documents for maintenance, rehabilitation, and construction of roads, including
technical assistance to improve contractual arrangements. Local consultants are better
familiar with their country’s practices or standards. While the Bank and RD timely realized
this and modified the TORs for the first activity and, thus, produced a useful output, most
of the outputs of the second activity were lacking local knowledge and experience in local
practices and standards and thus were found less applicable.



18
     This Lesson (6.2) from the ICR for SEWHIP remains relevant to FEWHIP, too.


                                                         23
6.5     Technical assistance activities related to modernization of human resources
(HR) management are likely to be implemented only if they are linked to the on-going
reform in the agency. This activity requires political will. If there is no ongoing reform
or modernization, the need becomes less obvious to high level management. This activity
kept being postponed under FEWHIP and was not implemented by the closure of the
project. However, this issue seems to be getting traction again and a similar activity is
now part of the on-going EWHIP-4. The concept of this activity has been tailored to meet
the needs of the anticipated reform of the RD and, thus, it has more chances to be
implemented.

6.5     The market for sophisticated information management systems (e.g., GIS-based
Road Asset Management System, RAMS) may be too small in a country which is small
and in a transition stage. Procurement of the RAMS was cancelled twice due to too high
financial bids in the first round and lack of responsive bids in the second round. After
each of these failures, the TORs were more simplified and eventually moved for financial
support from FEWHIP to on-going SLRP-II.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The economic analysis done at appraisal for the FEWHIP covered the main component of the
project, which represents the quasi totality of its costs (89 percent): the upgrade to four lanes of
the 11.6 km highway between Agaiani to Igoeti. The appraisal evaluation was done with the
Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4), which simulates life-cycle predictions
of road deterioration, road works effects and their costs and road user costs, and provides
economic decision criteria for road construction and maintenance works. HDM-4 analyses
projects by computing costs and benefits of different investment options in terms of savings in
road maintenance costs, vehicle operating costs, travel time costs and accident costs. The
appraisal economic evaluation was based on a comparison of the economic costs and benefits of
the proposed project with the “Do Nothing” scenario, which corresponds to the absence of any
capital investment on the road, but a minimum routine and periodic maintenance to maintain it in
its current condition. The analysis was done for an evaluation period of 25 years and a discount
rate of 12 percent. Allowing for a one-year construction period, the economic analysis yielded an
Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of 24.6 percent.

The economic analysis done at appraisal for the FEWHIP AF covered the rehabilitation and
upgrading of the 1,748 meters Rikoti Tunnel as well as its by-pass road, representing 81 percent
of the FEWHIP AF project costs. The tunnel had substantial ventilation problems, poor lighting
and its structural integrity and waterproofing was compromised. The tunnel did not meet the
minimum internationally acceptable standards of safety. Thus, postponement of the rehabilitation
posed a serious risk and, eventually, the tunnel would be too unsafe to remain open. The
economic analysis was based on unit road user costs computed with the HDM-4 model and the
base case for the analysis consisted of the eventual closure of the tunnel because of safety
concerns. The cost-benefit analysis was based on actual traffic volumes and forecasts, vehicle
operating costs and travel time-savings for users, and benefits derived from avoidance of traffic
diversion due to the closure of the tunnel based on traffic travelling from Chumateleti to Dzirula.
For the purposes of the FEWHIP AF economic analysis it was assumed that given the current
tunnel condition and traffic growth forecasts the tunnel would only last another five years. The
analysis was done for an evaluation period of 30 years using a discount rate of 12 percent.
Allowing for a two-year construction period, with the tunnel completely closed for five months
each year during construction, the economic analysis yielded an EIRR of 32.5 percent.

The following table summarizes the original project and the additional financing economic
evaluation results. Overall both projects yielded an EIRR of 28.8 percent.

The ex-post economic analysis of both projects adopted the same methodologies employed at
appraisal and the same key assumptions regarding the without project alternative, maintenance
policies with and without the project, and road user costs. The ex-post economic analysis of both
projects considered: (i) actual construction costs, (ii) actual duration and timing of the



                                                29
construction, and (iii) actual traffic growth rates observed during the 2006 to 2012 period. In
addition, the ex-post economic analysis considered an annual traffic growth rate of 6 percent per
year from 2013 to 2018 and 5 percent per year thereafter, based on the estimated average GDP
growth for Georgia from 2013 to 2018 given by the IMF.

The table below presents the estimated construction cost, the contract construction cost, and the
actual construction cost for both projects. Overall the contract cost was 95 percent of the
estimated cost at appraisal and the actual cost was 18 percent higher than the estimated cost at
appraisal. The actual cost of upgrading the Agaiani to Igoeti road was 7 percent higher than the
one estimated at appraisal, while for the rehabilitation of the Rikoti Tunnel and bypass road the
actual cost was 28 percent higher than the one estimated at appraisal.

The table below presents the estimated and actual disbursements for both projects. The appraisal
estimate of upgrading the Agaiani to Igoeti road considered construction duration of one year in
2007. The actual disbursements were 61, 37 and 2 percent respectively in 2007, 2008 and 2009.
The appraisal estimate of the rehabilitation of the Rikoti Tunnel and bypass road considered
construction duration of three years from 2009 to 2011. The actual construction period was five
years and the disbursements were 1, 36, 37, 18 and 8 percent respectively from 2009 to 2013.

The table below presents the ex-post economic evaluation results for both projects. The ex-post
economic evaluation for upgrading the Agaiani to Igoeti road yielded an EIRR of 21.0 percent.
The ex-post economic evaluation the rehabilitation of the Rikoti Tunnel and bypass road yielded
and EIRR of 28.6 percent. The ex-post EIRRs are lower than the appraisal estimates, on average
87 percent lower, due to the higher construction costs and delays on project implementation that
could not be compensated by the actual higher traffic growth rates observed from 2009 to 2012
on the project roads. Overall, both projects yielded an EIRR of 25.0 percent, which indicates that
they have a robust economic justification.
