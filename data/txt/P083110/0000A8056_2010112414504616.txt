                         engineers are ongoing with some delays.

                         As part of the additional financing, the main activity consisting in rehabilitating the Rikoti Tunnel has started well. The tunnel bypass road is completed and the contractor has
                         achieved most of the works scheduled for 2010 on time (the tunnel needs to be reopened for traffic during winter and works will resume in Spring 2011).
                         This project also has an institutional component support which is linked to the other roads projects. The key assignments are currently being procured (set up of a road management
                         system) or about to start (development of a new road legal framework).
