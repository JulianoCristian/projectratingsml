Railway Electrified Project\n            for China is one of the key state construction projects; it\n            passes along Zhejian, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces. The\n            project only affected the distant suburbs. The following\n            measures will be taken to resettle the affected households.\n            Compensation fee for developing the agriculture production\n            after adjusting the land will account 20 percent. The fact\n            that the amount of land possessed per capita and per laborer\n            along the Zhe-Gan railway is relatively large, land\n            acquisition for this project will produce comparatively\n            slight impact on the per capita land possession in the\n            affected villages. When first assigning land of\n            responsibility, each village reserved certain amount of land\n            for incidental utility and internal land reallocation\n            method, therefore, it has been adopted for all the affected\n            rural villages along the line. Land redistribution will\n            occur within several months following land acquisition. A\n            land compensation fee will be utilized mainly in the\n            transformation of the low and mediocre yielding field, in\n            the introduction of proved scientific and technological\n            achievements in order to raise the output value, which will\n            be realized mainly in: improvement of irrigation facilities;\n            amelioration of the soil, leveling of the fields and more\n            application of fertilizer; more funding in economic plants\n            which are expected to bring more profit; for example,\n            vegetables grown in green houses; development of such\n            sideline production as the breeding of pigs, cattle,\n            chicken, and ducks; sensible choice of 2 or 3 industries\n            with potential to alter the rural production setup."}, "docdt": "2004-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
