for the Second National Railways\n            Project for China were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: The efficient implementation of the\n            project again demonstrated the value of a well designed\n            project and clear and thorough project planning. The one\n            area which continues to require some attention is in the\n            area of resettlement compensation. The Minister of Railways\n            does not directly administer resettlement; this is done in\n            cooperation with local governments from the provincial level\n            down to the village level. On China railway projects this\n            can lead to a disconnect between the project's\n            resettlement action plan and actual implementation.\n            Reinforcing the control mechanisms is an important lesson to\n            be applied to future China railway projects. The use of an\n            independent environmental compliance monitor was a success\n            and is now being employed for other major projects with\n            potential environmental sensitivity, ensuring that proper\n            attention is paid to environmental safeguards while freeing\n            the supervising engineer to concentrate on technical issues."}, "docdt": "2008-08-15T00:00:00Z"}
