OBJECTIVES OF RESETTLEMENT PLAN AND DEFINITION OF RESETTLEMENT
TERMINOLOGY
This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is prepared according to the Laws and
Regulations of PRC and the resettlement policy of (K Involuntary resettlement )
OP4.12/BP4.12 of the World Bank. The purpose of this document is to set out an
action plan for the Resettlement and Rehabilitation of the Project Affected Persons
(PAPs) to ensure that they will benefit from the project and their standards of living will
improve or at least be restored after the project impact.
Acquisition of land and other assets for the project will adversely affect the
livelihood of persons who live, work or earn their living on the land that will be
acquired for the project. PAPs are defined as those persons whose income or
livelihoods will be adversely affected by land acquisition for the project. PAPs include
the following categories:
a) persons who have a title, right, interest, in structures (houses, enterprises,
shelters, or public buildings), land (including residential, agricultural, and grazing land)
or any other asset acquired or possessed, in full or in part, permanently or temporarily;
b) persons who use the structures, land or assets described above; or persons
whose business, occupation, work, place of residence or habitat adversely affected;
or
c) persons whose standard of living is adversely affected as a consequence of
land acquisition and/or resettlement activities.
Therefore, all these people who is affected will be considered and recorded
without considering its condition of property, land or location.
All PAPs are entitled to the improvement or at least restoration of their standards
of living, and compensation for the material losses they suffer. Compensation for
assets will cover replacement cost. No deductions or discounts will be applied to the
compensation amount for depreciation or other reasons. All PAPs deriving an
economic benefit from the affected land and property are entitled to receive
rehabilitation benefits in addition to the compensation for their assets lost. Those
PAPs without title, authorization or legal permission to reside, conduct business,
cultivate land or construct structures are eligible for rehabilitation of their livelihoods
I



and compensation for their assets on an equal footing with those with formal legal title,
authorization or permission to the assets.
The term of Resettlement and Rehabilitation:
Resettlement and Rehabilitation means: the arrangement of production and
living of project affected person, the restoration of the PAPs' resource capacity to
continue with productive activities or lifestyles at a level higher or at least equal to that
before the project.
a) the relocation of living quarters;
b) finding acceptable new employment for those whose jobs are lost or severely
affected;
c) restoration (or compensation) of affected productive resources such as land,
workplaces, trees and infrastructure;
d) restoration of other adverse effects on PAPs' living standards (quality of life)
through land acquisition, indirect resettlement impacts or other project impacts(as
harmful gas by pollution,etc.);
e) restoration of or compensation for affected private and public enterprises;
f) restoration of adversely affected on cultural or common property.
The objective of this RAP is to provide a plan for the resettlement and
rehabilitation of the PAPs so that their losses will be compensated and their standards
of living will be improved or at least restored to the pre-project levels in a sustainable
manner. Affected productive resources of businesses, enterprises (including shops)
and public facilities will also be improved or at least restored to their pre-project levels.

1.1 Project Background
1.1.1 Existing conditions
The Zhe-Gan Railway runs within Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Hunan provinces,
starting in the east from Hangzhou, Yiwu, Jinhua, Shangrao, Hengfeng, Guixi, Yingtan,
Xiangtang, Pingxiang to Zhuzhou in the west, totally 942.648km long. This railway
connects the Hu-Hang Railway, Xuan-Hang Railway and Xiao-Yong Railway at its
east end, and links the Jing-Guang Railway and Xiang-Qian Railway at its west end. It
runs across the Jing-Jiu, Ying-Xia, Wan-Gan, Heng-Nan and Jin-Wen railways. The
Zhe-Gan Railway serves for passengers and goods transportation between the East
China Region, South China Region and Southwest China Region, and is the busiest
railway trunk connecting the east and west of China and the important component of
the"8 -Longitudinal-plus-8-Transverse Railway Network" and the"4-Longitudinal-
plus-4-Transverse Express Railway Network" of China.
The Railway is under the jurisdiction of three railway bureaus, i.e., Shanghai,
Nanchang and Guangtie Railway Group, respectively managing the railway section
KO+000- K324+531.59 (324.634km long, by Hangzhou Branch of Shanghai Railway
Bureau), railway section K324+531.59-K889+670 (563.138km long, by Nanchang
Railway Bureau) and railway section K889+670 K944+546 (54.876km long, by
Changsha Company of Guantie Group).
From Hangzhou to Zhuzhou, the Zhe-Gan Railway has 111 railway stations
(including six complex railway stations at Hangzhou, five at Yingtan, and two at
Zhuzhou), 42 railway stations under the management of Shanghai Bureau, 62 under
Nanchang Bureau and 7 under Guantie Group. Along the railway length, there are
four key passenger stations (i.e., Hangzhou, Jinhuaxi, Yingtan, and Zhuzhou), two
marshalling stations (i.e., Yingtandong and Xiangtangxi) and one regional station
(Jinhuadong).
1.1.2 Necessity of railway electrification
The traveling speed-raising of the Zhe-Gan Railway by electrification has great
profound significance not only in the state's energy policy adjustment and energy
source restructuring, lowering of environmental pollution, improving environmental
quality, but also in self-developrhent of railway transprtation industry, enhancing the
3



capability of trunk railway in the network, increasing trunk railway quality, raising train
traveling speed, updating the service level, strengthening the competitiveness in
transportation market, decreasing the operation cost, increasing the benefit of railway
transportation and realizing the sustainable development of the railway transportation
industry. At the same time, the scientific and technological level in railway
transportation industry can be heightened and modernization of railway service can
be promoted. Therefore, it is of great importance to raise the transportation speed of
the Zhe-Gan Railway by electrification.
A. Necessary for state's energy policy adjustment and energy source
restructuring energy utilization
Taking electricity as driving power can facilitate using of wide range of natural
resources, which enable the state to use the energy in an economically rational way,
and is favorable to realize common-sharing of resources and optimum distribution of
resources. This can avoid additional long-distance transportation cost caused by oil
consumption of railway itself, avoid the non-normal oil loss in storage and
transportation, thus, reducing the operational cost of railway operation. This will
safeguard the energy supply and prevents the impact of oil price rise caused by the
international oil price escalation, thus, getting rid of the impact of oil crisis and
obviating the risk. This is also beneficial in take the full advantages of the electric
facilities along the railway route and in solving the environmental pollution caused by
burning of diesel oil, thus, promoting the environment-friendly development of energy
industry. Therefore, rebuilding of the Zhe-Gan Railway by electrification fully reflects
the state's energy policy, coincides with the state's orientation in energy development,
benefit the implementation of sustainable development strategy of the country. It is
the need for state's energy policy adjustment and energy source restructuring energy
utilization.
B. Favorable to rational distribution of electrified railways
The China's Main Technical Policy for Railways points out that electric power
driving method should be adopted along the main busy trunk railways, express
railway, specific coal-transporting railways, and railways on long inclined slopes and
in long tunnels. As a key trunk railway, the electrification of Zhe-Gan Railway will
contribute to realizing of electrified railway network in Each China.
4



C. Necessary for improving operational conditions and shooting at even
greater market shares
The rebuilding of Zhe-Gan Railway by electrification will be favorable to raising
the passenger train traveling speed, and arranging passenger trains arriving
destinations with a half day, and will improve the service condition to a great extent by
which the passengers and cargo owner can be satisfied in traveling speed
requirement, cosiness, quickness and keeping on schedule, thus, well positioning the
railway service in the future transportation market.
D. Necessary for raising traveling speed, lowering operation cost and
increasing benefits
The Zhe-Gan Railway will not only increase the traveling speed, greatly improve
the conditions of attracting passengers, satisfy the demand of transportation volume
and enhance the competitiveness in transportation market, but also expedite the
circulation of the locomotives and compartments, thus, lowering the operation cost
and the benefit of the railway utilization.
E. Favorable for reducing pullution to environment and improving
environmental conditions
After electrification of the railway, except few internal-combustion engine
locomotiveswhich will be used for local branch railways, the Zhe-Gan Railway will
totally adopt electric-power driven locomotives, which will greatly reduce the pollutant
emmision volume. It is estimated that the quantity of emitted smoke volume will be
reduced by 38.6%, S02 by 26.7%, NOX by 87% and CO by 48.5%. The energy
consumption will be reduced by 250500 tons, and the local environment along the
railway routes and around the machine repair spots will be definitely improved.
1.1.3 Significance of project
The Zhe-Gan Railway is the core section of the Shanghai - Kunming Passage,
and serves for most of passengers and goods exchange between the East China
Region, South China Region and Southwest China Region. The southwestern China
has abundant unique resources and is a labor souse concentrated area, thus, having
strong economic complementary effect with the East China Region. Along with
implementation of Western-Development Strategy, the social and economic
deveopment in the western China has geared up on quick track, the connection
between the east and west will be more and more tightend and frequent. The
5



Zhe-Gan and Jing-Jiu railways will jointly provide a simpliest and quickest in-land
passage between the Yangtze River Delta and Zhujian River Delta, and will provide a
good condition for enhancing the connection between the two major economic
developed areas. Meanwhile, the Zhe-Gan Railway is also one of the key passages in
the East China Region. Therefore, the Zhe-Gan Railway plays an important role in
connecting the eastern and western and southern China as well as the internal
connection of East China Region, promoting the economic development in the areas
along the railway routes, and implementing Western-Development Strategy and
shortening the gaps between the eastern and western China.
The Zhe-Gan Railway is the important component of the"8-Longitudinal-plus
-8-Transverse Railway Network" and the"4-Longitudinal- plus-4-Transverse Express
Railway Network" of China. It connects quite a few of trunk and branch railways and is
the most important busy railway running across the eastern and western China on the
south of the Yangtze River, playing an important role in communicating the East
China with Mid China Region, South China Region and Southwest China Region. The
Zhejiang Section of the Zhe-Gan Railway is the only railway passage of Zhejiang
Province to Fujian Province and Jiangxi Province as well as to the Mid-China Region
and Southwest China Region. It is also the key component of the City-to-City Express
Railway Network in the Yangtze River Delta. Upon completion of the electrification of
Zhe-Gan Railway the traveling speed and cargo capacity of the Railway will be greatly
increased. The project is in coincident with the state's policy of energy restructuring
and sustainable development strategy, and will promote the social and economic
development of Hunan Province.
1.2 Project Design and Design Approval
The feasibility study report of the project had been completed by March 2002 and
was examined at mid March same year by Planning Department and Engineering
Appraisal Center of Ministry of Railways. The railway route measurement was
completed in mid February - mid May in 2002. The preliminary design of the project
by No.2 Railway Investigation and Design Institute (herein after referred to as No.
Institute) was completed from April 1st 2002 to end of June same year based on the
(draft) examination comments to the feasibility study report, which was examined at
mid July in Beijing by the Engineering Appraisal Center of Ministry of Railways.
According to the examination comments to the feasibility study report and
6

1.4 Project Impacts
The Hunan Section of the Zhe-Gan Railway (K889+670 - K944+546) is
54.876km long and runs through 3counties/cities/districts, including Dongfu town,
Yangshanshi, Lailongmen, Huang-ni-ao, Banshan, Babuqiao, Xianxia, Yaojiaba,
Baiguan, Wulitun, Jianing and the end of Zhuzhou city. The project land requisition
and house relocation will affect 38 administrative villages (neighborhood committees)
in 11 townships (towns/street). A total of 2357.4 mu of various kinds of lands will be
requisitioned, including 1433.6 mu of farmland, 669.2 mu of woodlands, 235.5 mu of
building lands, 19.2 mu of unused lands; The project will temporarily ocuupy 828mu
9



lands, including 501.7 mu of farmland, 239.5mu of woodlands, 81.4 mu of building
lands and 5.4 mu of unused lands; A total of 29770m2 houses will be relocated, they
belong to 485 PAPs of 137 households in 15 administrative villages of 7 townships
(town/street), including 18255m2 of brick-concrete houses, 5441 m2 of brick-wood
houses, 6075m2 of clay-wood houses. In addition, the project will also affect 57996
trees scattered in the project affected areas and a few special items.
1.5 Measures To Alleviate Project Impacts
1.5.1 In project planning and design stage
The project construction will certainly cause land requisition, house relocation
and inhabitant displacement, and will unavoidably affect the existing living and
production conditions of the local inhabitants. During project planning and design
stage, the designer and project owner have envisaged some measures to alleviate
project impacts to local social and economic conditions, including:
A. In design scheme optimization and comparison, due considerations have been
made in project impacts to local social and economic conditions and the project
impacts were taken as key factors in the optimization and comparison of the design
scheme.
B. In order to reduce the quantity of requisitioned land and number of displaced
inhabitants, the designer follows the principle of"keeping the prject site away from the
densely populated area and reduce quantity of house relocation where possible, and
minimizing the area of requisitioned land and farmland as well".
C. Efforts were made to optimize the construction design, shorten the
construction period, and reasonably schedule the house demolishing and rebuilding
and construction time.
1.5.2 In project implementation stage
A. Enhance the public participation mechanism. Before project construction,
public notices were distributed, stating the construction commencement date, and
planned construction schedules, and publicizing the compensation criteria for
resettlement, house relocation and land reuisition. This is aiming at receiving the
public supervision of the project affected sites.
B. Adopt dust-reducing measures. In order to keep the project construction sites
in a clean and neat environment condition and to reduce the impact of construction ot
l0



the surroundings, water spraying for preventing dusts from the construction access
roads in the population densed areas in those days with fine weather and wind. The
The contractors are required to timely remove the excavated soil and rock through the
well-planned mucking routes, prevent overloading of the vehicles and adopt
measures to avoid rock and soil spilling out of the vehicles along the access roads.
C. Treatment of wastes produced at construction sites. As the project
construction period is long, there will be a large number of construction staff and
workers, and a large quantity of living rubbish and wastes of various kinds will be
produced at the construction sites, the project owner and contractors should timely
clean off the rubish and wastes according to the local environmental and sanitation
authorities so as to keep the sites clean and prevent epidemics.
D. During project construction, the local construction materials should be first
adopted and the local transportation service and labors should be used first so far as
technically feasible, so that the PAPs can be benefited from the project construction.
1.5.3 In resettlement action planning and implementation stage
In case when the house relocation and land requisition are unavoidable, the
following measures should be adopted to reduce the project impact ot the local
conditions.
A. Strengthening the basic date collection, in-depth analysis on the existing and
future development of the local social and economic conditions, and an operatable
RAP should be worked out with due consideration of the local reality, so as to
safeguard that the living standard of the PAPs will not be lowered as a result of the
project construction.
B. Enhance the internal and external monitoring and establish the effective
message feedback mechanism and channels. Efforts should be made to shorten the
information handling circle to ensure the problems encountered to be handled in time.
C. Effective measures should be adopted by the contractors to minimize the
project construction ot the local production system.
1.6 Project Schedule
According to the general project schedule, the project construction commenced
on Feb.28th 2004. The planned construction period is about four years, in which 20
months will be for the speed-raising works (completed in Oct. 2005) and 14 months for
11



electrification works (completed in Dec. 2006). According to the general project
schedule, the preparatory work for resettlement implementation has been completed
and the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) prepared in the light of the World Bank
guideline will be submitted in March 2004 to the World Bank for appraisal. The
resettlement implementation started in Feb. 2004. The official formalities for land
requisition, house relocation and inhabitant displacement are underway now and the
resettlement work are planned to complete before Jun. 2005, and the monitoring and
evaluation on the land requisition, house relocation and inhabitant displacement will
be followed according to the World Bank requirements.
1.7 Preparation for Resettlement, Monitoring and Evaluation
1.7.1 Breakdown of affected inventories and supplementary survey
In Jan. - Mar. 2004, under the leadership of Ministry of Railways, Shanghai
Railway Bureau, Nanchang Railway Bureau and Guangtie Group, the Project
Investigation Working Group was established, which is staffed by the persons from
the Zhe-Gan Railway Project Command Offices of Shanghai Railway Bureau,
Nanchang Railway Bureau and Guangtie Group, resettlement advisory unit, local
government departments at different levels and relevant organizations along the
railway (Jiangxi Section). With the technical guidance of East China Investigation and
Design Institute (the resettlement advisory unit of the Project) the Working Group
broke down the affected inventory indexes provided by No.2 Institute in Oct. 2003,
which resulted from the survey within the scope of land requisition and resettlement
as determined in the revised preliminary design, and carried out supplementary
survey. In addition, based on the survey into the social and economic conditions and
environmental capacity for resettlement in the project-afected areas, the resettlement
advasory unit provided the technical guidance and consultation in analysis on
environmental capacity for resettlement and formulation of the plans of land
requisition, house relocation and inhabitant displacement. The work in these two
months was actively supported by the local governments at all levels as well as the
village (neighborhood) committees and the PAPs. Inventory breakdown and
supplementary survey cover different affected objectives including various types of
requisitioned land, affected population, relocated houses and annexes, fruit trees and
woods and relocated special items, etc.
12



1.7.2 Social and economic survey
In order to analyze the project impact and formulate a feasible PAR, the project
command offices of Shanghai Railway Bureau, Nanchang Railway Bureau and
Gunagtie Company, resettlement consulting unit, local governments, and relevant
units along the railway, conducted detailed social and economic survey at the project
affected areas and host sites. The survey covered the land resources, industrial
structures, economic level, income and expense condition, population, living mode,
culture and custom, traffic condition, natural resources and possible future
development, etc. The survey was carried out by data collectin and sampling, and
based on the data and information obtained, the existing local social and economic
conditions and actual living and production conditions were analyzed.
1.7.3 Resettlement plan
The resettlement planning of the project was carried out under the leadship of the
local county (city,district) governments, which was based on the project affected
scope, and quantity of the affected inventory. The plan was prepared based on the
opinions of the villagers and resettlers and the actual conditions of the affected
townships, (towns, farms, development districts) and villages. The main measures to
be adopted in the resettlement are re-allocating the land within the original villages
and village groups, improving the infrastructures, developing the secondary and
tertiary industies, economic compensation and procuring endowment insurance. It is
to carry out the principle of production-developable reseettlement so as to ensure that
the host sites possess the basic materially living conditions and the potential for future
development, and to combine the resettlement with the regional economic
development so that the PAPs can restore their living standard or even better than
that before resettlement.
1.7.4 Preparation of resettlement monitoring and evaluation
The project owner has entrusted Importing and exploiting Researching Office of
Xinan Jiaotong University to carry out the independent resettlement monitoring and
evaluation for the project. The preparation of resettlement plan was organized by the
project owner and participated by the project design unit, monitoring and evaluation
unit and local governments at all levels. The monitoring and evaluation unit provided
the technical consulting service, the design unit defined the resettlement scope and
13



the local governments were responsible for formulating the specific schemes for land
requisition and house relocation and inhabitant resettlement. Since March 2004, a
great deal of work has been completed, including successive estaablishment of
resettlement organizations, determination of project affected scope, work outline of
the the RAP, survey of the project affected inventories, social and economic survey,
research work for policy adoption, formulation of the resettlement schemes, cost
estimate for resettlement compensation, etc.. The RAP of the project(Hunan Section)

2.3 Basic Conditions of Project Affected Households
The land acquisition of project impacts on 3 counties (city, district),1 1 (township,
town, street) , 38 administrative villages (neighberhood committee) , affected people
3751 (137 houeholds with 485 persons) . In order to further understand the basic
conditions of the resettlement households in the project affected areas and analyze
the project impacts to the PAPs, the project survey working group conducted survey
by random sampling into the basic living and production conditions of the project
affected households within the project affected areas. The of project affected
households were randomly sampled, and totally 55 sample households were taken
and investigated into their basic living and production status in detail. The samples
covered all areas within the project affected scope, and had the representativeness of
all affected households. The distribution of the samples are as shown in Table 2-1.

Lusong        Wulitun             3                5.5
According to the on-sopt survey, the project affected areas in Hunan Province are
mostly the economic developed places of"golden delta" area, and the local residents
have favorable condition for the secondary or tertiary industries. The statistics of
sampling survey results show that the per capita net household income of the 55
sample households is 3305 Yuan. The net income of family engaged in the secondary
or tertiary industries is higher than the family engaged in agrilculture. 92.6% of the
labors of the sample households are working in the non-agricultural industries, of
which 31% for non-agricultural industries and 24% work in industrial enterprises,
who are living in the towns. Most of these households live in towns and have rather
higher income. 50.9% of the residents's economic income was from commercial and
trading and food service, and only 15.4% from crop farming. The distribution of
income per capita is shown in Table 2-2 and the statistics of basic living and
production conditions of the project affected households is detailed in Table 2-3.
The labors of the project affected places working in non-agricultural production
were mainly working in food service, trading, transportation and building industry andn
other industries. The service field and industries have good labor absorbing capacity,
the construction of the project will bring about quite large job opportunity in these field
and will be the new income source of local resettlers.

3 Project Impacts
3.1 Confirmation of the scope of project impacts
The scope of project impacts is confirmed according to the revised preliminary
design report provided by project design unit, No. 2 Design Institute of Ministry of
Railways in Oct. 2003 including route change, passenger and freight transport station
and its nearby traction substation, work area and subarea of contact system.
3.1.1 Land acquisition for the project
The scope of land acquisition for the project is determined on the basis of the
revised preliminary design provided by the project design unit, No. 2 Design Institute
of Ministry of Railways in Oct. 2003. Land requistion for the project includes roadbed
of rebuilding route, drainage ditch, bridge and culvert, station and its nearby traction
substation, work area and subarea of contact system.
3.1.2 Temporary land for construction
Based on the revised preliminary design report provided by the project design
unit, No.2 Design Institute of Ministry of Railways, in Oct. 2003, the scope of
temporary land for the project is determined. The temporary land for the project
includes land occupation of stocking ground, excavation waste dump, production and
living area during construction and temporary road for construction, etc..
3.2 Investigation of project impacts
In order to find out the object and quantity of project resettlement and land
acquisition, under the leadership of Ministry of Railways, Shanghai Railroad Bureau
and Zhejiang Provincial Major Construction leading group office, a project
investigation working group was formed which is composed of the construction
Headquarters of relevant railroad bureaus for Electrification Project of Zhe-Gan
Railway of the, project resettlement consultation unit and the local people's
governments at all levels along the Zhe-Gan Railway (Hunan section). The project
resettlement consultation unit, East China Investigation & Design Institute is
responsible for the technology. From January to March 2004, on the basis of the
revised report on scope of land acquisition and relocation and material index in
preliminary design stage supplied by the project design unit, No. 2 Design Institute of
Ministry of Railways, in Oct. 2003, decomposition and supplementary investigation
28



was made for the material index of different affected objects such as population,
building, land and speical facilities influenced by the project.
The investigation method of population, land, building and its appurtenant works,
sporadic and special facilitie is as follows: with reference to the revised 1/2000 route
plan in preliminary stage furnished by No. 2 Design Institute of Ministry of Railways,
on the basis of right limit for site division of county (city and district) , township (town,
street, farm and development district) and village (neighborhood committee), in
combination with the revised investigation results of all kinds of material index in
preliminary design stage supplied by design unit in Oct. 2003, the buildings and their
auxiliary facilities are decomposed to detailed villages and households and
supplementary investigation is made to the population quantities involved in house
relocation, land is decomposed to detailed villages (neighborhood committees) and
supplementary investigation for other kinds is made, and the special facilities are
decomposed to detailed counties(city or district).
Owing to the particularity of construction of this project and some modification
comments and requirements for the revised preliminary design results the local
people's governments at all levels along with the railway and resettlers put forward,
the construction unit and design unit of the project and local people's governments are
at present negotiating, communicating and linking up. The design unit is also
revising the design schemes to result in corresponding changes in the scope of land
acquisition therefore and moreover pile-fixing and lofting hasn't been made on-situ for
most of scope of land acquisition.Accordingly, there will be some changes to certain
extent for the material index of project impact in impelementation stage based on the
revised preliminary design results. To confirm accurately each material index of
project impacts, in next stage the building unit, construction unit, the liability unit
appointed by the governments along with the railway and the objects (village and
household) whose land will be requisitioned and resettled will be organzied to jointly
take part in field measurementand checking of all material index of land quantities of
all kinds and relocated structures in the scope of land acquisition and it is necessary
for all parties to sign and approve.
29



3.3 Inventory index of project impacts
The land acquisition of this project(Hunan section) is 2357.4 mu totally(2218.6mu
for line and 138.8mu for station) ; temporary land occupation of all kinds is 828 mu
(for line); total relocation building area of all kinds of housing is 29770m2 (21531m2
for line and 8239m2 for station), involving 485 persons(319 of 90 households for line,
166 of 47 households for station) of 137 households in 38 administrative villages in 11
townships (town, street) of 3 counties(city, district), in addition, 57996 scattered trees
and a few special facilities are affected.
3.3.1 Land Acquisition/occupation
3.3.1.1 Permanent land Acquisition for the project
The gross land area of all kinds required to be requisitioned for this project
(Hunan Section) is 2357.4 mu (among them 2218.6 mu for route, 138.8 mu for station
yard), including farmland area 1433.6 mu (among which 1317.8 mu for route,
11 5.8mu for station yard), woodland area 669.2mu (among them 646.2 mu for route,
23 mu for station yard), construction land 235.5 mu (all for route), unused land 19.2
mu (all for route). The investigation results of land acquisition quantiites of all kinds of
county (city or district), township(town, street, farm, development zone) are shown
respectively in Table 3-1, Table 3-2 and Table 3-3.

3.3.3 Population affected by the Project
The affected population of the project was calculated through two measures, the
first is the actual affected population, which includes those to be affected directly by
house relocation, land requisition, the second is theory number calculated based on
the State Land Law, call population needing production rearrangement.
Based on the data from the design institute, the actual survey shows that, the
population affected by house relocation is 140 households with 485 persons ( in which
93 households with 319 persons will be affected by railway line and 47 households
with 166 persons will be affected by railway station).
According to 47th statute of the Land Law, calculation based on villages, a
population of 3651 persons (3316 for route, 294 for station) requires production
rearrangement. Viz:
population       needing           Land to be requisitioned
production rearrangement
Total land area/total agricultural population
Land to be requisitioned
Land area per capita
The resettlement population and production resettlement population are detailed

3.3.7 Affected facilities for production and living
The rural production and living facilities affected by the project construction
mainly include road of tractors, sidewalk and acequia, etc.. It has been considered in
project design to take palliation and rehabititation measures, therefore, their affected
conditions won't be investigated and counted. In the course of implementation, if other
47



impacts happen, the relevant material index and treatment measures will be
confirmed with the same principles and methods as this RAP.
3.4 Analysis of impacts of land acquisition on regional social economy
Land acquisition of the whole Zhe-Gan Railway invovles 3 counties(cities or
districts), 11 townships (towns, streets, farms or development districts) and 38
administrative villages (residents' committees) in Hunan provinces. To analyse the
impacts of land acquisition of the project on the local areas, the people concerned in
the project investigation group make a thorough investigation for the existing land
resources of the affected townships (towns, streets) and administrative villages and
make detailed analysis for the affected extent of each village and group on the basis
of material index of project impacts. See Table 3-15 for details.

From the table above, because Zhe-Gan railway is in linear and the affected range is
narrow comparatively, and normally tunneling for high mountain area and bridge for
valley region, therefore, the project construction has no big influence for the
agriculture of local villagers. Among 38 affected villages after analyzing one by one,
farmland decrease of 31 villages is less than 10% and so land acquisition has few
50



inflences on agriculture production, and other 7 villages over 10%(2 village above
20%), the largest is Yangsanshi street with 35.41%. The villages over 10% of land

5 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan
The resettlement plan for Electrification Project of Zhe-Gan Railway was
prepared jointly by Ministry of Railways, project command offices of Shanghai Railway
Bureau, Nanchang Railway Bureau, Guangtie Group Company, the people's
governments at all levels along the railway route, as well as East China Investigation
and Design Institute. The above organizations established a joint resettlement
working team to plan for the project resettlement work on the basis of the survey
results of project affected inventories and according to the current policies, laws and
statutes and the World Bank's resettlement requirements as well as the local actual
conditions.
5.1 Objectives and Tasks
5.1.1 Resettlement target
As the project affected places are in the areas where the traffic condition is good
and the economy is developed, particularly, the individual business households and
family-based enterprises are very popular. The farmers there do not take farming as
their main living means but mainly live on trading, running their own business and
providing labor service. The grain production level cannot be taken as the base for
determining the resettlement planning schemes. Therefore, the objective of
resettlement for this project is set as follows.
(1) The income per capita shall be recovered to the standard before resettement.
(2) The public infrastructures, school, hospitalize, social welfare level, natural
environment and traffic condition etc. shall be improved after resettlement.
5.1.2 Resettlement Task
Based on the inventory survey and anayles, there are 3751 persons to be
resettled or rehabilitated, in which 3651 persons will need for productive resettlement
and 485 persons from 137 households for living resettlement.
5.2 Resettlement Guideline and Principle
5.2.1 Resettlement Guideline
The resettlement work for this project should stick on the policy that: Esteem and
care for the living and production habits of the local PAPs, take full consideration of
the willings of the PAPs; with due consideration of the actual conditions in the original
75



townships (town, street committees) and villages (neighborhood committes), the rural
resettlers resettled on land basis without changing the agricultural status if land is
available for resettlement; based on developing the traditional crop farming and
guaranteeing the basic material survival conditions of the resettlers, guide and assist
the resettlers to develop the secondary and tertiary industries and to restore, improve
and raise the living and production levels of the resettlers, and reach the target of
prolonged social stability.
5.2.2 Resettlement Principle
(1) The resettlement plan will be based on detailed inventory for land acquisition
and houses demolition, and adopted compensation standards and subsidies.
(2) The resettlement shall be combined with the local development, resource
utilization and economic growth as well as environment protection. Considering the
local conditions, a practical and feasible resettlement plan should be developed to
restore and improve their economic production and create basic conditions for
long-term development.
(3) The resettlement plan should be based on the principle"Beneficial to the
production and convenient for living".
(4) The re-construction standard and scale shall be based with the principle of
recovery to the original standard and original scale. Combining the local development,
the cost for enlarging the scale, raising standard and future plan shall be solved
independently by local government and relevant department.
(5) Making overall plans and taking all factors into consideration, correctly
handling the relations between the state, collective and individual.
(6) Fully utilize local natural resource, build water conservancy facility, develop
new farmland, improve land quality, and strengthen agricultural strength and make the
resettler' living standard reach or exceed the original level step by step.
5.3 Overall Resettlement Scheme
Construction of the project will affect a small amount of houses and land along
the railway, which will not impose big impact to the original living and production
system in the existing villages. Consultation meeting have been held in the affected
towns, townships and villages to discuss the resettlement scheme. According to the
76



resettler's opinions and actual situation of the project affected places, it is determined
the the resettler's in the project affected places will be displaced in their original
villages and communities. This can ensure that the resettlers will keep their original
living and production habits, keep their custom and social relationship as before
resettlement, and the resettlers can comparatively easily restore and improve their
living and production level after resettlement. In order to minimize the project impact
to their living and production conditions, all old houses will be demolished after
construction of new houses are completed. The rural households whose houses will
be relocated will be resettled in their original villages, mainly on the land base and
supplemeted by production development in secondary and tertiary industries. After
the economic compensation is paid to the village, the land of the village
(neighborhood committees) and village groups will be re-allocated at the will of the
villagers. The resettlement will be carried out on land base, and for some village
groups which are comparatively serious affected by the land requisition, the basic
livelihood guarantee system will be established for the farmers according to the
relevant local policies so as to ensure the basic living condition of the farmers whose
lands are requisitioned.
5.4 Analysis on Carrying Capacity for Resettlement
5.4.1 Natural conditions and land resources
Since the project affected population will be resettled in their orginal villages and
communities, the natural conditions will not be the restricting factor of carrying
capacity for resettlement.
The carrying capacity analysis is based on detailed village to village survey.
During Jan. - Mar., 2004, arranged by Ministry of Railways, the project command
offices of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, Nanchang Railway Bureau and Guangtie
Group organized relevant staff to carry out a village to village survey. Through
collection of local social and economic data, land use survey results, annual statistical
report, and adjustable farmland possibilities among each affected village group, and
verification of their current land resources, population, agricultural production,
infrastructure, culture, education and sanitation, detailed carrying capacity analysis
has been carried out. Based on the principle of using same dialects, having similar
ethnic costumes, faciliating traffic, providing complete cultural, educational, medical
77



and sanitary infrastructures and esteeming the resttlers' wilings. it was determined
that all the population affected by the project will be resettled in their original village by
moving back through adjusting land allocation and monitized compensation. After the
determination was made, the Project Management Offices carried out, together with
the leaders of the local townships (towns) and villages, in-depth analysis (refer to
section 3.4) on the actual land conditions. The analysis shows that the land resource
is the constraint factor of carrying capacity only for 32 villages out of the 560 affected
villages.
5.4.2 Resettlers' characteristics and relationships
Among the project affected areas, the majority of affected people are Han
nationality. In order that the custom of the resettlers, original personal and social
relationship will not be affected to a possible ectent, and the existing distance to
farmland will not be increased, the resettlers of affected villages are planned to
resettled within the original villages and communities.
5.4.3 Basic Infrastructure Conditions for Production and Living
(1) Traffic Condition
Construction of the project will certainly affect the original traffic mode somewhat,
thus, some corresponding engineering measures have been considered in the project
design, which include building overpasses and intersections at main rural roads,
building pedestrian overpasses or underpasses near the main road of the villages,
schools, hospitals and other crowd area in order to ensure safty for people and
animals. Construction of the Project will not only improve the travel of the local
resident, enhance the circulation of freight and personnel, but also accelerate the
development of local economy. The living envoirnment and the infrastructures of local
resettlers will be upgraded after resettlement. Therefore, the traffic condition will not
be a constraint factor for carrying capacity.
(2) Water Supply Condition
The project is located in the plain and hilly areas of Southeast China Region and
Mid-China Region, where the economic and natural contions are rather good. Most of
the rural residents are mainly using tap water some are using water from wells dug by
themselves. As rivers run zigzag in the area and there is plenty of rainfall, water is
easily available for living and production and the project construction will not affect the
78



water use of the local residents. The water source and water quantity will not be a
constraint factor to the carrying capacity. Along with the economic development in the
project affected areas, the living and production conditions will be gradually improved.
(3) Electric Power Supply Condition
All electric power supply facilities affected by the project will be re-constructed
based on the orginal standard before the project construction, so the electric power
supply condition of the residents will not be affected.
(4) Medical & Education Condition
The medical and educational service facilities in the project affected areas will be
restored based on the orginal standard before the project construction. The existing
facilities in affected townships and villages could still be used. Access paths will be
constructed by the Project to ensure that no any inconvenience will be created for the
local people.
(5) Fuel Supply
The main fuel supply of the local residents is firewood collected from the nearby
hills. The project land requisition will impose little impact to fuel supply of the local
villages and townships. Along with construction of the project and improvement of the
traffic condition, purchasing coal and other types of fuels will be more and more easy.
5.4.4 Economic Development Potential of the Affected Area
In the rural areas affected by the project, farming is generally not take as the main
living means, and the secondary and tertiary industries are developed and it is rich in
land reserve, which leave a big development potential. In future, with improvement of
transportation condition, the resource advantage and good accessibility of local areas
should be fully utilized. According to local conditions, various income generation
opportunities should be developed by increasing input of science and improving
production technical level of the masses in order to promote overall development of
agriculture, forestry, sideline activities, as well as industrial, trade and transportation.
5.5 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan
During project impact survey and resettlement planning, the project owner
organized the relevant units involved in the project development to hold consulting
meetings with the representatives of PAPs, cardres and villagers of the project
79



affected arears for discussing the resettlement scheme. According to the resettlement
policies of the states and Hunan province as well as the World Bank requirements,
and through the analysis on the carrying capacity for resettlement after land
requisition for the project, it is determined that the PAPs will be resettled within their
original village groups so that they can keep their original living and production ways
and their social relationship will not be affected after resettlement. It is to encourage
the resettlers to carry on their original job and to create conditions for developing local
secondary and tertiary industries.
5.5.1 Plan of production recovery and resettlement
The impact of land acquisition for each county(city, district) is not identical.
According to actual quantity of land acquisition and house relocation, different opinion
and reconstruction scheme and resettler and local government, survey result of
resettlement  working  group  and  negotiation  of  relative  administrative
villages(neighborhood committee), it is decided that the land adjustment will be
completed in the 3rd round land contracting for the villages with less impact of land
acquisition or pay directly to the peasant household and use it on their own will;  For
7 administrative villages(Neighborhood Committee) with heavier impact, the
resettlement working group carried out special consultation, it is decided that readjust
land in whole village or whole team, the compensation fee and subsidy shall be
controlled collectively to develop the 2nd and 3rd industry to establish the basic living
guarantee or distribute averagely to whole village or whole team. The resettlement
plan is as the following:
(1) Liling city
Liling city is one of the most developed area of Hunan province, with not only
perfect basic facility and fast economy development, especially family-managed
individual economy developed, formed a certain scale of industrial system of daily use
porcelain, electrical porcelain, artistic porcelain and special industrial porcelain such
as the porcelain of Huang-ni-ao street, Yangsanshi street and Lailongmen stress, and
fireworks of Dongfu town. Therefore the local resource of labor force can not satisfy
the local economic development long ago, workers from outside has taken great
proportion in the employment people of local individual privately-owned enterprise
and trade enterprise. Except few old people staying at home to engage the
agricultural production for the most rural resident households, the young labor is
80



engaged in the 2nd and 3rd industry, and the income of the 2nd and 3rd industry is
over 95% of total income of the family. Therefore, the impact of land acquisition in this
area is relatively small.
The land acquisition of this project will impact on 25 villages (neighborhood committee)
of 7 towns (street) of Liling city, 6 villages with larger impact(land decreased over
10%), including 5 villages with land decreased 10-25% as Lianhua village and Huamu
village of Dongfu town, Dingjiafang village of Lailongmen street, Wuhuamiao village of
Huang-ni-ao street, Dashiqiao village of Banshan township; with land decreased
over 25% as Lisan village of Yangsanshi street. According to the impact of land
acquisition and actually condition, the production recovery plan of villages affected is
as the following:
A.   For the villages with larger impact as Lisan village of Yangsanshi street,
Wuhuamiao village of Huang-ni-ao street, Dingjiafang village of Lailongmen
street, Dashiqiao village of Banshan township, Lianhua village and Huamu
village of Dongfu town, adjust the land in whole village or whole team and the
compensation fee and subsidy will be controlled collectively for improvement of
basic facilities and development of 2nd and 3rd industry except the
compensation fee for young crops which will pay directly to the land user in
order to establish the basic living guarantee or distribute averagely to whole
village or whole team. But, the actual scheme shall consult with villager's
comment and pass by the villagers representative meeting.
B. For the villages with few land decrease or most of non-farming land, the
resettlement scheme shall be pass by the villagers representative meeting,
except the compensation fee for young crops which will pay directly to the land
user, the distribution and use method shall be as the following:
a.  Because each village has few or no flexible land, the land readjustment in whole
village is difficult and workload is greater. The loss in the 2nd round
land-contracting will be paid and the rest fee will be shared by whole village to
use mainly for improvement of infrastructure and the 2nd and 3rd industry. the
land adjustment will be completed in the 3rd round land-contracting.
b.  Pay the compensation fee and subsidy directly to the villagers who loss the land.
(2) Zhuzhou county
Zhuzhou county is located at the central of"Five zones and one-corridor"
economic zone of Hunan province, at the south of"golden triangle" city
concentrated area, a typical suburb county. Where has not only perfect
81



infrastructure, rich minerals resource and fast economic development, also
has special advantage of construction material and pottery and porcelain trade,
such as the construction material, electric and mechanic process, glass and
chemical trade in Baiguan town, paper mill of Yaojiaba township. The local
resource of labor force can not satisfy the local economic development and the
demand for labor force. The outside-worker in the employment people of local
individual privately-owned enterprise and industry has a certain proportion.
Except few old people staying at home to engage the agricultural production for
the most rural resident households,  the most young labor is engaged in the
2nd and 3rd industry, and the income of the 2nd and 3rd industry is over 90% of
total income of the family. Therefore, the impact of land acquisition in this area is
relatively small.
The land acquisition of this project will impact on 9 villages(neighborhood
committee) of 2 towns(street) of Zhuzhou county, 1 village  with larger
impact(land decreased over 10%), land decreased  20.56%.  According to
the impact of land acquisition and actually condition, the production recovery
plan of villages affected is as the following:
A.   For the villages with larger impact as Beiguan neighborhood committee of
Beiguan town, adjust the land within the committee and the compensation fee
and subsidy will be controlled collectively by the committee for improvement of
basic facilities and development of 2nd and 3rd industry except the
compensation fee for young crops which will pay directly to the land user in
order to establish the basic living guarantee or distribute averagely to whole
village or whole team. But, the actual scheme shall consult with villager's
comment and pass by the villagers representative meeting.
B.   For the villages with few land decrease or most of non-farming land, the
resettlement scheme shall be pass by the villagers representative meeting and
generally no land adjustment in the whole village, except the compensation fee
for young crops which will pay directly to the land user, the distribution and use
method shall be as the following:
a.  Because each village has few or no flexible land, the land readjustment in whole
village is difficult and workload is greater. The loss in the 2nd round
land-contracting will be paid and the rest fee will be shared by whole village to
use mainly for improvement of infrastructure and the 2nd and 3rd industry. the
land adjustment will be completed in the 3rd round land-contracting.
b.  Pay the compensation fee and subsidy directly to the villagers who loss the land.
82



(3) Lusong   district
Lusong district is located at the south of Zhuzhou city, with superior geographical
location where is the center of economy, culture, traffic, information, trade and
financial etc. and important part of golden triangle economic industrial zone and
having very convenient traffic condition intercrossed by Jing-Guang railway,
Zhe-Gan railway, Xiang-Qian railway. The local economy is well developed. The
local resource of labor force can not satisfy the local economic development and
the demand for labor force. The outside-worker in the employment people of
local individual privately-owned enterprise and industry has a certain proportion.
Except few old people staying at home to engage the agricultural production for
the most rural resident households,  the most young labor is engaged in the
2nd and 3rd industry, and the income of the 2nd and 3rd industry is over 95% of
total income of the family. Therefore, the impact of land acquisition in this area is
relatively small.
The land acquisition of this project will impact on 4 villages(neighborhood
committee) of 2 towns(street) of Lusong district, with few impact(land decreased
less than 10%). According to the impact of land acquisition and actually
condition, the resettlement scheme shall consult with villager's comment and
pass by the villagers representative meeting, and the compensation fee for land
and young crops and subsidy will pay directly to the land user.
5.5.2 Plan for house relocation
According to the villager's opinion and actual condition of village and team and
combining the master plan of village, resettlers can be concentrated in original
village or new residence area(for large numbers) or scattered (for small number),
and house construction can also be concentrated (for large numbers) or
scattered (for small number), and keeping the original administrative
management system and using existing water, power, road, education, medical
and health facilities. For few resettlers who have additional house in other
place for living, he can make application for monetized resettlement and
approved by local government and the resettlement organization.
According to relative policies of Hunan province, rural people who builds
residence should accord with the master plan of township(town), The
construction of residential house of villagers shall follow the master plan of
township(town). The land area of each household is not over 1 30m2 for farmland,
21 0m2 for fell and waste land, 1 80m2 for other land. One rural household is only
83



allowed to have one house plot. The house plot of resettler shall select in
original village or new residence area of this village, avoiding as far as possible
to occupy farmland and scattering for house construction. The house plot
standard shall follow relative rules of each county(city, district).
The house demolition and house construction of resettlers shall be performed by
their own wishes, and the resettlement organization will give compensation by
replacement price according to original house structure and area. The
compensation shall be paid by stages according to the progress of material
preparation and house construction. The resettler can build new house first or
demolish old house first, if demolish old house first, the subsidy of temporary
house shall be paid.
5.5.3 Social service facilities in resettlement plot
The land acquisition will not affect the social service facilities of school and medical
station, so that the original school, medical room and commercial network could be
used and not necessary to build separately, and move the distance from the
resettlement plot to original social service facility is almost identical.
5.5.4 Resettlers' Administrative Management and house construction
Since the affected households will be resettled locally and economic
rehabilitation will be carried out within the affected villages, the administrative
structure will remain the same.
The house construction should consider the living habit and also leave the room
for the further development. The house demolition and house construction of
resettlers shall be performed by their own wishes, and the resettlement organization
will give compensation by replacement price according to original house structure and
area. The compensation shall be paid by stages according to the progress of material
preparation and house construction. The resettler can build new house first or
demolish old house first, if demolish old house first, the subsidy of temporary house
shall be paid.
5.5.5 Administration of Resettlement implementation organizations
Implementation of resettlement plan will be under the leadership of the project
owner and the relevant provincial people's governments, and the project affected
counties (cities, districts) will designate personnel from their relevant government
departments to establish resettlement organization to formulate the resettlement
policies, and assume the responsibility for publicization, mobilization, arrangement
84



and implementation of the house relocation and inhabitants resttlement. At the same
time, the resettlement organizations are also requested to hear and timely collect and
sort the resettlers' opinions and questions, and timely report such to the superior
organizations or the relevant competent departments and convey the opinions of
handling such issues to the resettlers in possible shortest time.
5.6 Rehabilitation Plan for Special Facilities
The special facilities affected by the Project include: 1 1 OkV, 1 OkV and 380/220V
power lines, and telecom cables and power cables, which will all be relocated by the
local competent departments based on the relocation plan worked out by them. In
case the overhead power and telecom lines run across or parallel to the railway route,
they should be highly raised for crossing the railway or shifted horizontally away in
relocation. The underground telecom cables should run across the railway through
sleeves embedded under the railway.

E. Later on, the resettlement leading group and the resettlement offices at all
levels will make publicity of the resettlement policies and encourage the public
participation by the following ways.
-- Declaring Publicly Inventory Index
Declaring publicly the inventory index of each affected household before the
payment of compensation in order to be under the supervision of resettlers.
-- Declaring Publicly Compensation Policies
Declaring publicly the compensation policies for each effected item of household
before the compensation paid in order to be under the supervision of resettlers.
-- Establishment of Resettlement Information Booklet
The project resettlement office prepared resettlement information booklets to
ensure the local government and people in the affected areas to know the details of
the resettlement plan, and the booklet will be handed out to each of resettlement
households within the project site before project resettlement office obtains the
compensation. The information booklet covers main contents of resettlement plan,
compensation criteria and resettlement policy, the right of resettlers, respondent and
the appeal ways.
-- Holding Meeting
Public meeting will be held to explain relative policies, laws and rules and
compensation criteria in detail so that the PAPs can know these early before the
implementation of the land acquisition and resettlement
Issue relevant land acquisition and relocation announcement through local
newspaper or broadcasting television before enforcement of resettlement; Put up
bulletin to propagate resettlement policy, compensation standard and complaint
channel in the scope of towns and villages affected using easy language that
resettlers accept most according to local resident national composition condition;
The resettlement action plan report is put in local library or the project coordination
office to facilitate the resettlers to read.
9.1.3 Participation during Resettlement Implementation
All resettlers will be encouraged to participate in the whole process of
implementation of the RAP.
115



A. Participation in House Reconstruction
(1) Housing Compensation Criteria
The compensation criteria for housing will directly affect the interests of the
resettlers. Before the houses are relocated, the relevant resettlement authority will
consult and sign an agreement with the resettlers on the compensation criteria for the
houses. The consultation results will be declared publicly before the agreements are
signed, so as to put the resettlement under public supervision.
(2) Resettlement Host Sites and House Reconstruction
At the RAP preparation stage, the relevant authority carried out survey on the
resettlement host sites and the way of house reconstruction. According to the survey,
most of the affected households are willing to have their houses relocated in their own
groups and to rebuild houses by themselves. The local governments at all levels will
provide assistance at different stages for house relocation.
(3) Disposal of Old Houses
All the old houses to be demolished will be compensated at replacement cost
without depreciation. Within a specified time period, resettlers can, on their will,
demolish their old houses first and then rebuild the new houses or vice-versa. The
salvageable material from the old houses can be used by resettlers themselves
without deduction from compensation.
B. Participation in Production Rehabilitation
All affected individuals in the affected village groups (including those indirectly
affected) will participate in the land re-adjustment and redistribution process.
C. Participation in Using Land Compensation
According to the ownership in affected area, the land compensation will be paid
to the villager group and shall not be carved up or used for other purpose. The
compensation will be used in a planned way and for specific items planned. The use
of the money will be approved by the villager congress and under the supervision/
(with the participation) of the villager representatives.
D. Participation in Project Construction
116



The project construction will cause certain impacts on the local community. In
order to ensure the PAPs benefit from the project construction, the local people will be
encouraged to take part in the construction, and favorable conditions will be created to
use local materials and local labor force.
9.2 Grievance and Appeal
The public participation is always encouraged in the process of compiling and
implementing of the RP. There will be some unforeseeable problems occurring in the
process. In order to solve problems effectively and ensure the project construction
and land requisition is carried out successfully, a transparent and effective grievance
and appeal channel has been set up. The basic procedures for grievance include the
following steps.
Step 1:
If any resettler is aggrieved by any aspect of the resettlement, he/she can state
their grievance and appeal to the village committee or the township (town)
resettlement office in oral or in written form. If an oral appeal is made, the village will
record it on paper and process it. Village committee or township (town) resettlement
office will make decision on or resolve it in two weeks.
Step 2:
If the aggrieved resettler is not satisfied with the decision in Step 1, he/she can
appeal to the county (city) resettlement office or the Leading Group after receiving the
decision; the county (city) resettlement office will reach a decision in two weeks.
Step 3:
If the aggrieved resettier is still not satisfied with the decision of Step 2, he/she
will appeal to the Provincial Key Project Leading Group office after receiving the
decision, the Provincial Key Project Leading Group office will reach a decision in two
weeks.
Step 4:
If the PAP is still dissatisfied with the decision of Step 3, he/she will appeal to the
civil division of a people's court according to the civil procedural law after receiving the
decision.
117



The resettlers can appeal on any aspect of resettlement, including compensation
criteria and price.
The resettlers be apprised of their rights for lodging appeals during participation
in the public meetings and by receiving resettlement information booklet. At the same
time, the grievance and appeal process will be publicized among the PAPs through
media. The relevant authorities will sort out the opinions and proposals of the PAPs
and the resettlement offices at all levels will process the information in a timely and
effective manner.
The organizations will accept the grievance and appeals of the PAPs free of
charge, and the reasonable expenses incurred there from will be paid by the PRO
from the Project's contingency fund.
118



10 Monitoring & Evaluation
In order to guarantee that the RAP can be smoothly implemented and the
resettlement target suitably realized, the follow-on fact finding and monitoring will be
carried out throughout the whole process. Monitoring on the resettlement will be
divided into two parts, i.e., internal monitoring (by the resettlement offices) and the
external independent monitoring.
10.1 Internal Monitoring
10.1.1 Target and Task
The target of internal monitoring is to maintain supervision responsibility of the
resettlement organs as specified in the RAP during implementation, and ensure that
the project can be constructed smoothly and the resettlers' legal rights will not be
impaired. The auditing department of the provincial government will independently
exercise the auditing monitoring function over concerning units under its jurisdiction in
accordance with the laws and regulations. The superior units assume the
responsibilities for monitoring their subordinates so that the RAP principle and
schedule can be followed.
10.1.2 Institution and Staff
The internal monitoring for land acquisition and resettlement will be held by the
project construction comand of Guangtie Group, and be performed by local county
Resettlement Offices, townships and villages. To make the internal monitoring
effective, full-time professionals will be assigned within all the resettlement offices at
all levels. All of them have participated in the compilation and implementation of the
RAP, and they will carry out the internal monitoring control in the processes of the
work. The responsible institutes and persons for internal monitoring and data
processing are shown in respective RAPs.
10.1.3 Monitoring Contents
(1) Allocation and utilization of the resettlement compensation
(2) Selection and allocation of new house plots
(3) Rebuilding of private houses
(4) Support to vulnerable groups
(5) Employment of the PAPs
(6) Quality and quantity of new developed land
119



(7) Adjustment and distribution of the land
(8) Distribution of the land subsidy fees
(9) Relocation of private shops (If any affected)
(10) Restoration of special facilities
(11) Scheduling of the work above mentioned
(1 Implementation of the policies in RP
(13) Public participation and consultation during implementation
(14) Staffing, training, work schedule and working effectiveness of resettlement
offices at all levels
10.1.4 Monitoring Procedures
(1) The project construction comand of Guangtie Group will develop an internal
monitoring framework to supervise the resettlement activities, and has established a
database for the land requisition, housing relocation and resettlement, and will
monitor the whole process of the resettlement.
(2) During the implementation stage, the resettlement offices at all levels will
establish relevant sections of the database and update them along with the
resettlement progress for planning the resettlement work in their own regions. They
will also timely transfer the on-going activity records and report the resettlement
implementation progress to the resettlement office at above level so that a continuous
monitoring can be realized.
(3) In the above internal monitoring system, a set of formats of information lists
has been drawn up so as to realize the continuous message flows from the village to
the project resettlement office. The county(city) resettlement offices and town(ship)
resettlement groups are important chains in the internal monitoring system.
10.2 External Independent Monitoring and Evaluation
10.2.1 Target and Tasks
The external monitoring and evaluation (M&E) undertaken by an institution
independent to the resettlement execution institutions is to monitor and evaluate
whether the target of the land requisition, resettlement and relocation activities are
realized. Through the process, evaluation opinions and proposals will be put forward
120



on the resettlement, housing relocation and restoration of the resettler's living
standards, and to provide prediction and alarm system to the project management,
and reflecting channel to the resettlers.
The external monitoring institution will report independently to the Project
Leading Group for Resettlement and the Project Resettlement Office. It will conduct
follow-up investigation, monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement activities
according to the RP and provide advice for decision-making and mitigation measures.
10.2.2 Institution and Staff
Recently, the Foreign Fund Center of Minitry of Railway entrusted Importing
and exploiting Researching Office of Xinan Jiaotong University to carry out the
external M&E works. The Importing and exploiting Researching Office of Xinan
Jiaotong University will provide technical assistance to the PRO and conduct survey
of resettlement and living standards of the PAPs as well as all basic monitoring work,
and it will prepare annual and semi-annual report for submission to PRO and WB.

10.2.4 Monitoring and Evaluation Measures
Monitoring and evaluation will be performed on the basis of the survey data
provided by the survey design institution and resettlement implementation institutions.
With an overall understanding of the situation, the evaluation will be performed by
sample survey, key informant interviews and rapid rural appraisal techniques. Typical
samples, including resettled households, affected villages and Townships will be
selected to establish evaluation index system for different types of PAPs. Experienced
experts will be invited to decide in a back-to-back way the weights for different
122



indexes. Referring to the updated research output on living quality both in China and
abroad, the indexes will be non-dimensionally treated, and the survey results will be
analyzed and the computation results evaluated and compared. In addition to typical
samples, there will also be focused investigation of vulnerable groups.
Generally, the external monitoring and evaluation institution will carry out the
following work.
A. Survey of resettlers' living standards
A base-line survey will be conducted for this project, including the collection of
selected samples of the base-line living standards of the resettlers. (The preliminary
samples will be randomly collected). The living standard will be investigated once or
twice a year to monitor the variation in the resettlers' living standards. The necessary
data can be obtained by periodical survey, random interview and site visit, based on
which statistical analysis and evaluation are performed. There will also be targeted
survey of vulnerable groups.
The survey comprises various indicators of living standards. some of the
indicators will be used for weighing the dynamic variation of living standards before
and after the land requisition and resettlement. The selected indicators will be
checked to see whether they are reasonable in reflecting the actual production and
living levels in the base-line survey and are subject to modification according to the
actual conditions, so as to guarantee the message obtained reflects the quality and
quantity of the real situation.
Sampling scale: resettlers: 5%, sample villages by land requisition: 10%,
enterprises or self-employees: 20%.
B. Holding Public Consultation
The independent monitoring and evaluation institution will participate in the public
consultation conferences held by the villages and townships. By this method, the
institution can evaluate the effectiveness the public participation and the cooperative
attitude of the resettlers towards the RP implementation. Such activities will be
conducted during and after the resettlement implementation.
C. Gathering Resettlers' opinions
123



The independent monitoring and evaluation institution will often interview the
township resettlement offices and village groups to know the opinions collected from
the resettlers and interview the resettlers who have grievances. The institution will
report the opinions and suggestions from affected individuals and collectives to the
Project Resettlement Office, and provide advice for improvement, so that the

The most participants know that this project is a national key-project,
expressing that support positively the construction of this project.
About the compensation for land acquisition, they expressed that the relevant
compensation policy of country should be realized and is better to pay directly
the compensation fee to resettlers and try the best to reduce the intermediate
link as far as possible to avoid the compensation be trapped and reduced.
About the production resettlement, as the peasant they think that hope to
ensure to have the land to satisfy basic living demand of family through land
adjustment, using partial compensation capital to build water conservancy
facility or carry out industrial structural adjustment to raise benefits of
agriculture product and byproduct. The most young labor of village is
engaged in the 2nd and 3rd industry, or go out for employment and small
trade business. Therefore, they are not heavily depended on the land, and
they prefer the monetary compensation scheme..
The younger villagers wish to pay the compensation fee to individual, but the
director of village wishes to use this money to improve the production
condition and popularize scientific technology, making this capital to have
hematopoiesis function instead of compensation alone.

Place: Luotoushan village, Babuqiao township, Liling city
Date: Feb. 12th 2004 p.m
4 members, 1 son, 1 daughter and couple, son and daughter unmarried who
do odd job in Guangdong Province, having about 2mu farmland including
paddy field 1 .5mu and dry land 0.5mu. The main economic income of family is
from income of doing odd job by son and daughter and the householder has a
repair shop of pot. Two crops of rice per year on 1 .5mu paddy field with
500kg/mu last year, plant vegetable completely in dry land, total annual
income of family about 17000 - 18000 Yuan, the production cost accounting
for 15 - 20%, the agricultural tax of the village is 72 Yuan/mu, daily expense is
cigarette, liquor and telecommunications cost which is relatively larger, and
annual income in last few years is somewhat surplus.
About 4/1 Omu paddy field will be affected by the railway. From the view of
whole village, the influence of his family is relatively larger but no big
influence to the production and living. It is need to see what scheme taken
by the village. If the compensation measure is fair and reasonable, it can be
supported and realized. Crucial point is: the compensation fee shall be
implemented and the account opened.
