The project has the following three components:\n            Component 1) The Zhe-Gan line is an integral part of the\n            China Railways 2003-2007 Development Plan that calls for\n            raising the speeds and improving the quality of passenger\n            services on the major railway corridors nationwide. The\n            track is to be upgraded on many short sections totaling\n            about half of the track length. The line will also be\n            electrified throughout. Once it is upgraded, the 200 km/h\n            express trains will be operated by electric multiple units\n            (EMUS), while slower passenger and freight trains will be\n            operated with electric locomotives. Component 2) Ministry of\n            Railways (MOR) also wishes to acquire additional highly\n            mechanized, high-capacity equipment for replacing worn rail\n            and switches, renewing ballast, and other maintenance tasks\n            on heavy-traffic lines. Component 3) MOR will hire\n            consultants to analyze, and make recommendations on various\n            issues for improving business processes. MOR has proposed\n            the following topics: traffic forecasting methods; policy\n            framework for resettlement and environmental protection;\n            planning and equipment standards for electrified network;\n            and management of construction supervision."}, "docdt": "2004-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
