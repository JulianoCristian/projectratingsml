A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Countryandsector issues

China is inthe process o f making two historic transitions -from a rural, agricultural society to an
urban, industrialized society, and from a centrally planned economy to an integrated market-
based economy. To this end the principal goals o f China's strategy for the transport sector are
to:
    (a) expand the transportation infrastructureto serve the needs o fthe economy
    (b) address the mobilityneeds ofthe poorer and disadvantaged people andregions; and
    (c) facilitate a more environmentally sustainable development process.

The Ministry ofRailways (MOR), China's largest state-owned enterprise, currently operates rail
services reasonably efficiently andprofitably ina growing market. Mounting competition from
the expanding highway system andinternalpressure to increase service quality while
maintaining profitability and adding capacity has ledto the need to improve business processes.
This project, like the Bank's previous railprojects, will help to facilitate the process o f change.
It will also improve the transport connectivity o f southwestern China to the east by upgrading an
important rail line linking Zhejiang andHunan provinces, thereby helpingto address the needs o f
poorer and disadvantaged regions. Inaddition, the conversion o fthis line from diesel to electric
traction (generated from hydropower sources) will yield environmental benefits.

2. Rationalefor Bankinvolvement

The rail system inChina i s essential to the continuing economic development o f China and as a
keytransportationchoice for goods andpassengers. Over the past two decades ChinaRailways
havebeenconspicuously successful inexpanding their network and serving growing volumes o f
business, both freight and passengers. CR has been gradually shiftingfrom the management
habits o f a national monopoly toward those o f a modem transport enterprise competing for
business with other modes o f transport that are also modernizing and growing rapidly. Inrecent
years CR has generated sufficient revenues to cover not only all operating expenditures but also
a substantial part o f its large investment program. This sets China Railways apart from every
other railway to which the Bank lends.

The Chinese government wants the railway to be largely self-sufficient infinancing its
expansion. Budget financing i s limited to contributions towards extension o f the network to
open up western regions. The Bank supports this policy o f substantial financial self-sufficiency.
The Government also wants to encourage the railway to continue adapting to the challenges o f
operating ina competitive transport market, and looks to the Bank to advise -on the strength o f
its experience with railways around the world- on the gradual change process that this requires.
For its part, MOR wishes to continue borrowing from the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bankbecause it will only succeed infinancing its very large investment program
for the coming decade by expanding its sources o f financing, and it i sjudicious to combine
borrowing from both domestic and international banks. C R also looks to the international banks
to facilitate its access to internationaltechnology andbest practice inplanningand management



                                                  1

approaches. The World Bank's perspective i s that its international experience does indeed equip
itto addvalue regardingthe options andprocess for changing from a centrally-planned operator
to a market-friendly service provider, andCR's scale o f operations i s so large that its
performance can have far-reaching impacts on the Chinese economy.

Inparallelwithpreparationandappraisal ofthis project, the Bank hasbeenconducting a
dialogue with MOR on the broad objectives and approach for a long-term lending program to
support railway modernizationanddevelopment. It i s intended that this parallel dialogue will
allow the parties to agree on the mainpriorities inCR's investment program and related
institutional developments to be supported by future Bank loans.

3. Higher level objectivesto whichthe projectcontributes

    (a)    Move development westward to inland provinces.

    (b)    Upgrade infrastructure to serve the rapidly evolving needs o f the economy.

    (c)    Attract the movement o fpeople and goods to an environmentally friendly mode o f
        transport.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The Project involves construction o f large-scale infrastructure; the loan funds will be disbursed
mostly against goods procured through international competitive bidding. For this purpose a
Specific Investment Loanwas selected as the most appropriate lending instrument. MOR prefers
a variable-spread loanbecause its cost i s slightly lower thanthat of a fixed spread loan, and
MORmightnot tap the flexibility providedbythe fixed-spread loan inthe foreseeable future.

2. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveandkey indicators

The project development objectives are:
    (a) improve services provided to customers ofthe Zhe-Gan railway line; and
    (b).upgrade the quality o ftrack maintenance onheavily usedportions ofChinaRailways'
        network.

Project outcomes will be measured by three groups of indicators:

Zhe-Gan Line

    (a)    The transit time per trip i s to be decreased by:

 (i)Zhe-GanLineImprovements

A keyeast-west link inthe Chinese railnetworkis the linebetweenHangzhouinZhejiang
province near Shanghai and Zhuzhou inthe center o f China inHunanprovince. This line,
known as Zhe-Gan', is the only existing major east-west link connecting the coastal regions in
the Yangtze River delta inthe East to the industrial region inthe center o f China andthrough to
Chongqing and Chengdu inthe West andKunminginthe Southwest. Existing east-west links
are all operating at or near capacity. Passenger traffic on the Zhe-Ganline exceeds 20 million
passengersper year on most sections and freight traffic ranges between 33 and 57 million tons.
Coal, steel, mineral ores and buildingmaterials are the maincommodities carried (more than
two-thirds o f total tonnage).

The Zhe-Gan line is an integral part o f the China Railways 2003-2007 Development Planthat
calls for raising the speeds and improvingthe quality o fpassenger services on the major railway
corridors nationwide. Under this planthe maximum operating speed of express passenger trains
i s to be raised to 200 km/h. The Zhe-Gan line i s 942-km long, double track, diesel-powered, and
allows a maximum speed of 120km/h. MOR plans to install new signaling, realign sharp curves
andcarry out other civil works needed to permit higher speeds. The track is to be upgraded on
manyshort sections totaling about halfo fthe track length. The line will also be electrified
throughout. Once it is upgraded, the 200 km/hexpress trains will be operated by electric
multiple units (EMUS),while slower passenger and freight trains will be operated with electric
locomotives.


`The   "Zhe" inthe name is short for Zhejiang Province and "Gan" is the Chinese abbreviation for Jiangxi Province,
     through which the line passes.


                                                        3

The civil works for speed-raising beganinearly 2004 and are to be completed by September
2005. The electrification will overlap by several months and be completed by August 2006;
after a period o f testingthe new electrified services will beginearly in2007.

End-to-end trip times will be cut by 3-4 hours. The new signaling and communications
equipment will allow design headway between trains to be reduced from the current 8 minutes to
7 minutes, increasingthe line capacity by 13%. Electrification will allow the maximum gross
weight o f freight trains to be raised from 3,300 tons to 4,000 tons.

 (ii)Modernizingoftrackmaintenancetechnology

MORalso wishes to acquire additionalhighlymechanized, high-capacity equipmentfor
replacingw o m rail and switches, renewingballast, and other maintenance tasks on heavy-traffic
lines. Such technology i s more cost-effective that traditional labor-intensivemaintenance
practices, as the track needs to be closed to traffic for shorter periods and the quality o f finish i s
far better. Consistent, high-quality and frequent maintenance directly improves passenger safety.
MOR first introducedthis technology inthe late 1990s.

At present MOR's 19track maintenance depots arepart o fthe 14RailwayAdministrations.
MOR anticipates, though the timetable has not been set that eventually, the heavy track
maintenance equipment will be rolled out to cover MOR's entire territory and the track
maintenance depots (TMDs) will become independententities, subsidiaries o f a single group
company. TMDs at present cover approximately 40,000 track-km. With additional capacity
they will, by 2005, cover a total o f 67,000 track-km o f the system, about halfthe total track-km.
The intention is that TMDs should service all main trunk lines and all high-density mainroutes
that have traffic volumes greater than 25 milliontons per year. (Such volumes are uncommon
except inChina, NorthAmerica and parts o f Russia.)

MORalso wishes to acquirerail-based mobile cranes that canbe deployedrapidly to sites of
accidents and derailments, to enhance its capacity to clear accidents andrestore normal
operations quickly on heavy-traffic lines.


(iii)AdvisoryservicestostrengthenMOR'splanning,managementandtechnology

MORwill hire consultants to analyze, andmake recommendations on, various issues for
improving business processes. M O R has proposedthe following topics:

    0 Traffic forecasting methods
    0 Policy framework for resettlement and environmental protection
    0 Planningand equipment standards for electrified network
    0 Managemento f construction supervision

MOR will indicate additional topics for technical assistance (TA) at a later date.

4. Lessonslearnedandreflectedinthe projectdesign

 The client and the Bank have drawn valuable lessons from preparing and implementingpast
railway projects and these lessons have beentaken into account inthe preparation o f this project.
 First, a project should not include components to which the client i s not fully committed. This
 can leadto the restructuring o f the project, as was the case with Railways VII.

 Second, including too many components ina project (as was the case inRailways VI andVII)
 affects implementationnegatively, because boththe client and the Bank have limited resources
 for supervision andimplementation.

 Third, when designingandimplementingproject components, the project office, railway staffin
 MOR inBeijing, andrailway staff inthe regional administrationsneedto work with each other
 closely to implement the project efficiently.

 Fourth, client commitment to Bank guidelines andprocedures i s essential. Problems arose with
regardto resettlement and environmental issues inRailways VI and VII. However, inrecent
years the Chinese Government has intemalized concem over environmental impacts and
resettlement to a far greater degree, and domestic safeguards are converging to the standards
requiredbythe international financial institutions. M O R has recently appointeda resettlement
 coordinator inits headquarters inBeijing.

Fifth,the progress o fChina Railwaystowards improving businessprocesses andpolicy reform
has been steady and generally ina directionthat the Bank supports. M O R has continued to shed
non-core activities and recently separated from MOR its four design institutes, Railway
 Communications Company, the material supply company, and several hospitals and educational
institutions. It also set up three special-purpose companies (wholly owned byMOR) that will


                                                   5

handle transportationo f containers, special cargoes andparcels. The Bank's support in
improving the management o f China Railways and its business processes has been effective and
shouldbe continued.

5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

Zhe-Gan Line Improvements: Speed-raising
M O R has been raising speeds o f its passenger trains since 1997 and has implemented four speed-
raisings so far. As a result the maximum speed o f trains has increased from 120km/hto 140 and
thento 160km/hon several corridors. As part ofits long-term strategy andthe development
plans for 2003-2007, M O R has decided to improve the quality o fpassenger services on its main
corridors. The planincludes operation o f express trains at a maximum speed o f 200 km/h. The
facilities insuch trains would also be upgraded to provide greater comfort. The raising o f speeds
on the Zhe-Gan line along with four other routes (Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Guangzhou,
Beijing-Kowloon and Lianyuangang-Lanzhou) i s part o fthe system-wide strategy. The
alternative o fnot raising the speedwas, therefore, not considered (other than as the `do-nothing'
alternative for calculating the economic and financial retums).

Zhe-Gan Line Improvements: Electrification
I/yhy electvzjkation? The connecting routes to the Zhe-Gan line already are or soon will be
electrified. Electrification o f Hangzhou-Shanghai to the northeast i s approved and is to be
completedby 2007. Electrifying the section betweenHangzhou and Zhuzhou will result ina
fully electrifiedlinebetweenKunmingand Shanghai. Electrifying this section provides the
potential for extensive network effects: locomotives can inprinciple runfrom Shanghai to
Kunmingwithout any operationalneedfor change o flocomotives. Higher speeds andthe
potential to runlonger (heavier) trains increase the capacity o f the line. Environmental benefits
also accrue from the change infuel. The highcapital cost o fbuyingnew electric locomotives i s
more than offset by savings inoperating costs and the avoided investment that would otherwise
be requiredfor renewal and expansion o f diesel equipment. Deployment o f more powerful
diesel locomotives to haul longer and heavier trains was not considered viable, since the rest o f
the corridor will soon be electrified.

Traffic i s particularly heavy on a 100-km stretch between Xiangtang and Yingtan (inJiangxi)
that also constitutes part o f the major north-south route connecting Fuzhou to Nanchang and
points north. One possible alternative could be to electrify only that section o f the line. The
economics o f doing so would be favorable, probably more so than electrifying the whole line.
However, we endorse MOR'Sstrategic thinkingunderlying the decision to electrify the entire
Hangzhou-Zhuzhouline for the reason already stated: realizing the operational benefits andnet
cost reductiono f a through electrified line from Shanghai to Kunming.

Modemization o f Track Maintenance Technology       _.
M O R i s inthe process o f changing over from track maintenance by manual labor and light
machines to the use o f heavy track machines through its 19 track maintenancedepots. The
benefits o f the latter are better quality, reduced labor, and increases inthe intervals between
maintenance. Further, track under intensive use cannot be maintained properly unless rapid,




                                                     6

   high-capacitymachines are employed. Taking the track out o fuse for longperiods to carry out
   labor-intensive repairs is very disruptive to train operations andtraffic.

   MOR'Splanto eventually make its track maintenance depots independent ofthe regionalrailway
   administrations will help maximize the depots' efficiency andproductivity. Inlight o fthe clear
   merits o f this restructuring no other alternative was considered.


   C. IMPLEMENTATION

   1. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

   The central Railway Ministrywill be responsible for procuring all Bank-financed items, through
   anindependent procurement agent (tendering company). The Zhe-Gan linepassesthrough the
   territory o f three regional railway administrations: Shanghai, Nanchang and Guangzhou. Project
   management offices inthese three Administrations will manage procurement of the MOR-
   financed parts o f the Zhe-Gan component. Among other contracts, they will, through
   competitive bidding,.hire independent contractors to carry out the Zhe-Gan civil works and to
   install all equipment, including that financed by the Bank. The regional PMOSwill also be
   responsible for supervising the construction and installation. (See Annexes 7 and 8.)

   2. Monitoringand evaluationof outcomesand results

   The MORmaintains sufficient data collection activities to allow satisfactory reporting and
   monitoring o f the outcomes andresults o fthe project.

   Theresults o fthis project will not be measurable untilthe project is complete. The performance
   o f the electrification, for example, will be measurable only after the infrastructure i s inplace,
   electric locomotives are put into service, and operations resumed. The same applies to the other
   project components. Therefore, to properly evaluate the project's impact, it i s imperative that
%  post-project monitoring is maintained for the Zhe-Ganline and the system as a whole. This
   cannot be achieved muchbefore the closing date o f the proposed loan, so will require special
   arrangements.

   3. Sustainability

   The physical sustainability o f the proposedinvestments is sound. Experience from completed
   and on-going Bank-financed railway projects inChina confirms Chinese Railways' commitment
   to the physical implementation o f its projects. CR has the ability to build and operate the assets
   andhas providedtimely and sufficient maintenance funding for existing infrastructure.

   Traffic volumes on CR are expected to continue to grow. EIRR calculations o f completed
   railways projects inChina at the time of loan closing --when the line financed bythe loan has
   been inoperation for one or two years- frequently show higher values than at project appraisal.




                                                      7

4. Critical risksand possible controversial aspects

Sufficient electric power may not be available for electric traction. China is experiencing
electric power shortages incertain areas, as growth ingenerating capacity is not keepingpace
with growth indemand dueto sustained economic growth o faround 10percent annually. A year
before the Zhe-Gun electrification is due to start operating, MOR will confirm to the Bank that it
has concludedfirm agreements withpower suppliers or provincial governmentsfor adequate
electricpowerfor traction on the line.

Procurement of EMUtrains through domestic funding may be delayed. The planned
number o ftrains to be operated at the maximum speed after the Zhe-Gan line is upgraded will
require ten EMUtrain sets. All are to be financed locally. Any delay intheir deliverywould
cause implementation o f the full 200 km/htimetable to be postponed. Before the end of 2004
MOR will exchangeviews with the Bank on the EMU train sets and confirm the timetablefor
their acquisition andputting into operation.

The China Railways development plans are rapidly evolving. Early in2004 MORannounced
a Mid- and Long-Range Investment Plan approved inprinciple by the State Council. It sets
China Railways on an aggressive growth path that also includes elements o f continued business
process improvement andpolicy reform. The investments' economic and financial justification,
their source o f financing, and the nature o f the associatedbusiness process improvements and
policy reform are beingestablished. It i s expected that the Bank will be asked to assist in
financing the development plan. I t is hoped that the Bank's dialogue with Chineserailway
specialists, together with consulting servicesprovided under its on-goingprojects and the
proposed project, will help MOR to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of these investments.
This dialoguefocuses on defining a lendingprogram that will meet China Railways'
developmentobjectives while embodying thegoals of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategyfor
China. It also seeks ways to speedup and simplify loanprocessing.

Without changes in work rules, some of the economic and financial benefits of
electrification will not be realized. The potential benefits o f electrification will be realized
only ifcertain changes are made inwork rules, such as longer service schedules for electric
locomotives, including runninglocomotives from end to end o fthe Zhe-Gan Line, and operating
more long-distance and unit trains on the Zhe-Gan line that would skip one or more marshalling
yards. At least ayear before the start of electrlJed operations, MOR will inform the Bank of the
new operating rules to be applied.

Shock waves caused by high-speed trains intunnels. At 200 km/htrains entering tunnels
trigger shock waves that can hurt the ears o fpassengers. When two such trains pass ina tunnel
the phenomenon i s especially acute. Options for mitigatingthe effect include (a) buildingwider-
bore tunnels, (b) imposing speed restrictions for passingthrough tunnels, or (c) usingsealed air-
conditioned coachespressurized to keep the internal air pressure above the ambient pressure. At
the time the loan was submittedfor approval MOR was studying this issue. I n the meantime
mitigation measures,such as reducing speedprior to entering a tunnel, were in effect.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economicand financial analyses

Zhe-Gan Line Improvements: Most economic benefits o f the electrification and realignment of
the Zhe-Gan line fall into two categories: the operating cost savings attributable to switching
from diesel to electric traction and the capital cost savings resulting from not havingto acquire
diesel locomotives; and the time savings associated with shorter passenger trip times. In
addition, without the project the railway will have to tum away some freight traffic inthe outer
years for lack of capacity. Avoiding the diversion o f such traffic to roads or more circuitous
railway routes will give the project some benefits, but they will be small relative to the other
categories. Furthermore, a reduction inenvironmental pollutioncan be anticipatedboth as
electric is substituted for diesel traction and as highwaytraffic is diverted to the railway. But no
monetary value has beenput on this benefit.

Overall, this component i s expected to yield a net present value at 12 percent o f about $900
million andto achieve an economic rate ofreturn o f about 19percent (see Annex 9a), the
financial rate o fretumo f this component i s estimated at 11percent (see Annex 9b).

Modemization of Track Maintenance Technoloay: The larger track machines are far more
efficient than their predecessors. Therefore, the greatest benefit resulting from their use i s


                                                   10

directly related to the reduced amount o ftime that a line needs to be out o f service for
maintenance. With the additional time that i s available, a greater number o f trains canbe
accommodated, and therefore, the volume of traffic that can be handledon the line i s
substantiallyenhanced once the largertrack maintenance equipment is deployed. Basedon an
actual use case study, the economic benefits of this component are substantial, andthe economic
retum thus is high-more than 50 percent (see Annex 9c). N o financial analysis was undertaken
for this component.

2. Technical

Zhe-Gan Line Improvements: The speed-raising to 200 W h and the electrification o f the Zhe-
Ganline are closely linked. Realignment andupgradingo fthe track is needed at about 245
locations covering about 900 kmo f track length(about 50 percent of track on this line) to
increase the radius o f curves. Track radius would be increasedto 2,800m innormal sections and
2,200m indifficult sections for 200 W h speed. After realignment the line will be 3% shorter
(from the current 942 kmto 916). To minimizethe social impact o fthe civil works tighter
curves and hence lower maximum speeds will be tolerated over about 127 kmo ftrack.
Maximum grade would be limitedto 7.2 per thousand.

Inall 109bridges (26.8 kmtotal length), including 12extralongbridges (15.0 kmlength) would
be constructed and 26 existing bridgesimproved. The section has 29 tunnels (12.2 km). In
addition, 24 double-track (9.5 km) and 4 single-track (1.8 km)new tunnels will be built.
The tumouts (points) on the maintrack at stations where speeds o f 140km/hor 200 W h are
permittedwill bereplacedwith suitable high-speed tumouts.

For safety the entire line will be fenced to keep people off the track, andbridgesto carry roads
over or under the line will replace level crossings. Inorder to enhance safety cab signaling and
train radio system will be provided.

The existing communication system will be retained. However, to provide reliable channels,
new access network equipment, digital dispatching system and on-line optical fiber monitoring
systems will be set up for the entire line. Further, passenger train display andbroadcast
equipment will be set up at new stations (built as a result o f displacement due to curve
realignment). An intelligent centralizedtrain control system to provide automatic operating
command will be provided. A four-aspect automatic block system with speed difference and
frequency shiftingnon-isolated track circuit will be usedon sections where speed is raised. A
train over-speed protection system will beprovided.

Power supply for electric traction is at 25 kV, single phase, 50 hertz. Traction substations will be
set up at 21 locations. Four switching stations and six section posts will be set up. Three power
dispatching stations at Hangzhou, Nanchang and Changsha will be used. The overhead catenary
system will use silver-copper alloy contact wire for the maincontact system. Twenty-four
catenary sections will be set up. The total installed capacity oftraction sub-stations will be
614,000 kVA and energy consumption inyear 2010 i s estimated as 1,527 millionkWh. MOR
has been asked toprovide evidence confirming thatpower supply companies will meet the
required electrical load.

Ten locomotive depots will bemodifiedto handle electric locomotives. Two diesel locomotive
depots will no longer be usedfor east-west traffic, but will remain inuse onnon-electrified lines
that runnorth-southacross the Zhe-Gan.

Works for water supply, sewage, buildings, air-conditioning and fire fighting will be carried out.
Thetotal buildingareato bebuiltwill be 174,800 m2.New landrequisition will be 19.4 million
m2and another 5.3 millionm2willbeacquired for temporaryuse.

After electrification the 200 km/hsuper express trains will beoperated byEMUtrains, eachof
14cars. SS9 and SS4 locomotives would be utilized for slower passenger and freight trains
respectively. 115 electric locomotives and 10 EMUtrains would replace 264 diesel locomotives.
The stronger electric locomotiveswould be able to pullheavier freight trains (maximum train
weight raised from 3,300 tons to 4,000) and at higher speeds. The average speed o f super
express trains would increase from 86 km/hto 150km/h, that o f express passenger trains f7om
68 to 125 km/h, ando f freight trains from 36 to 43 km/h. The number o fpassenger trains would
increase from 41 pairs in2002 to 54 in2010 and 64 in2015.

3. Fiduciary

As noted elsewhere (Annexes 2, 7 and 8) MOR has considerable experience over the past two
decades o f implementing investments financed partly by loans from the World Bank andAsian
DevelopmentBank. The arrangements for the proposedproject are essentially the same as those
usedon earlier projects, andare long established andwell tested. A central Project Management
Office (PMO) has been established under FCTIC. Separate PMOs also have been set up inthe
three railway administration bureaus (Shanghai, Nanchang and Guangzhou).

All Bank-financed procurement and disbursement o four loanwill behandledbyFCTIC, while
the three regional PMOs will manage non-Bank financed contracts, including those with civil
works contractors who will install the Bank-financed equipment. N o Bank funds will be directed
to the regional PMOs.

Considering this substantial track record, the project team assesses the risks associated with
procurement as average. The procurement agent hiredby FCTIC i s also experienced with World
Bankprojects. Staff o fthe Bank's Beijingoffice will beprovidingsome training inprocurement
through workshops, to make sure that the procurement agent is fully up to date with the Bank's
latest Guidelines and standard biddingdocuments. For details see Annex 8.

Likewise the risk associated with financial management is assessedas average. Staff o f the
Bank's BeijingOffice will be updating the PMOs' FMstaff through project launch workshops.
For details see Annex 7.

4. Environment

The originalproject proposed for Bankfinancing was the electrification o fthe existing
Hangzhou-Zhuzhou (Zhe-Gan) line. Category BIS2 was assigned to the project duringthe PCD
safeguards review meeting inFebruary2003. Designwork was under way when the Zhe-Gan
line was chosen as one o f the lines for speed-raising under MOR'Splans. Since the two


                                                 12

investments are closely linkedintime, place and function, the Task Team advised M O R that
CategoryA would be triggered. The environmentalimpactassessments (EIAs) were prepared
accordingly.

According to these reports, the project area is predominantly cultivated landwith secondary
vegetation and some wasteland. Due to long andintensive human activity along the line as well
as the longperiod o f operation o f the existing railway, there are no wildlife, rare animals or rare
plantsthat need special protectioninthe project areas.

The major safeguard issues associated with the project are:
    (a) increased noise impact on sensitive sites such as schools, hospitals, and households near
        the rail line;
    (b) social severance due to total-enclosure operation after speed-raising;
    (c) selection o f optimal alternative sections to avoid and minimize impacts on villages and
        communities along the alignment;
    (d) increasedwaste water andsolid waste from stations and service facilities;
    (e) adequate public consultation; and
    (0 integrationofthe proposedenvironmentalmitigationmeasures inthe Environmental
        ManagementPlan(EMP).

The environmental impact assessment report found that the realignment works would not affect
ecologically sensitive or natural protection areas, andthat its construction and operation would
have no significant impact on the environment, provided the mitigation measures giveninthe
EMPare implementedproperly. Dueto the change from diesel to electricity, upon operationthe
project would have significant net positive impact byreducing emissions o f SO2 by 71%, NOx
by87%, andsmoke anddust by 87%.

The environmental impacts likely to occur duringthe construction include: construction noise,
potential increase insoil erosion, and generation o f dust during construction and transport o f
materials, interference with the local community and traffic, waste water and solid waste from
construction andcamp sites, impacts on local hydro-geological regimes, impacts on the local
ecology andirrigation system, and the health and safety o fworkers. Ecological protection at
borrow sites and safe disposal o f spoils will require close attention and supervision during
construction. The traffic noise and vibration, waste water and solid waste from train stations and
service areas, and social severance are the potential adverse impacts duringthe operation period.

Though the speed-raising project i s mainly to upgrade the.existingline, there are sections where
analternative alignment has been evaluated with integratedconsiderationo f environment, social
and engineering aspects. The final alignment was chosen based on a series o f technical,
environmental and social criteria, i.e. avoidance o f environmentally sensitive areas and cultural
properties, less social interference, shorter length, less land occupation, and compatibility with
local master planning. The final alignment is 26.6 km shorter than the existing line and avoids
the Donghuashan-Shitatou Tombs o f the HanDynasty, a county-level site protected for its
historical and cultural value.




                                                   13

A stand-alone EMPhasbeenprepared. Itspecifies the appropriate environmental management
andsupervision set-up, mitigation measures, environmentalmonitoring plans,training plans and
budget allocation necessary to implement the mitigation measures and strengthen the borrower's
capacity. Major mitigation measures include:

    0   watering to prevent dust,
    0   installation o fnoise barriersand soundinsulation windows to protect against excess
        noise,
    0   installatiodrenovationo fwaste water treatment facilities to minimize water pollution,
    0   installation o fcontinuous welded rail andhigh-quality overhead catenary to minimize
        electro-magnetic frequency interference,
    0   safe disposal and reclamation o f excess waste materials, and
    0   design o f adequate passageways for pedestrians and farm vehicles to minimize social
        severance.

The EMP also includes extensive re-vegetation and re-plantation plan for borrow/disposal areas
and sub-grade slopes.

This will be the tenth World Bank project to be implementedbythe MOR andthe second for the
railway administrations inZhejiang, Jiangxi andHunan; the Zhe-Gan second track was built
under the FifthRailway Project. Therefore, the borrower has developed ample in-house capacity
to implement, supervise andmonitor both the EMPand the RAP.

The key project stakeholders are the M O R and its administrations inthe three provinces, the
local people who may lose land and livelihoods, villagers and communities that may be
displaced, divided, or impactedbecause o f the alignment passing through or near their villages;
and hospitals, schools, and individual households that may be affected by the upgrading and
operation o f the railway line. Three rounds o fpublic consultation were carried out with the
affected people and communities, local government and environmental experts (April 2002,
May-June 2002 and September 2003), and the relevant information and documents were
provided at the public meetings. A total o f 2,580 people were consulted, and the EIAswere
placed inthe public libraries o f 10 cities along the line inJanuary 2004. Inaddition, the reports'
summaries and major findings were published inthree provincial newspapers and made available
at the information center o f the Bank's Beijing Office.

5. Social

The Zhe-Gan Line passes through three provinces o f Hunan, Jiangxi, andZhejiang. O fthe three,
HunanandJiangxi arerelatively poor, as are the provinces to the west ofHunanthat also use this
line to reach their markets inthe Shanghai area. Increased capacity and shortenedjourney times
for passengerswill provide safer andmore reliable transportation to the millions o fmigrant
workers who work inZhejiang, Shanghai and other parts o f the Yangtze River deltaregion.

Theproject will requirethe takingo f some land and structures that will affect the livelihood o f
some. Minimizing andmitigating these impacts has been a major consideration inthe selection
o fthe alignment for the project design (see Annex lO(a)). MOR has considered different
alternatives inorder to minimize land impacts.


                                                   14

MORhas prepared a resettlement action plan for each o fthe three provinces, summarized
below anddescribed indetail inAnnex lO(b). It involvedmapping o f affected production teams
(farmgroups), inventory o fimpacts, takinga censuso fdisplaced persons by gender andage,
remaining landcapacities after project landrequisition andreallocation, and categories o f land
resources remaining at the level o fproduction teams. A feasibility study has beenprepared for
landredistribution amongthe production teams and the villages. Alternative plans have been
drawn up to mitigate the impacts o f land acquisition. Farmers have been consulted regarding
land-based livelihood restorationand household-based land resources, and the impact o f land
requisition.

According to government statistics, there are no ethnic minority communities inthe project
areas. Duringthe resettlement inventory survey and livelihoodrehabilitation planning a form o f
social assessment screened a corridor on average 2 kmwide -1 kmeither side o f the proposed
railway alignment-- to identify whether ethnic minorities would be affected. The affected
villages vary insize. Focus group discussions andproject key information interviews proved to
be a good instrument for broad consultation as part o fthe strategy to disseminate project
information, collect people's concerns, needs and recommendations, and consult the affected
people about the resettlement andrehabilitation strategy. Fieldfeedback has been incorporated
into the project design and RAP documentation. The resettlement impact survey and focus
group discussions indicatedthat no minority community would be affectedbythe project.

All the affectedhouseholds andvillages havebeenidentifiedthrough the careful detailed
resettlement inventory survey. Project information has been provided to the affected villages and
local governments through newspapers, posters andpublic meetings. It is intendedthat
information disseminationand consultation will continue duringproject implementation. A
resettlement information booklet, including the detailed entitlements o f each household and
compensation and entitlement policies and grievance procedures, will be distributed to the
affected people before resettlement is carried out. The affected communities will play a key role
infinalizing andimplementing their livelihoodrestorationprograms.

Both internal andindependent monitoring o f the resettlement has been designed inthe draft
Resettlement Action Plans for project implementation. The draft Resettlement Action Plans
have beenplacedinlocal libraries and their availability has been advertised inlocal newspapers.

MORhas accumulated much experience inpreparing andimplementingthe on-going (first)
National Railways Project. It will establish a similar institutionalset-up to implement the
proposed project. The arrangements for resettlement implementation are detailed inthe RAPS.
The designwill berefined firther andrelatively minor design changes are likely to continue until
implementation starts. Typically, final designs result inmarginal decreases inlandacquisition
andstructuraldemolition, as well as changes inproportion among categories o faffected landand
structures. The resettlement entitlement matrix applies to the resettlement implementation and
the area affectedby the changes inproject design.

East China Survey andDesign Institute was contractedto conduct the resettlement social
assessment exercise, which has contributed to the project design. The same institute, which is
independent o fMOR, may be hired to conduct the independent monitoring o f the resettlement

Annex 1:Transport Sector Background
                             CHINA: Second National Railways Project

1. BriefDescription of the Transport Sector

Duringthe last decade there havebeenmanychanges affecting the transport sector inChina.
Since the early 199Os, the economy has moved from a centrally planned environment to one
which is more commercialized and competitive; the degree of openness has increased; patterns
o ftransport demand have changed; passenger and freight traffic has grown rapidly, puttingheavy
demands on infrastructure; and the role o fthe private sector has substantially increased.

Roads. China has, inthe past, underinvested inroads; its road network still ranks among the
sparsest inthe world relative to geographic area andpopulation. China's road network in2002
extended roughly 1.76 millionkm, including 25,130 kmof expressways and about 27,468 kmo f
other high-grade highways.

Yet inrecent years, governments at all levels have embarked on major highway investment
programs. At the core of this program i s the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS), a 35,000
kmnetwork composed o f 12majorhighways (five north-south corridors and seven east-west
corridors with an estimated cost o f $150 billion, connecting all provincial capitals and cities with
populations exceeding 500,000 inhabitants (100 major cities). All sections o fthe NTHS will
match U S Interstate or Europeanmotonvay standards. By 2002 roughly 27,000 km, or 77
percent, hadbeen completed. About 5,000 kmare under construction now, while the remaining
3,000 km are yet to bebuilt. The original target completion date for this program was 2020, but
the Government has since decided to push up the deadline to 2007.

Traditional funding resources are inadequate to meet the increasing demands that a growing
economy places on road infrastructure. Financingfor NTHS construction relies heavily on tolls
to repay loans. The government's cash contribution has been raised from three earmarked road-
user charges: the vehicle purchase tax ($4.5 billionin2002), the road maintenance fee ($10
billion), and the highwaytransport management fee ($2.5 billion). But altogether the charges
only covered one-quarter of new construction expenditures in2002. The road maintenance fee i s
inefficient, expensive to administer, easy to evade, and currently generates less than 40 percent
o f its potential. Ofthe revenue collected, only 60 percent is actually used for road maintenance;
the remainder i s spent on new construction. The 1999 authorization o f a fuel tax has yet to be
implemented.

Relative to most other countries inthe world, private sector participation inthe growth o f
China's highway system is extensive. Over the last decade, some 80joint venture transactions
betweenHongKong and mainland developers andtheir mainland-counterpart highway agencies
in 14provinces haveraisedanadditional $9 billionfromprivate sources. Further, asset
securitization (the sale o f highway equity through initial public offerings and private placements,
as a substitute for long-term debt financing) raised another $2 billion through 19 transactions by
2001. Altogether, though, private financing has contributed less than 10 percent o f China's total
commitment to new construction since the early 1980s.




                                                 17

Railways. Bythe end o f 2000, China's rail system reached 68,000 km. The nation constructed
5,600 kmo fnew rail duringthe NinthFive-Year Plan (FYP, 1996-2000), representing an 8
percent increase over the five-year period. Duringthis time, $29 billion was invested inrailway
infrastructure construction--28 percent more than duringthe EighthFYP (1991-99, which itself
had set records for railway investment.

The nation's Tenth FYP (2001-05) proposes to expand the size o f the rail network, speedingup
railway construction inwestem China andadding capacity inthe main corridors o f the eastem
network--notably to link Beijing and Shanghai. By 2005, the length o f the national railway i s
expected to reach 75,000 km, increasingrail inwestemregions bymore than 2,000 km.The
projects should create roughly 14,000 kmo fhigh-speed track--that is, with maximum speeds o f
200-250 kmper hour--across the nationalnetwork, about 25,000 kmo f double-track lines, and
20,000 kmo f electrified lines.

After careful analysis o finternational experience, the PRC government has adopted strategic
goals for the national railway system, aimingto make it more responsive to market needs. The
railway i s spinningo f fnon-transport subsidiaries as independent companies, and incertain
regions has initiatedpilot operations where passenger services are set up as profit centers
separate from freight.

Waterways. Chinahas large navigable rivers--especially incentral andsouthem China--that
linkmanyofits major cities. Moreover China's geography andthe locationofits population are
exceptionally favorable to inlandwater transport. These features create the potential for inland
water transport to claim a larger share o f China's inlandtransport market, which today makes up
roughly 10percent o f freight intons and, because ofthe more efficient use o f existing
waterways, makes up 27 percent o fthe freight ton-km. Many rivers carry large volumes o fbulk
cargo that are hauled from rural to urbanareas for processing. Onthe rivers' upper sections,
limitedwater depth prevents safe year-round access by vessels with capacity o f more than 100
tons. But at a relatively modest cost, the navigation channels on these rivers could be deepened
enoughto enable much larger vessels to reach far upstream. An added advantage i s that inland
water transport has less impact on the environment than rail or road transport. Accordingly, to
ease the pressure of demand for new roads and improvedrailways, the government has recently
increased investment inwaterways to deepen navigation channels and upgradenavigational aids.

Air transport. Although central responsibility for airport developmentremains with the Civil
Aviation Authority o f China (CAAC), China's provinces are increasingly involved indetailed
planning,construction, operation, and financing. CAAC will support between20 and60 percent
o fthe total airport development cost, depending on the airport's role inthe national hierarchy.

Air navigationis stillthe exclusive domain o fCAAC andis likelyto remain so for the
foreseeable future. Although a plan for the development o f air navigation facilities exists, there
is no overall strategy for airport development. Instead, eachproposal is considered on its merits.

The NinthFYP aviation policy emphasized safety and regular quality service. To achieve this,
substantial additions to capacity are being built at international airports inBeijing, Shanghai, and
Guangzhou, as well as inmanyprovincial capital airports, and improvements infacilities for



                                                  18

airport management, flight control, fuel supply and maintenance are under way. Good airfreight
facilities are important inattracting fast growing, highvalue-added industries. The smaller and
newer airports that can offer better services are growing faster than the larger ones. Beijingand
HongKonghave experienced highgrowthrates, despite the opening o f competing airports in
Macau, Zhuhai, and Guangzhou, and massive investmentinupdating freight facilities at
Shanghai.

Multimodaltransport andlogistics. Chinahas for years maintainedahierarchical culture that
resists crossingjurisdictional boundaries. This culture makes it difficult to take advantage o f
opportunities that require "horizontal" interaction--such as multimodal transport. Multimodal
transport requires cooperationbetweenproviders of road transport andrailways, which come
under separate ministries and rarely interact. This may help explain why in 1999 China's
logistics costs were estimated at 18 percent of GDP, highincomparison with the US share o f 9.5
percent inthe mid-1 9 9 0 but~ ~ about average for a transition economy. Transactions that are
lengthy and costly to complete, highinterest charges, and inefficient transport systems have
contributed to China's highlogistics costs. Indeveloped economies, transport costs account for
roughly one-quarter o ftotal logistic costs, while China's transport costs in 1999 totaled roughly
one-half o f its logistics costs. Since 1999, big improvements have beenmade inboth transport
infrastructure and services inthe coastal provinces, but the inland provinces are still lagging.

Urbantransport. The Chinese cities are experiencingrapidgrowthas workers migratefrom
rural to urbanareas. The substantial growth ofmanufacturing and consumer-based industries has
also sped up the process o f urbanization. Most large and mediumcities inChina are already
facing serious traffic congestion problems generated by crowded anddisorderedtraffic.

Inthe early 80s, there were only 28 citieswith over 1millionpeople, butby2002these have
increased to 36, o fwhich 9 are metropolitan areas with a population ofmore than 2 million. As
for the medium-size cities with half a million to one million people, the number increased to 45
duringthe last two decades. The trendofurban expansionis continuing characterized bythe
expansion o f the urbanboundary, the creation o f large regional cities, andthe development of
suburban areas.

Under these circumstances, even thoughinthe last decade Chinese cities investedmassively in
buildingandimproving urbanstreet networks, they canhardly keep pace with the growth rate o f
vehicles. The traditional passenger public transport cannot meet the demands o fmoderncities,
for rapid, on time, and frequent service, andpassengers inmost cities heavily rely on bus and
trolley systems that generally fail to meet the need o f the local residents. A large number o f
bicycles are still used for daily travel to work, sharing streets with motor vehicles. The mixing
o f fast andslow traffic causes traffic disorder andhighaccident rates and slows down the
average vehicle speeds, resulting inless efficient and poor-quality public transport services.

2. MainIssues

To reduce risks and bottlenecks inits transport sector, China needs to address several key issues.




                                                   19

Governmentand administration.Through aprocess o fdecentralization, the State government
has limitedits powers over provinces and, as o f yet, has not established a single, national
ministry responsible for all transport modes and therefore the degree o f administrative reform
varies from province to province. Improved cross-border cooperation o f China's de-centralized
government bodies will be required to meet the demandso f their new roles as regulators.

Regionaldisparities.Provinces along China's eastern seaboardhavebenefitedfrom logistical
accessibility andwell-developed infrastructure, andhave grown more quickly than their western
counterparts and the Northeast, seat o fmucho f China's early heavy industry. Current PRC
government efforts aim to narrow the widening wealth and income disparities among these three
regions by attracting more domestic and foreign investment to the interior.

ShiftinPmarketneeds, Shippers andpassengershavemore options now than ever before and
are requiring faster and higher-quality services. Currently, however, some shippers resort to
expensive and inefficient measures, such as operatingtheir own truck fleets, to ensure quality
service. As users demand better services, not only will infrastructure and other assets have to
improve, but so also will the capacity o f operating companies to integrate services across
transport modes andjurisdictions.

Specifically, road and waterway freight transport will take market share from rail--road transport
because it canprovide better door-to-door service and waterway transport because it is
potentially cheaper for bulk products. Rail andbuses' share o f the passenger transport market
will also shrink, as private car ownership andpassenger air services grow. Demand for container
transport services will increase since containers andmultimodal transport reduce transport costs,
facilitate global supply chains, andprovide the reliable services and delivery that exporters and
foreign investors depend on.

Roadtransport. The PRC government faces manynew challenges concerning the nation's
highways. While continuing to expand the expressway system, Chinawould do well to focus on
overall road network management and maintenance. Other key cross-jurisdictional coordination
issues include improving the transport standards o f western provinces and the management o f
entries andexits to cities, road safety, logistics, and landuse.

China's road investment in2002, including construction andmaintenance, totaled roughly $45
billion. This highlevel o f investment, which represents about 3.5 percent o fthe nation's GDP
and has been maintained duringthe last five years, i s exceptional (few countries spend more than
2 percent o ftheir GDP on transportation). Yet fundingfor maintenance and construction o fthe
secondary and tertiary networks remains inadequate. Additionally, the private sector's share o f
highway financing i s unlikely to increase inthe future. China, therefore, needs to introduce more
efficient and sustainable modes o f financing, such as a surcharge on auto fuel. (The State
Council approvedthe gas surcharge concept inprinciple in 1999,but implementing legislation
has yet to be passed because o f strong objections from many stakeholders. This reform will
entail a far-reaching restructuring o f several major tax revenue sources, public spendingpowers,
andthe balance betweennational andprovincialmandates.)




                                                   20

Railways. The performance o f China's rail systemis, byinternational standards, very good, but
the system needs to expandits capacity further, to keep raising the quality o f services, and to
acquire modemtechnology to remaincompetitive inthe future. Inthe past, PRC rail
management has tendedto emphasize maximizing volumes carried rather than generating
revenue or improvingthe value o f services. But attitudes are changing.

The PRC government may find it useful to address these longer-term strategic questions: How
muchcompetition should be allowed among companies offering rail transport services (private
or otherwise)? Can pricing be made flexible enough so that it reflects costs more accurately,
permits fees on a service-by-service basis, and allows carriers and customers to enter into
contracts that cover price and service quality? And what i s the best way to handle surplus labor
as information technology eliminates the need for manyjobs? China opened its rail freight
market to new privatejoint ventures inspecialized markets, such as container services, as part o f
its World Trade Organization entry.

Waterways. As China's economy matures and shifts toward manufacturing high-value
intermediate and finished products, the primary sector (farming, fishing, forestry, andmining)
andconstructionwill decline inrelative importance, shrinking the market for inlandwater
transport. The coastal provinces will feel this transition first. But inland water transport may
continue to thrive for bulk cargoes, oversized loads, or dangerous cargo; it may even prosper in
the coastal provinces--especially inriver deltas--where no road or rail altemative is readily
available. A niche market for containers may also develop inplaces where road andrail service
is deficient. Taken together, the demand for transport on China's major rivers i s likely to remain
substantial for at least the next couple o f decades.

To increase inlandwater transport efficiency, continuing channel upgrades and fleet
modemization includingthe use o f separatebarges andpusher units insteado f self-powered
small vessels, will be necessary.

Private fundingmay be crucial inmeeting China's water transport demands, but further
commercialization may be difficult because it implies an end to family-operated vessels, which
are an important source o f employment.

Air transport. Eventhough air transport makes up the smallest share o f China's total freight
transport, it is the fastest growing mode, with more than 2 million tons transported in2002,
compared with only 100,000 tons in 1980. And airfreight is important for China's international
trade since it allows quick access to China's two major markets--Europe and the UnitedStates.
Chinese officials are aware that the rapid growth inair travel creates a need for strong
infrastructure investment inthe sector. Most government resources have been allocated to
finance new runways. But as runway use and aircraft size increase, medium- and long-term
investments will shift toward passenger terminals. Inthe past, most fundinghas been allocated
to finance new airports, terminals, and other facilities to serve large cities incoastal provinces.
Since the Great Westem Development Strategy began in2000, the government's attentionhas
shifted to the needs o f China's interior.




                                                  21

Modernization o f air traffic control inthe coastal air corridors has begunineamest. The next
step will be expanding air routes as the demand for intemal flights increases.

Urbantransportinfrastructure. Population growth andincreasedvehicle use are severely
straining China's urbantransport infrastructure. The last decadehas thus seen a decline in
mobility for most classes o f urbantransport--especially bicycling andwalking. As fast as ring
roads are built, traffic expands to fillthem. And the urbaninfrastructure planningprocess i s
neither comprehensive nor systematic.

China's urbanization andmotorization growth rates have skyrocketed. The central government's
current policies support bothtrends, which are expected to continue into the foreseeable future.
According to UnitedNations forecasts, China's urban population will increase from 30.2 percent
o fthe population (3 19 million) in 1995 to 49.1 percent (712million) in2020. Car ownership i s
projectedto increase tenfold from an average o f 10 cars per 1,000 residents to 100 cars per 1,000
residents duringthe same period.

It is hopedthat traffic management andprovisions for non-motorized traffic will be facilitated by
implementation o f a new road traffic safety law that took effect inM a y 2004. It creates a formal
mechanism for coordination among the many government agencies with an interest inroad
safety.

3. MainPolicyRecommendations

Transportationwill be increasingly vital inChina as the nation's economy continues to change
from a planned, centralized system to one that i s market-based and decentralized. To satisfy the
rapidly changing needs o ftransport users, provide the necessary conditions for economic growth,
improve access andmobility among the poor, and protect the environment, China will need to
design, and fund, appropriate transport strategies.

Inthe short andmedium termthe Chinese governmentneedsto implement anumber ofpolicies
to improve the performance o f its transport sector. The Bank recommends that the Government
give priority to the following:
        Strengthen coordinationbetweenroad and rail systems by creating a government entity at
        the ministerial level that covers all transport modes, develop an effective institutional and
        regulatory capacity, and assist government to adapt to the role o fplanner and regulator.
        Identifyand create sustainable financing sources, includinga fuel tax.
        Create a more favorable environment for private sector investments.
        Support market-based initiatives for the provision o f infrastructure and services to enable
        China to take full advantage o f globalization through improved transport logistics and
        trade facilitation.
        Support modal reforms and facilitate the introduction o fmarket-based transport
        operations and services that offer more flexible pricing.
        Choose investments that will improve accessibility for lagging provinces, andwill reduce
        regional disparities through the provision o f critical links between eastern and westem
        China.



                                                   22

    0    Support direct investments inpoor communities through the completion o fprovincial
         roadnetworks that improve accessibilityto poor andremote areas.
    0    Strengthen management o f sector externalities such as pollution, health, and safety and
         integrate urban transport planning and management.

Manyo fthese objectives are already reflectedinthe Government's Tenth Five Year Planfor the
transport sector to support economic growth andspread its benefits to lower-income populations.
These plans call for continued efforts to improve networks--mainly through capacity increases in
infrastructure--andto develop transport services further.

PRC authorities are committed to continue construction o f the National Trunk Highway System
to complete the 35,000 kmnetwork by 2007; to improve transport to and within China's western
regions; and to improve accessibility to low-income populations everywhere inChina. This
long-term planinvolves extendingthe East-West and North-Southhighways (which today total
roughly 18,000 km) to link the interior regions to the coast and to connect western provinces
together. It also involves rehabilitating and upgrading technical standards on about 180,000 km
o fthe western roadnetwork and developing roughly 150,000 kmo frural access road.

The Government has announced that it attaches importance to developing and implementing
logistics concepts--particularly for container transport withinthe seven corridors leading to the
interior from major ports; improving road safety; anddeveloping market mechanisms in
infrastructure construction andoperation and inthe provision o f transport services. Further
reform o f transport sector institutions andthe continued development market regulations will
facilitate effective implementation o f logistic concepts.

According to recent international experience, the Government would do well to follow a number
o f general principles when formulating its transport sector policies. Except incases o f clear
market failure, rely more on the market and less on the government to allocate resources; allocate
public expenditures inthe transport sector more efficiently; and set standards andregulations for
consulting firms, construction companies, and for freight andpassenger transport services.
These standards should include minimumconditions for market entry that are consistent with
gradual improvements inservice and safety quality, and should include regulations for
transporting hazardous materials and other special transport.

Inthe short term, ifthe Government improves coordinationbetweenChina's transport modes by
creating a Ministry o f Transport, develops an effective institutional and regulatory capacity, and
creates a sustainable financing source (including a fuel tax), it will achieve the ambitious goals
defined inits current transportationplans. Inthe medium term, ifChina succeeds inmaintaining
highlevelsofinvestmentintransport infrastructure andselectsinvestments that will improve
accessibility for lagging provinces, it will reduce the regional disparities between eastern and
western China. But inthe long term, only through improved transport logistics andtrade
facilitation, anddirectly supporting market-based initiatives for the provision o f infrastructure
and services, will China create a more favorable environment for private sector investments and
be able to take f i l l advantage o f globalization.

The improvements will reduce the ideal minimumtravel time for express passenger trains from
628 to 336 minutes. For freight trains the corresponding reduction will be from 918 to 778
minutes. Other benefits include a small increase incapacity (largely due to reduced headways
made possible by upgraded signaling) and lower operating costs (due to energysavings and
better utilization o f locomotives and rolling stock).

Beneficiaries would include customers inthis important east-west corridor, not only inthe three
provinces through which the line passes (Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Hunan) but also provinces to the
west from which long-distance traffic originates or to which it i s destined. It is expected that
such improved transport services will encourage economic growth inthe region by attracting
new manufacturingindustries, while contributing to the efficiency andimproved financial
performance o f China Railways generally. It will also help reduce environmental pollution by
replacingpolluting diesel with clean electric locomotives; hydro-electricity contributes a large
part o ftotal power supply inthe corridor.

Component1: Zhe-GanLineImprovements, 1A: SpeedRaising. The Zhe-Gan line is
representative o fthe China Railways 2003-2007 Development Plan that calls for raising the
speeds and improving the quality o fpassenger services on selected railway corridors nationwide.
Under this planthe maximumoperating speed o f express passenger trains would be raisedto 200
km/h.MORwould carry out civil works relatedto physical infrastructure neededto permitspeed
increases on the Zhe-Gan line with its own funding. The track is to be realigned and upgraded at
about 245 locations covering about 900 kmof track length (about 50 percent o ftrack on this
line) to increase the radius o f curves that would permit higher operating speeds. Track radius
would be increased to 2,800m innormal sections and 2,200m indifficult sections for 200 km/h
speed. After realignment the track length would reduce from the current 943 to 916 km. Inall
109bridges (26.8 kmtotal length), including 12 extra-long bridges(15.0 km length) would be
constructed and26 existing bridges improved. The section has 29 tunnels (12.2 km). In
addition, 24 double-track (9.5 km) and 4 single-track (1.8 km)new tunnels will be built. The
turnouts (points) on the maintrack at stations where speeds o f 140km/hor 200 km/hi s to be
permitted will be replacedwith suitable high-speedturnouts. MOR will self-finance the civil
works required for speed-raising.


                                                  28

 Component1:Zhe-Gan LineImprovements,1B: SignalingandCommunications. The
 project will finance the procurement o f signaling and communication equipment that would be
 installedto upgrade signaling and communications systems. The design headwaybetweentrains
 wouldbe reduced from the current 8 minutesto 7 minutes. For safety the entire linewill be
 fenced to keep people o f f the track andbridgesto carry roads over or under the line will replace
 level crossings. Other measures to enhance safety of train operation, such as cab signaling, train
 radio communication; installation o f hot-box detectors andtrain over-speed detection devices
 would also be taken. The Bank loan would finance procurement o f equipment.

 Component1:Zhe-Gan LineImprovements, 1C: Electrification. The electrification o fthis
 diesel-operated line would closely follow the realignment o f track for raising the maximum
 operating speed. The loan will finance procurement o f equipment for overhead catenary, traction
 substations andpower supply for electrification. The electrification would lower the railway's
 operating costs and increase its capacity, allowing it to carry goods andpassengers it would
 otherwise have to turn away.

 The following equipment would be requiredto operate the electrified Zhe-Ganline:

         0        10 electric multiple-unit (EMU) trains
         0        34 SS9 electric locomotives for passenger trains
         0        81 SS4 electric locomotives for freight trains

 After electrification the 200 km/h super express trains would be operated by the EMUs, while
 slowerpassenger and freight trains would be operated with the electric locomotives. The 115
 electric locomotives and 10EMUtrains would replace 264 diesel locomotives. The stronger
 electric locomotives would be able to pull heavier freight trains (maximumtrain weight raised
 from 3,300 tons to 4,000) and at higher speeds. The average speed o f super express trains would
 increase from 86 to 150 Whythat o f express passenger trains from 68 to 125 km/h, and that o f
 freight trains from 35.8 to 43 km/h. The number o f passenger train pairs would increase from 41
 in2002 to 54 in2010 and64 in2015.

 M O R will self-finance all the locomotives andEMUs. 105 passenger and 159 freight existing
 diesel locomotives would be released from service on this line.

 Component2: Modernizationof Track MaintenanceTechnology. This project will finance
 the acquisition o fheavy equipment for renewal and maintenance of rail andtrack roadbed. The
 procurement o fthese heavy track machines i s part o f anon-going modernization and reform
 project, whose goal i s to set up adequately equipped specialized entities to handle track
 maintenance on the entire China Railways route network (Track Maintenance Depots - TMD).
.M O R i s augmenting the capacity o f TMDs by acquiring additional heavy track machines. TMDs
 are at present covering about 40,000 track-km. With additional capacity they would cover a total
 o f 67,000 track-km o f the system (about halfthe total track-km). The intentioni s that TMDs
 should service all mail trunk line tracks andall high-density main routes that have traffic volume
 greater than 25 million tons per year.

 The project will also finance the procurement o f rail-basedmobile cranes to allow faster
 response times for clearing the tracks after accidents andderailments on the mainlines.


                                                  29

Track maintenance i s divided into three activities:
    (a) Daily management and maintenance covers safety inspections andlight spot repairs
        carried out manuallyor with small track machines;
    (b) Overhaul andmaintenance oftrack with largemachines covers periodic tamping,
        stabilization and overhaul; and
    (c) Inspectionandmaintenance o f track usingspecial engineering equipment such as track
        inspectioncars and crack detection cars.

MORhas retaineddaily maintenance with the operationalentity (Administrations) andhas
separated the other activities --(b) and (c) above-- and assigned them to TMDs. Inorder to
ensure quality, the work carried out by TMD i s accepted by a quality assuranceteam (acceptance
team). The acceptance team i s located withinthe user administration. At present a TMD serves
only the administration inwhich it is located. The price for track work carried out is either
negotiated or there is a lump sum payment for an agreed output o f track work for each year.
Bonus is paidifthe output exceeds the initialtargets. The saving inrailway employees engaged
on track maintenance andoverhaul is o f the order o f 20 percent with the change over to heavy
machine maintenance. In1992, MOR deployed 345,322 permanent way staff for maintenance of
106,000 track km(3.25 persons per km). With the progressive introduction o fheavytrack
machines, in2001 it deployed 316,601 permanent way staff for maintenance o f 127,000 track
km(2.49 persons per km).

Thebenefits o fchange to employing heavy track machinemaintenance system over the light
machine maintenance are restorationo fnormal operational speeds relatively quickly after heavy
maintenancehepair, better quality, reduced labor and increase inintervalbetween maintenance.
For example, the yearly maintenance will be extended to 18 months when heavy machines are
used. The overhaul interval, however, remains the same at 7-8 years. Further, track under
intensive use cannot be maintained properly unless heavy track machines are deployed.

MORproposes to separate its 19track maintenance depots, which are at present part o fthe 14
Railway Administrations, into independent entities. Eventually, they would be subsidiaries o f a
single Group Company. The timetable for the separation o fthe track maintenance depots has yet
to be established.

Component 3: Technical Assistance. Consulting services will be hired for strengthening
MOR'Splanning, management and technology systems. The loanwill finance 91% ofthe cost.

MORhasproposedthe following subjects for TA, andwill define more subjects later on.

a) Traffic Analysis and Forecasting Methods

Forecast o f traffic is an essential input for evaluating a railway investment project. M O R wishes
to strengthen andmodemize the approach andprocedure for forecasting traffic inorder to meet
the rigorous requirements o fNDRC for project appraisal. This will call for use of modem
scientific methods for estimating freight as well as passenger traffic between origin and
destination pairs.




                                                   30

It is proposedto study the approach andmethodology for railway traffic forecasting employedby
developed countries and then adapt it to suit China's environment. A suitable computer-based
methodology will be developed to obtainrelatively better and more reliable estimates for traffic.
The TA will include the development o fnecessary computer programs.

The output o fthis TA will include:

    0     A "Railway Traffic Forecasting Handbook" which describes the altemative forecast
          models, conditions and parameters to be considered, methodology employed, and
         procedures to check the reliability o fresults.
    0     Developing an information system anddatabase for the important parameters.
    0     Technical training to concemed staff.

b) PolicyFrameworkfor ResettlementandEnvironmentalProtection

To meet the growing transportationdemand, China intends to utilize capital from the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank to expand and improve its railway network. Compliance
with national laws as well as safeguard policies o f the lending agencies relatedwith
environmental and social issues such as resettlement o f affectedpersons i s important to ensure
smooth preparation, appraisal and implementationo fprojects. It is, therefore, essential that
M O R develop policies and procedure for managingthe safeguards-related issues in an
expeditious and effective manner.

The proposedTA will survey and review the current policies andpractices for resettlement and
environment for railway projects inboth China and foreign countries. It will also review the
requirements o f state laws and the policies o fmultilateral agencies as well as o f other countries
inrespect ofsafeguards. The objective willbethat safeguard issues are dealt withexpeditiously
andthese should not, as i s the casenow, become critical activities inproject preparation as well
as implementation. Concerned departments and safeguards experts o f multilateral agencies and
those of developed countries will also be consulted. Based on the above, the study team will
prepare a draft paper that lays down the norms and procedures for handlingenvironmental and
resettlement-related work and assign responsibilities to specific agencies. Responsibilities o f
relevant departments will be defined. Suitable measures and responsibility for ensuring
compliance with standards andprocedures will also be included. The document will then be
submitted for review and approval o f MOR.

MORproposes to retain domestic as well as international consultants for this TA.

c) EquipmentStandardsfor Planningof ElectrifiedNetwork

The total operating length o f electrified railway inChina is 18,758 km. Except for lines o f
Guangzhou-Shenzhen, Harbin-Dalian and Qinghuangdao-Shenyang, which are equippedwith
imported technology and designed for speed o f 200 km/h, the maximum speed allowed on the
rest o f the electrifiednetwork i s 160krdhor less. This TA will help develop design and
equipment standards for 2001- km/hspeed overhead catenary system (OCS).




                                                  31

The objective o fthe TA i s to study international standards o f high-speed electrified railways and
develop a set o f standards for designing, construction, installation andtestingas well as
operatingmaintenance inreference to railways in China. These standards will pay special
attentionto safety aspects o f OCS.

The study will be carried out inthree phases. Phase Iwill consist o f data and information
gathering inrespect o f design, construction, installation, testing, operating andproblems on
quality control o f OCS indeveloped countries. A comparisonwill be made o f experience with
respect to factors such as cost o f equipment and installation, operating costs, maintenance
requirements, reliability and safety. Special attentionwill be paidto identifying problems
encountered with particular designs and equipment.

InPhase11,the studyteamwillmaketechnical visits to OCS installations, construction sites,
testing facilities, operating equipment and factory workshops. Differences on standards and
performance will be identified through discussions with international experts.

InPhase111,basedonthe information gathered andadvice received, draft standards willbe
prepared for designing, construction, installation and testing as well as operating maintenance o f
high-speed electrical OCS. The draft document will cover the following areas:

    1. Designunder special environment ( e g catenary at bridges, tunnels, stations andyards);
    2. Standardized design drawings for traction power supply stations;
    3. Standardized design for catenary;
    4. Measures for quality assurance;
    5. Recommendations for new equipment, spare parts, materials, maintenance tools, and
        raising staff productivity for maintenance;
    6. Application o f new technology for electrifiedrailways (testing o fpantograph and
        catenary, automatic neutral section insulating device, etc.);
    7. High-efficiency work methodology for maintenance.

A workshop will beheldinChina to discuss the draft document and arrive at recommendations
for approval byMOR.

M O R proposes to hire local as well international consultants for this TA.

d) Managementof ConstructionSupervision

The demands for railway transportation, both intraffic volumes and inservice quality, have been
growing steadily inChina. M O R is planningto build or upgrade a railway network composed o f
eight east-west corridors crossedby eight north-south trunk lines. The western railroad network
will also be expanded. Upgrading and capacity expansion o fthe existing railways andthe
raising o ftrain speeds is also a highpriority target. Duringimplementation o f the   lothand 1lth
Five-Year Plans (2001-2010), MOR will construct several newrailway lines including the
Beijing-Shanghai DedicatedPassenger Railway and the Northwest and the Southwest Cross-
Border Railway Corridors.




                                                  32

Railway construction on such a large scale will pose a serious challenge to the railway's
construction industry. M O Rproposes to engage a consultant for training and the development o f
project management techniques for effective supervision and quality assurance o f large
construction activities. M O R has already concluded a contract with an international consultant
for training o frailway managers with respect to environmental protection andmanagement
duringrailway construction.

The consultant will review the current procedures and techniques used for managingrailway
civil engineeringprojects. Management procedures at two major construction sites will be
studied to determine the improvementsthat are requiredto be incorporatedto bringthe project
management and supervision inChina to international standards. Based on the above review the
consultant will prepare a one-week training program and training material for managers o f MOR.
The consultant will then hold a one-week classroom training program for about 20 participants in
China. At the conclusion o f the classroom training, the consultant will accompany the trainees
on a field trip to one or two major construction sites inChina to review the project management
techniques andprocedures inuse for showing practical examples.

The expert will prepare a guidebook inEnglish language for project management techniques for
large railway civil engineering projects. This guidewill cover all major aspects o fproject
management and include intemationally accepted techniques.

The Bank will explore the availability o f grant funding for the Management o f Construction
Supervision technical assistance.

                          CHINA: SecondNationalRailwaysProject


1. Summary of the FinancialManagementAssessment

The Bankteam assessedthe adequacy o f the financial management system for the Project. The
assessment, based on guidelines issued by the Financial Management Sector Board inJune 2001,
concludedthat the Project meets minimumBank financial management requirements, as
stipulated inBP/OP 10.02. This project bears many similarities to the (first) National Railway
Project currently nearingcompletion andwill be usingthe same FMarrangement as before (e.g.,
internal controls and reporting), which were previously assessedand determined to be
acceptable. Inthe team's opinion, the project will have inplace an adequate financial
management system that can provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely
information on the status o f the project inthe reporting format requiredby the Bank and agreed
with the client.

The loanwill be disbursed using the traditional disbursement techniques and will not be using
PMR-based disbursements, inaccordance with the agreement between the Bank and MOF.

N o outstanding audits or audit issues exist with any o fthe implementing agencies involved. The
task team however will continue to be attentive to financial management matters and audit
covenants duringproject supervisions.

CountryIssues: To date, no Country Financial Accountability Assessment has beenperformed
for China, though dialogue with the Government inrespect of such an exercise i s underway. The
Bankhasreliedona similar exercise carried out bythe AsianDevelopment Bank in2000 for
reference.

However, based on observations o f developments inthe areas o f public expenditures, accounting
andauditing, andBank experience with Chinaprojects for the past few years, we note that
substantial progress has beenmade inthese areas and further improvement i s expected inthe
next few years. As economic reform further unfolds, the Government has come to realize the
importanceo f establishing andmaintaining an efficient and effective market mechanism to
ensure transparency and accountability, and minimize potential fraud or corruption.

ImplementingEntities:For the proposedproject, all Bank-financedprocurement and
disbursement functions will be handledby the Ministry o fRailway's Foreign Capital and
Technology Import Center (FCTIC). Similar to previous Bank railwayprojects, a central Project
Management Office (PMO) has been established under FCTIC. Separate PMOSalso have been
set up inthe three railway administration bureaus (Shanghai, Nanchangand Guangzhou). They
will awardMOR-financed contracts and supervise their implementation; no Bankfunds will be
directed to them.

  Strengths and Weaknesses
  (1) Strengths: MOR is ahighly centralized ministryinChina's government system. The
 organizational arrangement is simple andthe division of responsibilities is clear. FCTIC and the
  PMOs involved have extensive experience with Bank projects.



I Weaknesses                         Resolution
  1. Some financial staff are new to Strong assistanceand training program will be provided by FCTIC.
  Bank's projects and are short of
  relevant experience.
  2. FCTIC's knowledge on Bank       FCTIC's financial staff will better familiarize themselves with
  project financial management       Bank's requirementson project financial management. RequiredFM
  requirements needs to be updated.  procedures are beingdocumented in a financial manual.

          project transaction        FCTIC should consider the possibility of using accounting software
  accounting treatment may be        to processtheir transactions. Necessary internal controls will be
  manually processed.                maintainedto ensure the accuracy of accounting records if
                                     transactions continue to be processedmanually.

  FundsFlow: The Bank loanwill be signedwiththe People's Republicof China through its
  MinistryofFinance(MOF) andon-lent to MOR. TheBankloanproceedswill flow from the
  Bank into the project special account to be set up at and managedby FCTIC and finally to
  contractorsor suppliers. Counterpart funds will follow domestic procedures.

  Staffing: Adequate project accounting staffwith educational background and work experience
  commensuratewith the work they are expectedto perform is one of the factors critical to
  successful implementation of project financial management. Basedon discussions, observation
  andreviewofthe educational background andwork experienceofthe staff identifiedfor
  financial and accounting positions inthe PMOs, the task team notes that they are qualified and
  appropriateto the work they are expectedto perform.

  To strengthen financial management capacity andachieve consistent quality of accounting work,
  MORhas drafted a project financial management manual. Itprovides detailed guidelines on
  financial management, internalcontrols, accounting procedures, fund and asset managementand
  withdrawal applications.



                                                   37

AccountingPoliciesandProcedures: The administration, accountingandreportingo fthe
project will be set up inaccordance with the Circular #13: "Accounting Regulations for World
Bank FinancedProjects" issued inJanuary 2000by MOF. The circular provides in-depth
instructions on accounting treatment o fproject activities and covers the following:

    0   Chart of accounts
    0   Detailed accounting instructions for each project account
    0   Standard set o f project financial statements
    0   Instructions on the preparation o fproject financial statements

The above standard set o fproject financial statements hasbeen agreedbetweenthe Bank and
MOF andapplies to all Bankprojects appraisedafter July 1, 1998 and includes the following:

    0   Balance sheet
    0   Statement o f sources and uses o f funds
    0   Statement o f implementation o f loan agreement
    0   Statement o f special account

EachPMO will bemanaging, monitoring and maintaining its respective project accounting
records. Original supporting documents for project activities will be retainedby the PMOS.

ReportingandMonitoringandFormatof FinancialStatements: Each PMOwill prepare the
above four financial statements, which will thenbe reviewed, approved and consolidatedby
FCTIC before being sent to the Bank for review andcomment on a regular basis. Inline with the
newly issued Financial MonitoringReport (FMR) guidelines, the un-auditedproject consolidated
financial statements will be submitted as part o f each FMRto the Bank on a semi-annual basis
(prior to August 15 and February 15 o f the following year).

InternalAudit: Although MORhas its own internal audit department, it does not perform audit
procedures on its subsidiaries on an annual basis. Furthermore, we have not and will not assess
the competency o f the internal audit department due to the costibenefit o f doing such work.
Reliancewill therefore not be placed on work performed by them.

InformationSystems: The accountingtreatment o fproject transactions o f all the previous
railway projects were manually processed. Although accounting software developedby MOR
has been usedby FCTIC, it i s only for domestic reporting purposes and it i s impossible to
integrate the project transactions into this system. The Bank team discussed with FCTIC the
possibility o f developing a new system or purchasing existingsoftware to process the project
transactions. The team will review the adequacy of their financial accounting andreporting
software ifFCTIC decides to adopt such an information system. Otherwise ifthey insist on
continuing with a manual system, a soundinternal control should be maintained to ensure that
complete and accurate financial information can be provided ina timely manner.

SupervisionPlan: A detailed supervisionplan for this project will be included as part o fthe
China Audit Strategy document which i s currently inprocess. This planwill take into
consideration the size o f the project and the risk identified.

                                     2. Audit Arrangements

The Bank requires that project financial statements be audited inaccordance with standards

Disbursement methods, such as replenishment, direct payment and special commitment, are
available for the project. The SOE limitswill be set up inline with the procurement post-review
threshold, as follows: (i) contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent o f $100,000 or
                          all
less; (ii)
         consultant contracts estimated to cost $100,000 (firm) /$50,000 (individual) or less.

One special account (SA) will be established inFCTIC. Its authorized allocation i s proposed to
not exceed $20 million (initially $12 million, raisedto the full amount once disbursements reach
$50 million). From the SA, the Bank funds would be disbursed to the special account set up at
FCTIC, andthento supplier and contractors.

FCTIC will be directly responsible for the management, monitoring, maintenance and
reconciliationo fthe SA activities of the project. Supporting documents requiredfor Bank
disbursements will be prepared by FCTIC before sendingto the Bank for further disbursement
processing.

                                      Annex 8: Procurement
                           CHINA: SecondNationalRailwaysProject


1.      Duringappraisal the projectteam assessedthe implementing agency's procurement
capacity. The assessment report was archived inthe project files andi s summarizedbelow.

2.      This will be the tenth Bank-financed railway project inChina. The Foreign Capital and
Technical Import Center (FCTIC) o f the Ministry o fRailways (MOR) will be responsible for
coordination andoversight o fthe Bank-financed procurement under the project. FCTIC has
engaged China InternationalTendering Company as the procurement agent to actually carry out
all Bank-financedprocurement activities. CITC has undertaken many Bank-financed projects
including several railway projects inChina.

3.      The team assessedthe overall risk o f the procurement process as average and confirmed
the capacity and capability o fFCTIC andthe procurement agent to satisfactorily manage the
project procurement activities. Staff members who were involved inprevious Bank-financed
railway projects are familiar with the Bank`sprocurement procedures. Duringthe assessment the
need was identified for strengthening the agencies' procurement capacity and an actionplanwas
discussed and agreed. It includes the preparation and dissemination o f a project-specific
procurement manual, measures to be taken to improve the quality o fbiddingdocuments, and
procurement seminars andworkshops to be organized for staff of the involved agencies.

4.     The assessment also identified the main ways inwhich the Tendering and BiddingLaw
o f China differs from the Bank Guidelines. However, under the Project there will be no Bank-
financed procurement using national competitive biddingrules, so no waivers for such
procurement needbe incorporatedinto the procurement schedule o fthe LoanAgreement.

ProcurementArrangements

5.     ProcurementPlan: A procurementplandated April 23,2004 has beenagreed with
FCTIC (see Attachment 1andAttachment 2 to this Annex). The plancovers all the Bank-

prospective sources o f supply inChina and from abroad. For each group o f similar contracts
within eachcategory o f goods, there willbe a single Invitation for Bidsto be advertised. Bidders
may bidfor one or any combinations o f the contracts under such an invitation. Discounts offered
for award o fmultiple contracts will be evaluated to arrive at the lowest evaluated cost to the
purchaser.

      Annex 9a: EconomicAnalysis of Zhe-GanLineSpeed-raisingandElectrification


A. Introduction

This annex presents the results o fthe economic evaluation o fthe electrification and realignment
o fthe railway line between Hangzhou and Zhuzhou (hereafter the Zhe-Gan line). As explained
fbrther and as reflectedinTable 9.1,the component i s expected to yield a net present value of
over RMB7 billion and to achieve an economic rate ofreturn o f 19percent.


B. Traffic andCapacity

The Zhe-Gan line constitutes a part o f the major east-west railway artery that links areas west o f
Zhuzhou with the eastern coastal region centered inShanghai. Indeed, the line will be a critical
part ofthe "Shanghai-Kunming (Chengdu) corridor" -one o f the so-called "eight horizontals"
and "eight verticals" that will comprise the backbone o f the China railway network. These
corridors, the development of which will be the centerpiece of the railway construction program
inthe TenthFive-Year Plan, willbethe "best equipped, withthe highest degree of
modernizationand [the] largest carrying capacities. They are also the important carriers o fthe
future modern rail networks, e.g. the fast passenger train network, container transportation
network, et^."^

Today, the Zhe-Gan line primarily handles freight movements. Measuredinterms o f converted
ton-kms (where one passenger-km is considered equal to one ton-km), over three-fifths o f the
traffic consists of freight. Looking to the future, however, passenger travel i s expected to
account for most o f the growth. As o f 2015 (the benchmark long-term year inMOR's
projections), passenger volume is expected to be more than 15 percent larger than it was in2000.
Bycontrast, over this same 15-year period, freight traffic is anticipatedto grow byonly about
ninepercent. As aresult, by2015 the passenger share oftotal convertedton-kms will exceed40
percent. Thus, inassessing the costs and benefits o f the proposed Zhe-Gan component, attention
properly i s focused on the passenger ~ e c t o r . ~

The enhanced prospect for personaltravel over the Zhe-Gan line is consistent with recent
nationaltrends. After more than two decades o f intermittent gain and decline, the volume of
inter-city passenger traffic being handledby CR has grown substantially. Between 1996 and
2002 (the latest year for which complete data are available), railwaypassenger traffic (as
measured inpassenger-km) has increased at an average annual compound rate o fnearly 7%.
This iswell inline with overall traffic trends by all transport modes. As a result --and incontrast

  "Major Progress inRailways, Science and Technology," Chinese Railways (Vol. 9, No. 2, 2001, Issue 17) at p. 26,

  Although MOR's "with project" traffic forecasts are heldconstant after 2015, the analysis here extends the
increasesassumedfor the 2010-2015 period out to the year 2027. Thus freight traffic increases at 644 millionton-
kmsper year (about 700,000 tons) while passengervolume grows at 223 millionp-kmsper year (242,000 persons
annually). Annual historical and forecast freight and passengertraffic data are inthe Project File.


                                                         54

to prior periods-- the railway share o ftotal (all modes) traffic has stabilized at between 35%-37%
since 1996.

To attract andretainthe expected increase inpassenger business, MOR i s inthe process o f
substantially reducing travel times byraising the maximumtrain speeds over the Zhe-Gan line as
well as over the other "horizontals" and "verticals."             Comparedto diesel traction speeds o fno
more than 140km/h, the top speed over the realigned and electrified Zhe-Ganroute i s expected
to be 200 km/h. As a consequence, the travel time between Hangzhou and Zhuzhou will be
reduced. Inaddition to present users, this consumer benefit is expected to attract two other types
o fpassengers: those who are utilizing other, slower railway routes (incremental traffic) as well
as new intercity travelers.

Over time, the combined impact o f greater volumes and faster speeds on the capacity o fthe Zhe-
Ganlinewill be substantial. Today, the capacity o fthe line stands at 176train pairsper day.
Completion o f the proposed electrification and realignment project, however, would expand this
figure to 188 train pairs per day (a 7% increase). Set against this i s the anticipated demand
considered here interms o f factored train pairs - a measure that provides a rough indication of
the impact on capacity o f different types o fpassenger and freight operations. The
demandcapacity implications o f going forward with the project comparedwith a do nothing,
"without project" scenario canbe quantified. If90 percent i s employed as a benchmark o fwhen
traffic would be turned away due to lack o f track capacity, it i s evident that inthe "without
project" case by the year 2010 problems will arise only inthe Yingtan-Xiangxi section andto a
lesser extent at the eastern end o fthe route; by 2015, however, almost all o fthe line will be at or
over capacity ifthere is no project. Inthe "with project'' scenario, the data confirm that all of the
line will be able to handle the projected demand in2010 although some difficulties will begin to
emerge inthe Yingtan-Xiangxi section and at the east endby 2015.

c. costs
Direct Project Costs. MOR advises that almost 9 percent o f total project costs relate to labor
outlays (infinancial prices, RMB 1.0 billion out o f an overall amount o f RMB 12.4 billion). For
purposes o f economic analysis, labor expenses are shadow pricedto account for non-wage
benefits (housing, education, health care, etc.). Applyingthe shadow price factor o f 1.6 utilized
inprevious railways projectsto these labor outlays, results ina somewhat highertotal project
cost figure for the purposes o f economic analysis o f about RMB 13 billion (see Table 9.1).

Complementary Costs. Three types o f complementary costs are accounted for inthe analysis:
the investment outlays for electric locomotives and rolling stock; the generating costs associated
with the electric power that will berequired; and the further operating expenses required for
maintenance of electrical equipment. Each o f these i s reflectedinTable 9.1.

  ~    ~~




  Inthe "with project" scenario, there is little likelihoodthat traffic wouldbe turnedaway due to capacity
constraints. With respect to passenger traffic, for example, MOR assumes on average a load factor o f about 50
percent. A modest increase inthis percentage will accommodate the additional demand after 2015. As for freight,
improvements intrain operations are likely to absorb the added "with project" volume post-2015, but evenifthis
traffic was to be re-routed over adjacent railway lines, the added costs inthis out-year periodwould have an
insignificant affect onbottom-line NPV (on the order o f five percent or less).


                                                           55

Electric Locomotives and Rolling Stock. The proposed project necessarily requires the
acquisition o f electric traction locomotives for both freight andpassenger service. M O R
indicates that in2006 it will purchase 81 SS4 units for freight service at a unit cost o fRMB 8.7
million.Forpassengertrains, 34 SS9 locomotives will beobtained at aunit cost o fRMB 9.0
million along with 10 EMU(electric multiple-unit) trains each with 14 coaches at a unitcost of
RMB 100million. Assuminga service life o f 16 years, anidentical set ofunitswill be acquired
inthe out years ofthe estimate period. (The avoidedcost ofpurchasingwhat willbecome
unneeded diesel locomotives i s treated as a benefit- see below.)

Electric Power Generation. MOR estimates that the installed electrical capacity required for the
Zhe-Gan line is 614,000 kVA (kilovolt-amperes) and that the annual price o f electrical power
will amount to RMB 156per kVA. Thus, the electric power generation costs will amount to
about RME3 95.8 millionper year.

Electric Equipment Maintenance. There are two cost items inthis category. The first deals with
catenary maintenance, which MOR calculates to be about RMB 6.7 million per year. In
addition, MOR estimates the annual cost o ftraction substation maintenance at RMB 2.7 million.
The associated yearly labor outlay for these items i s expected to be RMB 11.1million. Taken
together, the complementary electric equipment maintenance costs equal RMB20.6 million per
year.


D. Benefits

The benefits o f the electrification and realignment ofthe Zhe-Gan line fall into three major
categories: the time savings associated with faster personal trip times (the benefits ofwhich are
obtained by the railway's customers); the operating cost savings attributable to switching from
dieselto electric traction (these productionbenefits are accorded to CR); andthe capital cost
savings resulting from not having to acquire diesel locomotives (a benefit also gained by CR).
These benefits (along with the total costs andthe benefit-cost ratio) are summarized inthe
accompanyingtable, which makes it apparent that passengertransport will be the overwhelming
beneficiary o f the project. Each o f these benefits will be discussedinturn.

Time Savings. The major benefit o fthe proposed Zhe-Gan electrification and alignment i s the
reductionintravel time that will accrue to passenger traffic. For through travelers, MOR
indicates that the anticipated"ideal" trip time savings approximate five hours, but commercial
operation-including idle time at stations, acceleration andbraking, etc. -- is more likely to
lower total passenger trip time savings to about three hours, the figure utilized here. (As an
illustration, the commercial time for express service over the length o f the line i s expected to be
10 hours compared to today's 13 hours.)

To value these savings, MOR utilized a recent PlanningDepartment study of the nearby Beijing-
Shanghai highspeed line that surveyed travelers over the 2000-2001 time period. This study
yielded separate estimates for business and non-business users (RMB 20 per hour and RMB 14
per hour, respectively). For Zhe-Gan, it is assumed that the business/non-business mix will be
50 percent. Hence the initial weighted average monetary savings is RMB 17 per hour, an
amount that is increased at 6.5 percent annually to reflect expected growth inpersonal income
perhead.

Based on the above, the calculatedtravel time savings are reflected inTable 9-1.

Operatiny Cost S a v i n ~ s .By converting to electric traction, operating cost benefits will be
                                 ~
obtained from savings infuel costs, lower freight locomotive maintenance outlays, reduced labor
expenses, and greater efficiencies inwagon utilization produced by faster electric-powered
freight trains. The methodologies by which these savings were derived are described inthis
section.

Fuel. Inorderto calculate fuel cost savings, isfirst necessaryto express thetraffic volume in
                                                       it
terms o f gross ton-kms. Inthis way, boththe net weights o f the cargo (and passengers) as well
as the tare weight o f the locomotives andwagons are comprehended. For freight traffic, annual
net ton-kms (no project scenario) were multipliedby a factor o f 1.5 to derive gross ton-kms,
while for passenger traffic (no project scenario), a factor o f 1.3 was used.

As o fthe year 2000, MORprovided information indicatingthat the rate o f diesel fuel oil
consumption by freight locomotives was 2.19 kgper 1,000 gross ton-kms; for passenger
locomotives the comparable figure was 3.43 kg. With regard to electric power, the consumption
rate infreight andpassenger service was 10.7 kWhand 14.4kWhper 1,000 gross ton-kms,
respectively. However, because EMUtrain sets will handle about 10 percent o f the passenger
traffic -and due to the fact that these faster trains use about twice as muchpower as SS9
locomotives -the weighted average consumption rate for passenger traffic has beenincreased by
10percent, to 15.9 kwhper 1,000 gross ton-kms.

For unit costs, a figure o f RMB3,000 ($362) per ton was deemed reasonable for diesel oil.
Recognizing what MOR as a large user i s now payingfor electric power on electrified sections


   Incremental passenger traffic is assumedto be re-routed from other railway lines and the factors used to calculate
the time savings are the same as those utilized for the base traffic. Generated traffic is estimated to be 30 percent o f
"without project" passenger volume.
'  Data values and calculations are inthe Project File.


                                                          57

near to the Zhe-Ganline, the likely downward impact on such prices resultingfrom the Three
Gorges hydroelectric project as well as the deregulation o f the power sector generally, a unit
price of RMB 0.32 (3.9 U S cents) per kwhis assumedto be appropriate here.

Taking all o fthese factors into account, he1savings for both freight andpassenger service o f
about RMB 390 million are projected by the year 2010 and more than RMB424 millionby
2015.

Locomotive Maintenance (non-labor). Primarilydue to a longer maintenance cycle, the upkeep
andrepair o felectric as compared with diesel locomotives usedfor hauling freight results in
further operating savings. Thus, while the unit cost for electric locomotives tends to be
somewhat higher, the service needs for electric units are typically muchlower. Multiplying
these respective values provides the cost per millionkilometers for each traction type and each
maintenance category. After determining the annual volume o f locomotive kilometers for all of
the freight units to be utilized on the Zhe-Ganline inboth the "electric -- with project" and
"diesel -- without project" scenarios, the annual cost savings o f freight locomotive maintenance
can be determined. For freight service, these yearly benefits arejust under RMB43 million in
2010 andalmost RMB48 millionby2015 (values for the intervening years have been derivedby
interpolation).

Savings inthis area also are obtained for passenger locomotives when SS9 units are substituted
for diesels, but these are outweighed by the higher maintenance outlays attributable to EMUtrain
sets.8 Therefore, operating costs for passenger locomotive maintenance actually are expected to
increase by about RMB 59 million in2010 and almost RMB 53 millionby 2015.

Locomotive andMaintenance Personnel. The conversion to electric traction also will yield
benefits with respect to labor cost savings intwo major categories: on-board locomotive workers
andmaintenance andrepair personnel. Pursuant to MORregulations, there are seven train
operators per locomotive unit. Because the changeover from diesel will reduce the number of
Zhe-Gan line locomotives, there will be a reduction inon-board employees. Inthe area o f
maintenance, most o f the savings are due to cutbacks infreight locomotivemaintenance, as the
added maintenance requiredby EMUSwill mitigate the effects insofar as passenger units are
concemed. Based on the experience o f electrifying the Baoji-Chengdu line, MOR believes that a
saving o f RMB20,000 per employee can be realized. By 2010, this yields freight benefits o f
about RMB 16 million per year and a passenger benefit ofjust over RMB 0.6 million annually.

Wagon Cost Savings. MOR data indicate that the rental cost of freight wagons is RMB 3.3 per
wagon-hour. With electrification, freight trains on the Zhe-Ganline will be longer (50 wagons
as contrasted with 41 wagons indiesel service) and also will travel faster (trains pulled by
electric locomotiveswill traverse the line about 2 hours quicker than when diesels are utilized).
As a consequence, the railway will be able to reduce the number o f wagon-hours required to hau
a given volume o f freight traffic. Assuming a gradual increase inthe number o f daily 50-wagon
trains, freight wagon rental savings will range from RMB 7 million to more than RMB 8 million
annually.

  To illustrate: the unit costs for overhaul of anEMUis RMB 8 million, whde the comparable figure for an SS9
passengerlocomotive is RMB 2.2 million.


                                                        58

For passenger coaches (which the regional railway administrations own) faster travel times yield
an even greater benefit because their value i s considerably higher than that o f freight wagons. In
the absence o f detailed figures for the existing coach fleet, it i s assumed here that the value i s at
least double that o f freight wagons or RMB 6.6 per coach-hour. For passenger trains, the time
savings (incommercial terms) will amount to 3 hours. Inaddition, the number o f train pairs will
rise from about 33 today to 47 by 2010 andto 56 by 2015. Most passenger trains will continue
to consist o f 18 coaches. Taking all these factors into account, annual coach savings are
estimated to range from RMB337 million to RMB 816 million by 2015.

Diesel Locomotive Savinps. Because o f the conversionto electric traction, MOR will be able to
avoid the capital costs o f the diesel locomotives that otherwise would be required for Zhe-Gan
line operations. MOR indicates that the unit cost of the DF4 model utilized for freight service on
the line i s equal to RMB 4.35 million, while the comparable figure for the DF11version that
hauls passenger trains is RMB7.6 million. Based on these unit costs and the yearly acquisition
schedule for each o fthese models, the locomotive capital costs that are saved are as indicated in
Table 9.1.


E. EconomicRate ofReturn and SensitivityAnalyses

Net benefits are calculated for the period 2004-2027 to derive estimates o f ERR andNPV (a
discount rate of 12percent was used). As reported inTable 9.1, the estimated NPV i s about
RMB7billionin2002 prices andthe EIRRis 19percent.

Adjustments were made inthree o f the base case assumptions inorder to test the sensitivity o f
these results. The first adjustment assumes that the cost o f electricity doubles thus reducing the
amount o f operating cost savings. Under these conditions, the NPV would decline to RMB 5
billion andthe EIRRwould fall to 17 percent. The second adjustment postulates that ifdirect
project costs increase by 20 percent, the resulting NPV would equal more than RMB 5 billion
andthe associated EIRRwould be 17percent. To parallel an alternative assumptioninthe
financial analysis, the third adjustment here examines the impact o f a passenger fare increase of
60 percent. This would result inthe elimination o f generated traffic, thus reducing the ERRto
18 percent and the NPV to RMB6 billion. All o f these adjustments result inacceptable NPV
and EIRRoutcomes.

Inadditionto these adjustments, the analysis also reports the switching values for all ofthe
benefits categories (switching values indicate what the value o f benefits would be at which the
ERRbecame equal to the discount rate (12 percent) andthe NPVbecomes zero). This result
would obtain iftotal benefits were to fall by more than 36 percent.




  Inaddition, existing diesel unitsnowusedonthe Zhe-Gan line will bereleasedfor service elsewhere inthe
railway system. Consisting of 159 SS4 freight locomotives and 105 SS9 passengerunits,this equipment will be
released inthe fxst year of electric operation. MOR assumesthat more than two-thirds o f the economic life of these
locomotives remain and has valued the release at more than RMB 917 million (see Feasibility Study at para 16.1.4).
This amount is includedinTable 9.1 for the year 2007.

                       Annex 9b: FinancialAnalysis of the Zhe-Gan Line

A. Background

MORwill beresponsible for implementationo fthis project andwill mobilize all o fthe financing
andrepay all borrowed funds. Therefore, the financial analysis focuses on two subjects: first the
financial soundness o f the project itself, and second, the financial viability and debt servicing
capacity o f MOR.

Representing the Government o f China, MOR i s the sole owner o f the Zhe-Can line. The project
along with the rolling stock and locomotives will be financed usingintemal funds, loans
obtained from domestic banks (the State Development Bank) as well as from the World Bank
amounting to RMB 14.6 billion intotal. O fthis sum, about RMB 6.9 billion (47 percent)
represents equity funds from MOR, about RMB 6.8 billion (47 percent) will be obtained from
domestic banks, andthe remainingRMB0.9 billion (6 percent) will be fundedby the proposed
Bank loan.

The Shanghai, Nanchang, and Guangzhou regional railway administrations ( U s ) will be
responsible for operating the sections o f the line intheir respective geographical jurisdictions.
Revenues obtained from operations will be forwarded to MORbythe RAs; and MOR, intum,
will compensate the R A s for costs incurred, allocate a profit/loss to the R A s through the railway
resettlement system, andpay interest andprincipal on both domestic and foreign loans.


 B. Cash Inflows

O fthe total increase incash inflows, the largest share is attributable to the incremental revenue
obtained. Unitrevenue for freight is assumed to be RMB0.0755 per ton-km; the comparable
figure for passenger traffic i s RMB 0.10 per pass-km. Incrementalrevenue from other sources i s
calculated at 15 percent o f the sum o f incremental freight andpassenger revenues. Inaddition to
revenues, another category o f cash inflows traces to an allowance for the value o f diesel
locomotives formerly used on the Zhe-Gan lines but now available for use elsewhere inthe
railway system. Consisting of 159 freight and 105 passenger units, the remaining economic life
o fthis equipment was valued byM O R at more than RMB917 million. Finally, MOR
assumptions with respect to the residual values o f electric locomotives, land, and current funds in
the out years o f the analysis comprise the remainder o f the cash inflows (see Table 9.2).


C. CashOutflows

The initial category o f cash outflows is the project investment outlays. As noted inthe economic
analysis, direct project costs including amounts for intangible deferred assets equal RMB 12.4
billion. To this must be added the capital costs o f the electric locomotives and rolling stock
(RMB4.7 billionover the life o ftheproject). Otherrelatively minor outflows include amounts
for working capital (supplied byMOR), as well as net non-operating costs (at the rate o f RMB
2.09 per 1,000 converted incremental ton-km) and miscellaneous taxes (calculated at 3.2% of
incrementaloperating revenue).



                                                  60

As the economic analysis also indicates a significant benefit o fthe project stems from the greater
efficiencies and lower operating costs associated with transportingthe traffic by electric rather
thandieseltraction over therealignedline. Fromtheperspective ofthe financial analysis, these
savings reduce the cash outflow substantially, even after allowing for the added costs o f catenary
maintenance andelectric power generation. (The particular annual calculations for these items
are the same as those inthe economic analysis.)


D. Financial Rate ofReturnand SensitivityAnalyses

Net cash flows are calculated for the period 2004-2027 to derive estimated NPV and FIRR. The
NPV at a cost ofcapital o f6 percent (slightly higherthan MOR's current borrowing rate o f5.6
percent) i s RMB 6.9 billion andthe FIRR is 11percent (see Table 9.2).

Apart from the operating savings already considered inthe economic analysis, the stream o f
benefits stemming from incremental revenues has the most impact on the NPV and FIRR. If,for
example, incremental revenues declined by 61 percent, the switchingvalues (FIRR equal to the
discount rate o f 6 percent and a nilNPV) would obtain. Alternatively, an increase inrevenues
can be postulated. To illustrate: ifthere was an increase inunit passenger revenues on the order
o f 60 percent, the financial results would improve. While the newly-generatedtraffic no doubt
would be discouraged by an inability to pay the higher transport price, the monetized savings in
personaltravel time for all o f the other passenger traffic would compensate almost totally for the
increase infare outlays. (At RMB 17 per hour, a three hour time savings would yield an overall
benefit o fRMB 51 or about the same as the assumed incrementalprice o f ajourney over the line
-RMB0.06/pax-km over921kms-aboutRMB55.) Undertheseconditions, theNPVwould
approximate RMB 24 billion andthe FIRRwould be 20 percent.


E. MOR's FinancialViability

To assess its financial viability, a review o f MOR's Sources and Applications Statements over
the recent past is instructive. As summarized inTable 9.4, over the five year period ending in
2002 (the latest year for which audited data are available), annual average total sources
approximatedRMB 100billion. Ofthat amount, internally generated funds (RMB 57.2 billion)
accounted for 57 percent, while loans and other sources made up the remaining 43 percent.

Juxtaposed against these sources, Table 9.4 shows that total applications amounted to an average
o f RMB 91.8 billion over the period. Here, capital investments - includingequipment
replacements - averaged RMB66.4 billion or an overwhelming 72 percent o fthe total. Debt
service and a modest transfer to the Government o f funds for other purposes represented the
other 28 percent o f applications.

Two key financial ratios are o finterest. The self-financing ratio, a measure o fMOR's ability to
fundits capital needs, has exhibited some improvement over the period, risingfrom 0.43 to a
highof0.57, but, as of2002, still stands onthe low side ofacceptability averagingonly 0.50.
At the same time, the debt service ratio, an indicator o fMOR's capacity to cover borrowings
from domestic sources, is satisfactory, thoughwith the exception o f 2001 it has been generally
trendingdownward from 2.4 in1998 to 2.1 in2002.


                                                 61

Lookingto the future, MOR's plans for a substantial increase incapital outlays necessarily must    '


be acknowledged. InJanuary 2004, MOR's "Mid-and Long-Range Plan" for railway
development received "in principle" approval by the State Council. This plan calls for capital
expenditures over a 16-year period (2004-2020) o f more than RMB 1.6 trillion (US$200
billion). This equates to an annual average o f about RMB 100billion (US$ 12billion). Put in
context o fthe recent spending levels, this RMB 100billion amount represents a 50 percent
increase over the RMB 66.4 billion figure noted above.

IfMORisto sustainthisRMB33.6 billionincrease, ithasseveral sourcesto whichit canturn.

     0  Internally generated funds. IfM O R i s to derive more inthe way o f bottom-line
        profitability, the railways will have to record a significant improvement inits operating
        ratio (operating expenses divided by operatingrevenues). Excluding the Construction
        Surcharge revenues (thus yielding a better measure of financial efficiencies), the
        operating ratio has remained virtually unchanged at 0.90 over the last five years.
        Obviously, this means more inthe way o f freight and passenger revenue per traffic unit,
        or a less rapid increase inunit operating expenses, or a combination o fthe two.


     0  Borrowed funds. MORcould increase its level o f localborrowings ifdomestic
        development banks remain willing to lend. However, any significant increase ininterest
        costs will work at cross purposes with improvements inthe operating ratio indicated
        above.


     0  Private Sources. Ultimately, MOR may find it necessary to attract more inthe way o f
        private capital. Conceptually, this approach could take a number o f different forms -
        investment inspecialized rolling stock, operation o f dedicated commodity, container, or
        passenger trains, even particularized equity opportunities. Resort to the private capital
        markets, it should be recalled, is not unprecedented, as evidencedby the Guangshen
        Railway Corporation's successful listing on both the Hong Kong andNew York stock
        exchanges.

While there is little doubt regardingMOR's financial viability, it i s apparent that meeting the
needs o fthe Mid- and Long-Term Planposes a significant challenge.

      Annex 9c: Economic Evaluation of Track Maintenance and Renewal Machinery


A. Introduction

As a part o fthe proposed loan, MORis requesting funds for the procurementofvarious types of
track maintenance andrenewal equipment. For the purpose o f economic evaluation, this Annex
examines the two representative applications o fthese machines: a case study o fthe Datong-
Qinhuangdao (DaQin) coal line where larger track overhaul and maintenance equipment o f the
type contemplatedhere has been substitutedfor lighter, smaller permanent way machinery. In
addition, the annex looks at the costs andbenefits involved with the contemplated use o fthe rail
grindingmachinesthat also are includedinthe proposedlist o fgoods to be procured. As will be
seen, the economic rate o f returnassociated with these track maintenance functions is
substantial.


B. Costs

Maintenance and overhaul o fthe DaQin coal line involves the quantity and types o f larger track
machinery. Basedon the indicated unit prices, the total cost o f the machines that are required
here amounts to just over RMB 175 million (see the Project File for details).

The evaluation o f the rail grindingequipment is based one set o f such machinery valuedat RMB
83 million. It assumes that this set will be deployedover a given 600-km distance o f track once
every two years. Thus one set can service 1,200 kmo f track over a two-year cycle.

Withregardto boththe rail grindingmachinery andthe large track maintenance equipment, the
labor costs inthe "with project" case are lower than inthe "without project" scenario.
Consequently, these savings are treated as a benefit (see below).


C.Benefits

Because the larger track machines are far more efficient than their predecessors, the greatest
benefit resulting from their use is directly relatedto the reduced amount o f time that a railway
line needs to be out o f service for track maintenance. With the additional time that is available, a
greater number o ftrains can be accommodated, and therefore, the volume o ftraffic that can be
handledon the line is substantially enhanced, once the larger track maintenance equipment is
deployed.

This canbe quantifiedby examining the experience o fthe 1,300-km DaQincoal line. Here, the
use o f the larger machinery has resulted ina longer maintenance cycle (16 monthsvs. 9 months),
a smaller maintenance window (less thanone hour vs. 2.5 hours per day), and, on an annual
basis, far fewer hours when the line needs to beblockedto permit the requisite track work to be
completed (96 hours vs. 250 hours). The net result i s that on the DaQin line some 3,835
additional trains per year have been able to traverse the route since larger maintenance
machinery was introduced. Allowing for the empty return, this means that 1,918 additional coal-
bearingtrains moved from the mines to the Qinhuangdao port annually. With each train
consisting o f 60 wagons each o fwhich can handle 60 tons o f lading, the increment incoal


                                                  63

 volume under the more efficient track maintenance regime amounts to about 6.9 milliontons
  annually. Ifthe value-added o f coal i s RMB 20 per ton," thenthe benefit stemming from the
  additional traffic madepossible by the more productive track maintenance machinery i s equal to
  about RMB 138 million per year.

 Inadditionto the enhancedtrainvolume, the more efficient largetrack machinery also produces
  a saving inlabor costs. Based on the experience o f the DaQin line, MOR data show that the
 introductiono fthe larger maintenance machines permitted a reduction inemployment o f 180
persons per year. With the annual outlay per employee estimated at RMB 30,000, this yields a
 cost saving (infinancial terms) o f RMB 5.4 million per year. After shadow pricing for labor
 costs (see the economic analysis inpart a o f this annex), the annual savings here amount to over
 RMB 8.6 million(see Table 9.3).

As for the rail grindingmachinery, the quantified benefit results from the fact that properly
 carried out, the procedure doubles the useful life o frail and hence reduces byhalfthe cost
 outlays associated with rail replacement. Specifically, MOR indicates that the cost of 60-kg rail
 is RMB 360,000 per track-km. With labor costs estimated at RMB 64,000, the overall cost per
 track-km i s RMB424,000. Ifthe rail i s ground twice, its useful life i s extended from 16 years to
 32 years. On an annualized basis, therefore, the saving associated with avoiding rail replacement
 is RMB26,500 per track-km. Since, as indicated above, a set o frail grindingmachines can
 service 1200km, the overall savings as reflected inTable 9.3 amounts to RMB 31.8 millionper
 year.


 D.EconomicRateofReturn andSensitivityAnalyses

 Taken together, the economic benefits o f employing largertrack maintenance machinery are
 quite considerable, as Table 9.3 indicates. Assuming that only halfo f the benefits are attained in
the first year, the Table shows that the NFV at 12%i s approximately RMB 934 million and the
 ERRexceeds 100percent.

 As constructed here, the analysis is quite sensitive to the value added for coal. Thus, a decline o f
  50 percent invalue added would lower the NPV and ERR to RMB484 millionand 54 percent,
respectively. Similarly, an increase o f 10percent would raise these figures to I2MB 1billion and
 yield an EIRRo f over 118 percent. Inthis context, it i s worth noting that a higher value traffic
mix that incontrast to coal was less susceptible to commodity price fluctuation, would sustain
the economic merit o f this component.




~~




 lo According to MOR, the delivered price at Qinhuangdao of Datong domestic coal is about RMB 290 per ton
(RMB 205 per ton at the mine head plus RMB 85 per ton for railway transportation). Applying MOR'Soverall
revenue to variable cost ratio of 130%to this delivered price yields an operating profit o f RMB20 per ton.

A.      ProjectBackground

The Zhe-Ganrailway line is a state-level Class Iline andthe most important westward running
artery southo f the Yangtze River. Itis an important component of anational backbonenetwork
of eight longitudinal (north-south) and eight latitudinal (east-west) mainlines. It starts from
Hangzhou inZhejiang province, runs through Jiangxi Province and ends at Zhuzhou inHunan
province. Its total lengthi s 942.6 km. The engineering feasibility study for its upgrading was
completed inOctober 2001 andthe preliminary design of the Project inNovember 2003, while
the final designofthe construction drawings is expectedto be finishedbyApril 2004. The EIA
was compiled byBeijingOASIS Environmental Technology Co. andthe Second Survey &
Design Institute o f China Railways (SSDI). The TOR of the EIA were prepared inApril 2002
and approvedby the StateEnvironmental Protection Administration (SEPA) inMay 2002. In
December 2002, the Environmental Impact Report was completed andpassedthe technical
review performed by SEPA inJanuary 2003. Dueto changes intechnical standards anddesign
proposals, the revised EIA report was worked out inNovember 2003 and passedthe technical
review of SEPA on December 6-7,2003, SEPA gave formal approval on May 20,2004.

The project originally proposed for Bank financing was the electrification o fthe existing line.
Category B/S2 was assignedto the project duringthe PCD safeguards review meeting in
February 2003. While the electrification was being prepared, the Zhe-Gan line was selected as
one of the lines for speed-raisingunder anation-wide campaign ofMOR, requiringrealignment
of parts ofthe line to ease tight curves. Suchworks will be carried out inadvance of the
electrification with domestic funds. Considering the two improvements are closely linked in
time, place andfunction, they are henceforthtreatedas a single project.

For the speed-raising, sections of the line will berenovatedand rebuilt to updatedtechnical
standards. The project will leadto suchproblems as increaseinnoise, landoccupation,
interference with the ecosystem, community severance, soil andwater loss, andresettlement.
Therefore, the Task Team advised MOR that Category A would be triggered, and EA documents
havebeenpreparedaccordingly.

B.      Basisof the EnvironmentalAssessment

Regulatory, policy and administrative requirements for environmental assessments of
developmentprojects inChina were followed duringthe preparation and evaluation of the EA.

D.       BaselineEnvironment

The areas along the Zhe-Gan Railway line belong to a semi-tropical region with a continental
climate. The climate is warm and humidwith abundantrainfall; mean yearlyrainfall being
between 1,500 and 2,300"         that is mainly concentrated inthe monthsfrom April through June.
Mean annual wind speed is 2.0-3.5ds.

The EA Team identified 113 villages/townships, 39 schools and 5 hospitals about 15-260m from
the railway central line, as the environmentally sensitive receptors through field survey and
investigation. According to the environmental assessment report, the project area has a complex
o fvegetation, most o f it i s secondary vegetation (forest coverage is about 40%), cultivated land
andsome waste land. Due to the longhistory o fhumansettlement andintensive activity along
the line, as well as the longperiod o f operation o f the existing railway, there are no wildlife or
rare animals or rare plantsneeding specialprotection inthe project areas within the three
provinces.

Baseline noise monitoring has been conducted for all 157 sensitive sites identified. Itwas found
that there are occurrences o f substantial standard exceedance on both sides o f the existing
railway line. This i s mainly due to the longperiod o f operation o f the existing railway and
intensive humanactivity along the line over the years.

Current air quality inregions andcities along the line was assessedbased on monitoring data o f
regional environmental monitoring centers. It was concludedthat air quality along the line could
basically satisfy the level I1standards o f ambient air quality with the exception o fjust a few
locations. The mainpollutants are: TSP, S02, andNOx with increasingtrend o f SO2 andNOx.
The project areabelongs to the national control area for acid rain.

For surface water, the main rivers crossed by the Line(the Puyang, Jinhua, Qu,Xin, Gan,
Yuanshui, Lushui andXiang) can barely meet relevant standards due to rapid economic
development inthe region. The water pollution sources o fthe railway are production wastewater
and sewage from depots andpassenger stations. Monitoringo f wastewater discharge was
conducted duringJuly and August 2002 at five major locomotive depots, tumaround depots and
passenger stations. Wastewater discharge from other depots along the line was assessedbased
on routine monitoring data. Itwas concluded that waster water discharged from treatment
facilities of depots and stations can basically meet the discharge standard. One direct receiving
surface water for North Zhuzhou Turnaround Depot was also monitoredindicating 88% and38%
exceedance o f COD and oil above the applicable standard.

According to the field survey andthe information from cultural property departments, the
Donghuanshan-Shitatou Tombs o f the HanDynasty (a county-level Cultural Property Protection
site) are locatedinLongyouCounty, Quzhou City, ZhejiangProvince beneath and adjoining the
existing line at K228+000-K232+000.

Theproject area (Le. the railway line andthe impact zone on either side) crosses the cities o f
Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Jinhua, Quzhou, Shangrao, Yingtan, Nanchang, Xinyu, Yichun, Pingxiang
andZhuzhou with total landarea o f 115,000 km2andpopulationof40,586,900. The GDP for
2002 was RMB421 billionwith a per capita GDP of RMB 10,376 (about US$1,250). The


                                                   71

project will directly affect the above-mentioned 113 villages, 39 schools and 5 hospitalsbecause
o f their proximity to the line.

E.       EnvironmentalImpacts

The project will occupy 43,3 10 muo f land (including 3,119 muto be acquired temporarily for
borrow sites and spoil disposal areas), ofwhich 75% are paddy fields and dry farm land, 10%are
barren lands, 8% are woodland andeconomic tree landand7% are others. The basic farmland
occupiedbythe project accounts for 0.025-0.34% o fthe total basic farmland o f the cities along
the line. Generally speaking, the project will cause little impact to the area's agricultural
production.

There are no valuable andrare plants protected by the government within the project scope.
About 1,130,600 trees inthe areas will be cut down andremoved, most o f which are planted
trees. However, the loss o fvegetation cover will be o f short duration since extensive re-
vegetation is plannedfor borrow and disposal areas, sub-grade slopes and landoccupied
temporarily, to restore the ecological loss.

Duringrailway construction, soil andwater loss mayoccur dueto damage to andinterference
with the original surface vegetation and soil. The soil erosion areas include deep excavationand
highbackfillsections, borrow sites, spoil yards, temporary construction camps, special
geological sections andother surface soil interference sections. According to a model
calculation result, the soil loss o f the entire project duringthe construction phase would be nearly
6 milliontons ifno proper measures were adopted, more than the existing intensityo f soil
erosion. Duringthe initial several years o f operation, soil erosion phenomena will continue to
occur untilthe vegetation is fully restored.

The noise duringconstruction phase will be mainly from the construction equipment. The
forecasted result from noise modeling shows that the national standard can bemet for areas more
than60mdistant indaytime and 120mat night. Residences closer to the linewill beaffected by
constructionnoise, especially ifconstruction is allowed at night.

The environment assessment team forecasted the noise level for the 113 villages, 39 schools and
5 hospitals in2011(short-term operation period) and 2016 (long-term operationperiod). Inthe
villages ("concentrated residential areas") the short-term noise level at locations 30m from
centerline o f the railwaywill be 63.2-71.ldB indaytime and 56.9-70.5dB at night. The long-
term noise level will be slightly louder: 63.9-71.9dB indaytime and 57.5-71.2dB at night. As for
the schools andhospitals, the short-term noise level will be similar at 57.0-71.3dB indaytime
and 55.4-70.6dB at night, exceeding the standard by 0-11.3 and 5.4-20.6dB and0-11.8 and6.1-
21.2dB for long-term. The reason i s the noise caused bypassingtrains, road traffic noise, and
social noise. It is also predicted that vibration will be felt up to 30m away from the center line
on both sides, at 81-84dB insub-grade sections. This is 1-4dB higher than the standard. This
effect will be 74-79dB inbeam-type elevated line sections, which meets the standard.

The primaryimpacts on the water environment duringthe construction phase include discharge
of sanitary sewage from constructioncamps, surface run-off from camps, storage areas, and
bridge construction. The camps are expected to generate about 2-3 tons o f sanitary sewage per
daywhich, ifnot treated properly, would affect the water quality ofthe receiving streams.

                                                     72

Bridge construction could result inthe suspension o friver sediments, and create risk o f oil
contamination from leaks and spills. Solid wastes from camps, service areas, storage areas, if
not handledproperly, could also create pollution problems.

Inthe operation period, the sewagesourceswill bemainlylocomotive depots, wastewater that
contains oil discharged from production sections, and domestic wastewater discharged from
passenger stations. The total wastewater will increase to 77,453 m3/year. Since electric
locomotiveswill be adopted, the pollutants such as CODcr, BOD5, andSS inwastewater
discharged from productionorganizations will bereduced. However, because o fthe expected
increase inrailway staff and passengers, pollutants such as oil inwastewater discharged from
each station will increase.

The main source o f air pollution duringthe construction phasewill be construction dust. The
dust i s mainly from the uncompletedroad foundation, storage sites and access roads. The scope
o f impact can extend 150-200m from the construction site on both sides o f the line. The
replacement o f diesel locomotives by electric locomotives will cause the pollutant discharging
quantityto be less than the existingrailway (no-project scenario), with smoke emissions reduced
bymore than 87%, SO2bymorethan 70%, NOx bymore than 87% andCO bymore than 80%,
which will contribute to improved air quality along the railway.

Duringthe operationperiod, the domestic solid waste andtrain waste generated from each
station and section will also increase by about 23,700 t/a and25,575 t/a respectively. The train
waste will be disposed o f after it i s bagged at Jinhua, Quzhou, Shangrao, Yingtan, Xiangtang,
Nanchang, Xinyu, Yichun, Pingxiang and Zhuzhou passenger stations. The waste from
passenger trains andrailway stations and sections will be transported to designated locations for
disposal after collection. Therefore, there will be no obvious impact on the environment along
the railway.

Once electric-powered trains start operating, a new environmental impact will occur: electro-
magnetic interference. When electric locomotives runat highspeed, sparks occur when the
locomotive's pantograph loses contact with the overhead catenary, forming electromagnetic
radiation. Its formation is hardto predict, and this high-frequency radiationwill affect TV
reception within 40m from the railway (mainly within 20m). According to site investigations, all
the towns and villages along the line have installed closed-circuit cable television systems
through a nation-wide "Village Linkup" campaign o f China Broadcasting and Television
Ministry. Therefore, electromagnetic interferenceafter completion ofthe Projectwillbe
minimal.

After train speeds are raised, the risk to pedestrians walking across or along the tracks will be
even greater thantoday. For this reason the line will be fully fenced throughout. The fencing
may isolate villages and fields on both sides o f the railway. A total o f 145 villages and
residential areas will be affectedby the restrictedaccess to their farmland, markets, schools and
social services o fthe community.

As noted above, the Donghuanshan-Shitatou Tombs o fthe HanDynasty are locatedon the
existing line inLongyou County, Quzhou City, Zhejiang Province. Ifno alternative were
considered, the upgrading o f the existing line would affect the site.

Healthrisks are primarilyrelatedto increased temporary population duringconstruction and
operationperiods. The increase inthe temporary population could potentially bring and spread
infectious diseases inthe project area, including HIV/AIDS. The MORwill disseminate
knowledge on the prevention o f disease among constructionworkers.

The safety risk is primarily inthe constructionphase with the local residents, particularly
children who have little awareness o f construction site safety inthe linear construction sites that
often do not have any fencing or control measures. The use o f explosives for cutting deep
sections andtunnels could result inflying stones, not to mention the explosions themselves, that
will be potential safety hazards to the residents livingnear the construction sites.

The constructionworks may damage the landscape, mainly from interferencebetween the
existing natural landscape, railway landscape and landscape environment. The main works that
will cause environmental impacts are deep excavationandhighbackfill sections that will
interfere with the surface landscape. Especially acute interference will be from largebridges,
spoil yards, borrow sites and large buildingsthat are not compatible with the surrounding
environment. However, most o fthese impacts are o f a temporary nature, such as borrow sites
andspoil yards that canberestored through well plannedlandscaping. Other visual impacts can
be given full consideration duringthe design phase to be harmonized into the background
landscape andreduce the visual sensitivity to the maximumextent possible.

Off-setting the above adverse impacts, the project will bringmore convenient transportationfor
the areas along the railway, promote the passenger and goods flow as well as information flow,
and benefit the circulation o f the local industrial and agricultural products to the outside world.
The construction and operation periods o f the Project will provide many work opportunities,
which will increase income o f the residents and the local farmers along the railway. More
convenient transportation will bringtourists to local areas. The improvement o f the
infrastructure conditions will help attract foreign investment. All o f these will help improve the
local economy along the railway.

F.      AlternativesAnalysis

Alternative analysis was conducted for two aspects: (1) diesel locomotive vs. electrification; (2)
alternative alignments at various sections.

For diesel locomotive/electrification: Although adoptinghigh-powered diesel locomotives could
also raise the transport capacity and satisfy the near and long-range demands for passenger and
freight transport, it is not recommendeddue to various disadvantages:

        Highdependency onpetroleum for which Chinaisbecomingthe largest importing
        country. Meanwhile, the current West-to-East Power DeliveryProject will take the
        uninterruptedclean energy from the Three Gorges and ErtanHydropower Stations to the
        areas o f East China.

        Not compatible with railwaynetwork. The Zhe-Gan Line is part o f the Shanghai to
        Kunmingand Shanghai to Chengdu corridor. The westempart o fthis corridor (from
        Zhuzhou) has already been electrified. The eastem section, Shanghai to Hangzhou, i s
        currently carrying out electrificationrenovations.

                                                  74

    0   Higher operation cost and much more environmental pollution.

Alternative a l i m e n t s at various sections: Though the speed-raising mainly involves upgrading
the existing line, there are sections where alternative alignments have been evaluated with
integratedconsideration o f environment, social and engineering aspects. The final alignment has
been chosen based on a series of technical, environmental and social criteria, i.e. avoidance o f
environmentally sensitive areas and cultural properties, less social interference, shorter length,
less land occupation, and compatibility with local master planning. The mainalternative
sections assessedinclude:

Zhuji Section (K66+400-K93+500):

The existing railwaypasses through the built-up area o f Zhuji City and i s 27.1 km long. Two
options were considered: renovating the existing line (described as Proposal A) and a new
straightened alignment (Proposal B). Compared with ProposalByProposal A would result ina
large number o fpeople needing resettlement, significant noise impact to dense communities and
serious social severance because of fully-fenced operation. Therefore ProposalB was
recommended. Under ProposalBytwo short sub-sections are also considered: Proposals I(5.8
km)andI1(6.5 km). The ambient environment for Proposals IandI1is the same, except that
ProposalI1is closer to the existing Hang-Jin-Qu Highway. For that reason Proposal I1was
selected, as it will take less landthat couldhave alternative high-value uses.

Longyou Section (K222+600-K238+380):

The existing railwaypasses through the built-uparea o f Longyou County and this section o f the
line is 15.8 kmlong. Two options considered were: renovating the existing line (Proposal A)
anda new alignment (Proposal B). Proposal A passesthrough the densely inhabitedcity area, as
well the Donghuashan-Shitatou Tombs. Proposal Bbypasses the outskirts o f the city and
country districts with dispersed inhabitants and avoids the tombs. It i s also compatible with the
Master Plano f Longyou County. Onthe other hand, Proposal B will occupy a large amount o f
cultivated landandrequire a larger investment. After comprehensive comparison, the
assessment team recommendedProposal B.

Quzhou Section (K258+770-K270+000)

The existing railway passes through the built-up area o f Quzhou City andhas a length o f 11.23
km. A new alignment (Proposal B)was comparedwith renovatingthe existing line (Proposal
A). Proposal Bythoughinvolvingmore landacquisition andinvestment, was selectedbecauseo f
avoidance o f dense urban areas, less resettlement, less noise impact, easy construction, less
social severance andcompatibility with the local master plan.

Dongxiang Section (K529+900-K539+100)

The existing railway passes through the edge o f the DongxiangCounty built-up area andi s 9.2
kmlong. Two alignmentswere considered: renovationwith the existingDongxiangstation
(Proposal A) andrenovation with construction o f a new Dongxiang Station (Proposal B).
Proposal Bythough requiring more landacquisition and investment, was selected because o f
avoidance o fmany sensitive receptors, less resettlement, and avoidance o f disturbance o f current

                                                   75

development o f the Dongxiang Economic Development Zone. It is also compatible with the
local master plan and supported by the local government.

Luxi Section (K835+100-K848+700)

The existing railway passes through the edge o f the Luxi Countybuilt-up area and i s 13.6 km
long. Two alignments were considered: renovationwith the existing Luxi station (Proposal A)
andrenovationwith constructiono fa new LuxiStation (Proposal B). ProposalBythough
involvingmore land acquisition andinvestment, was selected because o f less resettlement, less
social severance, easy construction and compatibility with the local master plan.

Baiyuan to North Pingxiang Section (K855+000-K858+300)

The existing line is 3.3km long. Its curves cannot satisfy the radius requirements o fthe speed
targets and so the line mustbe straightened. Three alignments were comparedwith target speeds
o f 200 km/h(Proposal A), 140km/h(Proposal B) and 120kmk (Proposal C). Proposal A and
ProposalBbothpass through part o fthe miningzone o f the Baiyuan Coal Mine, which poses
potential safety hazards and adds to the difficulty o f construction. After comprehensive
comparison, Proposal C was chosen.

LilingSection (K889+000-K899+000)

The existing railway passesthough the built-uparea of Liling City and is 10 km long. Two
options considered were: a new alignment usingthe existing Liling East Station (Proposal A) and
a new alignment with construction o f a new LilingEast Station (Proposal B). Proposal By
though requiring more land acquisition and investment, was chosen because o f avoidance o f
dense urbanareas, less resettlement, less impact on the LuRiver and easy construction.

G.      MitigationMeasures

The EA report includes a series o f measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate or otherwise
compensate the negative impacts from the Project. These measures are summarized below.

Design Phase

The railway alignment was carehlly selected to avoid occupying the sensitive ecosystems. The
excavated earth will be used as backfill where at all possible andminimize the occupation o f
farmland, cultivated landandwoodlands. Locations o fthe borrow sites and soil disposal areas
as well as other landthat will be temporarily occupied were carefully chosen. Concrete and
stone pitching will be used for highbackfillingand deep cuttingo f the slopes. The borrow sites
will be restored with extensive landscaping, tree planting andreclamation. The spoil disposal
areas will adoptretaining walls, drainage systems as well as re-vegetationmeasures. Local
plants andtrees will be carefully selected for the landscapingandre-vegetation.

The entire line will adopt continuous welded rail, reinforced concrete cross-ties (sleepers) (Type
111),elastic clip fasteners (Type 11)andClass Iballast sub-grade to reduce noise andvibration
impacts. Several mitigation measures to minimize noise were incorporated into the design for 71


                                                 76

sensitive receptors at which the noise level i s predictedto exceed the applicable standards.
These measures include noise barriers, double-glaze windows andtree-planting.

To treat domestic wastewater from each station or line section, batch activated sludge method
(SBR), anaerobic bio-filter chambers or septic tankshavebeen designed. For wastewater
discharged byproduction units, sedimentation tanks, oil separation by tilted board, air floatation
(adsorption) or filtering will be applied. The technology is well-developed and appropriate. The
proposed wastewater processing can meet national discharge standardsas well as the provincial
andmunicipal standards along the line.

Inall493passageways and298 overpassbridgeshavebeendesigned, toreducethesocial
severance impact on various towns, villages and residential areas, taking into account the
requirements o f various agricultural vehicles. On average, there i s one passage every 650m, or
3.4 passagesfor each village.

For the discovered cultural property and historical sites, namely, the Donghuanshan-Shitatou
Tombs (see above), the line has beenrelocatedinthe design stage inorder to keep away from it.
Methods for protecting cultural property have been drafted incooperation with the cultural
property departments and listed inthe Design Schedule. A procedure for handling "chance
finds" has also beenincludedincontract specifications for the construction stage.

The design has adopted high-tension catenary and'continuously weldedrails to minimize the
incidence o f generation o f EMF, and a budget has beenearmarked to compensate residents
whose TV signal, upon monitoring, would be affectedduring operation.

Construction Period

The landthat is temporarily usedwill be re-stored promptly following its use. For construction
activities near woodlands, the forest authority will be notified first. Where necessary, protective
zones will be defined together by the local forest authority andconstruction unit or protection
walls/slopes will be built duringthe initialphase o f construction. Other mitigation measures
duringconstruction include careful selectionofborrow sites and spoil yards locations, temporary
drainage ditches, retaining walls and culverts to reduce soil erosion and the impact o f local
irrigation regimes, and close supervision and inspection o f the construction.

The operationo fhigh-level noise construction will be 200 meters distant from the residential
areas, and low-level noise equipment will be used. The mainconstruction activities will be
strictly controlled during daytime. Temporary sound-insulation facilities will be usedto
decrease the mechanical noise. Construction vehicles will be arranged to steer clear of the
residential areas wherever possible. At the same time, such vehicles will be forbiddento go
through the residential areas at night.

Inorder to lightenthe negativeimpactsonsurface water duringthe constructionperiod, the
cofferdam methodwill be adopted during construction of the major-bridge piers. The
constructiono f river crossing structures will be timed for the low water seasonwhenever
possible. Domestic wastewater from the construction camps will be periodically drawnoff for
treatment or treated by septic tanks. Solid waste from the camps will be collected and
transported to municipal landfill sites for proper disposal.
                                                   77

Watering will be carried out for temporary roads twice a day (once inthe moming and again in
the afternoon) to keep dust down. The frequency o fwatering will be increased indry or blustery
weather. Covering canvas will be used for the transportation o f cement, sand, lime and so on.
Temporary construction roads will stay away from the existing residential areas wherever
possible.

Before construction begins, the contractors will be notified o f the procedure for treating and
reporting on cultural property and historical sites that may be encountered duringthe
construction. The contractors will berequiredto stop their construction immediately andwait
for the investigation and appraisal byprofessionalarchaeologists. The construction can be
resumed when approval has been obtained from the department incharge o f cultural property.

Construction workers will receive education on basic knowledge o f disease control, especially
some infectious diseases. Necessary self-protection devices, such as safety helmets, earplugs
and other safety protection devices, will be provided to workers. Enclosures at construction sites
andother dangerous placewill beestablished to prevent accessbythe public.

Environmental protection consciousness and environmental management system will be taken as
a basis for bidevaluation. The Environmental Management Planwill be incorporated into the
biddingdocuments so that its implementationwill be anobligation o fthe contractors. Relevant
environmental protection training on environment policies and laws, possible environmental
impacts, mitigation measures, routine monitoring, reporting systems, emergency treatment, etc.,
will beconductedfor all accepted contractors andconstruction supervision engineers prior to
commencement o f construction.

Operation Period

The operationunits will enhance the maintenance, service and administrationo fvarious
protectionworks. Fieldsupervision on the ecological environment along the line will be
enhanced andthe potential negative geological hazards will be identified in a timely manner for
mitigation.

Residential buildings, schools, hospitals or other noise sensitive receptors will not be newly
constructed within 30m o f the line. Concentrated residential areas will not be newly constructed
within 30-120mo fthe line.

All railway departments will strengthen management ontrain operations, maintain good traffic
andreduce blocking as well as reduce randomwhistling whenever possible andimprove the
environmental protection consciousness o f crew members at the same time. They will also
strictly obey MOR'Swhistle regulations.

H.      EnvironmentalManagementPlan

A stand-alone Environmental ManagementPlanhas beendevelopedwhich specifies policies,
regulations and applicable environmental standards, environmental management system,
mitigation measures and environmental monitoring programs for the construction and operation
phases. The EMPwill be implementedby contractors and supervised by the Project

                                                 78

Management Offices o f the three railway administrations (Shanghai, Nanchang, and Guangzhou
Railway Group) during construction andby the Environmental Departments o f these
administrations during operation. An independent environmental supervision consultant will be
hiredbyMORto supervise andmonitor implementationo fthe EMP.

The EMP includes environmental monitoring programs for bothconstruction andoperation
phases. The monitoring content includes soil andwater loss, noise, dust, and degradation o f
water quality, river sedimentation, solid waste treatment and electromagnetic radiation. During
the construction phase, environmental monitoring will be conducted intwo approaches: daily
androutine monitoring consisting o fmainlyvisual observations andlimitedequipment
measurements andperiodic monitoringby accredited professionals using standard methods.
Monitoringreports will be compiled at intervals o f once every six months, summarizing the
findingso fthe monitoring. The reportswillbe submittedto projectproponents as well as
relevant organizations andthe Bank. Duringthe operationphase, monitoring will be conducted
once after project completion and then twice each year for the first three years after completion;
water quality will be monitored once every year.

Inorder to ensure the environmental performanceo fthe Project, the EMPparticularly
emphasizes institutional capacity buildingand strengthening. It developedtraining programs for
personnel at the various management and supervision organizations that are involved inthe
Project. The environmental training for contractors and construction supervisors will be held
prior to the commencement of construction. The training will cover the basic knowledge o f
environmental protection andpollutioncontrol, the results o fthe EIA andrequirements o f the
EMP, the methodology for site environmental management andmonitoring, andreporting
requirements. The training for the various railway bureaus (groups), regional railway
administrations, management sections o f the various stations andrailway sections as well as the
environmental organizations will cover environmental management, management organization,
applicable environmental standards, mitigation measures, environmental policies and pollution
control technologies.

I. PublicConsultationandInformationDisclosure

Two rounds o fpublic consultationwere carried out duringthe EA: the first round when the EA
Outline was beingpreparedbefore April, 2002 andthe second round to review draft EA reports
betweenMay/June 2002 and September o f 2003. Various techniques were used inpublic
consultation, including survey questionnaires, public meetings, and interviews with affected
groups and individuals as well as small discussion groups. The people consulted included
mainlythose who will be affected directly by the Project, relevant government and non-
government organizations and environmental as well as other experts. Intotal, 2,580 people
participated inpublic consultations.

The primary concerns o f the public include the noise and impacts to traffic duringthe operation
period. The EA team responded to the public concerns by ensuring that adequate passageways
are included for the convenience o f farm vehicles and to mitigate impacts on daily farm work
and communication (inall 493 underpasses and 298 overpasses will be providedat an average
spacing o f 650m, or 3.4 passageways for each village); planning o f 109bridges and 1,439 new
culverts to minimize disturbance to irrigation; design o fnoise barriers and sound insulation
windows to minimize the impacts o f noise from the railway for 77 sites with a total budget
                                                 79

allocation o f about US$ 10million. Other responsesinclude the full fencing o f the railway line
for traffic safety, welded rails to minimize vibratiodnoise and EMFimpact, andprovision o f
employment opportunities duringconstruction.

IncompliancewithEIAprocessrequirementsoftheChinese government andtheBank, the
completedEA documents were disclosed inpublic places along the line where the concerned
public canhave access to, andreview, the reports. Inaddition, the project information and
feasibility reports were advertised inprovincial and municipal daily newspapers along the line as
well as onbroadcasting stations, television stations, Xinhua Net andNational Traffic Net
(www.eroute.com.cn). They were also posted on the websites o fthe Foreign Capital Center o f
MOR, the Second Survey & DesignInstituteo fChinaRailways andthe World Bank (China).

J.       EstimatedInvestmenton EnvironmentProtection

The estimated environment protection cost for the Project is RMB 434.1 million($52.4 million)
andthe total project construction cost is RMB 1352billion. Thus the environmental protection
cost accounts for 3.2% o f the total project investment.

         Annex lob: ResettlementImpactsandResettlementAction PlanSummary

LandAcquisitionandResettlement-RelatedImpacts

The purpose o fthe project is to upgrade the Zhe-GanRailway line (943 kmlong), connecting
Zhejiang, Jiangxi andHunan provinces from near the east coast to the center-west o f China.

The design for the upgradingwill be refined further inaccordance with the preliminary technical
design and resettlement impacts analysis. From September, 2003 to March, 2004, MOR engaged
Huadong Institute to guide the field survey work on resettlement inventory aspects and planning,
consisting o f local officials, representatives o f villagers. The LandResources Administration
Departments and local governments also participated inthe census of displaced people and
inventory o f affected assets. The census and various different categories o f impacts were
identified andrecorded intabular format for each household and village. They were verified and
signed o f fby the village committees, the head o f each household andthe investigationteam.
The property assetswill be reconfirmed through broad consultation andnegotiation when land
and structures are required.

Socio-economic Survey

The current resettlement planis basedon the preliminary design, a census o fthe displaced
population, an inventory of impacted assets, a socioeconomic survey, a social assessment and
continuous consultations with the displacedpopulation. The socio-economic survey conducted
byMORis to analyze the project impacts, understand the socio-economic backgroundinthe
project-affected areas as the basis for resettlement planning, andto consult the displaced people
for their feedback on the resettlement planning.

The project starts at the east coast city o f Hangzhou, capital o f Zhejiang. It traverses Jiangxi and
ends at Zhuzhou, the border city for Jiangxi and Hunan. The rural population i s relatively dense,
with landholdings averaging about 0.5 muper capita inZhejiang, 1.2 muinJiangxi and 0.8 mu
inHunan. Plantingisthemainagricultural activity andcrops include corn andrice. Average
yields are comparatively highinZhejiang and low inJiangxi andHunan. Animal husbandry i s
also another important rural activity. Inthe project areas along the line, farmers' non-farm
income i s generally higher. The resettlement income sampling survey indicated that 87% o f
farmers' family income comes from non-farm activity inZhejiang, 59% inJiangxi and 85% in
Hunan. Non-farm activities havebecome animportant source offamily income. Farmers
normally go out as wage laborers, some long-term and some seasonal.

ProjectImpact

According to the project RAP, the project will affect 560 villages in 133 townshipsin3
provinces along the 943 kmo f railway line to be upgraded. The project will require the
permanent requisition o f 26,668 mu(1,778 hectares) o f land. This includes 18,667 mu(1,245
hectares) o f collective agricultural land, 418 mu(28 hectares) o f orchard land, and 4,057 mu
(270 hectares) of timber forest land. Duringthe construction period 6,439 muo f landwould be
usedtemporarily.



                                                    82

The project would affect 49,102 people, including 45,853 persons affectedby landrequisition
and 2,666 households with 9,401 inhabitants subject to structure demolition. 6,152 people would
be affectedbyboth landrequisition and structure demolition.

The designwill be refined further to reflect the resettlement impact analysis. Relatively minor
design changes are likely to continue untilimplementationstarts. Typically, final designs result
inmarginal decreasesinlandrequisitionandstructuraldemolition, aswell as changes in
proportion among categories o f affected land and structures.

LegalFramework

The project followed local as well as World Bankpolicies on land acquisition. Policy principles
followed indeveloping the Resettlement Action Plan were:

    e   Allpossiblemeasures willbe exploredto minimize adverse impacts, including
        engineering, technical, environmental and economic measures.
    e   The objective o f resettlement planningis to increase or at least restore the living standard
        o f the affected population.
    e   All affected assetswill be compensated at replacement cost without depreciation.
    e   The affectedpeople andlocal governments will be consultedover the compensation
        rates.
    e   Compensation fundwill be paid 3 months before requisitionof the assets.
    e   Resettlement will be land-based, with non-farm industrial employment and self-
        employment as complementary measures.
    e   The affectedpeople andthe host population will be encouraged to participate in
        resettlement planning.
    e   Resettlers will be relocatedwithin existing villages or production teams.

CompensationStandards

The project office consults and negotiates the compensation with the three involved provinces.
The actual compensation rates will be basedon replacement cost for various categories o f
affected assets. For the land compensation, it will be based on the highest average annual output
value per muamong the same kindof land inthe affected counties. Ineach case, however,
compensation rates meet or exceed legal requirements, andmeet or exceed replacement cost
valuation.

The project also will affect public infrastructure. Compensationbased on replacement value will
be paidto the relevant government agencies or local governments to restore the affected
infrastructure and services.

ResettlementBudgetandDisbursement

The RAPScontain detailed compensation rates for all impacted assets. They were arrived at in
accordance with the above principles and after consultationwith local governments and the
affected people, Detailed unit rate analysis was conducted to determine the replacement costs



                                                  83

for different types o f houses. They are described inthe RAPS.Compensationfor affectedpublic
facilities was estimated at reconstructioncost.

A detailedresettlement budgethasbeendeveloped based on the inventory o fvillages andthe
developed compensation rates. This budget includes the base cost, management fees and
contingencies. The base cost includes compensation fund for land, standing crops, houses,
attached structures, facilities, landacquisition tax, resettlement subsidy, fund for land leveling,
training andmonitoring. The management fee i s about 3% o f the base cost. Contingency i s
estimated at 20% o f the base cost for physical resettlement activity. The total resettlement
budget i s RMB773 million, including RMB 116 million o f contingency and RMB75 million o f
tax. Resettlement will be financed entirely from counterpart (Le. MOR) funds.

Resettlement h d s will be disbursed from the Ministryo fRailways to entitled units through
provincial landbureaus and county landbureaus. Landcompensation will be paidto the villages
from the county land bureaus. MORwill supervise the relevant landbureaus to allocate land
compensation andprivate compensation 3 monthsbefore the village landrequisition andprivate
assets requisition. Compensation for affectedpublic facilities will bepaidto the owners o f
government agencies or entitled units.

Livelihood Restoration

Relocation o f households. The villages will provide new residential plots and the specific house
sites will be finalized through consultation with the affectedhouseholds. Farmers will build their
ownnew houses with cash compensation. All relocating households will be servicedwith
existing public facilities andinfrastructure. No need for additional village infrastructure i s
anticipated.

Rehabilitation ofpublic facilities. The infrastructure facilities impacted are mainly irrigation
canals, power and telecommunication lines, and transport facilities. For these facilities,
compensation based on the replacement cost will be paidto the respective owners. The affected
irrigation canals andunderpasses will be reconstructed by the project construction contractors
andbe supervised by the affectedvillages. The other ownerddifferent government departments
o f the facilities will be responsible for their reconstruction.

Livelihood restoration. Since the proposedrailway alignment passesthrough mainlyrural areas,
resettlement planning has included review o f impacts on incomes, based on village impact
analysis. Among the 560 villages affected, 32 will be substantially affected by the land
requisition, inthat they will lose more than 10%o f total village farmland. Livelihoodrestoration
for farmers losing agricultural land will follow a land-based and agricultural development-based
strategy. All affected farmers will get cultivated land through the redistributiono f the village
collective land.

Resettlement subsidyfunds and landcompensationwill be usedto provide assistance to self-
employment, improve agriculturalproductivity through landreclamation and irrigation
development, soil improvement, and other activities. Also, a village-based development plan
was undertaken inthe substantially affected villages. There as inother villages, land
redistribution will be undertaken so that wherever possible all village members retain access to
land, and compensation payments will be usedby the village to improve agricultural production.

                                                    84

Incaseswhere affectedvillagers are losingtheir landandothers arenotwilling to redistribute
their landto the affectedpeople, further consultations have resulted invillage-specific strategies
for livelihood development andvillage-specific income-generating measures will be developed.

InstitutionalArrangements

Each o fthe three provinces involved has established a resettlement leading group chaired by the
Vice Governor, and relevant prefectures andcounties have been grouped. Meanwhile, the
project office has set up a multi-level organizational frameworkto supervise resettlement
implementation. Other relevant government agencies are also involved, including planning,
finance, communications and land administration at different levels. The RAP also sets out a
detailedtraining program for capacity buildinginthe project offices.

ImplementationSchedule

Landredistribution anddevelopment are likely to start from September 2004 (except for a few
small sites where work began already inJanuary 2004 to set up camps and give access to the
line). Consultations with the displacedvillages on livelihood development have begun.
Resettlement will observe the followingprinciples for the schedulingo f its implementation:

        House demolition will be phased and civil works can not start before the relocating
        households move into their new houses.
        Demolition notice must be served at least three months before relocation, andrelocating
        households will be given at least three months for new house construction.
        Civil works can not start before compensation payment and landacquisition are
        completed.
        Redistribution o f landwill be carried out duringthe season-breaks.
        Village-specific livelihood restoration measures will be developed at the same time as
        landredistribution.
        Reconstructionand rehabilitation o f affected public facilities and infrastructure will be
        completedbefore civil works start.

PublicConsultationandGrievanceRedress

The RAP was prepared with active participation o f the displaced population. Local
governments, village leaders and the affectedpopulationparticipated inthe census, the
inventory, the finalization ,ofthe alignment, the compensation rates, andthe relocation and
livelihood development schemes. From September, 2003 to March, 2004, project information
andresettlement policies were disseminated among them before andduringthe consultation
process. The affectedpopulation was systematically consultedthrough the social assessment and
their feedback hasbeenincorporatedinthe RAP. The draft final RAPhas beenplacedinlocal
libraries andits availability was announced inthe mainprovincial newspapers on February4,
2004. MOR i s preparing a Resettlement Information Booklet and will distribute it to all
displaced households after the project appraisal.

MOR has designed a grievance redress mechanism. Any grievances will beredressed through
the resettlement management at different levels. The RAP contains detailed procedures and a


                                                 85

timeframe for grievance redress. This mechanismwill be described inthe the Resettlement
Information Booklet.

ResettlementMonitoring

To ensure the smooth and successfbl implementationo fthe RAP, MOR has designed both
internal and independent monitoring mechanisms for RAP implementation. Internal monitoring
will beconductedthroughthe resettlement offices at various railway bureaus. Itwill mainly
focus on physical progress of the RAP implementation. Independent monitoringwill be carried
out byHuadongDesign Institute, the same entity that performed the survey. Its independent
monitoring will be conducted every six months. Apart from physical progress, it will evaluate
livelihood restoration efforts andtheir effectiveness. The RAP describes indetail monitoring
purpose, responsibility, indicators, methodology, procedures and reporting requirements.
