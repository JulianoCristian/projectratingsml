                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key development objective of the proposed government program for the West Beka'a and World Bank-financed project is to alleviate the precarious conditions of the
                         area's water supply systems, which has been further aggravated the recent hostilities and long-term neglect.

                          More specifically, the project is expected to improve health conditions of the population of the West Beka'a through the provision of non-contaminated water in
                         increased quantities by completely rehabilitating the area's water network.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All infrastructure works under the project have been completed, including pumping station works, civil works, well stations, strategic reservoirs and distribution/transmission networks.
                         Learning from the experience of Baalbeck (where water was distributed to those households who had not legally subscribed and connected to the network), only paying subscribers
                         are connected to the network, which is now operating as per expected during project design. This has led to a delay in finalizing all connections to the network wherein a total of

                         approximately 11,000 connections remain outstanding. The project is thus considered to have not met its project development objectives. Progress towards achieving PDO as well as
                         implementation progress have thus been downgraded to Moderately unsatisfactory. An implementation completion report is underway and will be finalized by November 20, 2012.
