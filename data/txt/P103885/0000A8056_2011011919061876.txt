                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key development objective of the proposed government program for the West Beka'a and World Bank-financed project is to alleviate the precarious
                         conditions of the area's water supply systems, which has been further aggravated the recent hostilities and long-term neglect.

                          More specifically, the project is expected to improve health conditions of the population of the West Beka'a through the provision of non-contaminated water in
                         increased quantities by completely rehabilitating the area's water network.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
