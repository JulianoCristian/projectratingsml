                                           Restructuring Paper

1.     The closing date for Lebanon, West Beka 'a Emergency Water Supply Project
(Grant TF 058085-LE), PI 03885 will be extended from November 20, 2011 until May
20, 2012 as per the request received from the Government of Lebanon in its letter dated
September 19, 201l. There are no outstanding audits.

2.     The Project's development objective is to alleviate the precarious conditions of
the West Beka'a water supply systems, which were seriously aggravated by long-term
neglect and Lebanon's 2006 conflict with Israel. Specifically, the Project will improve
the health conditions of the West Beka'a target population through the provision of
increased volumes of non-contaminated water by completely rehabilitating the area's
water network. Project implementation is in advanced stages of completion and the
development objectives continue to be achievable.

3.     As of November 17, 2011, disbursements amount to 10.27 million USD.
Committed funds under the project however amount to 14.31 million USD (equivalent to
95% of the Grant total). As discussed with GoL during the October 2011 supervision
mission, the activities associated with the outstanding disbursements (4.091 million USD
as per Table 1 below) are for works and purchases that have already been completed.
These are thus expected to be fully disbursed within the coming months.

4.     As per the project design, a total of 13,080 new house connections will be made
to the water network. Of these 13,080 potential subscriptions however, approximately
11,000 house connections are outstanding and have not subscribed to the Beka'a
Regional Water Establishment (BR WE). The issues of non-subscription and non-payment
for water services have been a consistent problem in the Beka'a area and are largely due
to historically inconsistent water and sanitation services, a lack of law enforcement and
the particular characteristics of the overall politico-economic local environment.

5.      With the full implementation of the network infrastructure and the availability of
potable water on a 24-hour basis to the project affected areas however, the lags in
subscriptions are now technically unjustified and pose a serious risk to the financial and
operational sustainability of the BR WE in the medium and long term.

6.      The BR WE has made serious attempts at improving the rate of subscriptions in
the project area by: (i) significantly reducing subscription fees; (ii) designing and .
distributing effective awareness campaign materials and (iii) organizing community
meetings with local project municipalities, and endorsed by local government, religious
and social authorities.

7.     As agreed with the Bank mission, the BRWE plans to continue and intensify these
outreach activities over the next 6 months, in order to increase the number of
subscriptions to the BRWE network. Based on international best practice and the Bank's
experience in water sector reform, this action plan is likely to have a positive impact on
the number of subscriptions.

8.       A recently proposed World Bank PPIAF Grant to assist the BRWE in developing
a conununications campaign, business plan and improved awareness raising materials
will also directly complement the BRWE's action plan to improve subscription rates.

9.      While sUbscriptions increase and new households are connected to the network, it
is thus essential that the works contractor (who is already engaged in the field), assist the
BR WE in (i) making the physical connections between the network and individual
households and (ii) continue to train BR WE engineers on the technical methodologies
associated with house connections.

10.      The extension to the Grant closing date by 6 months will thus allow CDR to
extend the contract of the on-site works contractor (for a total estimated cost of 100,000
USD as per Table 1 above) to assist theBRWE in making the connections to the network.
Th~ extension to the Grant closing date will also allow the Bank to remain directly
engaged on the project during the upcoming critical period that will significantly impact
the sustainability of the project in the medium and long-term.

11.    This will be the second extension of the project closing date.
