(WBEWSP)", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the West Beka'a\n            Emergency Water Supply Project for Lebanon were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the history of performance in key institutional\n            areas provides critical insight into likely project\n            performance. Improvements in physical infrastructure and\n            service delivery were not sufficient to induce a change in\n            the culture of not subscribing or not paying. Potential\n            subscribers were drawn from households long accustomed to\n            poor quality service, creating a mistrust of the service\n            provider's announced plans for a consistently high\n            quality service. In the case of West Beka'a, the\n            simplification of the project design was a double-edged\n            sword. On the one hand it allowed for successful development\n            of physical infrastructure to meet the needs of an expanding\n            population, but on the other hand, underestimated the\n            institutional disconnect with the population it serves and\n            ultimately its impact on beneficiary access. The delayed\n            appointment of a full-time Beka\u0092a Regional Water Authority\n            (BRWA) Director General impacted its ability to respond to\n            the urgent need for increasing subscription and collection\n            levels. Once the leadership position was filled, a community\n            response mechanism to address these gaps was put in place,\n            albeit late in the project lifecycle. Institutional\n            development thus requires an internal champion who is both\n            empowered and competent to build consensus around solutions\n            that can steer the institution toward success as seen by the\n            promising results on the West Beka'a subscription program."}, "docdt": "2012-11-14T00:00:00Z"}
