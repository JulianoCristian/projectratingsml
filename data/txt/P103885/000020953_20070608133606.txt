INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
 
The drinking water situation in the Western Bekaa area is alarming in terms of water 
quantity and quality, which has been further aggravated by the destruction of some existing 
infrastructure during the war.  Available resources are limited to 20 000 cubic per day which 
represent only 70% of the present water demand.  In addition to the fact that available resources 
cannot meet the required demand most of the water facilities are undersized and inefficiently 
operated.  The Government has not been able to rehabilitate and expand the water supply system 
in this region.  Consequently the Beqaa Water Establishment is obliged to limit service delivery 
by rationing water. Residents rely on buying water tankers that are of poor quality and extremely 
expensive for a population, which is relatively poor.   
 
Water quality studies indicate that the water does not meet WHO standards nor the 
Lebanese drinking water standards.  Laboratory analyses of the water extracted from the existing 
wells show the presence of nitrate from agricultural practices and wastewater seepage
1
.
Analyses also show that in several parts of the network the water is not safe in terms of 
biological quality due to wastewater seepage and poor performance of the disinfection system.  
As a result of the degraded water quantity and quality a number of water born diseases are 
reported in the project area especially among children
2
.
The major dev
elopment objective of the proposed “Bekaa Water Supply Rehabilitation 
and Moderrnization Project” (the project) is to improve the access of the population to 
satisfactory water supply services. 
 
The project area encompasses 44 villages with a present population of 203,000 
inhabitants and is projected to reach 335,000 by the year 2030.   The total water demand of the 
project area is 28,000 cubic meters per day and is expected to reach 46,000 cubic meters per day 
by the year 2030.  At present the project area is fed from Chamsine spring and Lousi water wells 
which are located within the drainage zone of agricultural areas.

1.2 Objectives
 
The main objective of the present environmental review is to ensure that the project is 
environmentally and socially sound and sustainable. This report has been prepared to assess 
potential negative impacts that might arise from the construction and rehabilitation works and to 
identify possible mitigation measures and monitoring plans.  For this purpose the following 
activities were undertaken: 
·
Identification of all project components/activities; 
·
Identification of project components that would require an environmental review; 
·
Assessment of potential long term environmental impacts;  
·
Identification of possible mitigation measures and monitoring plans; and 
·
Development of Environmental Management Plan (EMP). 
 
1.3 Project 
Components 
The proposed project includes: 
i)  Improving the delivery of adequate water quantity and quality to the project area 
through the rehabilitation and extension of the water supply system; and 
ii)  Institutional development and technical support to the Beqaa Water Establishment. 
 
As part of the proposed project, the following civil works will be executed for a total 
amount of about 52 million US dollars: 
·
Installation of 40,000 house connections and water meters to serve the population up 
to the year 2010; 
·
Replacement and extension of water distribution network by replacing and laying 
about 300 km of water pipelines having 40 to 350 mm diameters; 
·
Construction of 38 ground reservoirs with capacities varying between 50 and 6000 
cubic meters; 
·
Construction of about 143 km of transmission lines having 80 to 600 mm diameters; 
·
Provision of 13 pumping stations; 
Page  5

·
Drilling of 17 wells and rehabilitating the catchment works of Chamsine and El Abd 
springs. 
 
1.4 
Project Environmental Category 
The proposed project has been reviewed and environmentally screened.   The project has 
been classified as Category B, consistent with the provision of the World Bank Operational 
Policy
 
4.01, Annex C on Environmental Assessment (January 1999).  The project focuses on the 
rehabilitation and extension of the water supply and distribution systems.  Potential adverse 
environmental impacts during both construction and operation are restricted in magnitude and 
severity.   
 
The proposed project is expected to have major beneficial impacts on the environment, as 
it would provide controlled water supply to the households and will reduce overdraft of the 
aquifer as residents will have sufficient water and will no longer need individual wells.  On the 
other hand extracted groundwater will conducted by the Bekaa Water Establishment who will 
ensure that the quantities that will be pumped from the wells do not exceed the safe yield of the 
aquifer.  The project will also improve health conditions of the population by providing them 
with good quality domestic water from storage facilities. These potential benefits should 
outweigh the magnitude of the adverse environmental impacts arising from the construction of 
the water supply and distribution networks.
 
2. 
LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 
2.1 
Regulatory Framework for Environmental Impact Assessment: 
The environmental framework of Lebanon is managed and supervised by the Ministry of 
Environment (MOE) that was created by law 216 of April 2nd, 1993 to be the government 
institution responsible for the development of a national strategy for sustainable development.  
The MOE is undergoing several review procedures to up-
date the country’s environmental 
policies and regulations including the preparation of a code de l’Environnement, an 
Environmental Assessment (EA) decree, as well as norms and standards for environmental 
protection.   
 
A
number of laws, decrees and ministerial decisions govern environmental management 
in Lebanon.  Among these are the laws and decrees establishing the Ministry of Environment and 
defining its mandate and organizing the ministry.  The latest legal environmental instrument was 
Page  6
BEKAA WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT 
Environmental Assessment 
 
4
the enactment of the environment code number 444 of August 2002 which requires that EA 
should be prepared for projects and MOE approval should be obtained. In parallel, MOE has 
prepared a draft EA decree that defines EA procedures in Lebanon and efforts are underway at 
the Ministry to pass this decree.  The Environmental Assessment (EA) decree will require that an 
EA be initiated during the planning process of both public and private development projects in 
Lebanon.  Procedures developed in the decree comply with the World Bank EA requirements.  
As part of the EA decree, two annexes have been prepared: Annex 1 lists projects that would 
require a full environmental assessment study (equivalent to World Bank Category A), while 
Annex 2 lists the projects that would require a limited environmental assessment (equivalent to 
World Bank Category B projects).  According to the draft EA decree the construction, 
rehabilitation, and extension of a water supply system would require a limited environment 
assessment.  
 
2.2 
Existing Environmental Legislation  
 
Existing laws and regulations for environmental protection in Lebanon date as back as 
1925. Ground and surface water resources have been protected since the introduction of Order 
No. 144 dated June 1925, which covered the major springs that supply the country’s potable and 
irrigation needs. Protection against pollution was first addressed by Decree No. 8735 of October 
1974 that prohibited the digging of wells for the disposal of raw sewage, banned infiltration from 
cesspits, and the use of sewage for the irrigation of vegetables and some fruits. A list of the most 
significant existing environmental legislation is given in Attachment A1.  
 
Decision No. 52/1 of July 1996 introduced measures to deal with the pollution of the air, 
water and soil, including national standards for drinking water, bathing waters and wastewater 
quality. Details of available standards for drinking water are given respectively in Attachment 
A2.  Comparing the drinking water standards used by the Government of Lebanon with the ones 
adopted by WHO, no important differences could be noted.   
 
3. 
ANALYSIS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
The project will extend and rehabilitate the water system to ensure 100% water supply 
coverage, to provide good quality water on a continuous basis, to cater for population growth and 
to reduce unaccounted for water. Thus, the project will provide controlled water supply to the 
households and will reduce overdraft of the aquifer. It will improve health conditions of the 
population by providing them with adequate water quantity and quality from sustainable 
Page  7
BEKAA WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT 
Environmental Assessment 
 
5
sources.   The execution of the project will have long term positive environmental impacts 
especially on the social environment.  
 
Once operational, most of the impacts of the Project will be positive.  The project will 
lead to better services to the population and an improved environment as a result of the water 
supply.  This will lead to considerable public health benefits for the residents of the area.  In 
particular it is expected to result in a reduction in the incidences of water born diseases.  
 
3.1 
Water Quantity  
The provision of adequate water supply quantities is one of the main objectives of the 
project. To this end, adequate water supply quantities have been addressed at the planning level, 
wherein the water supply components to be developed under the project will meet the water 
demand up to the year 2030.  In fact the feasibility study projects that the water supply will 
exceed the demand by 15,000 cum/day at year 2030. Furthermore, the water supply facilities will 
include adequate storage facilities that are capable of meeting seasonal, daily, and peak hourly 
demand. The supply network will be sized to provide the peak hourly rate required by various 
consumers. 
 
The water balance for the study area was prepared on the basis of the population figures 
(203,000 for the year 2005 and 335,000 for the year 2030), the water demand 28,000 cum/d and 
46,000 cum/d for the years 2005 and 2030 respectively) and the yield of springs and wells (ref. 
Attachments A3).  The water balance indicates that the total available resources (springs and 
wells) exceed the water supply demand of the project area for the year 2030. 
 
A
number of studies have been conducted to assess the water reserves of the aquifers in 
the West Beqaa region including geological and hydrogeological studies, geophysical logging, 
and test pumping of the various water sources.  Based on these studies, it was possible to identify 
the water resources for the project study areas.  These sources consist of two water springs: 
Chamsine (56%) and El Abed (4%) and 16 wells (40%) in the same aquifer that feeds the springs 
without affecting the flows of the springs.  In accordance with the feasibility study, these studies 
confirm  that  the  current  ground  water  resources  have  a  safe  yield  capacity  of  95,900                      
m
3
/day. Under the current plan adopted by the project, the maximum water supply rate from 
these resources is 61,583 m
3
/day in the target year of the project. Therefore the maximum supply 
rate from the water resources is lower than their safe yield capacity; hence the project would not

Environmental Assessment 
 
6
diminish the resources capacities
3
.
Details of the aquifer capacities and pumping requirements 
for the project are provided in Attachment A3.  
 
3.2 Water 
Quality 
The water quality analyses of Chamsine Spring are summarized in Attachment A4
4
.
The 
analyses indicate that the water quality is chemically good.  The concentrations of all chemical 
parameters are below the maximum allowable standards set by the Lebanese Government.  
However, the bacteriological results show the presence of fecal coliforms, which indicates that 
the spring is contaminated bacteriologicaly.  Among the major causes of contamination is the 
absence of proper wastewater collection network.  The project area is not presently sewered but 
60% of its area will be covered by a wastewater collection and treatment system as a wastewater 
collection system and two wastewater treatment plants presently under construction through an 
Islamic Bank Fund.  The remaining 40% of the area has its sewers already designed and efforts 
are underway to secure the required funds for constructing the wastewater system.  
 
On the other hand, the provision of chlorination at the water supply head works will 
certainly improve water quality by eliminating its bacteriological contamination.  Chlorination 
units will be installed under the present proposed project.  In addition, the proposed project will 
build capacities of the Beqaa Water Establishment to operate and maintain the water supply 
system including the regular monitoring of the water quality and the protection of the springs. 
 
3.3 Other 
Impacts 
Adverse environmental impacts during construction might not be negligible yet they are 
only temporary.  Typical impacts for pipe laying and construction of water headworks are dust, 
noise, traffic congestion, and disturbance to the residents of the area but these are expected to be 
within acceptable limits.   
 
On the other hand, incidents can arise during operation and could involve accidental 
chlorine emissions, pipe bursts, tank leakages, and occupational hazards, all of which can lead to 
serious health risks if not addressed and dealt with in an appropriate manner.

4. 
ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES 
The option of continuing with the current water supply system as well as alternative 
water supply schemes have been explored and compared in terms of capital costs, operational 
costs, land requirements, consumed energy, environmental impacts, management needs, and 
reliability.   
 
The “do nothing” option which means continuing with current methods of water supply 
would avoid the temporary environmental impacts of installing pipelines, constructing reservoirs 
and drilling boreholes; however, this option is rejected on the ground of economic cost and 
adverse long-term environmental, social and health impacts.  The “do nothing” option would 
mean 44 villages with extremely low water quantity and degraded water quality.  Under such 
conditions adverse environmental impacts such as poor health conditions would increase and the 
prevailing environmental conditions will further deteriorate.   
 
Moreover, the economic benefits of the proposed project are greater than the cost of not 
implementing it; taking into account revenues from charges for water supply; the cost of the 
degradation of water resources; the cost of supplying additional water quantities to compensate 
for the high unaccounted for water, the high maintenance cost of the aged water supply system; 
lost working days due to water related diseases; and the cost of medical treatment.  
 
With respect to the selection of the water resources to serve the project area with 
adequate water quality and quantity, three alternatives have been considered including:  
 
(i) 
Alternative 1: potable water is supplied from the following sources:  Chamsine 
Spring, Ain Ez Zarqa Spring, Abed Spring and Seven wells, 
(ii) 
Alternative 2: potable water is supplied from the following sources:  Chamsine 
Spring, Loussi wells, Abed Spring and Seven wells.  The use of the Loussi wells 
will necessitate their chemical  treatment to eliminate nitrate, and  
(iii) 
Alternative 3: potable water is supplied from the following sources:  Chamsine 
Spring, Abed Spring and Seven wells, and the drilling of sixteen water wells in 
the same good quality aquifer that feeds the two springs without affecting the 
flows of the latter. 
 
The three alternatives considered for the project were compared to each other in terms of 
capital costs, operational costs, land requirements, transmission lines, pumping stations, 
consumed energy, environmental impacts, management needs, and reliability of the process. 
Page  10

Alternative 1 entails the consumption of excessive energy for pumping the water from 
Ain Zarqa spring to the project area which is 900 m higher than the spring. Hence, this option 
was rejected based on high energy consumption and high operation and maintenance 
requirement.  The alternative of treating the nitrate in the polluted wells (Alternative 2) was also 
rejected based on cost, system reliability and potential adverse environmental and health impacts 
which might occur in case of poor system performance or emergency shut down of the treatment 
plant.  Under these conditions the residents would either experience water shortage or would 
receive water polluted by nitrates.  The proposed option (Alternative 3) of using the two springs 
located in the project area (Chamsine and El Abed) and the drilling of new water wells in the 
same good quality aquifer as the one of the springs ranked first in terms of reliability to supply 
compliant water quantity and quality, least operation and maintenance cost and least energy 
consumption.  Therefore this option was considered to be the most environmentally sound option 
and thus it was the selected alternative.  
 
5. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN (EMP) 
5.1 
Objectives and Structure of the EMP 
The objectives of the EMP are to identify feasible, cost effective measures that may be 
used to mitigate any adverse environmental impacts that might occur during the construction and 
operation of the project.  The EMP will consist of three kinds of activities: 
·
Implementation of mitigation measures;  
·
Monitoring and evaluation of mitigation measures; and
 
·
Institutional strengthening for effective implementation. 
 
The EMP will be carefully coordinated with the construction programme of the project, 
to ensure that each relevant activity is implemented at the most appropriate time and that 
resources are efficiently allocated. 
 
5.2 
Implementation of Mitigation Measures 
Mitigation measures have been identified to ensure that the defined objectives of the 
project are achieved whilst preventing and reducing any adverse environmental impacts.  The 
mitigation measures are to be executed by the Construction Contractor and the Beqaa Water 
Establishment. 
Page  11
BEKAA WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT 
Environmental Assessment

The final design process will detail and finalize construction drawings and tender 
documents of the project components.  This process will incorporate final review of the designs 
by environmental specialists to ensure that all required environmental issues are properly 
addressed and tender documents include specific provisions concerning environment, health, and 
safety.  Furthermore, pre-tender conferences will be held to brief pre-qualified contractors and 
supervising engineers on the effective implementation and monitoring of mitigation measures.  
All pre-qualified contractors and supervising engineers will be called to a pre-tender conference 
at which environmental, health and safety issues will be outlined.  
 
5.2.1 Construction 
Phase 
During the construction of the water supply network, the potential for causing disruption 
to public activities is the greatest. Monitoring during this stage will need to be continuous and 
will cover traffic impacts, noise and dust nuisances, disposal of spoil, and safety.  
 
Construction mitigation measures will be required to minimize inconveniences to the 
public.  Such mitigation measures are standard and widely used in construction practices 
properly supervised for achievement of international standards of quality.  Table 5.1 summarizes 
the major adverse environmental impacts during construction and their mitigation measures. 
 
The general disruption during construction will be mitigated by coordinated planning of 
construction activities. This will include coordination with all concerned authorities prior to the 
start of the construction activities.  Other adverse construction activities will be mitigated 
through the adoption of Good Practice Environmental Procedures. For instance noisy 
construction activities can be limited to normal working hours and providing muffler to 
minimize noise nuisance.  Dust emissions can be avoided by using dust suppression measures 
such as periodically sprinkling water in certain areas, providing appropriate covers and removal 
of excess material from the site.  Dangerous activities in public areas will be controlled to reduce 
risk to the public, traffic and warning signs will be placed at construction sites, trenches will be 
provided by fences, or railings.  
 
The contract with the contractor will incorporate all requirements to minimize 
disturbance from construction activities and will be monitored by the Supervision Engineer and 
the Beqaa Water Establishment to ensure compliance with the contract. The conditions of the 
contracts will include requirements for the work to be performed as per international 
Page  12
BEKAA WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT 
Environmental Assessment 
 
10 
specifications. If the contracts are properly prepared and supervised, then disturbance will be 
minimized.  
 
Monthly reports will be submitted by the Supervision Engineer to the Beqaa Water 
Establishment on the environmental impacts of construction with recommendations for dealing 
with any problems including corrective actions that should be taken. 
 
The cost of the mitigation measures during construction will be incorporated in the 
contract cost of the contractor.  Moreover, the Client and the financing agency will review all 
civil works contracts to ensure that the required mitigation measures have been incorporated in 
the tender documents.

Water quality 
Water quality should meet allowable drinking water standards set by the Lebanese 
Government and WHO. Among the parameters of concern are the bacteriological contamination 
of the water, the concentration level of nitrate, the presence of nitrite and the concentration of 
heavy metals. In order to safeguard public health, it is imperative that regular monitoring of the 
water at the sources, storage reservoirs and in the distribution network be implemented to ensure 
that drinking water quality limits are not exceeded. 
Page  15

Water Quantity
Mitigation measures during the operational phase will include: 
·
Responding to emergency leakage situations through an established procedure. 
·
Reducing unaccounted for losses through a comprehensive monitoring plan.  The 
monitoring program will prohibit illegal connections to the water supply network and 
prevent system leakages.  
·
The operator of the water sources, chlorination units, and pumping facilities will adhere 
to the operation and maintenance procedures and manuals, and will conduct regular 
maintenance and monitoring to ensure that adequate output is maintained from these 
facilities. The Beqaa Water Establishment
 will check the plant’s records and verify that 
proper O&M operations are being undertaken  
 
In all instances, the Beqaa Water Establishment will establish an emergency response 
program to address citizens’ complaints in the shortest possible time.  These complaints shall be 
attended, and appropriate mitigation action will be taken to restore water quantity.  A report will 
be generated to document such incidents, and will be forwarded to the management for review 
and evaluation of future required action. 
Incidents and Emergency Cases
To ensure incidents and emergency cases are dealt with efficiently the following 
mitigation measures will be implemented:  
·
Training of professional staff in the fields of health and safety will take place before they 
commence work or operations. This would minimize the effects of health and safety 
incidents.  
·
Public accessibility to the water supply facilities should be restricted. For this purpose, 
water supply facilities especially storage reservoirs will be under the supervision of the 
guards of Beqaa Water Establishment. 
·
Both the operator and Beqaa Water Establishment shall ensure that training in basic 
operational procedures is fulfilled by the concerned staff. Training will be conducted on 
an on-going basis so as to ensure that staff is aware of best practice procedures, changes 
to technology and emergency procedures that may occur throughout the lifetime of the 
project.   
Page  16
BEKAA WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT 
Environmental Assessment 
 
14 
·
All staff shall be provided with basic training in first aid procedures. 
·
Formal procedures on how to respond to emergency cases for facilities should be 
prepared in the case of incidents. Summaries of these procedures should be displayed in 
key locations and near telephones so that immediate actions are targeted for obtaining 
correct assistance in a timely manner. Co-ordination with fire services and hospital 
services should take place so that the information is kept up to date. 
 
5.3 Environmental 
Monitoring 
 
To ensure the performance, efficiency, and effectiveness of environmental mitigation 
measures programs, it is necessary that these activities be monitored. Monitoring programs will 
be necessary for noise, air quality, and dust during the construction phase. During the operation 
water quality monitoring will include chemical and bacteriological data. 
 
Compliance monitoring during construction will be the responsibility of the contractor 
who will be supervised by an Engineer on behalf of Beqaa Water Establishment.  Environmental 
monitoring of significant impacts during the operation of the project will be among the 
responsibilities of the water operator. A strategic monitoring plan will be developed by the 
operator and periodic review reports will be produced and submitted to Beqaa Water 
Establishment. 
The Beqaa Water Establishment will have the overall responsibility to ensure that the 
adverse impacts from the project are maintained to acceptable levels and corrective measures are 
undertaken when required. The Beqaa Water Establishment will also conduct periodic 
monitoring by visiting the project site at least twice a year. Beqaa Water Establishment will 
produce periodic review reports for the Ministry of Water and Energy. 
Monitoring of construction activities will have to ensure that mitigation measures of 
construction impacts are being implemented properly, while the monitoring of operation is to 
ensure that no unforeseen negative impacts are arising.  Tables 5.3 and 5.4 give the proposed 
monitoring requirements during the operational phase.

5.4 Institutional 
Strengthening 
The Beqaa Water Establishment is to be responsible for the implementation of the Beqaa 
Water Supply Rehabilitation and Modernization Project, which includes the supervision of 
contractors’ operation and ensuring that measures to mitigate adverse environmental
 
impacts will 
be carried out.  Following the implementation of the project, the Bekaa Water Establishment will 
be in charge of the operation and maintenance of the system, the collection of water tariffs and 
the continuous monitoring of the water quality and quantity.  It is to establish a Technical 
Support Unit (TSU) to implement the project and might use the services of the private sector to 
operate and maintain the system.  
 
The institutional arrangement and capacities of the organizations in-charge with the 
implementation and management of the proposed project were reviewed with the intention of 
providing technical assistance and reinforcement.   
 
A
capacity building program is defined in order to increase capability of staff to carry out 
the Beqaa Water Supply Rehabilitation and Modernization Project’s mitigation measures. It 
should be noted that many water supply systems do not operate to their full capacity or to 
prevailing environmental standards due to poor maintenance and lack of suitably qualified staff. 
Capacity building is thus vital if this project is to achieve its environmental and social 
development aims.   
 
Environmental expertise will be strengthened through: (i) the provision of an 
environmental expert to assist the Beqaa Water Establishment in supervising the implementation 
of the EMP; (ii) the development of a manual on occupational health, safety, and emergency 
response procedures; (iii) the development of base line on the quantity and quality of water 
resources in the project area; (iv) the development of baseline data on the occurrence of water 
born diseases and the preparation of a monitoring program for the occurrence of water borne 
diseases; (v) the provision of an expert to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the EMP 
especialy at mid-term review and at the completion of the project; and (vi)
 
the provision of 
training programs that will be designed and implemented with the assistance of a local or 
international expert and will include: 
 
(i) 
Beqaa Water Establishment, Ministry of Water and Energy, Ministry of Environment, 
and Municipalities: 
At the initiation of the project, a training workshop will be provided 
to the staff of the Beqaa Water Establishment, Ministry of Water and Energy, Ministry of 
Page  19

Environmental Assessment 
 
17 
Environment,
 
and Municipalities to raise environmental awareness and to clarify the 
specific environmental requirements related to the project.  
 
A
two days workshop will then be provided to the Beqaa Water Establishment, Ministry 
of Water and Energy, Ministry of Environment,
 
and Municipalities and will cover the 
following topics: 
-
Effective implementation of mitigation measures 
-
Project supervision 
-
Sampling and analysis 
-
Monitoring and evaluation 
 
(ii) 
 Staff at Beqaa Water Establishment:
 A one day training workshop on occupational 
health, safety, and emergency response procedures will be provided.
 
In addition, the proposed project will fund some basic laboratory equipments to enable 
the Beqaa Water Establishment to conduct daily water analyses.  The Establishment will either 
buy the remaining equipments that are required for weekly and monthly tests or will contract 
such analyses to the private sector.   
 
5.5 Cost 
Estimates 
The cost of the Environmental Management Plan (mitigation measures and monitoring) 
will be borne mostly by the contractor and the supervision engineer (construction phase) who 
will make the necessary provision as part of their contracts.  These have been included in the 
project costs as part of the construction and supervision costs. 
 
The cost of the institutional strengthening requirements and the required measures to 
avoid the degradation of the springs’ water quality are detailed in Table 5.6.  As indicated, an 
estimated amount of US$ 400,000 will be allocated for meeting the environmental requirements 
of the proposed project.  As mentioned earlier, the total cost does not include the cost of 
mitigating negative construction impacts as these are included in the cost of the construction 
contract with the contractor.   
 
Following the fund raising campaign conducted by the Lebanese Government, it was 
agreed that the World Bank will provide fifteen million dollars for funding part of the project 
Page  20
BEKAA WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT 
Environmental Assessment 
 
18 
while the Kuwait Fund will cover the remaining financial requirements of the project.  As part of 
the fifteen million dollars grant of the World Bank, hundred thousands dollars will be allocated 
to implement the associated environmental requirements.  Table 5.7 details the environmental 
activities that will be funded under the World Bank Grant.

BEKAA WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT 
Environmental Assessment

Table A3.5: 
Acquifer Capacities and Pumping Requirements for the Project 
 
Chamsine Aquifer
The Chamsine spring aquifer has a rec
harge area of 320.000.000 m². 
The amount of rain over that recharge area is about: 660 mm. 
The part of water that infiltrates underground is about 44% that is: 
V
=
320.000.000 m² x 0,660 x 44% = 92,9 x 10
6
m
3
.
Other inputs recharge that aquifer and are estimated at about 25 x 10
6
m
3
.
(20 millions from yahfoufa 
aquifer and from surface runoff and 5 millions from Jurassic aquifer). 
The total is therefore about: 118 x 10
6
m
3
.
Chamsine springs yield per year:  
 
76 x 10
6
m
3
Public and private water wells yield per year:  
23 x 10
6
m
3
Remaining volume not used per year: 
 
118 x 10
6
m
3

99
x

m

=

3
The project intends to extract an additional volume of 12,5 x 10
6
m
3
through water wells     (6 around 
Chamsine spring and 2 for Kfarzabad). 
 
The remaining volume in 2030 will be: 19 x 10
6
m
3
–
12,5

=

Southern Aquifer
The Southern area will be fed from the aquifer which outlets are the springs of Hasbani. 
The spring has an average yearly flow 1.000.000 m
3
.
The overall surface of this aquifer is: 119.000.000 m². 
Assuming an average precipitations of 900 mm and an infiltration rate of 44% the volume of water 
that could be stored is: 119.000.000 x 0,9 x 0,44 = 47.124.000 m
3
The spring gives: 31.000.000 m
3
The remaining amount is 16.000.000 m
3
The project intends to extract: 6.000.000 m
3
up to year 2030. 
The remaining amount is 10.000.000 m
