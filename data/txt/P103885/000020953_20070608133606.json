Rehabilitation and Modernization\n            Project\" is to improve the access of the population to\n            satisfactory water supply services. The project area\n            encompasses 44 villages with a present population of 203,000\n            inhabitants and is projected to reach 335,000 by the year\n            2030.   The total water demand of the project area is 28,000\n            cubic meters per day and is expected to reach 46,000 cubic\n            meters per day by the year 2030. Once operational, most of\n            the impacts of the Project will be positive.  The project\n            will lead to better services to the population and an\n            improved environment as a result of the water supply.  This\n            will lead to considerable public health benefits for the\n            residents of the area.  In particular it is expected to\n            result in a reduction in the incidences of water born\n            diseases. Adverse environmental impacts during construction\n            might not be negligible yet they are only temporary.\n            Typical impacts for pipe laying and construction of water\n            headworks are dust, noise, traffic congestion, and\n            disturbance to the residents of the area but these are\n            expected to be within acceptable limits. On the other hand,\n            incidents can arise during operation and could involve\n            accidental chlorine emissions, pipe bursts, tank leakages,\n            and occupational hazards, all of which can lead to serious\n            health risks if not addressed and dealt with in an\n            appropriate manner."}, "docdt": "2007-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
