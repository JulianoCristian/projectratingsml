                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key development objective of the proposed government program for the West Beka'a and World Bank-financed project is to alleviate the precarious conditions of the
                         area's water supply systems, which has been further aggravated the recent hostilities and long-term neglect.

                          More specifically, the project is expected to improve health conditions of the population of the West Beka'a through the provision of non-contaminated water in
                         increased quantities by completely rehabilitating the area's water network.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is progressing well and construction is in the final stages of implementation. As of November 17, 2011, disbursements amount to 11.04 million USD
                         (equivalent to 74% of total Grant amount). Disbursement is projected to increase to 14,235,698 USD by April 15, 2012. The project will close on May 20, 2012.

                         Subscriptions to the network have increased from approximately 2,000 connections to over 6,500 connections over the past 6 months due to substantial efforts made by the Bekaa
                         Regional Water Establishment (BRWE) to increase subscriptions to the network. This result is significant in an area that has long been associated with non-payment of fees and has
                         caused significant impact on the BRWE's long term financial and operational sustainability. The remaining 6,000 connections under the project will continue to be made by the BRWE
                         as subscriptions increase. This is a welcome step by the BRWE since connection of households to the new and improved water network will only be made in exchange for

                         subscription to the network. It is also important to note however, that all project affected residents will continue to have access to water, but those who are not subscribed to the
                         BRWE will only have access to the older network which provides water at lower pressures.

                         Despite the significant progress on connections as described above, the progress towards achievement of project development objective remains moderately satisfactory since all the
                         of the anticipated connections ( as per project design ) were not made as planned.

                         All infrastructure works under the project have been completed and the project is expected to close on time by May 20, 2012. An ICR mission is planned for end of April 2012.
