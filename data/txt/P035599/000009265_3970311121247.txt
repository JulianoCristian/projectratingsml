MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMNDATION OF-THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON FOR A
TRANSPORT SECTOR TECENICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and r       on   on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Cmeroon for SDR 6.9 million, the equivalant of US$10.2 mion,
on stadard IDA tenms witi a murity of 40 year, to help finance a trasport sector tecbnical assistance
project.                                        
2.    COUNTRY BACKGROUND. Unaddressed structural problcms in the country's economy have
prevented Cameron fim reaching its development potential. Until 1985, Cameroon's economic growth
averged 7 prcent per year, sustained by abundant nuau  resources (tropical forests, petroleum, bauxite,
naual gas, fertile agriculta  land, and i largely.-favorable climate),; and favorible export prices for
petroleum, cocoa-and coffe.. However, several structural problems developed during this period. The
trdtonal growth sectors,. agriculture in particular, were nelected and their productivity declined. The
multitude-of public enterprises cretd during this period were inefficient;and eventually became bankrupt
while draining wg resources frorm the State budget. The banking sector praciced imprudent lending by.
becoming overly depednt on- il revenues, and largeeent deposits. .''The investment in public
infrastructure was not selected to respnd to ec priorties or. social needs and was not followed by
proper m.   The lang-term,debtmincreased firo  less.than 201 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in. 1976, to about50 percent in- 1992. In additio, 'Cameroon suffired fio m two major
shocks. First, as a result of a sharp decline in.export prices.ofpetroleumrin 1986,1followed by declines.in
cocoa and coffee export prices, the eternaml terms of trade.fall by moredtan 55 percent from 1985 to 1989.
Second, de real effective .exhange rate, started to appreciate f   the US dollar and Nigeian Naira
depreciation in 1985-1986, and contdnued to appreciate as Cameroon's inflation  te conisntly =reained
abve the inflation rates of its main tding partners. .-
3.    In 1988, the Govenmnt launched an adjustment program  -withsupport fom the IMU and the'
World Bank. However, the program was not-impiement consistently' and its main objectives were not
attained. While some progress wasimade-in di ing    ent interventi n the economy, ireduCing
price controls on domestcally tradedgods, liftg a    of quantiive rstrictions on imports, and
rationalizing the incentives framewo,the. fn       St       problems of.6 teconomy remained
unaddrcssed. As arsult exteal ceddecline, ex                         l and intmal imbalan
worsened, and tb.e econmic and:fn   situon didi ot improve. Tax revenues deteriorated, wbile totl"
current expendres remained uchagd t           g the prmnarr fiscal balance from a surplus -in 1989
toDadeficit of2 percetofGDP.m'1992,.                              '     -
4.    A major :change .occurred in Januar 1994, whe Governmentof Cameron, along with its
partner countriesin the .CFA zone, decided to adjustithe parity, of ftCFA Franc from C1AF 50 per
Frech Franc (FF) to CFAFj.100 per FF.' To -talke advantage ofthe positive-effects of the'devaluon, te
Govcnment,  ith IMF and 'DA assistance,bega mpleg a program.of economic measures and
structuralreforms. The program,nsuipported by .an.IMF.Standby and an IDA:Economic Recovey Credit
(ERC, Cr. No. 2627-CM, Jume 10, 1994), covers three key areas: (a) reimsiong of the public sector
and improved public resourcemana t (b)'inproving.the incentives fimnework for the productive
sectors; and. (c) targtig of p ll        measures. Inh coqunction with the effects of the devaluation,
the program is expected to enid the recession and.reslti.' positive r.a growth. Real GDP growth- is
pr~ted to average about 5' percent per annum fr,m' 1995/96. Pb   se'ctor:ublic sector irrvestments  cted to
~~*          -'     '  !       .'-,  



recoer gradually fom 2.2 percent of GDP in 1992/93 to about 4 percent in 1996/97. Private investment
is expected to rise frn 8.7 percent of GDP in 1992/93 to about 12413 percent in 1996/97. Public sector
savings arc projected to turn around substantialy, as tax reform and expenditure control translatl into
improved fiscal balanoes.
5.    Redimsioning of the public sector and improving public resurce management would be achieved
by privamzing/liqtNdating priority -public enterpnrses, improving performance of enterprises not yet
undergoing privaizution, and implmnting a strategy to setle the domesic debt. The Declaration of
Policy adopted by the Government in the context of the ERC emphasized the need for State retrenchment
from commercial activities. In July 1994, the Goverment listed 15 public enterprise for privatization or
liquidation including the national airline, the milways, the urban bus company, the national shipping line
and the national containr transport and freight forwarder company. The Government is currently revising
the institutional famework for Public Enterprise (PE) reform. The Ministry of Economy and Fince has
been mandated to carry out this reform. The settement of Govenmet domestic debt is a priority for the
econom y.  Based on the prlhminay outcmes of an on-going analysis of the domestic debt, the
Governmen doimec debt accounts for 75 percent of the total domestic public sector debt, which amounts
to about USS4 billion and accounts for about 45 percent of the exta debt, 50 percet of GDP and six
times the 1993-1994 budgetary receipts. The Govenment and IDA are currenty worldng on a revised
definiton of the institutional framework for PE reform and on the strategy to settle the donestic debt.
6.    TRANSP6RT SECTOR BACKGROUND AND ISMS. The trasport sector is managed by ftree
Govemet institutions. TheMinistzy of Public Works (MT), with about 6,700 employees, -is
responsible for road mainteaance. Th Mistry of Trnsport (MINT), with about 880 employees, intites
and supervises transport regulations. MINT also oversees the Shippers' Council (CNCC), which controls
the distribution of Cameroon's maritime traffic under the United Nations, Conference on Trade and
Development's (UNCTAD) Code of Conduct, negotiateslner confene tariffs, and reps
Cam onian shippers' interests. The Dirtorte of Large Works of Cameroon (DGTC), with about 150
emnloyees, reports to the Prime Ministry. It prepares and   ses  large works,- including roads, and
procures contrcts above about US$100,000 equivalent -for: ministries, and about US$365,000 for PEs.
The contry procment review carried out by IDA in 1993 qualified the local procurement procedures as
critically deficient because of little trnsparency in bid evaluation and award of contacts, rulting in long
procurent processing and high costs. IDA and the Govenmt of C      agreed-on a revised draft
national procurement code in Decmber 1994.
7.    The transport sector contains nine PEs. Seven PEs are unde the jurisdiction of MINT: CA MA .R
(Cammroon Airlines), with about 1,600 employees; REGIFERGC: (Rigre Natonale des Chemins de
Fer), with about 4,000 employees, operating about 1,000 kon of riilways; SOTUC (Societi des Transports
Urbains du Cameroun), with about 1,050 employees, operating bus lines in Yaound6 and Douala;
CAMSHIP (CamemOon Shipping Lines), ith about 280- employees, including 80 saiors; cArTA'NER
(Socid   Nationale de Transport et de Transit du Cameroun), with about 200 employees; OAZC (Office
National des Ports du Cameroun), with about 1,000 employees, managing Cameroon's main port at
Douala and three secondary ports, with most port operations conactd out to p orae ors, and CNIC
(Chanher Naval et Industrfel du Cameroun), with about 130 employees, opeatig a diy-d     Two  PE s -     PEs
fall under the jurisdiction of MNTP: MATGENZE (Parc National de Materiel de Gedne Civil), with.
about 400 employees, an equipment pool for road mintenance; and L4BOGEAYE (Laboratoire National
de Genie Civil), with about 530 employees, which cantrls te norms and standards of road and building
constuction, and caries out research.

8.    In the past, weak management and insdtutions have aused the transport sector to have a negativu
impact on the ovcrall economy. MINT and MINTP lack technical and managerial competoncm Ministerial
interfekncc with public enterprises' managanent has limited their autonomy and hampered thoir
performance. Priority has been given to oversized investments without consideration to economic
justification and recurrent costs. Customs procedures are cumbersome and penalize transit traffic to and
from Chad and the Central African Republic. As a result of weak management, transport infriastructure
has lacked maintenance, and loss-mading PEs have drained scarce State resourou. The road network is
rapidly deteriorating and insufficient dredging impedes the access of large ships to Douala, the main port of
Cameroon: In 1993, dircct subsidies to cover transport PEs' deficit amounted to US$55 m-illion, equivalent
to 8 percent of the State revenues. About US$240 million of subsidies had been allocated to tansport
sector PEs between FY90 and FY92, of which 84 percent to CAMAIR. The total domestic debt for the
nine sector PEs is estimated at US$230 million as of 1994. This accounts for about 24 percent of the total
debt of the 34 major PEs in Cameroon, 6 percent of the total domestic public sector-debt and 3 percent of
the gross domestic product. Seven of 'the nine PEs are technically bankrupt. The consequences for the
economy are high transport costs, nmning down of existing assets, and lack of resources for investment.
Roadtransport costs, transport costs for irnational trade, and port tariff are excessively high. The road
network and railway tracks need costly-rehabilitation.
9.    TRANSPORT SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM. Since 1990, the Govermnet has undertaken to
reform the-tansport sector. Progress, :erratic and slow at. first, has accelerated recently, and is overall
satisfactory. In the earlier phase, supported under the IBRD's Structural Adjustment, Loan (SAL, Ln. No.
3089-CMI June 1989), top-level commitment was insufficient, ande dfctive rcstucturing- did not take
place. Since 1992, the pace of reform picked up. A perfonince contract was signed with the railway
company which resulted in the disniissal of about 2,000 employees, contracting-out of some mainte
works, and tariff autonomy. SOCAMAC, the national.stevedore, has been privatized. In October 1994,
following the appointment of a new managementteam, MATGENIE was restuctured and 400 employees
were dismissed, reducing the ,salary bill by 40 percent. In addition, salaries were cut' by 10 percent in
January 1995. CAMSHI[P has been cally restructred and earned profits in FY94.  Airport
managenent was privatized in 1994. in order toDshift fiom carrying out road maintenance by force account
to execution by contracts, the Government agreed to a new road mainteance policy in 1993. This policy is
being tsed for earth road maintenance with European Union financing. In early 1995, Xt  Goverment
c,ontractedoutthemanagementof asecondary portto aprivateinvestor. OnFebruaiy22, 1995, SOTUC's
General Assembly decided to liquidate the company:and all services have been stopped p   the
liquidation. This phase bas consolidatod a constituency for reform in the transport sector and has proved
that results can be achieved and sustained. Yet, the importance of the sector in the economy and the
current daunting magnitude of the issues call for scaling up the Government's effort 10o restore financil
viability and to solve the sectoral policy and insitional issues, with a coordiatedW coherent set of actions
on the domestic debt crisis.
10.   The Government, with the support of donors involved in the transport sector has developed an
overall transport sector reform program to complete the adjusment of the sector institutions and address
the financial issues in the sector. The program seeks to enable the sector to resume its contribution to
development instad of being a constraint to the country's economic growh  It is aimed -at impmving
mobiliation and allocation of resources, maintnance of transport infrastructuremand the oveiall efficiency
of the sector. These objectives would be achieved tro   Ste divestitur from transport operations,
increased competition, more focused institutions to improve their ectivess, and an improved regulatory
framework. The program would be implemented in thee phases over:a three-year perod. The first phase
of the program would privafize or liquidate five major tansport PEs with most impact on the Treasury,
i.e., the national airline, railways, shippig line, urban bus company and container trsport and freight

forwarder company. MsNTh rolo would be revised to focus on planing, reguation and policy. The
regulatory famework for air, maidme and urban transport would be revised to develop competition and
cntry of pri'ato operatori in the subsectors. The ubsequent r'aseu would downsize the port authority and
implement an efficiency-driven organization for dredging execuion, reorganize road maintenance, and
improve customs procedures for local and international trnsit, MINTP's role would be revised to shift
from carrying out road maintenance by force account to management of road maintenance by contracts.
The State would divest from MATGENME in parallol with the prgressive contrcting out of road
maintenancc. Investment in the sector, with an initial focus on maintenance and rwhabilitaion, would
resume once implementation of te reforms has begun.
11.   LESSONS LEARND FROM PrVIOUS DANKIIDA  INVOLVNM. XBlI) and IDA have
financed six highway projects, three port projects, four rilway projects and two structural adjustment
operations in Cameroon. Physical achievements of the transport projects lacked sustnability because of
lack of disciplined managment; weak instittional. capacity and insufficient local financing: for their
maintenance. This experience, and lessons from other countries, show that sustainable fran port sector
dewlopment should be integrted with and based on a sustainable macroecnomic framework; as well as
on a loqg-trm stategy with sector reform phased acding to priority of. issues. and local resource
mobilization capacity. In the PE sector, results of pc'.formance contracts signed under the SAL were
largely unsatisfkctory. This experience, and the deteriorating performce of PEs, justfy-a rmajor policy
emphasis on State divestiturethrough pivatization or liquidation. Weak re*rm implementation in
Cameroon also shows the need for strong, up-frbnt actions on adjnus-ent.
12.    PROJECT OBnCvEs. Wth the assistance of the pr       projectc the G rinmet intendsto:
(a) launch the transport sector reform progamin, which would result in the creaion of a new private civil
aviation company, private opertion of rail services, liquidation of the irban bus comipany, sale of public
shaTes in CAMSHIP and CAMTAINER, stucturing of MINT and reform of-te rtguaory 3amework
for air, urban, and maritime transport; and (b) continue preparation of the subsequent phases- ich would
result in: (i) restructuring of MP; exection by contract of most of the road maintenance work
program; and i nion of a pluri-anual programming systm; as well as .a sustainable finacing
mechanism for road maitece; (ii) restructuring and down-sizing of the port aui; implentation
of an efficidivm organization for dredging, and (iii) an improved customs       framework
overhaul of the customs comized information system; and imp       ion ofa new intematonal
transit system
t13.   PROJECT DESCRIPON. The project pmvides for consulants' services for lanching thef

ONPC's dredger; relocation study of the dry-dock; analysis of dredging mial (US$0.3 million); (e)
feasibility studies of an on-going prioty progm of ivestmt for REGIFERCAM (US$0.3 million); (f)
training or seminars on procurenent and supervision of road maineance works, on the procedures for the
new iterational transit system, on the road maintance initiative (carried out with PPF financing), on the
new secor policy, and on envirnentl consider   in road mainteance (US$1.4 million); (g)
preparation of a plan to improve road safety and institutional study of urban tasport (both carried out
with PPF financing), continuation ofte comterization of vehicle certification and of the monitoring of

(US$ 1.1 million); (h) local capacity building with a review of the capacity -of local consultants in transport
and the estabhshmt, within the Transport tmTnisterial Coordinaon Unit, of a training program for
young professionals (US$0.2 million); and (i) project audits, implementation of a project management
system, vehicles, computers, support staff under contract with the Transport Interministerial Coordination
Unit, and short-term exprts and training to sghen the unit (US$2.0 million).
15.   PROJECT SUSTANABLY. Project sustainability depends on satisibetory implementation of the
ransport sector reform prograL  4 detailed implentation schedule and timing targets have been
established to monitor execution. With te project's assistance, the Government is ecpected to meet these
tagts, which are prerequisites for fiurter IDA support planned in the short term through the proposed
Transpont Sector Adjustment Credit (TSAC) and Transport Sector Project (TSP) under preparation
(FY96).
16.   PROJECT FINANCING.  lhe project cost, including taxes, is esimated at US$23.9 milion. IDA
would fEnance US$10.2 million, French Cooperation US$2.2 million, Europcan Union US$7.3 millioHn
German Cooperation USS0.5 million The Government would bear the cost, estimated at US$3.7 million,
of taxes and duties lvied on consuling servics and goods. The Goverment will also finan  the salary of
the four civil servants working i the T sport Interniiisterial Coordination Unit, estimated at an ammal
US$ 16,000, and provide offices for the unit. In the curren budgetay situation, wher the Goverment is
barely able to finance its civil servants, service the country's external debt and allocate scarce remaining
resources to priority maintance, no other coaribution to the project;would be requested from the
Govwermnxt.
17.   PROJECT INPLRMENTATION. The M;isty of Economy and Finance will be responsible, for the
pnivazaon/liqidation component of the project. The overall institional fiamework for privatization is
beng revised as part of the preparation of a proposed Structual Adjustnt Credit (SAC, FY95), to
5



onsuro satisfactory implementation of this component. MINT and M1NWP Aill be rosponsible in teir
subsoctors for preparing tho subsoquent phases of tho rform program, including investmento, in close
collabortion with other interosted Govornmont agencies. The existing Transport Intministerial
Coordination Unit, which hs diligently assistod the Government in tho preparation of tho reform progrmn,
will continuo to assist MINT and MTNTP, and will administer the crodit under supervision of MINEFI.
Almost all toclhnical assistance to be provided under tho proposed project is of a short-tcrm nature and ,i
designed to strengffin national capacity to manago tio transport sector. Toechnical assistanco will not,
thereforo, be long-torm substituto for local staff.
18.   RATIONALM FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT. ThO project is consistent with the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on June 16, 1994, in conjunvetion w.th tho ERC. Tho CAS focuses
on three armas: (a) redimensioning, focusing and improving the public sector; (b) increasing productive
capacity; and (c) strongly focused interventions to alleviate poverty. Tho project will help achievo the
CAS's objectives by preparing: (a) the privatization/iquidation of transport PEs, and the restructuring of
seetoral ministries; (b) liberalization of air, urban and maritimc transport, and privatization of road
maintenancc and dredging execution, and (c) the use of labor-based methods in road maintanance. IDA's
involvement in the privatization and liquidation process is also vital in ersuring fairness and transparency.
While the preparation of the reform program would bc supported by the proposcd project, implemnation
of the refomns would be supported by the proposed TSAC and TSP. Tlhe proposed project is part of te.
Regional Program for Transport Policy Reform in the Customs Union of Cewtral African Countries
(UDEAC), which IDA has supported since its inception, along with other donors. -
19.   AGREED ACTIONS. During negotiations, the Goverment agreed to: (a) project objectives; O(b)'
expected rcsults and tming for key project activities; (c) pm ent procedures, including standard times
for prourm t steps; (d) disbursement, accounting, auditing and reporting  dures; (e) detiled content
of the project and implementation schedule; (fM outline of the Project Implementation Plan; (g) guidelines
for preparing taining activides; and Qi) arrangements for evaluation of consultants' and counterparts'
perfornance during project execution. Conditions for effeciiveness are: (a) signature of a pluniannual
contract with an auditing firm acceptable to IDA for project audits; and (b) completion of the Project
Impleimetation Plan.
20.   ENvmONxzNTAL AsPECTS. The project's envronmental classification is C, as the project will
only finance consulting services with no environmental impact. Enviromnental issues in the port sector
have been studied. The project will include a study and a seminar on enviromnental issues in road
* maintenance. Engmneerig studies will address enviromnental issues related to sector investments.
21.   PRoGRAM  OBJECTIVE CATEGORIES.  Public Entprse Reform. and Private Sector
Development.
22.   PARTICIPATORY APPROACH. Most stakeholders in the transport secr have participated in the
preparation of the transport sector reform program. Several sminars were organizd in the maritime, port,
road transport and road nairntace subsectors to discuss policy reforms with private and public actors.-
The proposed privatiaion/liquidalion of CAMAIR, REGIFERCAM and SOTUC-was discussed with the
employees of tbese enterprises.
23.   PROJECT BENEFrrs. By seDcting candidates tough a competitive bidding process, and by
clearly defining objectives in their terms of ref ce, grater faimess and trnsparency can be expected
from the use of financial advisors in the prparation and execution of the privatization program, as well as
from the use of a liquidator for the urban bus company. Completion of the privaizatoniquidation
6

program would curb subsidics to PEs concerned. More efficient road maintenance, port authority
restucturing, and improvement of transit and facilitation prepared under the project would reduce transport
costs and improve the country's competitiveness.
24.   RISKS. The risks are of: (a) delays in execution because of weak institutional capacity; (b)
proceeding with studies ahead of effctive comrimitment to PE reform; and (c) lack of fairness and
transparency in the privatization process. Decisions taken by the Govermment within the context of the
ERC (to privatize/liquidate the priority transport PEs), the recent Government reorganization, which
strengthens the institutions in charge of privatization, and the revision of the institutional fiamework for
privatizaticn supported by the proposed SAC would mitigate these risks. Effective implementation in
February 1995 of the Government's decision to stop SOTUC's services and Government agreement on
terms of reference for critical activities supported by the project demonstrate Government's commitment.
Clear indicators and detailed timetables have been defined to closely monitor the implementation of
transport reform. The donor-supported integrted approach, whereby investment projects are undertaken
after successful reform implementation, should impel the Govermnent to take actions to implement the
reform according to the agreed timeable. Public advertising, carefilly designed procedures, audits, and the
inputs of financial advisors would help reduce the risk of lack of fairness and transparency.
25.   RlCOMMDATION. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of
Agrement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
TRANSPORT SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
STATUS OF BANK PORTFOLIO
The quality of the portfolio in Cameroon was poor until 1994, when it improved
substantially as a result of the restrubturing exercise. The main objectives of the restructuing
were to downsize projects which were too large, and to cancel those with insoluble
implementation problems. Within the agricultural portfolio, the Livestock Development Project
was downsized to concentrate on the eradication of the tsetse fly in the Central Highlands. The
project component for feed manufacturers and pig and poultry manufacturers was canceled The
Cocoa Rehabilitation Project is the only problem project in the portfolio. Its performance has not
improved over the last year, despite attempts to restructure it.  It has been rated higbly-
unsatisfactory both- with regard to progress towards development objectives and implementation
status. The Bank has informed the Government that no extension is envisaged of the Closing
Date of June 30, 1995. Within the infrastrucure portfolio, the review of the projects indicated
serious management problems, but it was decided to let the projects close on time during the
course-of the year. In one of the projects, a significant resettement issue was ideified which the
Government will have to resolve before new projects can be processed in the sector. All other
projects in the active portfolio are rated satisfictory with respect. to development objectives and
implementation status.
