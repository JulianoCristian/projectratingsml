In October 1993, the Czech Republic\n            signed the United Nation (UN) framework convention on\n            climate change, and has since agreed to undertake efforts to\n            reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to meet the requirement\n            of stabilizing emissions at or below 1990 levels by the year\n            2000. This project was presented by the Government of the\n            Czech Republic for global environmental facility (GEF)\n            financing following a complicated and lengthy process of\n            project identification, analysis, and priority setting. The\n            project will: (a) reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from\n            the Kyjov district heating system, by increasing the energy\n            efficiency and reliability of heat and power supply to the\n            Vetropak Moravia glass factory and heat supply to the city\n            of Kyjov; and (b) achieve local environmental benefits by\n            reducing the proportion of lignite in the fuel-mix for heat\n            and power generation."}, "docdt": "2004-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
