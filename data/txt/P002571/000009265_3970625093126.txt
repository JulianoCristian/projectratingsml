PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Fourth
Railway Project in Sudan for which a Credit 727-SU in the amount of US$8.0
million and Loan 1467-T-SU in the amount of US$12.0 million were approved by
the Board on June 28, 1977. The Credit and Loan were closed on December 31,
1982, the original date planned for project closing, at which time US$276,960
equivalent was cancelled.
This completion report was prepared by the Bank's Eastern Africa
Regional Office and is based on information obtained from various missions and
from the files, appraisal and supervision reports, and data supplied by the
Sudan Railways Corporation.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were
received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUDAN
FOURTH RAIUWAY PROJECT.
CREDITALOAN 727-SU/146"7T-SU
HIGHLIGHTS
At appraisal in 1976, the project was deemed necessary to enhance
the capacity of the Sudan Railways Corporation to handle expected substar-
tial increases in traffic. The increased capacity was to be achieved
primarily through project components designed to improve operating effi-
ciency. Thus far, operating efficiency has deteriorated rather than
improved with consequent adverse effects on both capacity and quality of
service.--these limitations have, in turn, resulted in a decline of
traffic. The current outlook for operating efficiency is that no improve-
ment is expected; therefore, traffic is not expected to -increase in the
forseeable future. It is evident that the principal objectives of the
project have not been achieved (paras. 2.04 and 8.01 through 8.08).
During preparation and appraisal of the Project, the Bank
recognized that both pipeline and road transport were being developed and
that these competitors would have some adverse effect on railway traffic
growth (paras. 4.06 through 4.09). In retrospect, however, Bank staff did
not anticipate the great difficulties that SRC management would encounter in
improving services and efficiency. Poor railway performance in the 1976-83
period made the SRC a veak competitor.
The principal reasons for the unsatisfactory performance trends
of the railway in recent years are the (i) frequent changes in top
management; (ii) poor morale and productivity of railway staff; (iii)
shortages of qualified managerial and technical staff; (iv) failure of the
Government to make available, on a consistent basis, foreign exchange for
spare parts; (v) failure of SRC to institute a strong marketinq department;
and (vi) increased availability of competing means of transport -(paras. 4.10
through 4.17). Future performance of the railway will depend on the ability
of SRC to cope with these problems.
The Project Loan and Credit did not become effective until 18
months after Board Approval because of delays in completing co-financing
arrangements. Once effective, disbursements occurred with reasonable
regularity, and the Loan and Credit were closed on schedule.
Track improvements, representing 50 percent of total project
cost, were intended to improve operating efficiency on lines where slow
speeds and derailments were causing increasing problems. The project
component was essential for the lines that were assisted as they would have
ceased to function within 10 years.



A major conponent - construction of a new diesel locomotive
workshop - was deleted- from the project because of delays in design and
cost increases. Construction of a wagon workshop in Port Sudan was also
delayed but was retained in the project (para. 7.05).' Completion is
expected Xn 1984.

FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
CREDIT/LOAN 727-SU/1467T-SU
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Sudan, the largest country in Africa in terms of area, has one of the
most extensive railway systems on the continent. In addition to the 4,800 km
railway, Sudan is served by about 18,500 km of roads and tracks (of which only
1,500 km are paved), 1,690 km of navigable waterways and a 750 km pipelire.
Until the early seventies, the Sudan Railway Corporation (SRC) had a near
monopoly in the sector. Before 1970, road transport on major traffic corridors
was constrained by lack of roads. River transport was then under the
administrative control of the SRC. The role of the railway changed dramatically
in the seventies when road transport developed as a vigorous competitor for
traFfic, particularly between Port Sudan, the only deep water seaport, and
Khartoum, the primary commercial center in the interior. Road transport in
large volume became feasible between these points after a modern paved road was
built in the seventies. Significantly, service provided by the railway at this
time was poor, giving a great advantage to the trucking industry then in an
early stage oF development. In inland water transport, the role of the SRC
changed significantly in 1973 in that control of river operations was removed
from the SRC. Notwithstanding these changes, the Government retains the view
that the railway will continue to play a major role in the country's transport,
especially for commodities that move in large volume over long distances. Most
of Sudan's exports and a high proportion of imports when containers are
employed, appear to be well-suited to rail transport, assuming the SRC is
operated with reasonable efficiency.
1.02      The Railway Project (Credit/Loan 727-SU/1467T-SU) was the fourth in a
series of Bank-financed projects for the Sudan Railways. The first loan (Loan
202-SU, 1958) of US$39.0 million helped finance the Railways' 1959-60 investment
program which consisted of (i) acquisition of locomotives and rolling stock,
(ii) track rehabilitation, (iii) extension of western lines, (iv) modernization
of workshops, (v) modernization and expansion of Port Sudan, and (vi) acquisi-
tion of river craft. Implementation of the project was slow, and it was not
completed until 1964.  The second loan (Loan 440-SU, 1965) of US$31.0 million
helped finance the Railways' 1966-68 investment program; its principal features
were (i) procurement of diesel locomotives, (ii) procurement, construction and
improvement of rolling stock, (iii) relaying of rail on the Khartoum-Atbara-
Port Sudan Line, (iv) acquisition of a dredger and certain equipment for the
improvement of river services, and (v) construction of new cargo berths and
sheds at Port Sudan. Execution of the second project was slow, and the Loan was
not fully disbursed until mid 1972, three years later than scheduled. The third
loan (Credit 727-SU, 1973) of US$24.0 million assisted in financing the
following cor.jonents: Ci) the 1973-75 investment progran of SRC, (ii) equipment



-2-
and technical assistance for Port Sudan, (iii) equipment and technical
assistance for the River Transport Corporation (RTC), (iv) airport
pre-investment studies, and (v) training for the staff of the Auditor General.
The third project was completed in 1981, some five years after scheduled
completion.
1.03      Early Bank experience in lending for railway development in Sudan was
reviewed in the Project Performance Audit of 1974 for the Second Railway
project. The Audit concluded that the underlying project objectives of
increasing efficiency and capacity of the railway were not achieved, noting that
a major problem of the railway, notwithstanding the contributions of the
project, was the low availability and poor operational performance of SRC
locomotives. The evaluators found that the railway had directed dispropor-
tionate attention to the procurement of equipment and had devoted too little
resources to the task of improving the utilization of equipment. The Third
Railway Project was somewhat more concerned with equipment utilization, commit-
ting sizeable resources to the training of operating personnel. A Project
Completion Report for the latter project was issued on June 10, 1983; the
results were not satisfactory. Experience under these various projects has
shown that institutional development warrants greater relative emphasis in the
sector and that increasing inter-modal competition is creating inescapaole
pressures for improvement of railway service.
1.04      Several other projects in the transport sector have involved the Bank
Group during the seventies. In 1972, an IDA credit (Credit 331-SU) of US$7.0
million was approved primarily for improvement of highway maintenance but the
Credit also financed technical assistance for planning and coordination of the
transport sector as a whole; the project was completed satisfactorily in 1980.
A Second Highway Project (Credit 882-SU) of US$41.0 million, approved in 1979,
included institutional components, road design and construction of the Jebel
Aulia-Ed Dueim road; the construction work was completed with large cost over-
runs and institutional improvements in the south were still progressing slowly
in early 1984. The Third Highway Project (Credit 1450-SU) of SDR 15.5 million,
approved in February 1984, financed road maintenance equipment, ferry boats,
technical assistance and training. In the mid seventies, the Bank served as
executing agency to the UNDP, which made available US$434,000 to finance a
technical assistance team providing advisory services and counterpart training
to SRC operating personnel. A Technical Assistance Project approved in 1976
(Credit 614-SU, US$4.0 million), financed the execution of pre-investment
studies in various sectors including transport. In 1976, the Bank, using its
own funds for consultants, engaged a workshop expert from the Indian Railways to
investigate the problem of low availability of locomotives and on-line
locomotive failures. In the field of aviation, the Bank in 1976 approved a
project (Loan 1287T-SU and Credit 643-SU, USS20.0 million and US$9.0 million)
for developing four domestic airports; implementation of the project was long
delayed and most of the funds were cancelled (see PCR). In 1978, the Bank
approved a Port Project (Credit 781-SU, US$22.0 million) to improve Port Sudan
and the project was carried out successfully. A Second Port Project (Credit
881-SU, US$25.0 million) for further development of Port Sudan was approved by
the Board in April 1982.



-3-
1.05      The principal objectives of Bank lending for the transport sector have
been to provide (i) facilities and equipment for the railway system, sea port
and road system, thus, strengthening the physical capabilities for transport;
and (ii) technical assistance and training aids for the various transport
organizations, thus, strengthening the institutional capabilities in the
sector. So far, as the railway is concerned, the principal aims have been to
improve operational efficiency and to provide additional railway capacity as
needed to enable the system to carry expected increases in traffic. Notwith-
standing the provision of substantial Bank financing for both physical and
institutional development, performance of tl  SRC during the late seventies and
early eighties has been unsatisfactory as seen in the declining traffic and
deteriorating operating efficiency. The Ministry of Transport, at times, helped
the SRC overcome particular problems but was not able to prevent the sharp
decline of the railway. Recognizing the need for a Railway Action Program to
address the serious problems faced by the railway, the Bank in 1983 urged the
SRC to engage consultants to prepare such a program and both the SRC AND
Ministry of Transport agreed. The consultants for this effort, financed by a
Bank technical assistance credit, are expected to complete their work in mid
1984. Among the problems being considered are the excessive size of the railway
staff, lack of technical and managerial staff, lack of spare parts, recently
introduced orqanizational changes, and the frequent changes in assignments to
key managerial posts in the SRC.
1.06      This completion report is based on information collected on missions
to Sudan and a review of Bank files in Washington. The Credit and Loan
Agreements contain no requirement that the Borrower prepare a Project Completion
Report. SRC did, however, provide the Bank with certain information that has
been useful in preparing this report.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01      Identification of the Fourth Railway Project occurred in November
1975 when the SRC and Government Ministries expressed to a Bank mission their
interest in obtaining Bank Group financing for purchase of rolling stock and
workshop equipment as well as technical assistance to improve operations and
maintenance. As part of the Government exercise for preparation of the 1978-83
Six-Year National Economic Development P]an, SRC prepared a draft six-year
investment plan for the railway totalling £5d171 million without contingencies.
Based on this plan, an investment program for the first three years, 1978-80, of
the plan period was prepared by SRC and the Government. That program
constituted the Fourth Railway Project. A project preparation mission visited
Sudan in April 1976 and the appraisal took place in November 1976.
2.02      During appraisal in November 1976, the SRC sought, inter alia, to
include some new locomotives in the project but the Bank mission resisted this
move, contending that they were not needed Drovided the existing fleet was
properly maintained.  In the interest of z .ieving better locomotive



availability, it was agreed, however, that locomotive spare parts should be
included in the project. Following Credit/Loan negotiations in March 1977, a
meeting was held in Kuwait attended by representat±ves of the SRC, Government of
Sudan, Wold Bank and Co-financing Agencies, and it was decided to include 10
new locomotives and reduce to some extent the amount of spare parts in the
project. Bank staff agreed with this position on the basis that the locomotives
were to replace certain existing units that were causing serious maintenance and
operational problems. During the Kuwait meeting, the number of freight wagons
in the project was also discussed and it was decided to reduce the procurement
from 500 to 400 units.
2.03      As approved by the Board, the project consisted of (i) establishment
of new diesel locomotive and wagon workshops, (ii) sleeper renewal of about 500
km of track, (iii) rail renewal on 344 km of track, (iv) completion of the rail
communications network, (v) purchase of 10 diesel locomotives, (vi) purchase of
400 wagons, (vii) purchase of locomotive spare parts, (viii) completian of the
Atbara Railway Training School, and (ix) technical assistance in workshop design
and organization. The total project cost, at time of appraisal, was estimated
at US$141.5 million with a foreign exchange component of US$72.1 million (51%).
Bank Group contribution to the foreign exchange expenditure was estimated at
US$20.0 million, or 2B%, and nearly all of the balance was to be financed by
Kuwait Fund, Arab Fund, Abu Dhabi Fund, and European Development Fund.
2.04      The primary ubjectives of the project were to (i) improve the
railways' operating efficiency, (ii) increase the capacity of the system,
enabling the SRC to carry anticipated larger volumes of traffic, and (iii)
overcome long-deferred basic track maintenance, the lack of which could in time
lead to closing of some sections. Also, SRC was to take such steps as necessary
to achieve a financial target of 6Z per annum on net fixed assets in use.
Management was to be strengthened mainly through expanded training opportuni-
ties.
2.05      The various components of the project are presented below:
(i)   Expansion and reorganization of workshop facilities to undertake
appropriate maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock,
particularly the former. A complete new diesel locomotive
workshop to be built in Sennar and a new wagon workshop to be
built in Port Sudan.
(ii) Completion of the telecommunications improvements needed for
more reliable communications between various st;tions on the
system.
(iii) Assistance to SRC in carrying out its program of track renewal,
particularly resleepering the 500 km Haiya-Sennar-El Obeid
section, provision of track maintenance equipment, relaying of
the 150 km Khartoum-Sennar Line and the 194 km Abu
Zabad-Babanousa Line, building of 19 crossing stations and
bridge strengthening and provision of flood protection.



(iv)  Provision of 10 diesel locomotives and 400 freight wagons.
Also, spare parts for maintenance of the present locomotive
fleet and completion of upgrading the wagon fleet.
(v)   Completion of the Central Railway Training School at Atbara.
(vi)  Technical assistance for design of the new Sennar Workshop and
for implementing new methods of work organization in this
facility.
2.06      Bank staff focussed much attention, during preparation and appraisal,
on the problem of inefficient utilization of locomotives. A consultant to the
Bank investigated the problem in the field during April to June 1976 and
concluded that th- maintenance of equipment was very poor and that this
deficiency was the most important single factor crippling the operation of the
railway. Australian consultants who had provided advisory services and counter-
part training of operating personnel in the mid seventies had similar views
concerning the shortcomings of equipment maintenance. Accordingly, Bank staff
were particularly interested in the development of a more effective training
program and the provision of spare parts and the modernization of workshops.
2.07      Three issues arose during the course of project preparation and
appraisal. The first, already discussed (Para 2.02), was whether new
locomotives were needed in the project. In the end, Bank staff agreed to the
inclusion of 10 new locomotives on the basis of evidence that 15 of the existing
units presented so many problems that they required replacement.
2.08      A second issue related to the problem of agreeing on operational
targets for SRC. In the early stages of discussion, SRC staff resisted the
targets proposed by Bank staff claiming they were unrealistic. Ultimately,
agreement was reached on targets which the Bank considered very modest by
international standards but even these goals were not attained during project
implementation. Specifically, the 1983 targets anticipated the following
changes over actual 1976 levels: Ci) availability of heavy main-line
locomotives, +25%; (ii) productivity per available heavy main-line locomotives,
+47%; (iii) availability of freight wagons, +1%; (iv) turnaround time for
general freight wagons, -43%; (v) average wagon load, +4%; (vi) productivity per
available wagon, +25%; and (vii) staff productivity, +76%.  In light of the low
1976 levels of efficiency, by international standard, the appraisal team
considered the attainment of these targets in a seven-year period very likely.
2.09      A third issue was the reluctance of SRC to accept expatriate technical
assistance in management and operations. The Bank has long felt that substan-
tial improvements are needed in the quality of management and operations. An
attempt to achieve improvements in this regard was made through the technical
assistance team from Australia. Resistance to the team's recommendations was
strong, however, and the attitude continues to prevail among SRC management that
no managerial or technical experts from outside the country could understand



Sudanese railway problems and offer realistic prescriptions for improvement.
Government ministries have passively accepted SRC's position an this issue.
2.10      At the time of appraisal, the intended completion date for the project
was June 30, 1982 and the closing date, December 31, 1982.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS
3.01      The Credit Agreement, Loan Agreement and Project Agreement were signed
on July 8, 1977, but the Credit and Loan did not become effective until January
12, 1979. The 18 month delay in the effectiveness of the Loan and Credit
occurred because of the long time required to conclude co-financing arrangements
including the final preparation of legal documentation. In particular, the Loan
Agreement between the European Development Fund (EDF) and the Sudan Government
was not signed until October 9, 1978; thereafter, additional time-consuming
procedures were required by EDF before the Loan and Credit could become
effective.
Project Implementation
3.02      All project components financed by the Bank Group's Loan/Credit, as
shown in Table 1, were not fully completed on the forecast completion date. Re-
sleepering of the 500 km Haiya-Sennar-El Obeid section could not be fully
completed because of increased sleeper costs, making it necessary to reduce the
length to 314 km; the remaining 186 km were deleted from the project in 1979.
Procurement of track maintenance equipment was accomplished ahead of schedule.
Signals and communications work was finished a year late as were procurement of
machinery and etjuipment for workshops, locomotive components for shops, roller
bearings and couplers (including nearly all installation) for 500 wagons, and
equipment and technical assistance for the Atbara training facility.
Procurement of spare parts was completed by June 1982.
3.03      So far as Bank-financed components were concerned, the major execution
problems involved the planned locomotive workshop at Sennar and the wagon shop
at Port Sudan. Unfortunately, the design of the Sennar Workshop had not been
prepared before project appraisal because all concerned considered the design a
rather simple and straightforward procedure that could be accomplished quickly.
During project implementation, however, it soon became evident that there were
fundamental conceptual differences on the design requirements. Therefore, much
time was required for design study during project implementation.  A so^io-
technical study was an essential preliminary effort because of widely varying
views on basic principles of workshop organization and operation. Although this
consultants' study was completed satisfactorily and a general layout for the
shop prepared, so much time was taken with this task that the Bank and SRC
agreed in early 1981 to delete the workshop from the project and use the funds
saved for preparation of a Railway V project. In actuality, the funds saved
were used for other project components, particularly spare parts.



- 7-
3.04      The wagon shop at Port Sudan, like the Sennar Workshop, had not been
fully designed before project appraisal, thus accounting for much time being
required for design during implementation. The reason for not designing the
shop before appraisal was, again, the expectation that this rather simple task
could be done quickly as part of project implementation. The design work for
the wagon shop was undertaken by SRC and, while simple, was done very slowly.
In addition, much time was taken by SRC in site preparation and selection of
contractors. For these reasons, no construction work on the shop had yet begun
as of December 1983. Materials had been procured, however, and in financial or
cost terms, this project component was about 60?0 completed at the end of 1983.
Since that time, construction work has continued and completion is expected by
December 1984.
3.05      Project components financed by other agencies are also presented in
Table 1 with indications of accomplishments as compared with appraisal
expectations. Three of the components had been completed as of December 31,
1983 though none was finished within the original schedule: the locomotives
were procured about a year late in October 1981, and the crossing stations
completed a year late in June 1983.  These delays can be attributed to the 18
month delay in effectiveness. Procurement of the 400 general-purpose freight
wagons was delayed over three years, a major cause being that an intended
supplier of 300 of the wagons went bankrupt making it necessary to retender.
The new wagons are part of the active wagon fleet and have presented to unusual
problems.
3.06      Four components of the co-financed part of the project were incomplete
in December 1983 because of various problems. Relaying of the Khartoum-Sennar
section was slow to start as a result of delayed delivery of materials; about
three-fourths of the cost was incurred in the purchase of materials but no civil
works had been accomplished at the end of 1983; completion is expected in late
1984. Relaying of Abu Zabad-Babanousa line was delayed because this task was to
be done with used rail from the Khartoum-Sennar line. In 1982, the work on the
Babanousa Line began with other materials and about two-thirds of the job was
finished at the end of 1983. Bridge strengthening and work on flood protection
was not begun because of the long time taken to complete a preparatory study of
requirements. Finally, delivery of locomotive spare parts was delayed because
the Kuwait Fund suspended, for a time, its disbursements when the Sudan
Government failed to service its debt to Kuwait; about 45% of the parts had been
delivered in December 1983.
3.07      Non-project investments required Bank approval under Section 4.04 of
the Project Agreement; the investments made by SRC outside the project, as shown
in Table 1, were accordingly agreed by the Bank. As shown in the Table, the 20
locomotives had been delivered, and the 160 km Rahad-Abu Zabad line relaid at
the end of 19(3. At the time, conversions to vacuum brakes had been done on
2,600 wagons and additional wagons were to be converted. Sixty nine double-deck
freight wagons for the Livestock Meat Marketino Corporation (LMMC) had been
delivered, financed under another Bank project (Credit 882-SU). Underframes for
train vans for LMMC had been delivered but the vans had not yet been built.



- 8 -
3.08      Performance of the suppliers of locomotives, various types of equip-
ment and spare parts was satisfactory. Suppliers of couplers, however, were
very slow in making delivery and this problem caused several months delay in the
implementation of the component for coupler replacement. Similarly, increased
prices and slow delivery of sleepers by a supplier accounted for a delay in the
resleepering work and caused higher costs. Performance of consultants on
studies was satisfactory.
3.09      Each of the financing agencies involved in the co-Financed project
conducted some field supervision of the project. For the most part, these
agencies sent separate supervision missions as it was difficult to arrange joint
missions for this purpose. The Bank, on a number of occasions, proposed joint
supervision missions with co-financers but only once was it possible to actually
undertake such a mission. Although the other agencies were interested in
participating in this type of joint effort, they found the problem of scheduling
them nearly impossible because of the limited size of their professional staff.
Notwithstanding the inability to carry out joint missions, the co-financing of
the project was implemented successfully. Communications between the agencies
were good and a spirit of cooperation prevailed.
Project Costs
3.10      Actual total project cost, as seen in Table 2 (excluding Part C, Non-
Project Investments), was US$87.6 million or 62% of the US$141.5 million
original or appraisal cost estimate. Foreign costs actually incurred were
US$60.3 million or 84% of the US$72.1 million appraisal estimate. For the
Bank-financed part of the project, the actual cost was US$27.1 million or 68% of
the US$39.8 million estimate at appraisal; since the realized foreign costs of
the Bank-financed part were virtually equal to the appraisal figure, the
differences between actual and estimated total cost of this part of the project
are found almost entirely in local costs.
3.11      In comparing actual and original estimates of project costs, certain
points of clarification are noted: First, certain project components were not
completed (see plans for completion, Section 3.06) and, therefore, the extent of
physical implementation represented by actual costs differs somewhat from that
of forecast costs which assumed completion. Second, substantial changes occured
in the exchange rate for the Sudanese pound in recent years as the value of the
£Sd fell by stages from US$2.500 at time of appraisal to US$0.769 in 1983, a
decline of 69%. Third, while reasonable efforts have been made to obtain
complete and accurate data on actual costs, it is recognized that the available
information is not fully complete with regard to costs representing items
outside the Bank-financed part of the project. Fourth, since certain elements
of the original project were deleted (see Table 1), and the funds used for other
project components, the physical composition of the project as executed differs
from that intended at appraisal. The quality of the estimates of actual costs
are deemed to be reasonably good for the Bank-financed components and fair for
non- Bank financed project items.



- 9 -
3.12      Among Bank-financed components of the project, resleepering the Haiya-
Sennar-El Obeid Line was the most costly, representing 47% of the cost of all
seven components. While the US$12.9 million cost is lower than the US$15.8
million original estimate, it should be noted that more than a third of the
planned track relaying was deleted from the project; the actual unit cost per
kilometer was 300 higher than the estimated unit cost.  The second most costly
component -- workshops and workshop equipment -- costing US$5.0 million was
substantially below the original estimate in part because of the deletion of the
locomotive workshop in Sennar and the incomplete status (Para. 3.04) of the
wagon workshop in Port Sudan.
3.13      For co-financed components of the project, wide differences are found
between actual and original estimates, as indicated in Table 2. The major item,
in terms of actual costs, was the procurement of main-line locomotives costing
US$19.1 million, which substantially exceeded the original estimate of US$13.7
million. Other major components were the track relaying elements, the US$14.6
million and US$11.9 million cost of which represent largely material costs since
the construction has not been done. The co-financed US$7.0 million cost of
locomotive parts is much lower than the original estimate because suspension of
the applicable loan for a time prevented procurement of all the parts planned
for purchase. The cost of 100 freight wagons, US$6.9 million, is not directly
comparable with the estimated US$14.4 million because the latter represents 400
wagons; the actual cost of the other 300 wagons was not available.
3.14      Non-project costs, also included in Table 2, show that the US$55.0
million for these investments represented twice the cost of the Bank-financed
part of the project. For all three categories -- Bank-financed, co-financed and
non-project investments -- the total cost is US$142.6 million, of which US$96.0
million were foreign costs.
Disbursements
3.15      Actual disbursements under the Loan/Credit as compared with the
appraisal estimates are shown in Table 3. Disbursements began in the third
quarter of FY1979, nearly a year and a half later than planned, because of the
18 month delay in the effectiveness of the Loan/Credit. Under the estimate,
disbursements were to be completed in the second quarter of FY1982 but only 51%
of the total amount was disbursed at that time. The final disbursement occurred
in the first quarter of FY1984 at which time US$276,960.03 equivalent was
cancelled. Of the total amount cancelled, US$249,207.56 applied to the Loan and
US$27,752.47 to the Credit. Thus, the total amount disbursed was
US$19,723,039.97 or 98.62% of the US$20.0 million Loan/Grant.
3.16      Performance of the Bank and Government on disbursements, once the
Credit/Loan had become effective, was satisfactory. It is significant that at
appraisal full disbursement was expected over a period of 17 quarters and that,
in the event, 98.5% of the total Loan/Credit, or virtually 100 percent of the
amount ultimately disbursed, was actually disbursed in that length of time.

IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
4.01      Principal objectives of the Railway IV Project, as previously noted,
were to improve operational efficiency and to provide additional capacity (and
prevent loss of capacity) to enable the system to carry expected increases in
traffic. NDuring the appraisal, it was found that there was considerable scope
for improving efficiency of railway operations and, accordingly, targets were
set in the project. The appraisal also forecast that both freight and passenger
traffic would increase substantially by 1983.
Traffic
4.02      The trends in total freight and passenger traffic from 1976 to 1983 as
well as the appraisal forecast through 1983 are shown in Table 4. Annual
freight traffic fell 52% during this period from 2.7 million to 1.3 million
tonnes while passenger traffic dropped 16% from 3.1 million to 2.6 million
passengers. In contrast to these dramatic reductions in actual traffic, the
appraisal forecasts for 1983 were 5.3 million tonnes of freight and 5.6 million
passengers. Thus for 1983, the freight forecast was more than four times the
actual freight carried while the passenger forecast was more than twice the
realized traffic.
4.03      Freight traffic by major categories and for certain commodities is
shown in Table 5. In 1976, imports represented the largest category of rail
traffic at 1.4 million tonnes or 53% of the total. By 1983, the import tonnage
fell to 0.8 million but this category of traffic as a percentage of 1983 total
rail traffic rose to 61%. Export traffic on the railway in 1976 was 0.8 million
tonnes or 3a% of total freight traffic. In 1983, such traffic dropped to 0.2
million tons which was only 15% of total freight. Local traffic declined
sharply but in 1983 was a larger proportion of total traffic than export
traffic.
4.04      Also shown in Table 5 are the 1976 forecasts by SRC of total traffic,
broken down by the major categories and certain commodities. These estimates
may be compared with actual traffic levels and it is clear that the forecasts
were far too optimistic. The appraisal team revised downward to some extent
SRC's total freight traffic forecast but did not, itself, make specific
estimates for traffic categories or specific commodities. The appraisal
forecast was based on data available from various Government agencies involved
in preparing the Six-Year Development Plan. A basic assumption in the forecast
was that the national development plan would be implemented and that the plan's
underlying policy goals would be realized. The appraisal team found SRC's
initial traffic forecast to be unduly optimistic and it was revised downward,
with the concurrence of the SRC, to conform with the team's forecast. The
principal shortcoming of the Bank's forecast was its implicit optimism regarding
the ability of the railway to improve service and efficiency.
4.05      The sharp decline in railway traffic from 1976 to 19B3 may be
attributed to a number of causes. One of these is the severe drought that
affected agricultural production in Sudan. However, since much of the
commercial agriculture production (cotton, oilseeds, sugar) is based on
irrigation, rail traffic was probably not severely affected by this factor.



- 11 -
Other causes of poor performance in the economy (project failures, lack of
funds, market declines, the pricing policies which discouraged cotton growers
etc.) undoubtedly affected railway export traffic adversely to some extent.
4.06      More significant than the above factors as causes of decline in
railway traffic were diversions to other means of transport. A petroleum
products pipeline between Port Sudan and Khartoum, with a capacity of 650,000
tonnes per year but recently operating at only 54Z of capacity, was built in the
mid-seventies and began operations in 1977, diverting substantial amounts of
bulk oil traffic from the railway. Table 5 indicates that bulk petroleum
import traffic on the railway fell from 542,000 tonnes in 1976 to 350,000 tonnes
in 1983. Truck transport had a greater impact on rail traffic than did the
pipeline as the fleet of trucks grew rapidly during the period and a major paved
road was completed between Port Sudan and Khartoum. Trucking entrepreneurs on
this route offered shippers quick delivery, resulting in rapid growth of truck
traffic. The railway in many cases was not able or willing to provide the
service shippers demanded and, therefore, much traffic diversion occurred.
4.07      The reason for the large traffic diversion from the railway to other
modes of transport, particularly to truck transport, has been the poor and
deteriorating quaLity of railway service. Although data on this factor are
lacking; it is known that tne time between the request for rail freight service
and the delivery of freigtt has often been several days, and at times much
longer, between the key points of Port Sudan and Khartoum. In contrast,
truckers can nearly always transport goods within two days between these
centers. Moreover, the truckers can deliver goods with greater reliability of
delivery time and less loss and damage. Trucking rates are, of course, substan-
tially higher than rail rates. This rate advantage of the railway is based on a
relatively low ESdO.04 average cost per ton-kilometer for rail freight and the
£SdO.07 to £SdO.10 average cost of truck freight on paved roads. Notwithstand-
the fact that trucking costs to the shipper are higher than rail rates the
shippers generally have attached so much importance to comparative quality of
service that substantial diversion of traffic from rail to road transport has
occured. Rather than concentrating on improving its service in these
competitive circumstanrres, the railway allowed its efficiency and quality of
service to deteriorate with consequent severe loss of traffic. Some of this
diversion would have occurred in any event but SRC's loss of traffic was
exacerbated by its poor performance.
4.08      The extent of traffic diversion from the railway to competitive
transport is suggested by the following data:
Tons ('000)
FY 1976        FY 1982         Increases
Total traffic through Port Sudan
Exports                                 1,278            989           -  23 %
Imports                                2,248           2,825           +  26 t

Imports                                 1,432            996           -  30 %
Total                                   2,243          1,300           -  42 %



- 1.2 -
It is evident that while overall traffic to and from Port Sudan rose by 8
percent, railway export/import traffic declined 73 percent. Thus, railway
deficiencies caused a large shift to other transport means. To some extent,
this change in Sudan is a reflection of a world-wide trend toward diversifica-
tion of transport in which each mode finds an economical role to play in a
multi-modal system. In Sudan, however, where transport involves the movement of
much low-value freight over relatively long distances it would seem that the
railway should be able to compete effectively for a large proportion of
available traffic. But it has failed to do so in recent years. Between Port
Sudan and Khartoum, the railway has an advantage over road transport in that
road transport rates are much higher than rail rates, partly because the road
length is significantly greater than the rail route via Atbara. The main causes
of the railway's inability to compete lie within the railway itself.
4.09      The railway clearly has not risen to the challenge of competing trans-
port, particularly road transport. Instead, it has provided poor quality
railway service, often involving delays and uncertainty in delivery of freight.
Lack of sensitivity and responsiveness to the needs and interests of shippers is
pervasive in the railways system. Underlying the unattractive service is
another basic problem -- the poor operating efficiency of the railway.
Operations and Operatinq Efficiency
4.10      Several measures of operating efficiency, as shown in Table 4,
indicate that for all but one measure, the trend has been negative or adverse.
In the one exception, the average net tonnes per wagon at first declined from
24.0 in 1976 to 22.7 but then rose to 29.3 in 1983. Other factors show
unsatisfactory results: Traffic units per employee have declined from 125,000
in 1976 to only 67,900 in 1983, the result of not only traffic decline but also
retention of an excessive number of personnel. During the same period, wagon
turn-around time increased for general freight wagons from 16.5 to 26 days, and
for oil tank wagons from 9.2 to 15 days. Tonne kilometers per available wagon
fell from 520,000 to 257,100 in this period.
4.11      Locomotive availability fluctuated widely during the 1976-83 period.
For heavy diesels, the range was 51% to 73% but, at the end of the period, was
only 59%, or 5% lower than in 1976. For light diesels, the range was even
wider, 46% to 82%, but the 1983 level 40 higher than that evidenced in 1976; the
experience with shunters was similar. Wagon availability in the period dropped
from 91% to 83%. In general, equipment availability during this seven-year
period was erratic and, in 1983, showed no improvement over 1976 except for
light diesels and shunters.
4.12      Given the above trends, it is not surprising that the SRC fell far
short of the modest operational objectives or targets for 1981 and 1983 as
agreed at time of appraisal. In only three instances were specific targets met
or exceeded: net tennes per wagon in 1981 and 1983, and the availability of
light diesel locomotives in 1981. The other 19 targets were not reached.



- 13 -
Following are some of the most serious shortfalls for 1983:
% Actual
Actual     Target     of Target
Traffic units/employee ('000)          67.9      220.0          31
Tonne-kms/available wagon ('000)      257.1      650.0          40
Locomotive kms/heavy diesel
locomotives ('000)                 43.0      100.0         43
Wagon turnaround time - general
freight wagon (days)               26.0       11.5        226
Wagon turnaround time - oil tank                                       t
wagons (days)                      15.0        9.0         167
In summary, the railway failed to achieve 19 of the 22 agreed operational
targets and, in fact, operating efficiency during the period 1981-83 was far
below the general level which the appraisal considered attainable within this
time frame.
4.13      The low and deteriorating operating efficiency experienced by SRC in
the late seventies and early eighties is attributed to several causal factors,
one of which has been the instability of top management. During the period from
1977 to 1984, five different individuals served as General Manager, one of them
occupying the position for two terms. Likewise, five men served as Chairman of
the SRC in this period. Many other replacements of high level SRC managers
occurred in these years. Moreover, in 1983, the headquarters offices of the
railway were moved from Atbara to Khartoum. The effect of all these managerial
changes on the quality of management and the efficiency of operations was
undoubtedly very negative.
4.14      At intermediate and lower staff levels in the SRC organization, a
severe morale problem developed in this period. The lack of continuity of top
management certainly contributed to reduced disciplina and poor morale at all
levels. Perhaps more important was the combined effect of more or less fixed
wage levels over extended periods and sharp increases in the cost of living.
One effect of this economic squeeze on employees was that a significant number
of staff took second jobs and their productivity on the railway declined.
4.15      Faced with increasing competition from enterprising trucking
companies, bus operators, pipelines and other threats to their normal traffic,
the railway needed to develop a strong market orientation and agressively persue
available traffic. In the new competitive environment, SRC has been very slow
to adapt and improve its service.
4.16      SRC management has been inclined to explain its shortcomings in
traffic and operations on the basis of factors beyond its control, such as a
lack of spare parts or funds to procure them, the poor condition of track
facilities or workshops or other physical components of the system. The Bank
and other financing agencies, however, have substantially assisted SRC in
alleviating physical limitations of the system and yet performance has not
improved. There seems little doubt that the primary constraints are institu-



- 14 -
tional and what is, therefore, required is substantial institutional change and
development through carefully targeted technical assistance, training and policy
changes.
4.17      One of the special covenants in the Credit/Loan docunents was that
"The Borrower shall ... cause its Central Bank to provide, on a monthly basis,
the foreign exchange required by SRC to procure and import the spare parts and
other materials needed for ensuring the proper operation and maintenance of its
facilities and equipment". The Borrower did not comply with this covenant and,
as a consequence, sufficient spare parts were not available to SRC on a
consistent basis over the years of project implementation. This deficiency
explains, in part, the erratic pattern of locomotive availability. Another
problem affecting the flow of spare parts to workshops was the ineffectiveness
of materials management. To alleviate this problem, technical assistance was
provided in this field under a UNDP-financed and Bank-executed special project.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
General
5.01      Accounting System - SRC has a computerized accounting system and
properly trained accounting staff. Accounts are closed within a reasonable time
after each year-end and financial statements prepared for audit approximately
four months later. In recent years, these have been delayed due to computer
breakdowns.
5.02      Costing System - Until 1981, SRC followed a global, or average, system
of traffic costing. During mid 1982, consultants were retained to change to a
point-to-point system and to train staff in its use. The initial exercise was
completed by end of December 1982 and SRC staff were to complete the
implementation. This has been done. However, the consultants were to return
after June 30, 1983, the fiscal year-end, to assist in the final phase of the
conversion. This has not been done as the Credit/Loan was closed on December
31, 1982, and no further funds were available.
5.03      Budgeting System - Approximately six months before the fiscal
year-end, projected operating and capital budgets are prepared for review by
management and the Board. The current year's projections are also revised at
this time. These reports are well prepared and contain considerable detailed
documentation.
Revenues and Expenses
5.04      The trends of SRC revenues and expenses are shown in Table 6.
Revenues remained at about £Sd 32 million in 1976, 1977 and 1978 but rose in
subsequent years, particularly in 1982 when they increased 39 percent over the
preceding year. The causes of these revenue increases in the early eighties
were increases in tariffs, especially the sharp rise in 1982. Since freight



- 15 -
traffic was virtually unchanged from 1981 to 1982 and passenger traffic dropped
13%, the improved 1982 revenue is explained entirely by tariff increases.
Working expenses changed very little in 1976-78 but rose substantially there-
after reaching £Sd 64 million in 1982, or more than double the 1916 level. Net
operating revenue, which was 'Sd 2.5 million in 1976, turned negative in 1978
and did not become positive until 1982 when it was nearly £Sd 9.0 million. Net
income, however, was negative for all years following 1976 when it was a modest
£Sd 228,000.
5.05      At appraisal, net operating revenues were expected to exceed the base
year amount for all forecast years, reaching £Sd 11.0 million in 1982. Net
income of £Sd8.0 million was forecast for 1982. The SRC fell far short of
achieving these forecast levels. The principal reasons for this unsatisfactory
financial performance were the decline in traffic and deterioration in operating
efficiency as explained above. At present, the size of the railway staff is at
least 50% greater than is required for efficient operations.
5.06      The sizeable tariff increases introduced in FY82 included (i)
increases, effective November 1, 1981, of 21.5% on wagonload consignments and
34v on passenger luggaqe, parcels and small consignments; (ii) increases,
effective March 20, 1982, of 21.5% on wagonload consignments, passenger luggage,
parcels and small consignments; and (3) increases, effective March 20, 1982, on
passenger services varying from 20% and 50% depending on class of service.
Moreover, additional equivalent increases in passenger tariffs were put into
effect on July 1, 1982. While tariff increases are essential during serious
inflation, the principal problem of SRC, so far as earned revenue is concerned,
has been the decline in traffic carried.
5.07      Certain export commodities (cotton, groundnuts, sugar and others) were
exempt from major tariff increases in 1981 and, in consideration of the SRC
movement of these items at below-cost rates, the Government began in March 1981
paying SRC a subsidy of £Sd 1.0 million per month. In addition, the Government
began in FY82 to provide SRC compensation of £Sd 476,000 per month to allow for
increases in the price of diesel fuel and to reimburse SRC for fuel taxes paid
by transport organization, such taxes being designed primarily to finance road
construction and maintenance.
5.08      Salaries represent about three fourths of working expense and it is
noteworthy that from 1978 to 19B2, this item rose sharply from about £Sd 20.0
million to £Sd 48.0 million. In the same period, freight traffic declined 26%
and passenger traffic dropped 15%. The size of the working force remained
nearly unchanged over this four-year period. While it is impractical to adjust
a railway labor force closely in accordance with traffic fluctuations, SRC's
rentention of nearly its entire staff in the face of a major drop in traffic was
unwarranted.
Balance Sheets
5.09      As indicated in the balance sheet data presented in Table 7, the trend
of SRC assets has been sharply upward in recent years, reaching £Sd 282.0



- 16 -
million in 1982, up from £Sd 123.0 million in the base year 1976. Equity,
however, fell severely in the same period, despite sizeable grants, because of
large negative amounts of retained earnings reflecting operating losses. In
1976, retained earnings were over £Sdl.O million but in 1982 the accounts show a
negative amount of £Sd63.0 million. In contrast, at appraisal, the forecast
levels of these accounts for 1982 were £Sd6.0 million for retained earnings and
£Sd69.0 million for equity.
Financing of SRC During Project Period
5.10      The sources of financing for SRC during the project period, as shown
in Table 8, changed dramatically from year to year. In 1976, some 21% of total
funds were obtained from operations. In 1979, 1980 and 1981, little or no
amount was available from this source. Because of large tariff increases in
1982, this source again contributed about 21% of the total revenues. As to the
uses of funds, interest on debt became an increasingly important factor, in 1981
accounting for over half of the total funds used. In 1982, however, the pattern
changed sharply as three-fourths of the funds used represented a net increase in
fixed assets. Bank overdraft amounts rose significantly during the 1976-82
period.
5.11      Appraisal forecasts of funds by source and use differed considerably
from realized levels, particularly for the years 1978-81. The improved
operating revenue of 1982, based on major tariff increases, made the actual 1982
Figures for funds from operations somewhat comparable to the forecast.
Otherwise the 1982 experience differs substantially from the forecast: the
increase in long-term debt as a source of funds was actually £Sd38.0 million,
vastly more than the £Sdl.O million that was forecast For that year; increase in
debt was in reality about three times that forecast; and the closing bank
overdraft in 1982 was over three times the forecast amount.
Financial Covenants
5.12      The Credit Agreement required that the Government provide or cause to
be provided funds sufficient to enable the SRC to meet its operating expenses
and debt-service obligations. The Borrower complied with this requirement by
supplying overdraft facilities and providing certain subsidies. SRC was
required under another provision to realize an annual rate of return not less
than six percent commencing in FY81; this has not been met. SRC did, however,
meet the obligation not to incur any debt outside the project unless net
revenues were at least 1.5 times the maximum debt-service requirement. SRC did
not fully compiy with the provision that audited accounts be submitted to the
Bank within nine months of the year end; the reason for this deficiency was a
breakdown of a computer which remained out of operation for a period of 14
months. As previously noted (Para 4.17), the Borrower also has not consistently
satisfied the requirement of the Credit Agreement that it issue or cause to be
issued all necessary foreign exchange for spare parts and other materials for
SRC operations and maintenance.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Performance of SRC
6.01      At time of appraisal, both freight and passenger traffic for FY76 had
reached somewhat higher levels than in the two previous years, a situation that
constituted a basis for some optimism about the railway prospects. The SRC
staff that produced this output was, however, relatively large and, accordingly,
productivity was low (Para 5.05). Operational management was regionalized to a
limited extent early in 1976 and this was seen by the Bank appraisal team as a
move in the right direction, tending to alleviate excessive centralization and
over-extension of managerial lines. Weakness was especially evident at the
middle level of management. For the mass of railway employees, a strong labor
union provided substantial protection from any actions of management regarded as
adverse to their interests. The Ministry of Transport maintained a general
overview of SRC operations but interfered little in its affairs.
6.02      At time of project completion, circumstances had changed considerably.
The Ministry of Transport in 1983 took a more active interest in the management
and operation of the railway although it was unable to effect any significant
improvements. Traffic had fallen to half the 1976 level but the size of the
staff remained about the same at some 31,000. Thus, productivity was down
sharply. In 1979 and 1980, the powerful and politically active railway union
exerted strong pressure on both SRC management and government for labor demands
and caused serious work stoppages. The union was abolished by the Government in
1980 but was later permitted to continue in a much weaker role. Morale of
employees generally had deteriorated, primarily because of declining real
income, with consequent adverse effects on productivity and quality of work.
Several top managers, including the general manager, had been in their posts
only a short time as a consequence of major changes in key personnel. In 1983,
the decentralization of SRC which had begun in 1976, was carried much further.
Regional managers with substantial line authority took up posts in five
centers. In the meantime, the SRC headquarters was moved from Atbara to
Khartoum. Five top officials resigned during this transition, thus depleting
the railway of scarce management resources; this scarcity was a key constraint
in implementing the decentralization. Another critical limitation in carrying
out this reorganization is the lack of essential communications facilities
required to manage SRC under a system with strong regional authority.
Institutional Development
6.03      In its analysis of the institutional problems of SRC, the appraisal
team identified needs for training to strengthen the quality of staff. In
addition, the Bank saw a need for technical assistance to conduct certain types.
of studies. Other institutional problems, such as the excessive size of the
labor force (Para 5.05), low morale, weaknesses in organization, and a general
lack of discipline in SRC were largely unaffected by the railway project.
6.04      The training component of the project, largely concerned with
completion of the Central Training School in Atbara, was aimed at strengthening



- 18 -
.he skills of the staff. Although the school was not fully completed at the end
of 1983, it had capacity For 750 students per year for training artisans,
traffic and stores staff, accountants and management. During the period January
through March 1983, some 300 skilled workers were provided various kinds of
training.
6.05      Another project component that will ultimately have a positive effect
or, the strength of the institution was the Sennar Workshop Study which made
recommendations on new work organization and workshop layout. Although the
effects of this study will not be felt until the Sennar Workshop is built, its
impact should, in time, be significant. In another field, the first phase of
the Traffic Costing Study was completed and its impact on rate-making and
revenue generation in future could be far-reaching. Additional study, however,
is required before the costing study's findings and recommendations can have
their intended effect. The performance of the consultants on these two studies
was satisfactory.
6.06      A major constraint on achieving progress in strengthening SRC
generally is the long-standing resistance of the Sudanese to accepting
expatriate technical assistance. They find it difficult to believe that
managerial and technical experts from outside Sudan can really understand their
problems and make useful contributions either as management advisors or
management staff. Until this attitude of resistance to expatriates is overcome,
progress in strengthening SRC management will be achieved only slowly.
VII. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
Benefits From the Project
7.01      The economic justification for the project as viewed at time of
appraisal rested largely on the benefits from anticipated growth in traffic
which, without the project, would otherwise move by higher-cost transport or not
at all.  In the appraisal, the principal project benefits were derived from the
difference between the relatively low £Sd.038 average cost per ton kilometer of
rail transport and the £5d.057 average cost per ton-kilometer of road transport,
excluding the cost of roads. Had the cost of the roads been included in the
road transport cost the project benefits would have been higher than estimated.
More than 80Z of the project investments were directed to improving SRC
efficiency and less than 20 (namely, purchase of wagons) to increasing the size
of the fleet. Thus, investments to increase operating efficiency were seen as
the principal means by which the railway would be able to handle the expected
increases in traffic. As of 1984, rail traffic, in fact, had not grown but
sharply declined (Para 4.02), and operating efficiency had not improved but
deteriorated (Para 4.12); it is apparent that the project had not thus far
realized its objectives.  Since the economic life of the major investments ini
the project is about 20 years, the re-evaluation should be based on actual or
anticipated results over that period of time. Indications are, however, that
railway traffic will not, over the period to 1990, increase above its present
level and thus is assumed to remain constant over the 1984-93 period.
Reevaluation of key project components is detailed below.



- 19 -
7.02      Resleepering the Haiya-Sennar-El Obeid Line has not, so far, produced
any benefits but in the future may yield some benefits in terms of higher
operating speeds, shorter turnaround time of wagons, fewer accidents and lower
maintenance costs. The increased line capacity, which the appraisal considered
necessary, will probably not be required for many years. Thus, giver the
traffic trend and outlook, the resleepering was premature. Without this
investment, however, the line would probably have become inoperable within 10
years causing diversion of traffic to higher-cost truck transport. As indicated
in paragraphs 4.07, road transport is currently twice as costly as rail
transport.
7.03      Relaying of the Khartoum-Sennar track was also intended to result in
higher operating speeds and lower maintenance costs. This work had a slow start
and completion is not expected until about the end of 1984. Benefits may be
realized from improved operating efficiency. Without this work, closure of the
line would probably be necessary in about 10 years with consequent diversion to
costly truck transport.
7.04      Relaying of the Abu Zeb'ad-Babanousa line, delayed because of non-
availability of used track from the Khartoum-Sennar works, was incomplete at the
end of 1983 and is not likely to be finished until the end of 1984. Benefits
from this relaying of track would be similar to those indicated above for other
track works. Traffic on the Abu Zabad-Babanousa line has been extremely light
and will probably continue to be meager, thus, raising the question whether the
line should be abandoned. The route has been important for the movement of
livestock and groundnuts eastward from producing areas in western Sudan, but the
possibilities of closing the line and employing road transport requires study.
7.05      The aoesel locomotive workshop at Sennar included in the original
project was deleted and it is uncertain when the facility will be designed and
built. Construction of the wagon shop at Port Sudan was delayed and will
probably not be completed until 1985. When ready, the workshop should
contribute to higher availability of wagons and improved operating efficiency.
7.06      The 400 wagons and 10 locomotives purchased under the project were
expected to increase trans'ort capacity to handle anticipated traffic growth.
Since the trend of traffic hab 'Pen sharply downward, the additional capacity
was not needed. As to the future, the outlook for rail traffic is not promising
and, accordingly, the added capacity represented by these wagons and locomotives
will not be required for several years. The addition of new equipment did, of
course, enable SRC to upgrade the quality of the wagon and locomotive fleets.
Without this addition, efficiency would have fallen even Further than the low
level already evidenced which tended to make operations more efficient. Thus
far, however, adverse factors have caused operating efficiency to decline. The
quality of the equipment fleets in the future may be better than without the
project, but this will depend on the effectiveness of workshops. Since the
Sennar Workshop was indefinitely postponed, the outlook for locomotive
maintenance is poor. In summary, it is difficult to anticipate more than
minimal benefits from the wagon and locomotive components.



- 20 -
7.07      The benefits from other project components may be stated briefly:  Ci)
track maintenance equipment and signal and telecommunications works were
necessary investments for the railway to continue functioning without undue
interruptions and slow-downs; (ii) bridge strengthening and flood protection,
although not yet accomplished, are similarly required for continued operations;
(iii) crossing stations, which were to increase line capacity, were in fact
premature in light of traffic trends and outlook; (iv) locomotive spare parts
were vital, preventing locomotive availability from falling to unacceptable
levels; (v) roller bearings and couplers were beneficial in reducing service
interruptions and wagon maintenance; and (vi) training and technical assistance
components contributed to improving the quality of staff, particularly in work-
shops.
7.08      Investments not included in the project and undertaken during the
project period were mostly unnecessary or premature, although they were
consistent with the financial covenant (Section 4.04 of the Project Agreement)
(Para 5.12). Among these investments, the major item, procurement of 20
locomotives, w-as clearly not economically justified for the reasons discussed
above related to locomotives financed under the project. The conversion of
wagons to air brakes was also premature but they may in the future contribute
somewhat to improved operations. Relaying Rahad-Abu Zabad was probably
justified on the same basis as presented above for relaying on the Khartoum-
Sennar line, assuming that the continued use of the line is economically sound.
Procurement of wagons and parts for LMMC was justified for livestock movement.
Economic Rate of Return
7.09      At appraisal, the economic rates of return estimated for principal
components of the project at appraisal, as shown in Table 9, ranged from 15% to
65% with a 27% return estimated for the total project. The underlying economic
rational for these estimates was that Ci) the investments would result in
improvements in operating efficiency which would, in effect, increase transport
capacity, (ii) the increase in capacity was necessary because of anticipated
growth in traffic, (iii) without the project, this traffic could only be handled
by road transport at relatively hiqh cost (Para. 4.06), and (iv) the savings in
rail transport cost over road transport cost constitute the benefits associated
with the rail investments.
7.10      Re-evaluation of the project takes into consideration the fact that
rail traffic in recent years did not increase but declined substantially and the
current view that this traffic is expected to rise in the next few years and is
assumed to remain at the 1983 level in tne late 1980s and early 1990s.
Therefore, the project benefits, as viewed in 1984, are far less than were
anticipated at appraisal. Accordingly, the economic rate of return on the total
project would be much less than originally estimated and probably about 1%.
Nevertheless, the returns on track works are positive because, without the track
works on these lines, they would have to be closed in the 1990s and all traffic
consequently would be diverted to high-cost road transport. However, were



- 21 -
the rail traffic to continue declining, rather than stabilize as assumed, the
economic rate of return on the track works would be lower than calculated.
7.11      The lack of traffic growth in the late seventies and early eighties
does not mean that the investments in the project are of no value. Without
them, operating efficiency presumably would have been even worse than was
experienced in the recent past. Moreover, since the lines for which track work
was done would probably have been inoperable in 10 years without this work, most
of the railway network would have been shut down by the early 1990s with all
traffic on those lines diverted to higher cost road transport. Assuming that
continued operation of the present network will, in the 1990s, be economically
justified, the track work undertaken in the project would have been justified at
that time. The track work, however, should have been deferred several years,
tolerating the consequent operational inefficiencies in the interim, even though
these problems would have aggravated an already serious difficulty in providing
adequate rail service to the public and in competing with road transport for
traffic.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      After many years of near-monopoly control of traffic, the railway, by
the mid seventies, found itself in a new world of competitive transport as both
road haulers and a new pipeline vied for the traffic between Khartoum and Port
Sudan. Rather than concentrating on improving its service in these competitive
circumstances, the railway allowed its efficiency and quality of service to
deteriorate with consequent severe loss of traffic. Some of this traffic
diversion would have occurred despite the best of efforts by the railway, but
SRC's loss of traffic was exacerbated by its ooor performance.
8.02      The Bank, in 1976, recognized that the railway was facing increasing
competition as indicated by the near completion of the pipeline and the progress
being made at that time in the construction of a paved road between Khartoum and
Port Sudan. While correctly noting that these developments would deprive the
railway of some traffic, the Bank misjudged the magnitude of the traffic
diversion that would soon occur. Subsequent events demonstrated that Bank staff
were much too sanguine about the railway's ability to adapt its operations and
services to the new competitive environment.
8.03      The Railway IV Project was aimed primarily at increasing the capacity
of the railway system to handle an expected substantial growth in traffic.
However, instead of virtually doubling its freight traffic by 1983 as expected
at appraisal, the tonnage was cut in half. Consequently, the increased capacity
was not necessary in 1983 nor will it be needed for an extended period in the
future.
8.04      For the most part, the project was designed to achieve an increase in
transport capacity by improving operating efficiency. Thus, track improvements
were to permit higher operating speeds, spare parts and improved workshops to
raise the availability of locomotives and wagons, training to increase



- 22 -
productivity, and so forth. Disregarding increases in capacity, there were
other good reasons to seek improvements in operating efficiency:  to reduce
costs and improve service.  Unfortunately, despite the project, operating
efficiency by 1983 had declined and the near-term outlook was that little
improvement could be expected.
a        8.05      The track improvements, representing 50% of total project cost, were
premature but would have been required, assuming these lines are economically
viable, in the late 1980s for the lines assisted to -ontinue functioning.
Without such improvements, operating efficiency on the weak lines during the
1980s would have become progressively worse and the lines would probably have
ceased functioning in 10 years.
i        8.06      New locomotives and wagons, representing 16% of total project cost or
30% of total investments in SRC during the project implementation period, were
not economically justified. In light of traffic trends, a need for this
additional capacity is not expected for a considerable number of years.
8.07      A major project component -- construction of a new diesel locomotive
workshop in Sennar -- was deleted from the project after delays in preparing the
design made it necessary to either delete the component or extend the project
closing date a number of years. In view of increased project costs and problems
associated with the workshop design, it was agreed to eliminate the workshop
from the project.  Long delays also occurred in designing the Port Sudan Wagon
Workshop. These experiences indicate that it would have been preferable to have
ihad the detailed design of such facilities completed before project appraisal.
8.08      The principal reasons for the unsatisfactory performance trends of the
railway in recent years are the (i) frequent changes in top management; (ii)
poor morale and productivity of railway staff; (iii) shortages of qualified
managerial and technical staff; (iv) failure of the Government to make
available, on a consistent basis, foreign exchanqe for spare parts; (v) failure
of SRC to institute a strong marketing department; and (vi) increased availabi-
lity of competing means of transport. Future performance of the railway will
depend on the ability of SRC to cope with these problems. To this end,
consultants have been retained under Credit 1153-SU to prepare an Action
Programme for SRC. This study involves a review of rolling stock requirements;
material management, civil works, signals and telecommunication, finance,
management, and an implementation strategy.

1/ Length of line resleepered was reduced from original distance.
2/ Not completed.
3/ Reflects some materials costs for Port Sudan wagon shop which was not
completed. Excludes Sennar Workshop deleted from project.
4/ Rate of return is low because the project component was several years
premature. Rates of return are based on the consideration that without the
track works on these lines, they would have to be closed in the 1990s and
all traffic would consequently be diverted to higher-cost road transport.
5/ Rate of return not calculated because component has not been completed but
the indications are that the economic return would be far below the forecast
level, perhaps in the order of 10 percent.
6/ Rate of return negative because the wagons were not needed.
7/ Overall return not calculated because it is impractical to quantify benefits
of some components but the return would probably be below 8X. If investment
costs of all components are considered along with the benefits of track
works alone, an economic return of 1X is derived.
