outcome of the Financial\n            Institutions Development Loan is rated as satisfactory with\n            sustainability likely. Key lessons learned follow. The\n            implementation of reforms in the banking sector was\n            successful due to successive Government's ownership of\n            the program and the commitment to move to a market based\n            economy. The twinning worked well in this case and proved to\n            be an effective mechanism for transferring know-how.\n            Important aspects for successful twinning are clear\n            expectations, sound work schedules, realistic pace, close\n            and candid monitoring, and the full involvement of senior\n            management of the local bank. Institution building is a\n            medium to long-term process requiring significant change in\n            minds and systems and significant training (the Bank was\n            over ambitious in estimating the time needed to implement\n            the comprehensive policy and institutional development\n            reforms). Bank's procurement procedures were perceived\n            as being complex, rigid, and not fully suitable for dealing\n            with procurement of complex software based information\n            technology. In hindsight, it may have been better to have\n            stayed with the original project proposal to finance the\n            basic, initial automation needs of the banks and leave the\n            financing of fully integrated systems for the future, at\n            which time they could have been financed directly by the\n            banks which would have had more flexibility to choose the\n            supplier and approaches to fit their individual needs."}, "docdt": "1999-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
