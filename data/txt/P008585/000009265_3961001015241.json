main objectives of the project are\n            to support financial sector development as a key element of\n            the Government's Economic Transformation Program\n            through:  (i) actions on the policy, regulatory, and\n            institutional fronts; and (ii) modernization and ultimate\n            privatization of existing banks. The project includes two\n            components:  (i) a quick-disbursing policy component; and\n            (ii) an institutional development component.  The major\n            policy reforms urgently needed to permit a rapid transition\n            toward a modern market-oriented, mostly private, financial\n            system must be accompanied by significant, concerted efforts\n            to develop efficient institutions and skilled staff.  There\n            is consequently a strong interrelation between the two\n            components and the success of the reform program will\n            closely depend on their timely joint implementation.  The\n            policy component is articulated around four elements: (i)\n            improvements of financial policies; (ii) modernization of\n            banking legislation; (iii) bank restructuring; and (iv)\n            development of financial markets.  The core of the\n            institutional development component relates to a\n            comprehensive program of technical assistance and automation\n            programs for banks aimed at their institutional\n            strengthening and privatization."}, "docdt": "1991-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
