MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPHENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE DENOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR A NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT
1.         The folloving memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Democratie Republic of Madagascar for SDR 18.6 million (US$ 24.0
million equivalent) is subm.tted for approval.  The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms vith 40 years maturity and vould help finance the first seven
year phase of a long-term support program to strengthen national agricultural
research and make agrieultural research more responsive to the needs of
producers. Parallel financing in the amount of US$ 10.4 million equivalent vould
be provided by Franc., the Pederal Republic of Germany, the United States of
America, Switzerland and the International ?und for Agricultural Development.
2.         Backkround:  Since independence, Madagascar's economy has followed
a rocky road: from modest growth until 1972, a sharp deterioration between 1980
and 1982, followed by financial stabilisation from 1983 to date, vhen real GD?
started groving again, althougi per capita GDP continued to decline through 1987
due to fast population growth.   A heavy external debt burden ls severely
constraining economic recovery. The agricultural sector, vhich vas severely hur:
by th. economic decline, in particular as a result of market controls and
consumer subsidies on fooderopa, and nationalisation of th. export crop trade,
is looked upon as the engin. to stimulate future economic grovth.  Performance
of the sector, the most Important contributor to the national economy, has been
poor saince the mid-1970s. In the 1975-78 and 1984-86 periods, production growth
vas insufficient to ke.p up vith population growth and between 1979 and 1983,
agricultural production did not grov at all. Th. problems have been most serious
inm (a) the stagnation in rice, (b) the very serions decrease in edible oIla
production, (c) the decline in cof fe. exports, and (d) the disappearance of
Malagasy beef from external markets. Adjustment measures taken since 1986,
supported by four sectoral adjustment Credits, appear to have led to a bottoming
out of the economic decline.  By 1990, Madagascar, is expected to be self-
sufficient again in rice, the country's main staple, and the Governm.nt has
refoeussed its strategy in the agricultural sector and nov supportss  (a) moving
towards a market system as a means of Improving producer incentives«, (b)
vithdrawing government services from activities better performed by others, and
(c) lfimiting public expenditure outlays to essential services (research and
extension) and rehabilitation and maintenance of rural infrastructure (rural
roads and irrigation n.tworks).
3.         Agricultural Researchs   Before 1974, agricultural research in
Madagascar vas conducted by a multitude of French research institutes, each vith
its own network of résearch stations (31 in total).  Upon the creation of the
National Agricultural Research Institute (FOFIFA), all ree.arch efforts vere



" 2 -
brought under one umbrella.   Presently, Madagascar bas only 50 national
scientista,  14 of vhio   ro tu management poeitton.   ln 1983t Government
requested tic International Service for National Agricultural aRosearch (ISNAR)
to critically evaluato FOFIFA'o ongoitag resoarch effort,  Folloving ISNARIs
recomundations FOFIFA ch ag.d it. organisational structure towards à nationally
coordinated  multi-disciplinary  commodty  research  ptogram  approach,  and
r.gionaliued Lt. station network. Rlsearch it still characteriaed by: (a) poorly
coordlnated donor interventions, (b) a focua on station resoarch rather than on-
fagm reoearch, (c) poor linkages vith extension, (d) severe under-funding, (o)
outdated and bad'ly maintained r earch lnstallations  nd (f) poor research
qu.lity. la 1988, FOFIFA prepared with assistance from ZSNAi a 15 y,sr
masterplan for agricultural rosearch, amtlng at a rofoeusstng of research
prtoritiee sad improvtng 4tt  quality and efficiency through à heavy mphw.il on
human resources dev.lopment, a further roorganiuatton of FOFIFA and
rationalisation of ltt research station netvork (to b. reducod to 17).
4.          Madagascar requires stgntftcant incroases la agricultural production
to keep pace wlth population grovth, provide addttional employment, gonerate a
better standard of living, sad £=croese  *nd dtv.rsify oxports.   The great
dtv.r.ity La topography, agro-climates, population deor ty and farsmig systeus
nocessitates a strongthenang and régionalisation of adaptive research capacity.
To moet these challenges, a atrong national research system te a prerequisite.
Such a syste  should b. responsive to far.r constraints and provide ne»
tochnology to improve food security, incrteaa and diversify export erntngs, amd
tncrease  _all farmer tncome.  Ooverment has shown lts williagness to follow
those n» directions but requtrés resources boyond ltt own, and more coordLnstton
amongst donoro.
5.          Rattonale for IDA Involmraentt   IDA's commttment to asststtng
Governmaet bas besn demontrated tb ough the Agrieultural Institutions Technical
Assistanco Project (Cr. 1249-MAG) and itt follow-up, the Second Agricultural
Institutions Devolopment Project (Cr* 1709-HMG) under which FOFIFA vas assisted
in improving Lt.  anagement and in preparing thc propos.d project, and under
which an Agrieultural Extenston Pilot Progrm lt  boeng funde, aimng among
others at strengthentg links betweon *xtension and rosearch.  Furtier support
would b. a continuation of the IDA asstitance (ineludtng itt role tn factlitattng
aid coordinatton) essential for assuring mnorasses Lu agrilultural producttvity.
6.          Proelet OblectLves_   The prtucipal objective«  of the Projeot aret
(a) to foeus on priority multi-disciplinary and nattonally coordtnated rosearch
programa with a significant likelihood of high sud early returne to investment;
(b) to develop technologies that contribute to increasod farmer income, in
particular of smsllholders, through a greater responstvenesa of research to real
farm.r constratnts (farmor participation ln research program formulation,
"recherche dtalogu*O'); (a) to tncresse res.arch efficiency through an increased
emphasis  on  off-station  resoarch,  mprovemonts  in  research  quality,  a
reorganisation of POFIFA, changiug the composition and skills mix of FOFIFA staff
(reductng the number of unskilled staff and increaaing the number of rosearch
scientists), rationalising the research station notvork, stabilizing research
funding, sad improved donor coordination; and (d) to strengthen the linkages
betveen research and extension. Over a 7 year period, the project would support



- 3 -
ressarch programs on rice, tubers, maize, greirndnuts, cotton, sugar, coffee,
vanilla, pepper, moat, milk, inland fisheries, fuelwood, industrial wood, soil
conservation (agro-forestry>, national forest management and conservation,
agrieultural maechanization (animal traction), post-harvest technology, on-farnm
irrigation efficiency, and 6 regional farming systema research programs.
7.          Proioct Descriptions To support these programs, the project vould
(a) provide for institutional strengthening, research quality and adaptability
improvement, human resources devolopmont (including the improvement of the
training capabilities of the Agrieultural Faculty of the University of
Antananarivo (ESSA)), and improved researchlextension linkagest (b) rehabilitate
or construct, and equip FOFIFA's contral facilities in Antananarivo, 8 Regional
Rosearch Contera, 4 Research Stations and 5 Sub-stations; and (c) provide for
a donor funding coordinating mechanim. The project, to be carried out over 7
years, provides funde for civil vorks; vehicles, agricultural and laboratory
equipment; training; technical assistance; and incremental operating coste. The
total cost of the project is estimated at US$70.6 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of US$22.6 million (32%). A breakdown of coste and
the financing plan are shoewn in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of diabursements, and the disbursemint achedule are shown in Schodule B.
A timetable of key project processing ovents and the status of Bank Group
operations in Madagascar are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is al80 attachod. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7735-MAG dated 14ay 19, 1989,
48 aleo attached.
8.          Agreed Actionst  Assurances vere obtained from the Government on
the folloving:  (a) a revis'fun of FOFIFA etatutesg (b) the roorganization of
FOFIFA; (c) the recruitment of professional accounting services; (d) Government
budget allocation for research to meet FOFIFA's recurrent operating costs and
working capital requirements in relation to the sizs of the program; (e) tho
creation of a Steering Coammittee for Agricultural Research Funding through which
all donor participation vould be channeled; (f) rationalisation of the research
station network; (g) Issuance of land titles for FOFIFA's research stations; snd
(h) post-graduate courses for scientiste at the agricultural faculty of
Antananarivo University.
9.          Benefites   Project benefits are expected f roms (a) accelerated
agricultural productivity and grovth, (b) higher returns to farmers and increased
employment, sad (c) increased foreign exchange earnings. Most of these benefits
are indirect and obtained through improved resoarch priority setting, improved
research quality sad greater résearch efficiency (earlier availability of higher
returns to investment at less cost).
10.         Riskes  The principal rieks of the project are:  (a) adequacy of
budgetary funding levels and mechanism; (b) effectiveness of FOFIFA organisation
and management; (c) possible lack of qualified staff by non-adherence to
recruitment sad human resource development criteria; (d) non-adherence to agroed
priorities and balance in research programs; (e) relevance and adoption of
