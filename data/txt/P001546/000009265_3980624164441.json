   Project in Madagascar was achieved. The Bank performance was\n            mixed. The project was technically innovative and consistent\n            with the Government strategy for the sector. The frequent\n            change of Bank task managers (five times) for the project\n            affected continuity and hindered the smooth execution of the\n            project. Overall, however, the Bank performed satisfactorily\n            during project supervision through its skills mix, and the\n            handing over of responsibility for project supervision to\n            the Resident Mission in Madagascar. The National Center for\n            Applied Research for Rural Development (FOFIFA)\n            management's performance was satisfactory, although it\n            did not have the full support of the Ministry of Research to\n            implement some of the more sensitive staff reduction\n            programs. In spite of this, it successfully completed the\n            main aspects of its institutional strengthening program and\n            pressed on with the decentralization of staff to regional\n            centers with some success. In particular, the Government and\n            FOFIFA must be commended for taking some tough and sensitive\n            personnel decisions in the second half of the project which\n            greatly helped to turn it around. Without the staff\n            retrenchment program, the sustainability of FOFIFA would\n            have been at very great risk."}, "docdt": "1998-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
