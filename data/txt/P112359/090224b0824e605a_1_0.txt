                         The objective of the project is to provide additional transport capacity and reduce transport time between the less developed western region of southwest China and the
                         relatively more developed Pearl River Delta region.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Considering implementation progress as well as the rapid development of all cities along the new rail line, the overall project objectives of providing additional transport capacity and
                         reducing transport time between the less developed western region of southwest China and the relatively more developed Pearl River Delta Region are expected to be achieved. The
                         construction work for this major project is progressing well, with completion expected by year end. The new line between Litang and Wuzhou commenced commercial service on April
                         18, 2014. The Zhaoqing - Wuzhou section is expected to be operational by the end of December 2014. Most civil works including earth work, bridges and tunnels are completed. The
                         remaining work is related with completion and final adjustment of track laying, electrification, signaling and communication, followed by a period of testing and commissioning. This
                         project includes several exceptional bridges and tunnels even by international standards.
