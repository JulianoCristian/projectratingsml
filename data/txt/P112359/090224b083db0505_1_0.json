        to development outcome was low or negligible, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: unified control\n            over railway program development, project design, financing,\n            and implementation is a recipe for overall project success\n            even when the Bank\u2019s financial contribution is relatively\n            marginal. The use of agglomeration benefits is essential for\n            structuring a railway project as an increasing number of\n            companies became more closely connected. A large and linear\n            infrastructure investment projects calls for: (a) a good\n            preliminary design; (b) strict control over compliance with\n            standards and specifications and quality control; (c)\n            reliable and responsible contractors; (d) meticulous\n            planning of activities; and (e) timely land acquisition.\n            Understanding and addressing passenger needs in the context\n            of door-to-door connectivity and adequate urban planning\n            will be critical to achieve the full impact of the high\n            speed rail network."}, "docdt": "2015-12-03T23:37:03Z"}
