The change is to reflect in the\n            project documents the incorporation of the NanGuang Railway\n            Company Preparation Group as the Nanning-Guangzhou Railway\n            Company Limited and the GuiGuang Preparation Group as the\n            Guiyang- Guangzhou Railway Company Limited. This change,\n            anticipated in the original project appraisal document,\n            reflects the creation of new legal entities, as part of the\n            project implementation structure, in line with the practice\n            in other recent railway projects in China."}, "docdt": "2011-08-02T00:00:00Z"}
