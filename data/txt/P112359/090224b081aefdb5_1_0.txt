                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to provide additional transport capacity and reduce transport time between the less developed western region of southwest China and the
                         relatively more developed Pearl River Delta region.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Considering implementation progress as well as the rapid development of all cities along the new rail line, the achievement of the development objective appears likely at this point.
                         Construction work for this major project is progressing well, in line with the schedule indicated in the Project Appraisal Document with completion of the new line expected in 2014.
                         Most civil works including earth work, bridges and tunnels are completed. The next phase includes track laying, electrification, signals and communications, followed by a period of
                         testing and commissioning.
