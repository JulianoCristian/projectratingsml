 Wuzhou, 237km) was placed into commercial service on April 18, 2014 while that in Guangdong province (Wuzhou-Zhaoqing 165 km) was placed in
 commercial service on December 26, 2014. The project is meeting its overall performance development objectives, although with a different mix of
 traffic than originally anticipated (more pairs of passenger trains, no freight traffic) . NanGuang started to operate with 18 pairs of trains in December,
 but in order to meet the demand, 3 and 10 pairs of services were added in January and March 2015 respectively. With 31 pairs of passenger trains, the
 project exceeds the level projected by 2030. Average travel time for direct express trains is in line (156 minutes) with the target (170 minutes). There is
 substantial demand for those train tickets with an average high occupancy rate of 91 percent. Additional pairs are expected to be put in service
 accordingly in May 2015. Freight train operation has not been introduced so far and no timeline has been set for their introduction.



 All contracts under the project have now been awarded, and the delivery of goods against all contracts has been completed. The project will close as
 scheduled on June 30, 2015.

 Overall Comments
 Project implementation is proceeding in line with expectations, with completion on time and strong initial traffic. The section in Guanxi province
 (Litang-Wuzhou, 237km) was placed into commercial service on April 18, 2014 while that in Guangdong province (Wuzhou-Zhaoqing 165 km)
 was placed in commercial service on December 26, 2014. The project is meeting its overall performance development objectives, although with a
 different mix of traffic than originally anticipated (more pairs of passenger trains, no freight traffic) . NanGuang started to operate with 18 pairs of
 trains in December, but in order to meet the demand, 3 and 10 pairs of services were added in January and March 2015 respectively. With 31
 pairs of passenger trains, the project exceeds the level projected by 2030. There is substantial demand for those train tickets with an average
 high occupancy rate of 91 percent. Additional pairs are expected to be put in service accordingly in May 2015. Average travel time for direct
 express trains is better (156 minutes) than the original target (170 minutes). At this point freight train operation has not been introduced and no
 timeline has been set for their introduction, hence the value of 0 at this point in time. CRC wants to optimize the traffic mix, giving priority to
 passenger traffic at this point in time. The combined number of pairs of trains is higher than the target.
