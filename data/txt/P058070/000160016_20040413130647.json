The project repairs small\n            irrigation schemes and rural roads, and builds community\n            buildings and drinking water wells. To reduce accelerated\n            soil erosion, restrict construction to the dry season,\n            retain ground vegetation, retain channel/drainage\n            reservation, turf exposed surfaces quickly, and create\n            contour strips/steps as slope breakers. To prevent water\n            logging and flooding, rehabilitate borrow areas, reshape\n            excavated areas, and design proper drainage. Retain ground\n            cover to reduce soil erosion, dump vegetation and scraped\n            earth at suitable location and compact, and avoid clogging\n            natural drainages. Use a clay cut off wall and ruble packing\n            and toe filler to stem seepage. Retain natural vegetation\n            and avoid cutting large trees. Mobilize community to prevent\n            encroachment, fires, and tree cutting in catchment areas.\n            Control dust by water and cover excavated soil material\n            during transport. Train farmers in water management,\n            conservation agriculture, organic farming, and integrated\n            pest management. Create awareness of proper handling,\n            storage, and disposal of pesticides and insecticides. Locate\n            wells away from agricultural lands and drainages, dumping\n            grounds, latrines, and saline deposits to prevent\n            groundwater contamination from runoff and salinization."}, "docdt": "2004-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
