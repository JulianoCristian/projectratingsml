unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was un-evaluable, the Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            lending for land-based assets in a protracted conflict\n            affected situation, characterized by massive displacement,\n            and should be sequenced within a broader social development\n            framework that balances individual needs with equity aims.\n            The term \u2018post-conflict\u2019 should be used sparingly in the\n            absence of a negotiated peace agreement and World Bank\n            projects should accordingly exercise caution in project\n            design in situations where conflict may re-emerge. There is\n            a tension between responding to the immediate needs of\n            conflict affected populations and the use of a community\n            driven development model to respond to these needs in fluid\n            or highly mobile environments.
