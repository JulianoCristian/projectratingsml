Lessons learned from the\n            project: Delivering assistance directly to communities and\n            forming strategic alliances between key stakeholders are\n            critical determinants of project success in conflict\n            affected situations. Anchoring a project at the provincial\n            level in Sri Lanka increases ownership at the local level\n            and facilitates project implementation. Innovation and\n            flexibility in project design, initial piloting of project\n            activities, and close and competent supervision, are\n            important if projects are prepared quickly in conflict\n            affected situations. In a conflict situation securing\n            technical assistance to build local capacity is critical.\n            Selecting villages in poorer areas and activities targeted\n            to poor and landless people, ensure benefits of\n            irrigation-led projects reach communities and families most\n            in need of assistance. Livelihood support to women's\n            groups can make a project more inclusive and has tremendous\n            potential for alleviating poverty. Community Based\n            Organizations (CBOs) need sufficient training and technical\n            back-up to sustain project created assets. Continuous\n            monitoring and assessing of project processes and impact\n            with beneficiary participation, should be part of project\n            monitoring and evaluation and MIS systems. It is not\n            sufficient to have technical auditing without a clearly\n            defined practical quality management system in place."}, "docdt": "2005-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
