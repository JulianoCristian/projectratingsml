Sri\n            Lanka\u2019s 30 year war between the government and the\n            Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam devastated nearly\n            two-thirds of the population of its Northern and Eastern\n            provinces. People could no longer access markets as they\n            once had and the transport of goods virtually came to a\n            halt. The International Development Association financed the\n            Reawakening Project to adopt a community-driven development\n            approach. Over 500 villages in the conflict-affected areas\n            have been organized into community-based institutions and\n            were benefiting from new community and productive\n            infrastructure. More than 35,000 hectares of irrigated land\n            has been brought back to cultivation through the\n            rehabilitation of seven major irrigation schemes that had\n            been damaged by the conflict, benefiting more than 55,000\n            farm households. Over 10,000 small community groups started\n            saving schemes, developed their business plans, and accessed\n            credit to upgrade the vocational and life skills for jobs\n            and to set up micro-enterprises."}, "docdt": "2009-09-17T09:14:01Z"}
