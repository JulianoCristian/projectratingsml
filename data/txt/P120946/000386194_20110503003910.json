Public\n            Investment Reform Operation Program for Vietnam is to\n            support one of the emerging priorities of the Socio-economic\n            Development Strategy (SEDS) 2011-2020, namely to raise\n            productivity of investment. Improving the efficiency of\n            investment has emerged as one of the key economic priorities\n            in Vietnam. The country has already achieved rapid economic\n            growth and fast poverty reduction over the last twenty\n            years. However, there is a growing concern that the momentum\n            of a growth strategy that is largely based on factor\n            accumulation may have run its course. Vietnam has one of the\n            highest investments to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratios\n            in the world, averaging around 43 percent of GDP during the\n            past five years. But the growth rate has not been\n            commensurate with this high investment rate. The\n            inefficiencies in public investment are partly the result of\n            inherited institutional constraints. During the command and\n            control period, public sector investments used to be managed\n            by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). MPI used\n            to compile proposals from line ministries, provincial\n            governments and State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and arbitrate\n            among competing demands. The weaknesses of the public\n            investment cycle have also resulted in cost overruns, time\n            delays and slow disbursement of development assistance.\n            There are important gaps between Vietnam's national\n            system and international practices in areas such as\n            environmental screening and environmental management,\n            project preparation and appraisal, procurement, public\n            financial management, the regulatory framework for private\n            participation in infrastructure, and monitoring and\n            evaluation. The program is designed to assist the government\n            of Vietnam (GoV) to strengthen the selection, preparation,\n            implementation and supervision of public investment\n            projects. While much progress has been made over the last\n            decade in the upgrading of public financial management in\n            relation to recurrent expenditures, there are still\n            important weaknesses in the management of investment\n            projects. The program supports a series of policy measures\n            which are expected to strengthen the effectiveness of public\n            investment in Vietnam. The program aims to improve all\n            public investment projects, regardless of their source of\n            funding. The operation, is the second and last in a\n            programmatic series of two."}, "docdt": "2011-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
