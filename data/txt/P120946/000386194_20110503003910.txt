Operation Type         Single-tranche programmatic budget support operation, the second and
                       last in a series of two.
Main Policy Areas      This is the second and last of a series of two programmatic development
                       policy operations that was prepared in response to a request made by the
                       Government of Vietnam (GoV) to provide more resources in support of
                       its response to the global economic crisis.
                       Vietnam‘s economy is recovering steadily from the global economic
                       crisis, thanks partly to the large and timely stimulus package. While the
                       stimulus measures are being phased out in a calibrated manner, the level
                       of fiscal deficit and public debt remain elevated, and significantly above
                       their historical pre-crisis, levels.
                       The key emphasis of this operation remains unchanged from its
                       predecessor, namely to strengthen the public investment cycle, an area
                       where reforms have lagged. The Agence Française de Développement
                       (AFD) will continue to provide parallel finance to the program based on
                       the same policy matrix.
                       The program is organized around four main areas which are essential to
                       strengthening the public investment project cycle:
                          Project selection (environmental screening).
                          Project implementation (cost estimates, bidding rules, bidding
                           transparency, conflict of interest, dispute resolution, land
                           acquisition, environmental management).
                          Financial management (reporting and control, administrative costs,
                           environmental budgets, subsidies and guarantees).
                          Project oversight     (project   documentation,     monitoring    and
                           evaluation).


                                             i
                         Progress in these areas is expected to improve public investment
                         processes and strengthen country systems.
Key Outcome Indicators   A set of nine measurable indicators covering the four areas of the
                         program (project selection, project implementation, financial
                         management and project oversight) has been identified. An effort has
                         been made to refine the monitoring framework and include new
                         indicators. However, given the short time span for the program, it is
                         difficult to have measurable results on the ground. Therefore, it is
                         expected that progress towards meeting development outcomes will be
                         measured at completion.
Program Development      Though Vietnam‘s economy has grown rapidly, the bulk of this growth
Objectives and           has come through factor accumulation, with modest contribution from
Contribution to CPS      productivity growth. The country therefore cannot achieve its objective
                         of growing at 7 to 8 percent, as indicated in its Socio-economic
                         Development Strategy (SEDS) 2011-2020, without raising the
                         productivity of investment, especially public investment. The reforms
                         supported by PIR 2 attempt to improve the effectiveness of public
                         investment through better project selection, implementation, financial
                         management and oversight.
                         In doing so, PIR 2 supports one of the emerging priorities of the SEDS
                         2011-2020, namely to raise productivity of investment. The operation
                         also supports modern governance, which is one of the four main
                         ―pillars‖ of Vietnam‘s Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP)
                         2006-2010. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) is aligned to the
                         SEDP. Better planning processes, more transparent procurement and
                         stronger public financial management, all areas covered by the proposed
                         program, fall under the modern governance pillar of SEDP.
                         Through its focus on the environmental screening and the environmental
                         management of projects, the proposed program is also expected to
                         contribute to the natural resources pillar of SEDP. Its attention to fair
                         compensation and livelihood support in the event of land acquisition
                         should also contribute to the social inclusion pillar.
Risks and Risk           In recent years, Vietnam‘s impressive growth performance has been
Mitigation               tempered by its growing macroeconomic instabilities. The annual
                         inflation rate has hovered at double-digit level and the local currency has
                         been under intense pressure in the past few months. Foreign exchange
                         reserves have declined and the sovereign rating has been downgraded on
                         account of persistent macroeconomic volatility, including default by one
                         of the largest state owned enterprises. While these instabilities were set-
                         off by external shocks, they have become increasingly domestic,
                         conditioned by domestic institutional weaknesses and policies.
                         In recent months, and especially since mid-February 2011, there has
                         been a distinct shift in government‘s policy stance – from emphasizing
                         growth to stabilizing the economy. Resolution 11, which outlines a wide
                         range of monetary, fiscal and structural policy measures to cool an
                         overheated economy, is an important step in that direction. Some of the
                         stabilization measures announced so far include: (i) a 9.3 percent

                                               ii
               devaluation of the dong against the US dollar; (ii) significant tightening
               of monetary policy including the increase in the refinancing rate from 8
               percent to 13 percent and open market operation rate from 7 percent to
               13 percent since November 2010; (iii) reduction in the target growth for
               domestic credit in 2011 to below 20 percent from actual growth of 30
               percent in 2010; (iv) cutting non-salary current expenditure by 10
               percent and containing the fiscal deficit to below 5 percent to GDP in
               2011.
               In addition, the government has indicated its commitment to timely
               disseminate macroeconomic and financial information and communicate
               its policies more clearly and transparently to the market, strengthen
               regulations on provisioning by the banks, encourage independent audit
               of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and better monitor contingent
               liabilities arising in the SOE sector.
               The recently announced measures constitute a credible package that
               could begin to address Vietnam‘s macroeconomic instability. So far the
               markets have reacted favorably, with parallel market premium and
               sovereign bond spreads steadily declining. Given the extensive
               consultation both within and outside the government, Resolution 11
               enjoys broad support, thereby reducing the possibility of a policy
               reversal in the near future. Moreover, continuous monitoring of the
               macroeconomic situation, close collaboration with the IMF and frequent
               discussion with the authorities on remedial options are other potential
               ways the macroeconomic risks are being mitigated.
               In addition, there are potential operational risks arising from temporal
               mismatch between actions and triggers on one hand and development
               outcomes on the other. This is because the operation has a short time
               span (two years), but it addresses PFM/institutional reforms that are
               long-term in nature and in Vietnam context, have a slow pace of
               implementation. So while measures will be adopted as agreed in the
               operation, the specifics are such that their impact on efficiency and
               transparency of public investments could be felt after considerable lag.
               This risk is to some extent being addressed by the quality of the ongoing
               technical assistance provided by the six development banks in several of
               the areas covered by the proposed program, and by the World Bank and
               other development partners in relation to public financial management.
               Since many of the measures supported by this operation are expected to
               improve the speed and quality of public investment projects, including
               the projects financed by development partners, their implementation is
               being closely monitored.

                  IBRD/IDA PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
        PROPOSED SECOND PUBLIC INVESTMENT REFORM OPERATION
                TO THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM


                                     I.    INTRODUCTION


1.        Improving the efficiency of investment has emerged as one of the key economic priorities in
Vietnam. The country has already achieved rapid economic growth and fast poverty reduction over
the last twenty years. However, there is a growing concern that the momentum of a growth strategy
that is largely based on factor accumulation may have run its course. Vietnam has one of the highest
investment to GDP ratios in the world, averaging around 43 percent of GDP during the past five years.
But the growth rate has not been commensurate with this high investment rate. So if Vietnam aspires
to grow at 7 to 8 percent rate during the next decade, as indicated in its Socio-economic Development
Strategy (SEDS) 2011-2020, it cannot do so by raising investment rate even higher. Instead, the focus
has to shift towards raising the competitiveness of economy, especially the quality of public
investment.
2.      The inefficiencies in public investment are partly the result of inherited institutional
constraints. During the command and control period, public sector investments used to be managed
by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). MPI used to compile proposals from line
ministries, provincial governments and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and arbitrate among competing
demands. This ―ask and give‖ mechanism resulted in economic inefficiency and fiduciary
vulnerability. Gradually, the separation between government and SOE investments became clearer,
and responsibilities for public investment projects were delegated to lower levels of government. The
Law on the State Budget, which became effective in 2004, pushed decentralization further by leading
to the adoption of progressive budget allocation norms, transferring more resources for public
investments to poorer provinces. However, the decentralized system carried with it many of the
deficiencies that existed at the federal level, such as weak project selection system, slow pace of
execution, inadequate emphasis on monitoring and oversight.
3.      The weaknesses of the public investment cycle have also resulted in cost overruns, time delays
and slow disbursement of development assistance. There are important gaps between Vietnam‘s
national system and international practices in areas such as environmental screening and
environmental management, project preparation and appraisal, procurement, public financial
management, the regulatory framework for private participation in infrastructure, and monitoring and
evaluation. These gaps have led to the use of parallel systems by development partners, for instance in
relation to procurement, which have resulted in considerable delays in project implementation.
Officials in line ministries, provincial governments and project management units (PMUs) are
reluctant to deviate from official procedures, for fear of sanctions. This cautious behavior is
associated with consistently low disbursement rates for the development banks operating in Vietnam,
thus reducing the efficiency of Official Development Assistance (ODA) implementation.
4.       The proposed public investment reform program is designed to assist the government of
Vietnam (GoV) to strengthen the selection, preparation, implementation and supervision of public
investment projects. While much progress has been made over the last decade in the upgrading of
public financial management in relation to recurrent expenditures, there are still important weaknesses
in the management of investment projects. The recent international macroeconomic turbulence has
exposed the weaknesses of public investment in Vietnam. Distorted price signals resulted in capital

                                                  1
expenditures going to sectors experiencing asset price bubbles, thus amplifying macroeconomic
fluctuations. In fact the expansion of SOEs into non-core areas through leveraged borrowing is one of
the key reasons for the recent default by the national shipbuilding conglomerate on its external debt.
Insufficiently developed monitoring mechanisms have also made it difficult for the government to
adjust investment volumes timely so that they would play a more counter-cyclical role.
5.       The proposed program supports a series of policy measures which are expected to strengthen
the effectiveness of public investment in Vietnam. The program aims to improve all public investment
projects, regardless of their source of funding. The operation builds on analytical work conducted by
the World Bank and other donors in relation to the efficiency and financing of capital accumulation in
Vietnam (see Capital Matters, Vietnam Development Report 2009, World Bank, 2008), public
financial management (see Country Financial Accountability Assessment, World Bank, 2009),
harmonization in the spirit of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (see Mid-Term Review on
Implementation of Paris Declaration and Hanoi Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness, PGAE's Report,
2008) and findings presented at the International Conference on ―Public Investment Management‖
held in Hanoi in September 2010. Other development banks and aid agencies, and especially the
Agence Française de Développement, have been involved in the policy dialogue.
6.       The proposed operation, Public Investment Reform Development Policy Operation 2, is the
second and last in a programmatic series of two. The first operation was for US$ 500 million on
IBRD resources, while the second operation is for US$ 350 million, with US$ 262.7 million from IDA
resources and US$ 87.3 million on IBRD funds. The Agence Française de Développement co-financed
PIR 1, contributing EUR 50 million and it will also co-finance PIR 2 with a contribution of EUR 35
million.
7.       The size of PIR 2 has been reduced by US$ 150 million from the initial agreed amount for two
reasons. First, with the gradual and calibrated phasing out of the stimulus measures, the fiscal deficit
as a share of GDP, though large, has been declining – resulting in a smaller financing gap than was
originally assumed. Second, while there has been important progress in reforming public investment
cycle, one of the key policy actions for PIR 2 has not been achieved 1. So keeping with the spirit of
development policy lending operation, the size of PIR 2 has been reduced for both the World Bank
and the AFD. In addition, given the concern that a second large development policy loan will quickly
exhaust Vietnam‘s limited IBRD exposure, PIR 2 will be partly financed from Vietnam‘s IDA
allocation. Accordingly, a blend operation, with US$ 262.7 million in IDA resources and $87.3
million in IBRD funds, has been prepared.
8.        The proposed program is consistent with the objectives of the Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for the period 2007-2011. Under its first pillar (improved business environment) one of the
objectives is the efficient and reliable provision of infrastructure services. In Vietnam, infrastructure
is still largely dependent on public investment. Under the fourth pillar (strengthened governance)
objectives include improved effectiveness of public resources management and reduced corruption.
Together with other development policy operations already approved or in preparation, the proposed
program complements the series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) which is the primary
vehicle for the policy dialogue in Vietnam.
9.      Apart from helping the government to finance the stimulus program, the PIR series has had
many other benefits. Given the concessional nature of the operation (blend of IDA and IBRD), PIR 2
will provide alternative source of financing the fiscal deficit, substituting for more expensive

         We have been recently informed that the ―Law on Public Investment,‖ which was dropped from this
operation, may now be tabled in the National Assembly in 2012. No formal announcement to this effect,
however, has been made by the government yet.

borrowing, and thereby helping to keep the level of fiscal deficit and government debt lower than what
they otherwise would be. It is also expected to reduce net credit to government, and consequently net
credit expansion, at a time when the external position of the country remains vulnerable. Finally, the
operation will help boost the level of international reserves and contribute to building market
confidence.

                                  II.   COUNTRY CONTEXT


RECENT MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

10.     Vietnam has weathered the 2008-09 global economic crisis relatively well. After registering
real GDP growth of 5.3 percent in 2009, its economy grew by an estimated 6.8 percent in 2010.
Vietnam stands out not only for achieving a higher average growth rate in the post-crisis period, but
also a more stable growth path. The rapid recovery has been bolstered by higher level of investment
and a strong revival in exports. Foreign direct investments have continued to remain buoyant and
remittances have grown at a healthy rate. Exports are growing at 24 percent, with export of non-oil
sector doing particularly well, having registered 30 percent growth in first eleven months of 2010.
Overall, the recovery of the real sector of the economy has been both robust and remarkable.
11.      Vietnam‘s strong recovery has, however, been tempered by its growing macroeconomic
vulnerabilities. The annual inflation rate is currently hovering at double-digit level and its currency
has been under intense pressure for the last several months. Foreign exchange reserves have declined
and Vietnam‘s sovereign rating has recently been downgraded on account of persistent
macroeconomic vulnerabilities, including default by one of the largest state owned enterprises. These
instabilities were triggered by external shocks – the surge in capital flows in 2007 and the global
financial crisis in 2008-09 – but have become increasingly domestic, with the authorities being slower
to react and hesitant to disrupt the country‘s impressive growth record.
12.     The first signs of macroeconomic problems can be traced back to 2007 when Vietnam
experienced an unprecedented surge in external capital flow, fueling a credit boom and an asset price
bubble. Between 2006 and 2007, foreign direct investment increased by three fold and portfolio flows
by four-fold – with total external capital increasing from US$ 3.6 billion (or 5.9 percent of GDP) in
2006 to US$ 12.8 billion in 2007 (18 percent of GDP). Consequently, money supply grew rapidly,
fueling a credit boom and creating an asset price bubble. Inflation rate accelerated and trade deficit
widened rapidly during this period.
13.     The economic boom came to a sudden halt as the global economy plunged into a financial and
economic crisis during 2008. Capital flows slowed, with portfolio flow reversing from its peak of
US$ 6.2 billion in 2007 to US$ -0.5 billion in 2008. The stock market lost nearly 66 percent of its
value in 2008. Fueled by global commodity price shocks, Vietnam‘s inflation rate accelerated to
nearly 20 percent and its currency appreciated in real terms.
14.      This was followed in 2009 by the global economic crisis that led to a significant slowdown in
manufacturing growth, contraction in export demand and the possibility of closure of thousands of
factories and millions of lost jobs. Many of the export-oriented firms, which had invested heavily with
the belief that the boom would continue, suddenly found their orders cancelled and sales plunged.
Some of the more leveraged firms, including SOEs, found it difficult to keep up with their debt service
payments. A timely and large ‗stimulus package‘ however helped to cushion the adverse impact of the
global crisis.



                                                  3
15.     The most recent episode of macroeconomic instability started in the second-half of 2010 when
the economy overheated following delayed withdrawal of the fiscal and monetary stimulus that had
been introduced to deal with the impact of the global financial crisis. As of December 2010, inflation
climbed to a two-year high of 12.2 percent, the dong came under intense pressure, and the level of
foreign exchange reserves declined to $12.5 billion (1.5 months of imports). The health of the
banking sector also became a focus of concern, in part because of the build-up of contingent liabilities
in the SOE sector. On account of this deterioration in the country‘s macroeconomic indicators and a
default by one of its largest state owned enterprises, Standard & Poor‘s and Moody‘s downgraded
Vietnam‘s sovereign rating to BB- and B1, respectively.

THE GOVERNMENT’S POLICY RESPONSE

16.     After the successful completion of the XIth Party Congress in January 2011, a consensus begun
to emerge within the government (including the provincial governments) behind the need for strong
measures to restore macroeconomic stability. The authorities recognized that their attention and focus
should be on addressing instability even if this comes at the expense of slower growth in the short
term. The government publicly indicated its intention to pursue ―tight and prudent monetary and
fiscal policy‖ and approved Resolution 11, which commits the government to a wide range of
monetary, fiscal and structural policy reforms that are intended to cool an overheated economy.
Several of the measures in the Resolution have already been implemented. Specifically, the State

                                                          4
Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has issued Directive 01/CT-NHNH on March 1, 2011 to implement parts of
Resolution 11 that fall under its ambit and similar directives and circulars are under preparation in all
the relevant ministries. A brief summary of the measures are as follows:
17.      Exchange Rate Policy. The dong was devalued by 9.3 percent against the US dollar and the
trading band was narrowed from +/-3 percent to +/-1 percent. This is the single largest correction to
the exchange rate following the onset of macroeconomic instability in 2007. The authorities also
indicated that the interbank average exchange rate will be managed more flexibly, consistent with the
intention to gradually move to a more flexible exchange rate regime. Given a large and rapidly
growing quasi-illegal trade in gold, which led to a significant increase in errors and omissions in the
balance of payments, Resolution 11 instructs SBV to prepare a Decree on Management of Gold
Trading for issuance by the second quarter of 2011. The Decree will centralize gold exports, eliminate
trading in gold bars, and prevent cross-border trafficking of gold. The Resolution instructs responsible
authorities to ensure that foreign exchange and gold traders comply with the law.
18.     Monetary Policy. In the last four months, SBV has increased the base (refinancing) rate from
8 percent to 13 percent and revised upward the overnight market operation (repo) rate six times– from
7 percent to 13 percent. SBV also announced that the target for credit growth in 2011 will be cut to 20
percent from 39 and 30 percent in 2009 and 2010 respectively. This will be the lowest target for credit
growth in the last 10 years. Concomitantly, the target for broad money supply growth has been kept at
15-16 percent during 2011 ― the lowest growth target since the beginning of economic reforms two
decades ago.
19.      Fiscal Policy. The government has announced that it will cut non-salary recurrent
expenditures by 10 percent, will not start any new construction projects in the public sector this year,
including in SOEs, and thereby reduce fiscal deficit to below 5 percent of GDP in 2011 (GoV‘s
definition) ― a 1 percentage point reduction relative to 2010 and 0.3 percentage point reduction
relative to 2011 budget estimate.
20.       Banking Sector. Resolution 11 limits banks‘ exposure to non-productive activities (which
include real estate and security market) to 22 percent of total credit by June 30, 2011 and to 16 percent
by December 31, 2011. Non-compliant banks will be asked to double their required reserves ratio and
restrict their business activities. SBV will review compliance at the end of June 2011. The government
is revising Decision 493 to upgrade loan classification and provisioning practice in the banking system
to bring them closer to international norms. The revised Decision will be issued by May 2011. The
government has also confirmed its participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP),
and has sought technical assistance from the Bank and Fund.
21.     State-Owned Enterprises. The government has asked key Economic Groups to carry out
independent audits using international norms and make the results available by end 2011. MPI has
been asked to review planned loans and investment projects of SOEs to identify those that can be
dropped or scaled down. The report from MPI is due to the National Assembly by the end of March
2011. Resolution 11 also indicates that the government will accelerate the equitization process and
strengthen the governance of SOEs.
22.       Other Structural Measures. The government is preparing a Circular to increase disclosure of
information and policies affecting monetary management and banking, including submitting key
statistics to the IMF‘s International Financial Statistics on schedule. A draft Circular has been sent to
the Bank for review. Finally, the government is moving from an administrative mechanism for setting
the prices of key commodities such as electricity, gas and fuel, to a more market-based mechanism. It
has already announced an increase in electricity tariffs by 15.3 percent, and in the price of gasoline (by



                                                    5
18 percent), diesel (24 percent), and kerosene (21 percent). In addition, Resolution 11 instructs MOIT
to prepare a regulation for establishing a market mechanism for pricing electricity.
23.      The above policy measures, in our view, constitute a credible plan for Vietnam to regain
macroeconomic stability. The measures have been widely discussed and debated within the
government, with representatives of large SOEs as well as with independent Vietnamese economists.
It has the broad support of line ministries as well as key finance and budget committees in the National
Assembly. The international financial markets have reacted favorably to the recent announcement,
with Vietnam‘s sovereign spreads steadily declining over the past few days. This augurs well for
successful implementation of Resolution 11.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS

Fiscal Policy and Debt Situation
24.      Vietnam experienced a sharp increase in its fiscal deficit in 2009 on account of the
stabilization measures. The government‘s overall fiscal deficit was 9.0 percent of GDP in 2009,
substantially above those of previous years, as the stimulus package came on top of an already
expansionary budget plan. In addition to the measures adopted to stimulate economic activities, the
fall in oil prices and the slowdown in economic activities have resulted in a decline in the government
revenue. This decline was partially offset in the second half of 2009, as both international commodity
prices and domestic economic activities became more buoyant.

25.     With significantly higher than expected revenue outturn and expenditure in check, the
government has achieved a lower fiscal deficit than anticipated during 2010. According to the latest
IMF estimate, total budget revenue and grants increased from 26.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to 28.1
percent in 2010. Meanwhile, total budget expenditure (including off-budget expenditure) is estimated
to have decreased by 3.1 percentage points, from 35.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to 32.6 percent in 2010.
The fiscal deficit is therefore estimated to have declined from to 9.0 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4.4
percent in 2010 (Table 2).
26.     Through its 2011 Budget, and its recent Resolution, GoV has indicated its intention to further
consolidate the fiscal accounts and gradually reduce the fiscal deficit to pre-crisis levels. This process
is being facilitated by reining in current expenditure, improving efficiency of public investment and
scaling up the existing medium term budget framework being piloted in various line ministries to the
national level.
27.      Vietnam‘s public debt is likely to remain sustainable if the current economic recovery
continues and the authorities carry on the current fiscal tightening. The results of the debt
sustainability analysis conducted in 2010 indicate that the public sector debt was 49 percent of GDP at
end-2009, two-thirds of which (31 percent of GDP) was owed to external creditors. Under the
baseline scenario, this ratio was projected to increase to just above 50 percent of GDP during 2010-13
before starting to decline again thereafter. The large fiscal deficits in 2009 and 2010 do not affect the
overall debt sustainability significantly, as long as the government reverts to the pre-crisis levels of
deficit in a few years as expected. The stress tests indicate that the two main risks to debt
sustainability are a loss of access to non debt-creating capital inflows and a slowdown of exports. The
standard assumptions applied for these shocks are severe, and are unlikely to materialize.2
28.       The largest source of uncertainty and hence, unquantifiable risk, to the DSA comes from
implicit obligations which are not captured under public and publicly-guaranteed debt statistics.
Neither a clear definition nor a reliable estimate of such liabilities is available, which limits the
government‘s ability to manage associated risks. Contingent liabilities might arise from off-budget
statutory funds such as health insurance fund, the banking sector, or large SOEs. The last one in
particular is a serious concern. It is now well known that Vinashin (a ship-building economic group)
used resources obtained through their preferential access to credit to invest heavily outside its core
businesses and falsified financial reports. Collecting reliable and up-to-date information on contingent
liabilities (mostly in the SOE sector) and assessing their fiscal risks has become be a priority. And by
articulating these changes taking place in the government to market participants and providing them
with regular and up-to-date information on fiscal and debt situation, the government is trying to help
to build confidence among market participants.

29.      The second source of fiscal risk, albeit not of the same magnitude as contingent liabilities,
arises from the large size of off-budget expenditure, which has been funded by issuing off-budget
bonds. The off-budget spending is managed by MPI to build infrastructure such as canals, schools and
housing for the poor. While the off-budget spending is approved by the National Assembly and is
subject to the same level of oversight and scrutiny as on-budget spending, it has been termed as off-
budget (misleadingly in our view) because it is largely managed by MPI – a leftover of the planning
era. In the last four years, off-budget expenditure financed by MPI bonds has increased sharply from
1.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to 2.8 percent. However, it is scheduled to fall to 1.9 percent of GDP in
2011 and to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2012 (Table-2).




                                                    7
Changes in the Banking Sector
30.     The banking sector has been adversely affected by the succession of asset price bubbles,
monetary tightening and growth slowdown. The real estate bubble of end-2007 and its subsequent
freeze in early 2008 have made it difficult for several commercial banks to recover their loans; the
rapid disinflation in late 2008, at a time when interest rates were still very high, substantially increased
the debt service burden faced by enterprises because of the rapid rise in real interest rates.

31.      The asset quality of bank portfolios remains an ongoing concern given the unusually high
credit growth of the past years and developing, but relatively weak, risk management capacity in the
banking sector. According to the official data, the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of the banking
system was 1.9 percent, 2.5 percent and 2.4 percent in end-2009, March 2010 and August 2010,
respectively. However, if international standards are applied, the NPL ratio of the banking sector is
expected to be significantly higher. Currently, only 3 commercial banks are assessed to have the
adequate capacity to use international method of calculating NPLs.

32.      From the macroeconomic risk perspective, the financial health of the state-owned commercial
banks (SOCBs) has often been highlighted as a source of concern. SOCBs play a dominant role in the
banking sector, though they have been rapidly losing market share (in both credit and deposit markets)
to the joint stock banks (JSBs) in recent years. At the end of 2007, SOCBs share in total outstanding
credit was 59.3 percent and that for JSBs was 27.7 percent; by the end of 2010, these numbers were
51.4 percent and 34.8 percent respectively. Two SOCBs have started the equitization process and a
third one plans to start the process this year. The International Financial Corporation (IFC) has
recently bought 10 percent stake in the third largest SOCB. In terms of credit growth, loan portfolio of
the SOCBs has grown at a slower rate than the overall system in the past couple of years. For example,
in 2010, SOCBs loan portfolio grew at 22 percent compared with the average of 40 percent growth in
the JSBs. The share of SOCBs credit going to SOEs has also declined in recent years. For example,
only 25 percent of Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam‘s (BIDV‘s) portfolio has been
lent to SOEs in 2010 compared with 35 percent in 2009. For Agribank, the largest SOCB, the ratio
was 6.6 percent and 4.4 percent in 2009 and 2010, respectively.

33.     The SBV has upgraded its supervision efforts and raised minimum capital requirements in
response to the concerns about the health of the banking sector. By the end of 2008, all commercial
banks had met the new requirements. The process of increasing the minimum charter capital
continues, in part as a gentle push towards some consolidation of smaller banks. However, the
deadline to increase the minimum charter capital further to 3 trillion dong (about $150 million at
today‘s exchange rate) by end 2010 was extended, when 18 of the smaller banks were unable to meet
it. The SBV opted for a more measured implementation of this policy, especially in the current fragile
macroeconomic environment.

34.      In 2010, a number of other important changes in the policies and regulations governing the
banking sector were announced. These include the removal of interest caps, the revised banking laws
(namely, the Law on the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV Law) and the Law on Credit Institutions (LCI)),
and regulation on prudential ratios. These together are expected to reshape the working environment
of the banking sector. The SBV Law is expected to improve the accountability, mandate and
autonomy of SBV in undertaking monetary policy. The LCI is seen as enhancing the autonomy, safety
and soundness of credit institutions. The removal of the interest rate caps and the issuance of Circular
13 (replacing Decision 457) on prudential ratios are expected to affect the operation of the credit
institutions. On one hand, credit institutions now have greater flexibility in setting interest rates, but on
the other hand, are subject to the tighter prudential ratios, most notably the significantly higher capital
adequacy ratio (9 percent as of October 01, 2010), while facing stricter requirements on the amount of

                                                     8
funds eligible for lending activities (although the subsequent Circular 19 lightened this requirement to
some extent).

35.     Much needs to be done over the medium term, however, to address some of the structural
weaknesses, particularly in the banking and state enterprise sectors, that have contributed to periodic
bouts of macroeconomic instability. On this, Resolution 11 is less ambitious, partly because of a lack
of capacity to detail actions in this area and also because there is less consensus within the government
on the way forward. Various on-going activities such as review of the state economic group model,
taking stock of the SOE reform and the formulation of Decrees to improve the management of state
assets and equities in SOEs can, however, provide valuable ingredients for the formulation of a
systemic reform program in the medium term.
36.      Through various tasks in the work program, the Bank team is providing policy advice and
technical assistance to prepare detailed action plans for the reform of banking and SOEs, help build
consensus behind them, and eventually support their implementation. The upcoming preparation of
the FSAP will provide a platform for some of this work while ongoing TA on SOE Governance, the
upcoming Vietnam Development Report 2012 on ―Transition to Market‖, and a policy note on
ensuring that SOEs face hard budget constraints will support progress on the SOE issues. Through the
Public Financial Management Reform project we are also assisting the government in developing the
legal framework and monitoring indicators to better manage contingent liabilities, including those
arising from the SOE sector.

                          III.   THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM
OVERALL STRATEGY
37.     Improving efficiency of investment is high in Vietnam‘s development agenda for the next
decade. Despite its success in rapid economic growth and fast poverty reduction over the last twenty
years, there is a growing concern that the momentum of a growth strategy that is largely based on
factor accumulation may have run its course. There is a growing imperative to move to a new growth
model that relies on more efficient use of resources. The Socio-Economic Development Strategy
(SEDS) 2011-2020 and the Five Year Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2011-15, therefore
put greater emphasis on quality of investment and on sustainable growth. A common important
objective of these strategic documents is to raise the competitiveness of the economy and improve
quality of public investment.
38.      The decision to add a stronger quality dimension to growth has been supported by various
research initiatives of both the government and the National Assembly. Since 2008, the Prime
Minister has instructed several government think tanks to conduct research on a number of topics such
as restructuring the economy and impact of decentralization in investment. The National Assembly
has also assigned a research team to carry out a study on economic restructuring. Vietnam first
competitiveness report was just completed in November 2010 under the guidance of a Deputy Prime
Minister. In October 2010, the Prime Minister issued Decision 1914 on implementation of a
comprehensive research program to identify measures for improving the efficiency and
competitiveness of the economy. Importantly, the Resolution 51/2010 issued by the National
Assembly on November 8, 2010 includes a target on the share of investment in GDP at 40 percent in
2011, a reduction from 44 percent in 2010.




                                                   9
39.      Raising the productivity of state capital has emerged as one of the key themes for improving
investment efficiency and competitiveness. State investment still accounts for a very high share in
total gross capital formation and continues to play a dominant role in infrastructure development. In
addition, infrastructure development has been identified as one of the top three priorities during the
next decade in Vietnam development strategy. Consequently, special attention has been given to
strengthening the management of state capital in the SEDS and SEDP. Official assessment of public
investment, as documented in the SEDP and a recent MPI report to the Consultative Group (CG)
Meeting, proposes several areas for improvement, including further decentralization combined with
strengthened Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) activities, avoiding fragmentation in public
investment and removal of SOE privileges.
40.     Strengthening the management of public expenditures has also been an integral component of
the Vietnamese Public Administration Reform Program over the last decade. A benchmark in the
reform process was the approval of the Revised Law on the State Budget, which became effective in
2004. Except for the largest national projects, public investment decisions were decentralized to
ministries and provinces. Other important developments were the move towards increased
transparency for all agencies using budget resources, including SOEs and public investment projects,
the establishment of the State Audit of Vietnam (SAV) as a technically independent entity under the
National Assembly, and the gradual integration of capital and recurrent expenditures through forward-
looking budgets and resource allocation norms. Decision 60/2010 by the Prime Minister sets out
transparent and stable norms for the transfer of equalization investment expenditures from central
budget to provinces for period 2011-15. A more detailed overview of public financial management in
Vietnam is provided in Annex 4.
41.      The reform of the state sector initially focused on the equitization of the SOEs, though dealt
exclusively with small SOEs. During the current five-year cycle, the equitization process involved
increasingly large enterprises such as Vinaconex and Vietcombank, but has recently slowed down. A
new phase in state sector reform started with the transfer of state ownership rights in SOEs managed
by ministries and provinces to the for-profit State Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC). From July
1, 2010, the Law on SOEs was effectively rescinded and all SOEs, FDI and private enterprises now
operate under the same regulatory framework. The SEDP 2011-15 emphasizes ―reform of SOEs must
take the direction towards elimination of subsidies of all types, avoiding the abuse of monopoly or
market power (p.98), and the government should minimize direct interventions, relies mostly on
indirect instruments to create equal opportunities for all enterprises (p.101)‖.
42.      At the same time, the recent years have recorded the emergence of State Economic Groups,
reporting directly to the Prime Minister. Economic Groups may benefit from economies of scale and
from their ability to mobilize financial resources, but this is at the same time a potential source of
systemic risk. In the absence of sufficient competition, Economic Groups have become ―too big to
fail‖. Vinashin, a state economic group in ship building is on the verge of bankruptcy, highlights the
risk of possible failure of state economic groups in the absence of good corporate governance and
effective M&E for SOEs. During the last two years, measures were taken to prevent them from
having controlling stakes in financial institutions, but with limited effects. Decree 101 was issued in
November 2009 and creates legal foundation for the management and governance of state economic
groups. The Prime Minister‘s Decision 1914 includes a research project that seeks solutions to
separate the ownership and regulation functions of the state in the case of Economic Groups.
Resolution 51/2010 of the National Assembly requires the implementation of several measures for
stepping up the SOE reform, including the introduction of compulsory audits. The National Steering
Committee for Enterprise Reform and Development (NSCERD) has been instructed by the PM to
finalize a review of the pilot of state economic group model by the third quarter of 2011.



                                                  10
43.      Vietnam has experienced a rapid financial deepening in recent years. There has been a
sustained monetization of economic transactions, a parallel expansion of credit, a rapid growth of
stock market capitalization, a gradual emergence of the bond market and a boom in insurance. This
progress is all the more remarkable considering that barely a decade ago Vietnam‘s financial sector
was simply a ―window‖ to channel resources to SOEs. However, important weaknesses remain,
including a still rudimentary approach to monetary policy, and an insufficiently developed capacity to
monitor and supervise the financial sector. Aware of these challenges, at the beginning of this five-
year period, the government launched a roadmap for the reform of the banking sector, including the
transformation of SBV into a modern central bank, and the attraction of strategic investors to the
SOCBs, so as to strengthen their commercial orientation and improve their ability to assess credit risk.
The SBV Law and the LCI were revised in June 2010, further enhancing the role and flexibility of
SBV in conducting monetary policy. The objectives of the government program in this area are
reflected in the SEDP, which instructs ―perfecting the legal framework towards transparency, stable to
ensure effective operation of all participants in the financial market in a level-playing field.‖ (p. 97).

INVESTMENT-RELATED POLICIES

44.      The promulgation of the Law on Amendments in June 2009 was arguably the most important
step towards overhauling the fragmented and overlapped regulatory framework for investment,
including public investment. Several laws such as Land Law, Procurement Law, Investment Law,
Construction Law and Enterprise Law were amended. Following the Law, a number of Decrees have
been issued at the end of 2009. The formulation of the Law on Amendments and implementation
Decrees benefitted significantly from the policy dialogue within the context of preparation of the PIR
project.
45.      The basic institutional and legal framework for environmental protection has been gradually
laid out. The strategy is partly spelled out through the Amended Law on Environmental Protection,
which became effective in July 2006, and in the National Environmental Protection Strategy until
2010 and vision toward 2020. Many policies, programs and plans have broad-reaching environmental
implications. These cannot be captured by simply conducting Environmental Impact Assessments
(EIAs) at the project level. MONRE has already developed guidelines for SEA work, and SEA
guidelines for development planning are being prepared by MPI. Such ―upstream‖ reviews are
especially important at a time of rapid economic growth and massive public investment in
infrastructure.
46.      The period leading to the finalization of the SEDP 2011-15 witnessed the issuance of
important strategic and legal documents related to the fight against corruption. The SEDP articulates
five important groups of measures for its implementation and improving the effectiveness of the state
apparatus is one of them. It puts emphasis on positive, systemic approaches to reduce the scope for
corruption, in contrast with the almost exclusively punitive measures that prevailed until not long ago.
Fostering government transparency and increased people‘s supervision are among those positive
approaches. In this respect, the SEDP states the need to ―[s]trengthen the publicity and transparency
in the use and management of the state budget and funds‖ and [s]trengthen the supervision of the
society and community to state apparatus (p.108)‖. At the same time, a number of important laws have
recently been promulgated, including the Law on Natural Resources Administration and Law on Tax
for Usage of Non-agricultural Land. These laws, issued in June 2010, are expected to result in
significant improvement of the administration of land and natural resources, the two areas that are
highly vulnerable to rent-seeking activities.




                                                   11
47.     The weaknesses of the management of public investment were further highlighted in the draft
SEDP 2011-15 and a recent MPI report to the 2010 CG Meeting. Among the major remaining issues,
the lack of a consistent legal framework was identified as the most impact factor. At present, public
investment is under the regulation of two different sets of legal documents. Projects that do not
involve construction work are regulated by a series of decrees, whereas projects that do involve such
work fall under the Construction Law and another set of associated decrees. In addition, the State
Budget Law, Investment Law, the Procurement Law, the Land Law, the Environmental Protection
Law and the relevant decrees apply. Furthermore, there are important inconsistencies between these
documents, especially in relation to the preparation, appraisal, classification, and monitoring and
evaluation of projects. There are important gaps as well, particularly in relation to assessing the
economic and social impacts of projects. All these issues seem to be amplified with increased
decentralization in investment-related decision making.
48.     Recognizing those weaknesses, several important decisions were made by government.
Through the Official Letter 6999/VPCP-TH, on October 8, 2009 the Prime Minister asked MPI to
prepare a program on restructuring the economy, with the structure of investment as one of its focal
areas. The Official Letter 78/BKH-VP, issued by MPI on February 5, 2009, identified as key policy
actions for 2009 the completion of the Law on Amendments, the drafting of a new Law on Public
Investment, and the issuance of several decrees related to investment processes. Prime Minister
Decision 1914/QD-Ttg issued on October 19, 2010 instructs relevant line ministries to conduct 19
research projects, among them three projects directly touch upon the management of state capital. In
particular, an MPI-led project focuses on the review and adjustment of public investment policies to
improve the efficiency, quality of growth and competitiveness of the economy. The SEDP instructs
the development of the second Public Administration Reform (PAR) Program for period 2011-20.
Restructuring of investment sources towards less reliance on state budget and improving efficiency of
state capital is also identified as one of the main tasks in 2011 in the government's report to the 2010
CG Meeting "Achieving macroeconomic stability for sustainable growth".
49.     Despite several areas of progress in policy reform related to public investment, there is an
important setback in taking the Law on Public Investment out of the National Assembly agenda for
discussion. The Cabinet turned down the proposal from MPI to include the Law in its proposed list of
laws to be presented to the National Assembly because of lack of consensus among the key
stakeholders. The Law covers very complex cross-sectoral areas and involves stakeholders at both
central and local levels. As a result, it is taking much longer time to build the consensus needed for
the promulgation of the law.

50.     The outcome of the recent Cabinet meeting in February 2011, however, indicates that a
consensus within the Cabinet has indeed emerged on the need of having such a Law. MPI has been
asked to prepare the brief note on the Public Investment Law as part of the government proposed law
package for the National Assembly Program in 2012. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ), who takes lead
in preparing the government proposal, has sent an official request to MPI about submission of the brief
note for the Cabinet. An official government proposal with a list of laws to be reviewed in 2012,
including the Public Investment Law, is expected to be sent to the National Assembly soon.

CONSULTATION ON THE REFORM PROGRAM

51.      The preparation of the SEDS 2011-20 and SEDP 2011-15 had important strengths compared
to its predecessors. Applying the new regulations, the drafting process was characterized by serious
efforts to collect inputs from different groups of the Vietnamese society. In addition to internal
discussions within the government, MPI organized consultation workshops with local officials, groups

                                                  12
of academics, the domestic business sector, international and local NGOs, and donors. A series of
research exercises involving local and international experts was arranged to provide analytical inputs
for both SEDS and SEDP. The draft SEDS was also posted on the internet to gather feedback from
the public and the final SEDS is available in the government‘s website.

52.      Several of the policy actions and triggers under the proposed program have been championed
by the National Assembly, which has become much more assertive during the last five-years. This
represents an important institutional transformation for Vietnam. National Assembly members have
been especially vocal on the efficiency of capital accumulation, on the regulation of Economic
Groups, and on the overall macroeconomic stance. All of these aspects affect the proposed program
either directly or through the framework in which public investment decisions are made. National
Assembly members were also the driving force with regard to the Law on Amendments, which
underpins the first operation in the proposed program. The National Assembly has also been carrying
out a study on restructuring the economy so that it can make better contribution to the formulation of
Vietnam‘s strategy and supervising the government.

53.     As part of the effort to monitor the results of the proposed program, a two-round survey of the
people affected by land reclamation is foreseen. The first round was completed in early 2010 with
active participation of the General Department for Land Administration at MONRE. The second
round survey is planned at the end of 2011. As discussed in the section on social impacts, the most
direct consequences of the proposed program would be on resettlement. The result of the first round
suggests that the proposed program will have a positive impact, by leading to more timely and
adequate compensation, and by introducing an independent monitoring mechanism.


             IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

LINK TO COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

54.      The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2007-2011 articulates the support of the World Bank
Group to Vietnam around four main pillars: (i) improving the business environment, (ii) strengthening
social inclusion, (iii) strengthening natural resource and environmental management, and (iv)
improving governance. The proposed PIR 2 program touches on all the four pillars. With regards to
the first pillar, the CPS focuses on more efficient and reliable provision of infrastructure services,
which is being facilitated through various measures included in this operation. Through its focus on
the environmental screening and the environmental management of projects, the proposed program is
also expected to contribute to the natural resources pillar of CPS. Its attention to fair compensation
and livelihood support in the event of land acquisition should also contribute to the social inclusion
pillar. The operation supports modern governance, which is fourth pillar of the CPS. Better planning
processes, more transparent procurement and stronger public financial management, all areas covered
by the proposed program, fall under the improving governance pillar of CPS.

55.     More importantly, the operation is closely linked to one of the key results set out in the CPS,
namely to accelerate the implementation of investment projects. ―While the quality of portfolio
implementation continues to be satisfactory, challenges remain from slow disbursement against
rapidly growing commitments, long project preparation, and delays in implementing investment and
technical assistance interventions‖. The CPS concludes that ―the most crucial task will be to improve
and strengthen Vietnam‘s own process of planning and financing investment projects, and safeguards.
The key factors behind the delays in processing are Vietnam‘s extensive internal control mechanisms
for ODA implementation and centralized decision-making, coupled with inconsistent regulations for

                                                  13
government-funded investment projects compared to ODA-financed projects‖ (p. 35). This program is
an attempt to address these very problems and initiate a process of upgrading the national system to
international standards.
56.      The proposed policy lending program to reform public investment processes was, however,
not foreseen when the CPS 2007-2011 was prepared. Moreover, when the CPS was drafted, the use of
IBRD resources had not been considered yet. These two developments are addressed in the CPS
Progress Report, submitted to the Board of Directors in November 2009. The proposed program is
explicitly mentioned, and briefly described, in the CPS Progress Report. Since Vietnam became
eligible for IBRD resources, two operations with IBRD funding have been approved by the Board,
including PIR 1.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS

57.      The Bank and the Fund country teams for Vietnam have an active dialogue on a range of
macroeconomic and structural issues and have maintained a close working relationship. They have
coordinated their macroeconomic policy messages to the authorities and even worked together in
communicating joint messages to the authorities on key macroeconomic risks and policy options. The
ability of the two teams to coordinate and provide consistent policy messages to the authorities has
contributed to government action, which did help improve macroeconomic performance during 2010.
The two teams also regularly share data and information and discuss and exchange institutional views
on key macroeconomic developments.
58.     The two teams also work together on a number of issues of mutual interest, such as technical
assistance for financial sector reform, preparatory work for FSAP, public financial management and
tax and customs modernization reform, preparation of the Bank‘s semi-annual economic update
(Taking Stock) and Fund‘s Article IV Consultations including the joint preparation of the Debt
Sustainability Analysis. The two teams are committed to continue the close cooperation going
forward.
59.     Beside the IMF, the World Bank worked closely with the other five development banks active
in Vietnam to select the set of policy actions under the proposed program. The other five development
banks are AFD, ADB, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the Korean
Development Bank, and the German Kreditanstalt Für Wiederaufbau (KfW). Together with the World
Bank, these agencies had been actively working on the implementation of the harmonization agenda
under the Paris Declaration. In particular, they have provided extensive technical assistance aimed at
narrowing the differences between the government systems used by the government of Vietnam to
implement public investment projects and international practice. This effort was seen as essential to
accelerate the disbursement of donor-funded projects. In the process, it led to a deep understanding of
current weaknesses in project preparation, selection, implementation and monitoring in Vietnam.
60.      Active consultation with other donors and with non-government actors also took place as part
of analytical work underpinning this program. For instance, in the context of the report on
Improvement of ODA Programs and Projects‘ Payment and Disbursement Process, completed in 2009,
field visits were made to PMUs of ODA projects and expenditure control agencies (State Treasury,
Vietnam Development Bank) in some localities in Hanoi, Hai Phong, Ho Chi Minh City and Dong
Nai. Consultations also took place during the preparation of the CFAA, in relation to SEAs and EIAs,
and on issues related to land reclamation and compensation.




                                                  14
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

61.     There is a close relationship between the proposed program and the PRSC process. Until quite
recently, PRSCs were one of the few vehicles for the policy dialogue in Vietnam, bringing together a
dozen donors around policy actions in 17 policy areas. Gradually, sectoral policy lending operations
started to emerge, to go into more detail into specific areas, such as poverty reduction, higher
education, power sector reform, or climate change. The proposed program to reform public
investment in Vietnam can be seen as one of those sectoral lending operations.
62.     Previous PRSCs included a few policy actions aimed at strengthening public investment
processes in Vietnam. Relevant prior actions included enhancing the decentralization of public
investment decisions to lower government levels (under PRSC 4), facilitating community participation
and supervision in local investment projects (also under PRSC 4), establishing criteria for selecting
public investment projects and mechanisms to monitor their financing and implementation (PRSC 7)
and revising the investment laws to improve efficiency in state capital expenditures and strengthen the
management of public investment projects (under PRSC 8), implementation of annual procurement
compliance and performance audits of project funded by the State budget, making public the results,
adoption of a pilot procurement code of ethics for participants, and launching of an open access
electronic bidding system (all under PRSC 9). In addition, the PRSC process supported the
equitization of SOEs and the separation of regulation and ownership roles within the State.
63.      The various policy dialogues pursued through this operation has implications going beyond
public investment. The proposed program is seen as better suited to address the fight against
corruption, the strengthening of planning and public financial management process, and the reform of
the state sector in aspects directly linked to the efficiency of public investments.

LESSONS LEARNED

64.      The design of the proposed program has been informed by World Bank experience with policy
lending in Vietnam. It has followed the good practice principles for conditionality, which were
recently the focus on extensive consultations with the relevant stakeholders. The design of the
operation draws on the lessons from the PRSC series in identifying an area in which the leadership is
keen to move, where the dialogue is well advanced and where capacity to develop and implement
policy is in place. Such a window currently exists in Vietnam, given the renewed focus to improve the
effectiveness of public investment. Also, growing concern about the environmental impacts of large
public investment projects has added to the momentum, as does the discovery of problems at Vinashin
has provided an urgency to undertake broad-based reforms in the state owned sector.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

65.     A key analytical input in the preparation of the proposed program was the Vietnam
Development Report 2009, entitled Capital Matters. It focused on the efficiency and financing of
investments in Vietnam. It examined the sources and uses of funds, quantified the gaps between
investment and savings for each of the main economic agents, and highlighted the mechanisms
through which the agents who save channel resources to those who invest. Inadequate criteria to select
projects, the lack of an adequate framework for private participation, and weaknesses in project
implementation were identified as the main constraints to efficient public investment in Vietnam.
66.     The selection of policy measures under the proposed program results from a combination of
analytical and institutional criteria. The long-standing analytical program of the World Bank and
other donors was used to select the actions deemed more strategic, or with the highest potential impact
on the actual implementation of public investment projects. The analytical inputs combine insights

                                                  15
from the work program on public financial management and financial accountability, from the joint
efforts of the six development banks to implement the Paris Declaration and the Hanoi Core Statement
on Aid Effectiveness, from the flagship Vietnam Development Report series, and from the technical
assistance work in support of planning reform at MPI, among others. The second criterion to select
the actions in the policy matrix was readiness. The proposed measures were extensively discussed
with the relevant line ministries and government agencies to identify which of them were feasible
within the time frame of the proposed program. Taking into account the technical background work,
the legal process and the consultation requirements in each case, a preliminary agreement has been
reached on the content and time line of each of the measures.
67.     A series of core diagnostics and specific studies have been undertaken to provide sound
analytical underpinnings to the implementation of the government-led public financial management
reform program. The two most important assessments produced in recent years are the best-practice
Public Expenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-IFA), completed in 2005, and
the 2007 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) which was finalized in 2009. These
two comprehensive diagnostics have helped identify areas in need of further improvement, including
the process of budget development, budget execution control, accessibility of financial information,
and accounting, reporting, auditing and oversight framework. The PER-IFA and the CFAA reflect a
trend towards analytical work being undertaken jointly by the government, World Bank and interested
development partners, which has ultimately resulted in enhanced ownership of relevant
recommendations. In the meantime, the recommendations from PER-IFA 2004 and CFAA 2007 have
formed the basis for policy dialogue conducted through the PRSC series and the proposed program.
68.     Another important analytical underpinning for the design of this operation was the Diagnostic
Framework for Assessing Public Investment Management, produced in early 2009 by the Public Sector
and Governance Unit of the World Bank. This study provided a very useful starting point to design
the results framework, an area in which few precedents are available. Other studies serving as
analytical underpinnings for the proposed program included the Public Investment Management Case
Study for Vietnam (2008), Vietnam Infrastructure Strategy (2006), the analysis of land markets in the
Vietnam Development Report (2006), and the piloting process for Medium-Term Expenditure
Frameworks (MTEFs). The operation has also benefitted from the findings at the International
Conference on ―Public Investment Management‖ held in Hanoi in September 2010.
69.      The Joint Portfolio Performance Reviews and Joint Action Plan of the six development banks
active in Vietnam contributed an in-depth understanding of the microeconomics of public investment
processes in Vietnam. The focus of the six banks‘ efforts was to identify ways to upgrade the
performance on the ODA-funded programs. However, the exercise led to a systematic identification
of gaps between Vietnamese laws and regulations on public investments and accepted international
practice. Several key areas where short-term actions could be taken were selected for what has
become known as the Joint Action Program (JAP). Each of the six banks subsequently agreed to assist
MPI to pursue options for improvements in specific areas of the JAP.
70.      Several of the actions pursued by the six banks feed directly into the preparation of the
proposed program. On procurement, an independent assessment of the Vietnamese system was
commissioned by MPI in 2007 using the OECD-DAC methodology. On the use of cost estimates as
bid price ceilings, the program included a program to review of the whole cost norm system to
determine whether a reform would be advantageous for Vietnam. On construction contracts, an
Institutional Development Facility (IDF) grant was signed to support the Ministry of Construction
(MOC) to review an important decree and prepare its replacement. Good progress was also made by
the six development banks on the common policy framework for resettlement and the environment.
Regulations on SEAs and EIAs were thoroughly reviewed, and proposals were made to improve the
management of the resettlement of illegal land users, which has been one of the most controversial
issues in the public debate recently. On payment procedures and non-essential disbursement checks,

                                                 16
the work of the six development banks included a survey of PMU practices, leading to consultation
and discussion with key stakeholders. Common guidelines for feasibility studies were jointly prepared
with government for use in all projects by the six development banks. Finally, on establishing a
consistent M&E framework, an Aligned Monitoring Tool was agreed upon with government and is
already been used in all projects by the six banks.
71.      The technical assistance provided to MPI in recent years is aimed at addressing remaining
weaknesses in planning and investment. This engagement has resulted in substantive learning about
project implementation in practice. The technical assistance program has supported reliance on broad-
based consultations in planning process, the introduction of a results-based M&E framework at the
central level, the adoption of forward-looking budgets better integrating capital and recurrent
expenditures, the adoption of the first ever legal document in support of spatial planning, and the
strengthening of provincial SEDPs. Some important lessons have been derived from this technical
assistance work. It has appeared clearly that the key impediment to further breakthroughs in planning
reform is the lack of a sound regulatory framework that clearly spells out requirements,
responsibilities processing, steps and resources needed for strategic planning. Under current
institutional settings, agencies and provinces simply compete for the allocation of resources through
their SEDPs and investment master plans, without much guidance on which investments are eligible
and which ones should not be selected. Another important lesson concerns the lack of an effective
M&E mechanism which would not just be based on administrative reporting.

                              V.    THE PROPOSED PROGRAM

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

72.     The proposed operation is the second and last of a series of two general budget support
operations that aims to strengthen public investment processes in Vietnam. In preparing this operation,
several factors were considered regarding the appropriate lending instrument and the loan size. First,
Vietnam has weathered the global crisis rather well and now policies put emphasis on more balance
between stability and growth. As GoV has been withdrawing the stimulus, the rationale for an
operation of the same size has become weaker overtime. Second, a key trigger for PIR 2, the
submission of the draft Law on Public Investment to the National Assembly has been postponed,
mostly due to the complexity of the issue and the lack of consensus within the government. A
Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO) was also considered, but it is clear that the government will use
the resources as soon as they are available.
73.     Consultations with the government and the AFD about different alternatives took place, and
the most preferred option was to have a reduced size of the operation and to make it a blend of IBRD
and IDA resources – the latter decision was made to avoid rapid exhaustion of Vietnam‘s IBRD
exposure limit. The proposed operation would mobilize US$ 350 million, including US$ 87.3 million
in IBRD resources and US$ 262.7 million in IDA resources. In addition, AFD is expected to co-
finance an additional EUR 35 million.
74.      The policy actions under the operation are either complements or follow-ups of the prior
actions under PIR 1. All of the proposed measures concern public investment projects in general,
regardless of their source of funding and are organized around 12 main issues or problems to address.
Following PIR 1, those 12 issues are grouped under four main thematic groups: project selection,
project implementation, public financial management, and project oversight.




                                                  17
75.      Difference between the original triggers in PIR1 and the final prior actions for PIR2 is
summarized in Annex 5. Most of the changes are of editorial natures aiming to reflect more accurately
the content of the supporting documents related to the relevant policy actions. These changes do not
alter the substance of the prior actions and the reform objectives therefore have been kept unchanged.
76.     There are, however, two notable changes in the policy matrix (Annex-5). The most important
change is the trigger about the submission of Public Investment Law to the National Assembly for
review. Towards this objective, MPI has intensively worked on the preparation of a Law on Public
Investment. Several consultations with stakeholders, including the development partners, were held
and the draft completed. Yet despite MPI‘s efforts, a consensus about the inclusion of this law in the
proposed list of laws prepared by the government could not be reached and the draft law was not
submitted to the National Assembly in November 2010 for review. As a result, the formulation of a
Law on Public Investment has been dropped from PIR2 operation despite its importance. However, as
discussed earlier (paras. 49 and 50), it appears that the Cabinet has agreed on the inclusion of the
public investment law in its proposed list of laws to be issued in 2012 by the National Assembly.
Thus, there are 12 prior actions in PIR 2 operation instead of 13 as formulated in PIR 1.

77.     The second important change is with respect to trigger #13 in PIR1 (labeled as prior action #
12 in PIR 2) that required an approval of a Charter establishing an Association of Independent
Investment Evaluators. Instead of approving the Charter, which required more time, the government
asked MPI to issue two Circulars to establish standard templates for project monitoring reports and set
up the criteria legally required for individuals and institutions to carry out investment evaluation. In
addition, the Circular setting up the criteria legally required for individuals and institutions to carry out
investment evaluation is the legal pre-condition needed for the approval of the concerned Charter.

THEMATIC AREA # 1: PROJECT SELECTION

78.      Environmental screening. Only investment projects consistent with master plans are eligible
for funding by the state budget. According to the Law on Environmental Protection of 2005, key
master plans need to be informed by Strategic Environment Assessments (SEAs). But to date no
master plan has incorporated the recommendations of an SEA in Vietnam. Lack of effective SEA has
commonly been identified as one of the main reasons undermining the environmental sustainability of
public investment. Hence, one of the objectives of the proposed program is to review the experience
with SEAs and identify the main reasons why SEAs have not been conducted as mandated by the Law
on Environmental Protection. The second objective is to have a ―demonstration effect‖, whereby
hands-on technical assistance allows producing SEAs and mainstreaming environmental concerns in
the selected master plans.
79.     As of April 18, 2011, the prior actions for Environmental Screening have been completed. In
early 2010, MONRE submitted to the Prime Minister its SEA review report that includes
recommended policy actions to improve SEA preparation and use. MPI has produced SEAs reports
and master plans for all six geographical regions with technical assistance from the World Bank and
DANIDA. All the SEA reports have already been reviewed by the National Appraisal Councils,
chaired by MONRE. MPI has already revised the SEA reports for all six regions as per comments
received from the appraisal councils and submitted the revised reports to MONRE for clearance3. The
draft SEA report for the Power Master Plan, prepared with assistance from the ADB, has been
completed and circulated for consultation.

        The SEA report for one region has already been cleared by MONRE as of April 20.

                                                     18
THEMATIC AREA # 2: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

80.      Public procurement policies and practices are an important determinant of public resource
management effectiveness and performance. Vietnam's evolving public resource management
framework recognizes that sound and transparent public procurement policies are among the essential
elements of good governance. However, an assessment of Vietnam's public procurement system using
the OECD/DAC Baseline Information System benchmarking tool shows that the country meets the
rating requirements for only 3 out of 17 Core Sub-Indicators. Weak areas include eligible bidders,
opening of bids, evaluation criteria, contract negotiation, sole source and minimum time for bidding,
among others. Unfortunately, up to now no major breakthrough has been made in bringing the
Vietnamese legal framework for public procurement in line with international good practice. For
example, there is a need to control the over-reliance on direct contracting through clearly defined
conditions for use, rather than the current threshold method whereby all contracts under the threshold
may be awarded by direct contracting without limitation. In some cases, there are even setbacks, as
with the recent, substantial increase in the thresholds for direct contracting for consulting services,
works and goods.
81.      Bidding transparency. Direct interaction between investment owners and potential
contractors is a source of fiduciary risk. Impersonal, electronic interfaces, reducing discretion by all
parties, can in principle reduce processing times and increase transparency in procurement. The
government is taking important steps in this direction. Under the time frame of the proposed
operation, a regulation for the piloting of e-procurement in Hanoi and selected government agencies
was issued. Circular 17/2010 on e-procurement was issued by MPI on July 22, 2010 that includes
regulations on e-signature and digital certification. MPI also strongly encourage all other agencies to
adopt the e-procurement in their biddings. There is strong evidence of high interest in adopting e-
procurement by provinces and agencies which are not required to pilot the system. For example, Bac
Ninh People‘s Committee already decided to use the system for some of its procurement packages.
82.      Conflict of interest. The design and implementation of infrastructure projects is often
conducted by SOEs affiliated with investment owners. This is especially the case in Ministry of
Construction (MOC), which is in charge of a large fraction of infrastructure spending in Vietnam.
While many of the affiliated SOEs have been equitized, the exercise of ownership rights on behalf of
the state remains with the ministries in most cases. One way to solve this conflict of interest is to
transfer state ownership rights in construction companies out of MOC. The proposed prior action for
the operation concerns MOC and aims to transfer the exercise of state ownership rights in civil works
companies outside the ministry. In January 2010, the Prime Minister issued two Decisions about the
establishment of two State Economic Groups by merging State General Corporations which used to
belong to MOC. The Prime Minister further issued two Decisions in February, appointing the Board
members of these two groups. From July 2010, the two Economic Groups have been operating under
the Enterprise Law. The ownership rights will be exercised by either the Prime Minister himself or a
specialized agency while MOC only carries out state management functions. This change will help to
address the eligibility issues related to conflict of interest that used to prevent the enterprises of these
two economic groups participating in the bidding for construction work owned by MOC. In addition,
an equitization plan for the remaining general corporations with 100 per cent state equity under the
Vietnam Construction Economic Group has already been approved by the Prime Minister in
December 2010. According to the plan, the equitization of these general corporations will be
completed by 2012.

83.      Dispute resolution. The legal obligations of the parties engaging in civil works contracts are
not clearly defined, with disagreements often slowing down project implementation. This problem
became apparent during the inflation outburst of 2008. Unambiguous templates for standard contracts
under the Law on Commerce are needed. Contracting rules are currently regulated in a circular under
a decree. However, one year into its implementation, it became apparent that the circular did not
provide for adequate transparency, prompt settlement of disputes or removal of implementation
bottlenecks. This in turn resulted in excessively slow disbursements. In response to this situation, the
government has issued Decree 48/2010 in May 2010 on the Management of Construction Contracts.
The issuance of this decree constitutes a prior action for this operation. The Decree has contributed
significantly to clarify the rights and obligations of parties engaging in civil works contracts, and
MOC is in the final stage of issuing detailed templates for different types of construction contracts
under funding from an IDF grant.
84.      Environmental management. Environment Impact Assessments (EIAs) are often conducted
at a late phase in project preparation. Because of their poor quality, the associated Environmental
Management Plans (EMPs) tend to be weak. Delays and technical weaknesses arise because of
inconsistencies in the legal framework, allowing the submission of EIAs at the same time as
construction permits. According to the Law on Environmental Protection, the EIA should be an
integral part of the feasibility study for a public investment project. The independence of EIA
consultants and review authorities is supposedly guaranteed and public consultation is required.
However, inconsistencies in legal regulations and the lack of technical guidelines on the format and
content of EIAs and on public consultation procedures have undermined the process. In particular,
consultations usually take place with local authorities and representatives of mass organizations, but
do not often involve the population at large. To address these shortcomings, a prior action under this
operation is to replace two current but overlapping decrees by a new one mandating the timely
preparation and review of EIAs and EMPs so that they inform feasibility studies. This Decree also
covers the preparation and timing of SEA reports. Decree 29/2011 was issued on April 18, 2011 and
its preparation benefitted from technical assistance from the World Bank-funded CCBP (through MPI)
and from ADB.. The new Decree represents an improvement over their predecessors and is expected
to substantially improve the process of EIA and SEA preparation. However, it became evident that
some fundamental problems with the EIA process will require a revision of the Law on Environment
Protection, which is scheduled to be done over the next two years.

THEMATIC AREA # 3: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

85.      Reporting and control. Recording of budget revenue and spending is slower for ODA funds
than for state budget funds, due to the spending and reporting procedures of project implementing
agencies. ODA-funded projects are also subject to less frequent auditing by SAV, despite that fact
that it is already authorized to oversee ODA-funded projects as it would do with budget-funded
projects. However, in light of its growing responsibilities, SAV has been expanding its annual audit
plan in this direction only gradually. Addressing these shortcomings in public financial management
requires modifying several sub-laws. There was a prior action in PIR 1 about aligning the recording of
ODA funds in government accounts with the timing of actual receipts and expenditures for ODA-
funded projects. Because many ODA-funded projects are subject to independent audits, a prior action
for PIR 2 is to mandate the sharing of those audits with MOF and SAV. After several months of
consultation, including with development partners, MOF issued Circular 40/2011 on March 22, 2011
which amend some provisions of Circular 108. Circular 40 contains provisions about compulsory
sharing of audit reports with SAV.

86.     Administrative costs. Caps applying to consultant fees, travel costs, translation services, the
organization of workshops and other ancillary expenses are increasingly misaligned with the market.
This has resulted in an inadequate quality of project preparation and implementation. In addition, caps
on total preparation costs set in percent of total project costs have proven to be inflexible to
accommodate the diversity of projects. The caps applying to individual administrative cost items and
to overall project preparation costs are set by different ministries under different regulations. Under
PIR 1 operation, MOC has issued Decisions 957 (cost for project management), and under PIR 2, it
issued Decisions 1129 and 1161 (cost for construction work and repair) and Circular 04/2010 for
management of cost estimates for construction work. These documents clarify that norms for cost
estimates set in percentage of total project are to be used as reference only, and do not establish a cap
for budgeting purposes. Following the mandate of the Law on Amendments, MOF has already issued
a set of circulars, including Circular 01/2010 in January and Circular 97/2010 in July 2010 to align
cost norms related to project preparation and implementation with the market. The average increase of
the norms is about 70 percent and a further 20 percent in excess of the MOF norms can be approved
by authorized bodies. In special cases, the heads of the spending units can decide the specific level of
expenditures and are responsible for their decisions. The issuance of those documents by MOC and
MOF effectively completed Prior Action 8 for PIR 2 operation.
87.      Environmental budgets. In the case of environmental work, such as the preparation and
review of SEAs and EIAs the problem is not that cost norms are outdated, but rather that they were
never introduced. The absence of guidelines on admissible expenses has been one of the main
practical obstacles to compliance with the Law on Environmental Protection. To address this problem,
admissible expenses for review of SEAs and EIAs as well as their funding sources need to be
institutionalized; especially all spending for SEAs will be funded from state budget. At present, MOF
and MONRE have already issued Joint Circular 45 in March 2010 about the reviewing costs for SEA
and MOF has issued Circular 218 on December 29, 2010 for EIAs. The issuance of these Circulars
results in satisfactory completion of Prior Action 9 for the operation.
88.     Payment and disbursement. The Law on Amendments mandated the review of circulars
dealing with payment and disbursement procedures applicable to budget-funded projects. ODA-
funded projects also include some areas in which disbursement checks can be improved to streamline
payment processes and simplify payment-supporting documents. The prior action in this case is to
streamline payment procedures and simplify payment-supporting documents for ODA-funded
projects. This was also completed by the amendment of the Circular 108 with Circular 40..
89.      Subsidies and guarantees. Few public investment projects ensure full cost recovery and
hence are not attractive to private investors. Sufficient private participation in these projects requires
transparent mechanisms to bridge the viability gap in PPP projects. Such mechanisms need to
articulate when and how the viability gap is to be bridged by the state, and how to ensure that explicit
costs and contingent liabilities are minimized. In November 2010, the Prime Minister issued Decision
71 that sets up for the first time interim regulations for pilot Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects.
This represents an important step towards the establishment of sound legal foundation for PPP
projects, although there is room for improvement, particularly in the areas of specific provisions for
transparent and competitive selection of investors and a clear mechanism to provide government
contribution to PPP projects. Decision 71 puts a clear time frame of 3-5 years for its validity, during
which the MPI will regularly assess the implementation of pilot PPP project(s) to form the basis of
making revisions to the Decision. The Bank is currently supporting the preparation of the first pilot
PPP project in Vietnam, in the toll roads sector. The project will set an important benchmark for PPPs
in Vietnam, particularly vis-à-vis demonstrating a transparent Viability Gap Financing Mechanism
(VGFM) to increase the financial viability of PPP projects, and international standards of project
preparation by accessing professional, high quality transaction advisors. The pilot project will also
provide first learning opportunity to make improvements and revisions to Decision 71.

THEMATIC AREA # 4: PROJECT OVERSIGHT

90.       Monitoring and evaluation. Discrepancies and inconsistencies in project reporting
mechanisms across sectors and PMUs weaken accountability. In spite of various efforts to improve
the M&E of public investment projects, there is a clear fragmentation of the legal framework, with
some regulations referring to the general evaluation of projects across all sectors, others to individual
sectors and projects, others to community-based monitoring, and yet others to ODA-funded
investments. In addition, the stabilization program of 2008 spelled out clear criteria to stop or defer
the implementation of non-critical public investment projects. Strictly speaking, no new M&E
framework was introduced at that point; but the stabilization program marked one of the first instances
in which selectivity needed to be applied across the board. To address these problems, project
management should be strengthened by broadening the use of standardized monitoring tools to all
projects regardless of their source of funding and by relying more extensively on independent
evaluation of projects. Building on joint work between MPI and the six development banks, the prior
action in this case was to establish a consistent M&E framework including standardized monitoring
tools. The prior action in PIR 2 is about the issuance of Circulars that set up legal foundations for the
working of independent investment evaluators and the standard templates for project monitoring. MPI
has issued Circular 13 in June 2010 that covers the latter and Circular 23 in December 2010 that will
fulfill the first. Circular 23 is the legal foundation required by MOHA to approve the Chart for the
establishment of an association of independent investment evaluators.


                           VI.     PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

Overall impact

91.      Vietnam is widely acknowledged for its high and sustained poverty reduction. Poverty fell
from 58.1 percent of the population in 1993, to 28.9 percent in 2002, to only 14.5 percent by 2008, the
last year for which official poverty estimates are available.4 Preliminary estimates from the 2010
Vietnam Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) suggest that poverty is continuing to fall, albeit at slower
rate. Progress has been achieved without substantial increases in inequality, although poverty is
increasingly concentrated in rural areas and among certain social groups (viz. ethnic minority
populations). There are growing concerns about poverty and in particular vulnerability in Vietnam‘s
cities and peri-urban areas due to high rates of urban population growth (including a heavy influx of
migrant workers), excess demand for urban services, and a continuing rise in the cost of living. Urban
poverty is back on the development agenda.
92.      Public investment projects in infrastructure have made a substantive contribution to poverty
reduction in Vietnam. Not only is the volume of such investments very high, reaching or exceeding
10 percent of GDP, but it also has a very strong poverty reduction focus. A case in point is the rural
electrification program, the households now connected to the electricity grid. Local infrastructure
projects, such as those undertaken under the second phase of Program 135, which is targeted to the
most disadvantaged communes, have resulted in improved access to markets and better social services,

        Poverty data are based on the Vietnam Living Standards Surveys (VLSS) of 1993 and 1998, and on the
Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) carried out by Government Statistics Office (GSO) in
2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008.


                                                   25
having a clear impact of the livelihoods of some of the poorest population groups in the country.
Large-scale infrastructure projects, while having a more indirect impact on poverty, have enhanced the
business environment, thus contributing to significant job creation.
93.      Pro-poorness of public investment in Vietnam has recently been further enhanced by increased
decentralization in decision making and the establishment of a transparent set of progressive criteria
for allocation of investment expenditures from central budget to provinces. With increased autonomy
of local authorities and active participation of local communities, management of local infrastructure
development projects have improved considerably, resulting in better satisfaction of local demand. In
addition, the criteria for allocation of investment expenditure remain stable for five year plan period,
allowing the local authority to develop better vision for investment planning. More importantly, the
allocation is progressive and depends on several development indicators such as poverty rates, the
population of ethnic minorities or remoteness of location.
94.      Yet many of the local investments which have been so critical to poverty reduction are
unlikely to secure sufficient cost recovery. Investment costs in the remote and disadvantaged areas are
often higher, due to remoteness and small scale, whereas marginal returns are presumably lower. Low
returns of the majority of public investment projects imply that a substantial fraction of public
investments is bound to remain government-funded. The scope for private participation in these
projects is therefore limited unless there are appropriate legal and institutional frameworks that address
the viability financing gaps. By supporting the adoption of a financing framework for pilot PPP
projects, the proposed program is expected to contribute to a rising share of private investments in
infrastructure.
95.     From the above perspective, the proposed operation should have positive social impacts. That
is, given that public or private investment will contribute to poverty reduction, increasing the
efficiency of such investments should in principle be beneficial.
96.      However, some of the potential positive impact on poverty reduction through this operation
could be offset by higher than expected inflation in Vietnam. The domestic price of rice has risen to a
level comparable to mid-year 2008, the peak of the rice price crisis in East Asia. While analysis
suggests that many poor rural households benefit from higher food prices (they are net producers of
food), households in urban areas, also in food deficit regions like the Northwest and areas in the
Central Highlands, purchase rice and other food staples in the market at high costs. In addition to
rising food prices, the poor are paying more for basic services. Fuel costs are rising, and electricity
tariffs were increased by an average of 15.3 percent in 2011, with the aim of bringing them more in
line with market costs. Earlier PSIA work on electricity tariff reforms in 2009 indicated that, despite
tariff increases and a reduced lifeline band, electricity was affordable and widely available to most
poor households in Vietnam. However the number of households benefiting from lifeline tariffs was
sharply reduced in March 2011 and the lifeline tariff itself has increased by over 30 percent. The
government is putting in place a system to provide subsidies to poor households to help mitigate the
impacts of electricity tariff increases.
Land issues
97.      Investments in large-scale infrastructure typically require land acquisition, and the process of
compensation and resettlement is typically a source of grievances in developing countries. Recent
experience suggests that Vietnam is not an exception in this respect. There are no specific actions or
investments supported by the project that would result in acquisitions or resettlement but we
investigated the theoretical possibility of an indirect impact of greater amounts of resettlement taking
place in the country as a result of the project.

98.      The proposed operation is unlikely to lead to an increase in the overall volume of public
investment. Admittedly, the resources provided by the program will be used to finance the stimulus
package, and in particular to finance the implementation of critically important infrastructure projects.
However, the stimulus package basically aims at offsetting a decline in public investments, as a result
of a drop in revenue collection and the difficulties to issue more public debt on both domestic and
international markets. Official capital expenditure, not including off-budget items, is actually
expected to decline from 10.9 percent of GDP in 2009 to 7.4 percent in 2010.
99.     On the other hand, the actual implementation of Decree 69/2009/ND-CP, a prior action under
PIR 1 operation, should lead to substantial improvements in procedures for land acquisition and
compensation. This decree includes provisions on land-use planning, land prices, development of land
funds, land acquisition and compensation, and resettlement support. This decree includes the
management of land use zoning at four levels (national, provincial, district, and communal) requesting
a clear determination of land use indicators for wet rice cultivation, specialized-use forests, and
protective forests. To ensure that land valuation reflects market prices, the decree includes articles on
the relevant prices in the cases of land allocation, land lease, land reclamation, and SOE equitization.
Importantly, the decree prescribes the same valuation procedures for allocated land and land rented
from the state. This provision is expected to accelerate project implementation and to reduce the scope
for corruption.
100.     The most significant improvements introduced by this measure in relation to the social
impacts of investment concern compensation and assistance for affected populations. According to
the decree, those whose land is reclaimed are entitled to relocation and resettlement assistance in the
cases of residential land, and livelihood and production assistance, occupational training and job-
seeking assistance in the case of agricultural land. The decree clearly specifies the obligation of the
state to make up for any shortfall between the compensation received and the market value of the
property, allocating this responsibility to the relevant People‘s Committee. To speed up compensation
and assistance, the decree also adjusts and combines some requirements in the process of land
acquisition, allocation, and lease with existing construction and investment procedures. In doing so, it
aims to reduce the processing time by one half to one third.
101.     In summary, on land issues, based on a strong suite of analytical work carried out by the Bank,
no evidence that actual investments in infrastructure will increase under the project, and the policy
actions that will be actively reforming regulatory instruments in this area, it is concluded there are no
likely impacts in the area of land and resettlement.
Other Policies
102.    Other than the issue of potentially increasing land acquisition, a review of all the policy
actions and triggers under the proposed program was conducted to determine if there are other
potential social impacts. Those policy actions and triggers fall in one of two groups:

       Group A - Socially positive policy actions to upgrade consultation with affected populations.
        In the proposed program, several actions and triggers aim at improving the framework and
        practices of carrying out SEAs and EIAs. These are primarily environmental tools, but their
        strengthening has social implications as well. The mainstreaming of SEAs in master plans
        should result in reduced environmental degradation, and the poor are among the most directly
        affected by pollution or the loss of natural habitats. A timely implementation of EIAs
        involves consultation with affected populations, and this tends to enhance the voice of
        vulnerable groups. Therefore, these actions should all result in markedly positive benefits.




                                                   27
       Group B – Socially neutral actions. This group includes all the remaining policy actions
        included under the operation. None has been identified as being potentially socially
        detrimental.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

Overall impact
103.     The proposed program is likely to have an overall positive impact on the environment, forests,
and other natural resources. This is to a large extent because of the strong leverage exercised through
this operation to substantially advance the regulatory and legislative framework for SEAs and EIAs.
A number of environmental policy actions are included in the program precisely with the objective of
generating a significant positive environmental impact.              Others, while not being strictly
environmental, are also expected to result in positive externalities. A more detailed analysis, presented
below, was carried out to determine whether the proposed set of prior actions and triggers could have
significant effects, defined as environmental changes of sufficient magnitude, duration, and intensity
as to have non-negligible impacts on the natural resource base and on human welfare. A small number
of policy actions had some theoretically negative environmental impacts but were found to be neutral
on further analysis. The bulk of actions supported through the project are environmentally neutral.
104.    As argued in the section on social impacts, the proposed program aims at partially offsetting
the decline in government revenue as a result of the economic downturn, but it is unlikely to result in
an overall level of public investment (and thus environmental consequences) that would be different
from a baseline case. Even if this were to happen, the strong pro-environmental measures in the
proposed program should still ensure that the overall environmental impact remains positive.
Specific policies
105.     Environmentally, the proposed program of prior actions and policy triggers can be divided
into three groups as follows:

       Group A – Environmentally positive policy actions to update or improve environmental
        legislation. Prior actions and triggers in the areas of environmental screening, environmental
        management and environmental costs are intended to fill identified gaps in the country‘s
        existing environmental legislation. As a result of the policy interventions, environmental
        management practices in Vietnam will be improved. Regional and sectoral development
        strategies as well as specific investments can be expected to be more environmentally
        sustainable. Environmental impacts of future investment projects will be better assessed and
        addressed.
        To develop the proposed program, the Bank, in coordination with other international donors
        such as ADB and the Government of the Netherlands, over the last several years has provided
        technical and financial analytical support to improve environmental regulations and practices
        for impact assessments. Examples include the study on the Harmonization of EIAs for the
        Hanoi Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness (World Bank and ADB), the Pilot Strategic
        Environmental Assessment in the Hydropower Sub-sector in Vietnam (World Bank, the
        Netherlands Government and Birdlife), and the Strategic Environmental Assessment for the
        Development Master Plan of Red River Delta, 2011-2020 (World Bank). The Bank has also
        published a recent analysis of SEA in South-east Asia with a strong analytical section on
        Vietnam: Strategic Environmental Assessment in East and Southeast Asia: A Progress Review
        and Comparison of Country Systems and Cases. Additional analytical work was carried out in
        2010 as part of the preparation of the new decree. During this time ADB has also been

                                                   28
        carrying out an assessment of Vietnam‘s environmental policies and regulations as part of a
        country systems approach.

       Group B – Environmentally neutral policy actions. This group includes almost all of the
        policy actions and triggers in the proposed program.

       Group C – Policy actions with potentially detrimental environmental impacts. Of interest in
        this respect is the prior action related to conflict of interest, involving the transfer of state
        ownership rights in civil works companies under MOT to the SCIC. It could be argued that
        greater profit orientation may result in diminished attention to environmental mitigation
        measures, thus resulting in increases in negative impacts from their operations. However,
        regulations on SEAs, EIAs and EMPs will remain the same, regardless of who the contractor
        is affiliated with, and there are no solid grounds to claim that SOEs are more environmentally
        friendly than profit-driven companies.
        The prior action on land compensation could conceivably be seen as a driving force for project
        investors to convert natural habitats such as forested land, rather than accepting compensation
        costs for acquiring agricultural land. This potential impact is mitigated however by article 3
        of Decree 69/2009-ND-CP which regulates that zoning of critical forested land (catchment
        protection forest, specialized forests and natural reserves) is determined in country-level
        master plans and production forest land is determined at provincial level. The impact is also
        mitigated by article 29 of the Law on Forest Protection and Development, which regulates that
        conversion must be in accordance with the Land Law, Forest Protection and Development
        Law, and that project proposals (including environmental impacts assessments) must be
        approved by the authorized agency. Taking this into account, the Bank thus considers that the
        proposed program entails no risk of increased conversion of natural habitats.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

106.    Designing an appropriate results framework for the proposed program is challenging, given
the shortage of relevant precedents to build upon. Previous lending related to public investment
management is quite limited. Operations are often embedded in public financial management reform
or concern a specific operation or sector (such as roads, for instance). The proposed program departs
from existing precedents by combining the macroeconomic angle characterizing policy lending
operations with the microeconomic focus that is typical of investment operations.

107.     As previous operations have different scopes and development objectives, their results
frameworks do not particularly fit to the one for the proposed program. Operations embedded in
public financial management reform typically rely on outcome indicators for the performance of
public investment management which are tied with measurement of efficiency, transparency and
accountability of the overall public financial management system. These indicators tend to focus on
strategic upstream public investment programming, on its alignment with budget processes, and on
enhancing the associated regulatory framework. But broad indicators of this sort tend to be
qualitative, and usually do not cover implementation and monitoring issues. On the other hand, in
operations with a sectoral focus, outcome indicators for public investment management tend to
emphasize project implementation. These programs are generally designed with sufficient time frames
to allow measuring the outcomes of investment spending.




                                                  29
108.    The proposed program combines the short time span of operations with a public financial
management focus with the project dimension of operations with a sectoral focus. This results in a
temporal mismatch between actions and triggers on the one hand, and development outcomes on the
other. The proposed program would be closed when some of the key policy actions it supports could
only become effective.

109.     The monitoring framework (see Table 4) is proposed for the entire program (both PIR 1 and
PIR 2) and has already been revised from that in PIR 1 Program Document. In particular, indicator 1
(number of FDI re-registered firms) was removed. With the issuance of Decree 102 on October 1,
2010, the re-registration of FDI firms has become unnecessary even if they want to have operation in
areas not specified in their license. The framework should still be seen as work in progress, bound to
be refined through completion of relevant economic and sector work. Ongoing discussions with
experts and government officials in each area are being conducted to ensure that the preliminary target
figures provided are realistic. These tentative estimates should provide a sense of the potential impact
of the program.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

110.    Public Financial Management. Vietnam‘s public financial management (PFM) environment
is considered adequate to support this operation. The most recent Country Financial Accountability
Assessment conducted in 2007 concluded that ‗the financial management risk to proper use, control
and reporting of funds that are managed through the Vietnam public financial management systems is
assessed as moderate‘. The government has maintained strong ownership of the PFM reform agenda
and continues to lead a coordinated reform program in consultation with the donor community. While
the financial management and accountability systems of the government have improved, the risks
arising from weak implementation and compliance remain. The quality and extent of independent
audit oversight can be further strengthened by updating the audit strategies and methodologies of the
SAV to align with international practices, and through the development of an effective internal audit
function, which currently is only at an embryonic stage in Vietnam. A detailed discussion on the state
of PFM in Vietnam is in Annex 4.

111.    Foreign Exchange Environment. An IMF safeguards assessment has not been conducted in
Vietnam. This assessment would provide information about the foreign exchange control environment
of the SBV and integrity of financial information. The SBV is subject to auditing by SAV on an
annual basis, however under the current laws the audited financial statements and audit reports of SBV
are not made public. Notwithstanding these factors, the Bank/Association understands, following
recent discussions with the IMF, that there are no serious concerns with the SBV‘s foreign exchange
control environment.

112.    Flow of funds and auditing. To address the potential residual fiduciary risks related to the
foreign exchange environment, the Borrower/Recipient will maintain a dedicated foreign currency
deposit account (DA) at SBV in US dollars for the proceeds of the Loan/Credit, and will report on the
funds flow of the dedicated deposit account. The government will, if deemed necessary by the
Bank/Association, allow an independent external audit of the dedicated foreign currency deposit
account (DA).




                                                  30
113.     Disbursement. The proposed Loan/Credit will follow Bank/Association‘s disbursement
procedures for development policy lending operations. The Loan/Credit proceeds will be disbursed
against satisfactory implementation of the Program and not tied to any specific purchases, and no
procurement requirements will be needed. Various measures have been taken to ensure that the
overall fiduciary policies and institutions are adequate to proceed with support from the
Bank/Association and other development partners. The Borrower/Recipient will open and maintain a
dedicated Deposit Account in US dollars for the Borrower/Recipient‘s use once the Loan/Credit is
approved by the Board and becomes effective. The dedicated DA will form part of the country‘s
official foreign reserves. The Borrower/Recipient shall ensure that upon the deposit of the
Loan/Credit into said account, an equivalent amount in Vietnamese Dong is credited in the Recipient‘s
budget management system to be used for budget expenditures in a manner acceptable to the
Bank/Association. If the proceeds of the Loan/Credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the
Loan/Financing Agreement, the Bank/Association will require the Borrower/Recipient to refund the
amount directly to the Bank/Association. Amounts refunded to IDA shall be cancelled. The
administration of this Loan/Credit will be the responsibility of MOF.

114.     Reporting. The Recipient will report to the Bank/Association on the amounts deposited in the
foreign currency account and credited to the budget management system and on the timing of such
deposits and credits. The Recipient will forward the report within one month of receiving the letter
from the Bank/Association advising of the deposit, and the report will include: (i) statement of the
exact sum received into the dedicated DA and the timing of such receipts; (ii) confirmation to
Bank/Association that all withdrawals are for eligible expenditures; (iii) confirm to the
Bank/Association details of the Treasury account to which the Vietnamese Dong equivalent of the
Loan/Credit proceeds will be credited, the credited amount, and their timing, and (iv) a report on
receipts and disbursements for the dedicated DA.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

115.     Increased macroeconomic instability is one of the most important risks facing the proposed
program. Rising inflation, volatility in the foreign exchange market, slower than expected fiscal
consolidation, problems in the state-owned enterprises and health of the banking sector are some of the
key factors have contributed to this elevated level of risk. In recent months, and especially since mid-
February, however, there has been a distinct emphasis by the government to stabilize the
macroeconomic situation. The recently policy measures, especially Resolution 11, should help to
arrest further exacerbation of the situation and mitigate the macroeconomic risks facing the country.
Moreover, continuous monitoring of the macro situation, close collaboration with the IMF and
frequent discussion with the authorities on remedial options are other potential ways the risks are
being mitigated.

116.     There are potential operational risks arising from temporal mismatch between actions and
triggers on one hand and development outcomes on the other. This is because the operation has a
short time span (two years), but it addresses PFM/institutional reforms that are long-term in nature and
in Vietnam context, have a slow pace of implementation. So while measures will be adopted as
agreed in the operation, the specifics are such that their impact on efficiency and transparency of
public investments could be felt after considerable lag. Moreover, weak and delayed implementation
of good policies – a key challenge in Vietnam – could also dilute some of the impacts of this
operation.




                                                  31
117.     This risk is to some extent being addressed by the quality of the ongoing technical assistance
provided by the six development banks in several of the areas covered by the proposed program, and
by the World Bank and other development partners in relation to public financial management. Since
many of the measures supported by this operation are expected to improve the speed and quality of
public investment projects, including the projects financed by development partners, their
implementation is being closely monitored. In parallel, the importance of the proposed program to
sustain the economic recovery has increased the attention of senior leadership to the reforms covered
by the proposed program.

1.      Growth has remained strong through the global crisis thanks to the sizable
stimulus package, but macroeconomic stability has deteriorated and financial sector
risks have increased as monetary policy has remained accommodative.
     GDP growth accelerated in 2010, and is estimated at 6¾ percent for the year as a whole. At
        the same time, inflation rose to 11.8 percent y/y in December and further to 13.9 percent y/y in
        March 2011.
     Credit-to-GDP ratio reached 125 percent of GDP as credit growth remained high at 32 percent
        y/y in December 2010. Concomitantly, financial sector risks have risen, exacerbated by cross-
        holdings within the financial sector and ownership links to the corporate sector, in particular
        state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
     The current account deficit in 2010 narrowed significantly to 3.8 percent of GDP from 6.6
        percent in 2009, on the back of recovery in exports. Direct investment inflows remained
        robust and portfolio investment rose strongly, but high unrecorded outflows of $13.3 billion
        (13 percent of GDP), reflecting to a large extent foreign currency and gold hoarding by
        residents outside the financial system, have led to continued exchange rate weakness and
        further pressures on international reserves which stand at 1.4 months of prospective imports at
        end-2010.
     The overall fiscal deficit in 2010 is estimated to have reached 6½ percent of GDP, lower than
        the budgeted 7½ percent, owing to higher-than-projected revenues even as expenditures are
        also estimated significantly higher than budgeted levels.

2.       Against this background, the authorities have shifted their policy focus toward restoring
macroeconomic stability. After raising policy interest rates in several steps in late 2010 and early
2011, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) in February devalued the dong by 8.5 percent, while
indicating greater flexibility in adjusting the daily exchange rate. Subsequently, the government
announced a comprehensive stabilization package aimed at reining in inflation. Key measures for 2011
in the package include a reduction of credit growth to below 20 percent, proactive use of policy
interest rates, and a reduction of the budget deficit by around ¼ percentage point of GDP from the
budget plan. In addition, 10 percent of non-wage recurrent spending is to be frozen until the second
half of the year, and investments by the state and SOEs are to be reviewed, reprioritized, and in some
cases cut. The authorities have also announced plans to ban trading of gold bars to curb hoarding. cut.
The authorities have also announced plans to ban trading of gold bars to curb hoarding. To address
financial sector risks, the SBV earlier raised minimum capital requirements— though its application
has been postponed for some banks—and the capital adequacy ratio, and is introducing a limit on the
credit-to-deposit ratio.

3.       The stabilization package is a very important step in the right direction, but steadfast
implementation through concrete action, which may need to be stepped up, is crucial. The
revised credit growth target is appropriate to reduce inflation expectations and stabilize the exchange
rate in 2011. At the same time, more ambitious fiscal consolidation than currently planned would help
support inflation reduction and build cushions against potential contingent liabilities. If such a policy
package is implemented, IMF staff expect output growth in 2011 to slow down somewhat to around
6¼ percent, and inflation at end- 2011 to about 9½ percent y/y. The current account deficit is projected
to widen slightly, but remain more than covered by continued strong direct investment inflows.
Provided confidence in the dong is restored, international reserves are expected to recover somewhat
but remain low. Downside risks to this outlook include a further rise in international commodity
prices, and a slower growth in major export markets.

4.      Safeguarding financial sector stability is critical. In this context, the recent request for an
assessment under the Financial Sector Assessment Program is welcome. The SBV‘s new prudential
regulations are important steps, but enforcement is key. The SBV‘s credibility—and with it successful
management of sectoral risks—hinges on close onsite and offsite supervision of the financial sector
and strong enforcement of prudential norms.

                     Annex 4: Public Financial Management in Vietnam

Overview

1.     Over the past decade, Vietnam has made strides in establishing a sound public financial
management system. With the adoption of the first organic budget law in 1996 and its revision in
2002, a legal framework for public resource management has been put in place. A centralized treasury
system is being set up with branches extending from the center to all provinces and districts to provide
basic essential financial services to all government agencies. Steady progress has been achieved in
making the budget more predictable and pro-poor, and the budgeting process more transparent and
participatory. Substantial efforts have also been made in recent years to improve transparency in the
use of public resources through disclosure of information on detailed government spending as well as
expenditure policies, regulations and procedures.

2.     There is strong ownership in the Vietnamese Government of the PFM reform agenda.
MOF is currently engaged, as are other Ministries, in developing a reform strategy for 2011-2020. The
strategy aims at (i) maintenance of stability of public finances within the broader economy; (ii)
improved effectiveness of public sector expenditure in achieving policy and service delivery; (iii)
development of effective influence by government over key finance markets; and (iv) effective and
efficient resource mobilization to finance public expenditures. Support to the implementation of
reforms is coordinated through the PFM partnership group which overarches the activities of
government, donors, and working groups, meeting half yearly to discuss progress. There is ongoing
effort among donors to directly align their support with the mainstreaming government‘s strategies
and plans.

3.    PFM remains in the center of Public Sector reforms. Other focus areas are organizational
restructuring, pay and employment reform, and institutional development. The PFM reforms hinge on
seven priorities: budget management, revenue management, debt management, SOE fiscal risk
management, financial market supervision and government bond market development, public asset
management, and price management.

4.     The overall conclusion of the latest Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA 2007)
stated that PFM arrangements and their implementation and performance pose a moderate risk
that funds will not be properly controlled or used for intended purposes. The CFAA proposed a set of
recommendations to help the government design and continue implementing reforms and capacity
building programs to modernize and strengthen PFM and enhance transparency and accountability
arrangements in support of sound economic management and improved governance.

5.    Even though a series of analytical work, such as Public Expenditure Review (PER) or CFAA,
have been undertaken every three to four years, progress and impact of the PFM reforms and
development initiatives can only be measured by establishing an official monitoring framework, and
baseline performance measures. The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
measurement framework provides a recognized measurement of the performance of the public
financial management of government. Similarly, the Debt Management Performance Assessment
(DeMPA), adapted from the PEFA framework, but is focused on debt management issues, would
provide a baseline assessment of debt management capacity. Although the government has agreed in
principle to introducing these measurement frameworks through pilot self-assessment process in 2011
(PEFA) and 2012 (DeMPA), no firm decision on detailed timeframe and commitment of resources
have been made.

6.    Within the MOF, the number of technically-qualified and experienced managerial staff needs to
be increased to meet the reform challenges of the Ministry. Support is needed for Capacity building
across sectors and sub-national government to implement decentralized PFM reforms.

Recent Developments and the Way Ahead

7.    PFM Legal and Institutional Framework. The CFAA reported that since 2004,
implementation of the 2002 State Budget Law and the 2005 Accounting Law has progressed and a
State Audit Law has been enacted. However, it also noted that some confusion and overlap in budget
responsibilities remain in the budgeting system which is limiting the participation of sectors in
resource planning, budgeting and budget management and confuses accountabilities between the
national and sub-national levels. Furthermore with the redevelopment of the government accounting
systems and regimes, the Accounting Law is no longer adequate and needs revision, and the basis for
accounting needs to be better defined, however there is no clear plan at that this time to revise the
Accounting Law. The State Budget Law will be revised and re-submitted to the National Assembly in
2012, expectedly including a number of critical changes to state administration in Vietnam such as
enhanced decentralization to sub-national government and adjusted fiscal authority of central vis-a-vis
sub-national tiers of government in budget approval.

8.     PFM information systems. The Treasury and Budgetary Management Information System
(TABMIS) will progressively address difficulties in monitoring a fully-consolidated budget as well
as the fiscal position. TABMIS has been developed since 2007, piloted in 2009, and recently rolled-
out to MOF and treasuries and financial agencies in 35 out of 63 provinces. Fifteen largest spending
line-ministries are getting ready to use TABMIS to conduct budget allocations for 2011. It is expected
that the system will become fully operational in 2012 upon its nationwide roll-out. TABMIS will
provide the capability to record and control commitments, improve cash management and arrears
management, and strengthen expenditure management and controls. There are initial staged plans for
TABMIS consolidation and expansion, in both terms of both functionality and coverage, towards the
Integrated/Government Financial Management Information System (IFMIS).

9.    Public accounting regulations. In parallel with TABMIS project, a unified Treasury and
Budgetary Chart of Accounts has been developed to provide consistency of classification of revenues
and expenditures in budgeting, accounting and reporting with expenditures classified on an
administrative, economic and functional basis. This will facilitate accurate and timely financial
reporting, and the flow of budgetary information between government ministries provinces and the
public. For future TABMIS expansion, development of a unified and uniform chart of accounts for the
public sector (including the Spending Units) is now envisaged. A staged roadmap for adoption of the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) is also being developed to align
government accounting regimes and practices with international standards.

10. Budget Development & Execution. Vietnam‘s budget coverage is reasonably comprehensive
but still incomplete compared to international practices. Budget gaps arise from the lack of clarity in
the state budget coverage of user fees and charges of many service delivery units, lack of integration
or disclosure of the financial positions of public financial funds, untimely and sometimes inadequate
incorporation of donor financing, and off-budget government bonds. Budget execution variations arise
from such practices as revenue underestimation particularly for crude oil revenues, keeping the state
accounts open after year end with post year expenditures recorded against previous year unused
budgets, and over implementing construction and development plans. Separate preparation of the
recurrent and capital investment budgets hampers effective management of resources and the
composition of public expenditure remains unbalanced.

11. Public expenditure is planned annually and also for medium-term over five year periods but the
linkage between the two remains weak. The ongoing revision of the State Budget Law introduces
Medium-Term Fiscal and Expenditure Framework, to be mainstreamed in the annual budget cycle.
There are also initial discussions on reforming budget planning toward output- and program-based
budget elaboration.

                                                  48
12. Off-budget-balance expenditures, i.e., expenditures not counted in the calculation of the
budget deficit, include government bonds issued to finance infrastructure projects and education
facilities, recapitalization of entities such as the Vietnam Development Bank or the Vietnam Social
Policy Bank, and borrowings by sub-national governments and their affiliated entities such as local
development funds. However, these so-called off-budget expenditures in Vietnam can be considered
on-budget in several respects. They are included in the budget that is reviewed and approved by the
National Assembly, and their execution was done through the Treasury and subject to the same
disclosures and scrutiny as standard budget expenditures. There are attempts under the ongoing
revision of the State Budget Law to adjust budget structure and coverage to be more in line with the
international norms.

13. Contingent liabilities might be arising from these ―off-budget-balance expenditures‖ and other
implicit sources. A systemic definition and a reliable estimate of such contingent liabilities are not
available, which limits the government‘s ability to manage such risks properly. More broadly, as
Vietnam is reaching middle-income status, it will need to engage more long-term finance from both
domestic and external sources. Under the recently improved debt management, initial attention from
the government on risk management and monitoring of contingent liabilities has been observed. Given
the recent default of one of the largest state owned Economic Groups (Vinashin), MOF is planning to
strengthen monitoring of fiscal risks from the SOEs. However, although considered as the country‘s
lead agency for national and public debt management, MOF has not yet prepared an inventory of
government contingent liabilities from various sources, due to lack of necessary legal framework, poor
data availability and limited assessment capacity.

14. Revenue administration. Customs controls are still considered low in productivity,
inconsistent and vulnerable to corruption. The Customs administration will need to change
significantly, shifting its mindset from a culture of domestic protection and control of all transactions
to one that facilitates foreign trade and promotes private sector development. The tax administration is
also characterized by low compliance and vulnerability towards corruption. Five areas of tax
administration have been identified as in need of special attention: (1) the fragmentation of the legal
framework related to tax administration; (2) the absence of effective coordination and information-
sharing between the tax administration and other government agencies; (3) taxpayers‘ lack of
knowledge about the tax laws and compliance procedures; (4) inadequate professional skills and
training of tax administration; and (5) information technology system which is lagging behind the
requirements of a modern tax administration. In addition, tax laws and policies will need further
reforms to broaden the tax base, and to reduce the number of rates and exemptions. Reforms in the
management of revenue are progressing with clearer allocation rules and decentralized responsibilities;
however classification of revenue in line with international standards needs to be introduced, and
enhanced consultation on revenue targets is needed to improve the quality of revenue budgets.

15. Public debt management has improved both in terms of legal framework and institutional
arrangements. The Debt Management Department was established in May 2009 with the role of a
modern debt management office under the MOF. Although not all of the tasks relating to public debt
management have been consolidated to this Department, the organizational structure of the department
is similar to the debt management office according to international practices, with 6 divisions
functioning as front office, one division performing the middle office functions, and one division
performing the back office functions. Meanwhile, the first-ever Law on public debt management was
approved by the National Assembly in June 2009 and came into effect in 2010. The Law introduced
substantial reforms in managing and monitoring comprehensively public debt and government
commitments (including domestic sub-national debts and on-lending), and addressing many
weaknesses in the public debt management in Vietnam. A series of guiding decrees were adopted in
2010 to facilitate the implementation of the law. Special attention is now paid to strengthening risk
management and developing forward-looking debt management strategy and program.

16. Financial market supervision and the government bond market. At present, many agencies
participate in financial market supervision, leading to overlapping responsibilities and ineffective
management and supervision. There is a need to consolidate market supervision functions into a
single agency and to separate state management and supervision functions. Vietnam‘s government
bond market is still small scale, low liquidity, and the maturity structure is skewed toward short-term.
The number of market participants is relatively small and supporting infrastructure, such as
depository, clearing and information systems, is yet to be developed. Therefore, considerable efforts
are required to develop a full-fledged government bond market and coordinate it with development of
related markets such as capital, security and real estate. A bond market development roadmap is being
prepared towards these visions.

17. The government‘s PFM reform program highlights that state assets budget resources and human
resources need to be managed in an integrated way for efficient and effective service delivery, and
reforms are being gradually introduced. The legal framework and market principles in asset
management were recently adopted under the Law on State Asset Management. The requirements for
management reporting systems are being defined, but reform in this area has been slow. Initially,
attention is needed for developing consistent and comprehensive asset accounting and asset
management policies in line with international standards and practices. Further study will be carried
out in 2011 to determine the most appropriate solutions to address the government‘s accounting and
asset management requirements.

18. Independent scrutiny of PFM has significantly increased, with external oversight of budgetary
affairs by the National Assembly and the recently independent State Audit of Vietnam (SAV). The
functional committees and deputies of the National Assembly, and the local People‘s Committees have
been given greater prominence in examining, decision-making and oversight of the state budget. There
is steady expansion of external audit coverage and quality, and legislative oversight. Encouragingly,
the SAV audit report was made public for the first time in 2006, and regularly since, triggering serious
debates where are broadcasted live on the usage of state budgets. However, the capacity of these
institutions, especially the SAV, is limiting the coverage and scope of audits. It is difficult for the
SAV to manage the increasing workload including compulsory audit for 100 percent of SOEs, and to
consider the move towards performance audit. Significantly, the SAV has recently approved an
ambitious and comprehensive strategy to 2020 (with accompanying implementation plan to 2015)
aimed at upgrading its capacity across the key areas of organizational and legal framework, human
resources, audit planning and methodologies (including performance audit), information technology,
and external relations.

19. The country‘s public financial management system has a range of internal oversight
mechanisms. In the past, the focus was on inspection rather than systematic review to provide regular
and timely feedback to the management on the use of public resources. Internal auditing is an
important element of a sound public financial management system, which helps increase effectiveness,
efficiency and financial control. This issue becomes even more important if the government intends to
decentralize further to the local levels. The legal and institutional frameworks for the organization and
operation of internal audit are being developed. Although implementation will be challenging, this has
been a very encouraging step towards establishing a sound internal audit system in Vietnam in the
coming years.

20. Vietnam has increased its level of fiscal transparency. Budget plans and budget execution
accounts are being made available publicly, and there is increasing compliance with reporting
regulations. However there is still room for improvement, particularly in relation to consistency in
quality of reports and their timeliness. The draft budget plan should be disclosed before National
Assembly‘s approval. To enhance the quality of financial reporting, consistency between budget and
accounting classifications needs to be maintained. The number of budget execution reports needs to be
rationalized. Content and presentation of financial information needs to be improved in line with
                                                   50
existing government regulations in the publicly available budget execution reports to make them more
informative. Enabled by TABMIS, MOF has committed to, by 2013, publish monthly and more
disaggregated budget execution reports on MOF website 15 days after month end, as opposed to the
current practice of publicize quarterly and aggregated report 45 days after quarter end. In addition, the
government is establishing a State Accounting General function, and working toward producing and
issuing annual financial statements, including cash and asset information, in line with international
practices. The annual final accounts need to be issued faster than the current 18 months, e.g. 9
months, after year end to enhance their relevance to the discussions on the budget of the subsequent
year.

21. Good progress has been made in establishing legislation and the environment for greater
financial accountability and transparency of financial information. Regulations on financial
disclosures of the State Budget Law, Accounting Law and State Audit Law have been issued
increasing the scope and range of required disclosures by entities at all levels of government.
Information is being made available on public accessible websites. However, implementation remains
the challenge. To further increase transparency, the content of budget documentation and the final
accounts could be enhanced by including analysis, explanations and information in line with
international practices. Disclosure of financial information, particularly spending at unit level should
be actively monitored to ensure compliance with the enhanced disclosure requirements. Published
financial reports should be timely, and a calendar for disclosures issued publicly.
