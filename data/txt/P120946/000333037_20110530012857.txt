           The Executive Directors approved a Loan and Credit for the Second Public
Investment Reform Development Policy Operation for the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in the
amount of US$ 87.3 million, and SDR167 million (US$262.7 million equivalent) respectively,
on the payment terms and conditions set out in the President’s Memorandum (R2011-0106;
IDA/R2011-0145).

        Executive Directors expressed support for the objectives of the operation, which aim to
raise the effectiveness of public investment through better project selection, implementation,
financial management and oversight. They noted that the operation is closely aligned with the
Vietnam’s Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and consistent with the Bank’s
Country Partnership Strategy. Directors asked for further clarification on the status of the Law
on Public Investment and stressed the importance of its timely passage. They noted the strong
analytical underpinnings of the operation and welcomed the collaboration between the Bank,
development partners and the authorities.
