           Investment Reform Project for Vietnam were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Ratings for the Second Phase of\n            the 135 Programs Supports Credit Project was as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the One-Two Public\n            Investment Reform Project were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: excessive flexibility regarding the policy\n            content of a programmatic series weakens the program.\n            Although flexibility is an important feature of Bank policy\n            lending, there is room for striking a better balance between\n            flexibility and rigor. Inclusion of partially met triggers\n            as prior actions should be considered with particular\n            caution. Greater willingness on the part of the Bank and\n            other external partners to withdraw their support for weakly\n            implemented reform programs and unproductive policy dialogue\n            can strengthen the content and outcome of future operations.\n            The delays in the second operations of P135 and PIR, and\n            PRSC 10 appear to have reflected concerns with program\n            quality, which, however, were only adequately resolved in\n            the case of P135. Arguments for budget predictability under\n            the Paris Declaration are less relevant in Vietnam due to\n            relatively small share of budget support in public\n            expenditures. A strong knowledge base is of critical\n            importance for upstream design of reforms and parallel\n            technical assistance to support their implementation.\n            Selectivity helps to adapt knowledge products and technical\n            assistance to the most pressing needs in a timely manner."}, "docdt": "2015-06-30T00:29:00Z"}
