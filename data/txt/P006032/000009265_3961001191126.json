commercial role; (b) expand\n            opportunities for mobilizing greater private enterprise\n            investment in the sector; (c) strengthen the\n            government's hydrocarbon policy making and regulatory\n            capabilities; and (d) support energy conservation and\n            bolster the government's efforts in developing and\n            enforcing environmental and safety standards. Technical\n            assistance will be provided to prepare engineering designs\n            and specifications to support YPFSA's and the\n            government's investment program in the areas of: (a)\n            enhancement of primary, secondary and tertiary hydrocarbon\n            recovery in YPFSA fields; (b) natural gas processing and\n            storage facilities expected to be put in place by private\n            investors; and (c) improvement of YPFSA's petroleum\n            processing and marketing in terms of dispatch centers and\n            export infrastructure. The institutional strengthening\n            component will provide technical assistance to: (a) design\n            and implement YPFSA's financial information,\n            procurement, taxation and accounting systems to function as\n            a private corporation, define environmental policies, and\n            provide related staff training; and (b) develop in the\n            Combustibles Subsecretariat of the Ministry of Economy the\n            capability to oversee sector policy and regulatory\n            activities and negotiate contracts for exploration and production."}, "docdt": "1991-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
