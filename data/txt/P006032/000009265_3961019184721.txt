IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR)
ARGENTINA
HYDROCARBON ENGINEERING PROJECT (LOAN 3416-AR)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Hydrocarbon Engineering Project in
Argentina, for which Loan 3416-AR in the amount of US$28.0 million equivalent was approved on
November 19, 1991 and made effective on June 9, 1992. The borrower was YPF Sociedad An6nima
(YPFSA), the former state-owned national oil company.
The last disbursement was on July 5, 1994 and the outstanding balance was prepaid on
September 15, 1994. The loan was closed as scheduled on July 31, 1995.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Andrew Waldrop, LAIIU, under the supervision of Mr. Ricardo
Klockner, Task Manager, and was reviewed by Mr. AsifFaiz, Chief, LAlIU, and by Mr. Orville Grimes,
Project Adviser, LA1DR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun in August 1994. It is based on material in the project file,
interviews with Bank staff, and information provided by the borrower.
A draft of this ICR was sent to YPFSA and the Government for their review. Their comments
are included as an appendix to Part I of the ICR.

Evaluation Summary
HYDROCARBON ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN 3416-AR)
ARGENTINA
Introduction
Hydrocarbon and Adjustment Loans to Argentina. The borrower of Loan 3416-AR
(US$28.0 million, 1991) is Y P F Sociedad An6nima (YPFSA), a privately-owned corporate successor
to the state-owned oil company (para.. 1). The Bank has loaned Argentina since 1980 US$651
million, including Loan 3416-AR for hydrocarbon development, and about US$1.5 billion between
1989 and 1993 for adjustment operations to restructure and stabilize the economy. It makes sense
to think of Loan 3416-AR as serving both the efficiency objectives of a normal engineering project
and the privatization objectives of adjustment operations.
Project Objectives and Definition
Objectives. To help YPFSA privatize, the project aimed at improving the efficiency of YPFSA.
To further mobilize private participation in the newly liberalized hydrocarbon sector, the project aimed
at strengthening the capacity of the Fuels Secretariat (Sub-Secretaria de Combustibles-- SC) for
overseeing sector policy and regulatory activities and for negotiating contracts for exploration and
production. The project also supported SC's efforts to develop and enforce environmental standards in
the sector (para. 6).
Definition. The project consisted of engineering studies (Parts 1-3) and technical assistance
(TA--Part 4). The studies were to: improve/enhance recovery of crude oil and natural gas (Part 1);
construct natural gas processing plants and define the adequacy of a geological formation for storing
natural gas (Part 2); and enhance the capacity of certain plants and facilities (crude oil processing, export
infrastructure, and marketing plants--Part 3). Under Part 4, to benefit SC, consultants would: establish a
hydrocarbon development promotion unit, and develop a manual setting forth sector-wide environmental
standards. In connection with the unit, consultants were expected to train staff and transfer from
YPFSA a national data bank on oil acreage in Argentina. To benefit YPFSA, there was also an
institutional strengthening component (para. 7).
Special Covenants. Except for a timetable governing the execution of the studies, the Loan
Agreement did not include special covenants for project execution.
Evaluation. The project objectives were compatible with sector and macroeconomic objectives
and achievements of prior investment and adjustment loans. The loan documents clearly stated the
objectives which were consistent with the country development objectives and the Bank's lending
strategy (para. 9).



iii
Implementation Experience & Results
Achievement of Objectives. Although the project was reduced in scope, the components
carried out by YPFSA (Parts 1-3, plus some of Part 4) substantially achieved their privatization
and efficiency objectives, and these achievements appear to be sustainable. Under Part 4, SC
achieved part of its environmental objective through the development of standards for development
drilling operations. It remains to be seen how the environmental standards will be enforced and
whether additional standards will be developed for other operations (such as exploratory drilling).
SC did not establish a hydrocarbon promotion unit and did not transfer the national data bank from
YPFSA. In the opinion of SC, the existing policy framework was achieving satisfactory private
participation in the sector; hence, the unit was not really needed. Lack of physical space at the SC
was the reason for not transferring the data bank. The Bank accepts SC's judgment on not
establishing the unit but the wisdom of not transferring the data bank remains to be seen (paras. 10
and 12).
Timetable, Cost, and Financing. The project started six months late--June 11, 1992-- due
to bureaucratic delay on the part of the Argentinean authorities; the project ended five months
early--July 5, 1994, with the last disbursement. Underlying the early completion date was YPFSA' s
growing disinterest, following its privatization, with Bank financing which was considered non-
competitive with what was available in commercial credit markets. The actual project cost was
US$19.1 mnillion vs. the forecast cost of US$23.9 million; and Bank financing amounted to US$8.3
million vs. the forecast of US$12.8 million. The forecast cost and financing have been adjusted to
reflect the reduction in the scope of the project. The original project cost was US$40.1  million,
which was to have been financed with a Bank loan (US$28.0 million) and funding from YPFSA and
the Government (US$12.1 million) (paras. 8, 13, and 15).
Factors Affecting Project Implementation. Factors affecting implementation included a
reduction in project scope (see above); the privatized status of YPFSA, which caused it to end its
relationship with the Bank and prepay Loan 3416-AR (September 15, 1994); and SC's progressive
disinterest, due to reduced need, in establishing the hydrocarbon promotion unit. These factors affected
the project timetable, cost, financing, results, and sustainability of achievements under the project (para.
11).
Performance. With the objectives of the studies benefiting the YPFSA and SC substantially
achieved and likely to be sustained, the performances of YPFSA, SC and the Bank should be judged
"satisfactory" (para. 20).
Assessment of Outcome. Given the gains of privatization and greater efficiency at YPFSA,
satisfactory private participation in the sector, and the establishmnent of partial environmental standards
at the SC, the outcome of the project merits an overall rating of " satisfactory" (para. 21).



iv        ,
Future Operations and Lessons to be Learned
No Further Projects. As a private company, YPFSA has access to commercial credit markets
in a way that was not possible in the past. Given such access, the Bank is not planning future operations
in the hydrocarbon sector (para. 22).
Key Lessons. The efficiency gains under this project provide no obvious lessons. The
privatization of YPFSA demonstrates the importance of commitment on the part of political authorities
to the objectives of the project. The privatization of YPFSA also demonstrates that, in connection with a
multi-loan, economic stabilization and restructuring operation, it is important that the Bank ensure that
the successive loans properly "link" in order to advance or achieve the final objective(s) of the operation.
Another lesson relates to the realities of a privatized sector. The retention of the data bank by YPFSA
may be perceived by other oil companies as a sign of preferential treatment on the part of the
Government and may lead them to defer needed investment in the sector. In retrospect, the Bank should
have impressed on the SC the importance of transferring the data bank from YPFSA to a neutral location
with open access to all interested parties. This would have the impact of enhancing competition in the
sector and would remove concerns of preferential treatment of YPFSA by the Government (para. 23).






ARGENTINA
HYDROCARBON ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN 3416-AR)
PART I: FINDINGS AND LESSONS
A. Background
1.    The Borrower. The borrower of Loan 3416-AR is Y P F Sociedad An6nima (YPFSA), a
privately owned oil company (since July-September 1993), which became the corporate successor (on
January 1, 1991) to the state-owned oil company (Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales--YPF).
2.    Political and Economic Context. During the 1970s and 1980s, Argentina, a rich country,
struggled to reverse a slow economic decline resulting, in part, from its statist economic approach. In
1989-1990, the Administration of President Menem initiated reforms to stabilize and restructure the
economy. The stabilization reform focused on reducing the government deficit. The restructuring reform
emphasized market forces, private initiatives, reducing the role of the state, and improving the
performance of public enterprises (PEs) which accounted for about 10% of the GDP and 50% of the
annual government deficit. Supporting these reforms was a Bank program of adjustment and technical
assistance (TA) loans which exceeded US$1.5 billion (through 1993).
3.    Hydrocarbon Loans. To restructure the economy and to secure future energy needs, the
Government began preparing the hydrocarbon sector and YPF for, respectively, deregulation and
commercial operations, reorganization, and privatization. Concerning key issues, the Bank provided the
Govemment with financing for TA and studies, including: (1) the institutional strengthening component
of the Gas Utilization and Technical Assistance Project--GUTA (Loan 2592-AR, US$70.9 million,
1985); (2) the corporate strategy component of the Public Enterprise Reform Project--PEREL (Loan
3292-AR, US$23.0 million, 1991); (3) the energy sector reform conditions of the Public Enterprise
Reform Adjustment Loan--PERAL (Loan 3291-AR, US$300 million, 1991); and (4) the engineering
studies and TA of the Hydrocarbon Engineering Project (Loan 3416-AR, US$28.0 million, 1991).
4.    GUTA, PEREL, and PERAL. At appraisal, the institutional strengthening component of the
GUTA included an organizational review of YPF to streamline decision-making and to improve
operational efficiency; and improvements to its financial management systems. To advance the program
of privatizing PEs (para. 3), the objectives of the organizational review were expanded to include the
identification and analysis of key financial and institutional issues, including how to assure a good
reception for YPF shares on local and intemational equity markets. The GUTA studies produced a
diagnosis for restructuring and the identification of assets (non-core) to be sold'. Building on the GUTA
studies, the PEREL studies examined the strategic plans of the restructured YPF and defined needed
changes to its legal regime and relationship with the Government. The PERAL extended the
achievements of the GUTA and PEREL by conditioning the release of a " floating" (or undated) energy
The study on restructuring led, inter alia, to a reduction of employees from 40,000 to 10,000. The
study which assessed and identified core and non-core activities led to the disposal of pipelines,
refineries, storage facilitates, etc. Also financed under Loan 2592-AR were the design and
implementation of a new, comprehensive accounting system which became operational in 1993.



2
sector tranche (US$75.0 million) to, inter alia, the approval of a new charter providing for financial and
operational autonomy, divestiture and privatization of non-core assets, and increasing private ownership
of YPF.
5.    Milestones. On January 1, 1991, YPF was converted into a stock corporation (YPFSA) with
the shares held by the Government. (The same month, work began on the subject engineering project.)
Seventeen months after conversion, the Government began to fulfil the conditions for release of the
energy sector tranche. First, it enacted (September 24, 1992) new legislation (Law 24.145) which
established YPFSA's new corporate charter, thereby laying the foundation for restructuring and
privatization. Then, it disposed of non-core assets, still leaving YPFSA with a dominant position in the
sector2. Finally, at the beginning of February 1993, it commnitted itself to the near-terrn privatization of
YPFSA On February 17, 1993, the Bank, satisfied that the release conditions had been fulfilled,
disbursed the tranche and closed Loan 3291-AR. In July 1993, the Government sold 46% of YPFSA's
common stock (first offering) on domestic and international equity markets, and in mid September 1993,
an additional 22% (second offering) with the result that a majority of YPFSA's stock was in private
hands. The privatization of YPFSA resulted directly from TA financed by Loan 3416-AR and the prior
achievements of Loans 2592-AR, 3291-AR. and 3292-AR..
B. Project Objectives and Definition
6.    Objectives. The proposed project aimed to improve the efficiency of YPFSA's operations,
thereby helping YPFSA make an effective transition to its commercial role and eventual privatization;
and strengthen the capacity of the Fuel Secretariat (Sub-Secretaria de Combustibles--SC) to regulate the
hydrocarbon sector; and support its efforts to develop and enforce environmental standards in the
sector. The project was also expected to improve SC's capacity to mobilize private participation in the
newly liberalized hydrocarbon sector.
7.    Definition. The project consisted of engineering studies (Parts 1-3) and TA (Part 4). Part I
studies were to improve/enhance crude oil and natural gas recovery. Part 2 included studies to construct
natural gas processing plants and to define the adequacy of underground storage facilities for natural gas.
The underground storage study was to be jointly executed by SC and YPFSA. Part 3 studies were to
enhance crude oil processing, upgrade export infrastructure, and automate marketing plants. Under Part
4, to benefit SC, consultants would help to: establish a hydrocarbon development promotion unit which
would auction oil acreage and operate an exploration data bank; train staff for the unit; and develop a
manual establishing sector-wide environmental standards. To benefit YPFSA, consultants would
redesign the management information systems (MIS), especially the budgeting and accounting systems,
and monitor the environmental impact of projects identified in Parts 1-3. Also benefiting YPFSA was a
component for overseas management training.
8.    Cost, Timing and Mode of Execution. At an expected cost of US$40.1 million, the project
was to be executed between December 15, 1991 and December 30, 1994. Typically, the engineering
studies were to be executed in three phases: (i) data collection/system design; (ii) preparing/issuing bid
documents; and (iii) evaluating bids/awarding contracts.
2  After restructuring, YPFSA accounted for 40% of national oil production, 60-70% of refining capacity, 50-60% of
sales of hydrocarbon products, and 60% of the gas production market.

9.    Evaluation. The project objectives were compatible with sector and macroeconomic objectives
(para. 3) and achievements under the GUTA, the PERAL, and the PEREL (paras. 4-5). As set forth in
the loan documents, the objectives were clearly stated; they were also important, appropriate to the
development of Argentina, and consistent with the Bank's lending strategy.
C. Achievement of Project Objectives
10.   Assessment. If the achievements of TA/engineering projects are indicated by the actions taken
on the basis of consultant recommendations, then YPFSA substantially achieved its objectives (para. 6).
For example, based on the results of Part 4, YPFSA introduced its shares on domestic and international
stock exchanges; and based on the results of Parts 1-3, YPFSA discarded or adopted investment
options and installed or planned to install works. Improved efficiency, it is assumed, follows from the
completion of such works, although the degree of improvement cannot be measured because no
indicators were established at appraisal. SC did not establish a hydrocarbon promotion unit and did not
transfer the national data bank from YPFSA, but, by setting a proper policy framework--rules for
privatization and other regulatory norms--it prompted, to its satisfaction, private participation in the
sector, which was the result to be expected from establishing the hydrocarbon promotion unit. The Bank
accepts SC's judgment on not establishing the unit, but the wisdom of not transferring the data bank
remains to be seen. SC achieved part of the objective of developing environmental standards; and a
regulatory unit, the Federal Hydrocarbon Agency (FHA), is contemplated in connection with an
amendment to the Hydrocarbon Law (Law 17.319). Economic benefit calculations were not applied to
the project.
D. Major Factors Affecting Project Implementation
11.   General. Factors affecting implementation included a reduction in project scope; YPFSA's
changed status as a private company; and SC's progressive disinterest in establishing the hydrocarbon
promotion unit. SC found that a proper policy framework was sufficient to prompt private participation
in the sector and that it did not need to create the hydrocarbon promotion unit. Because of their impact
on one another, it is convenient to relate the reduced project scope to cost reductions; and the changed
status of YPFSA to the changed composition of financing and to the early project completion date.
(a) Changes: Project Content and Cost
12.   Project Content: As compared with what was planned at appraisal, the completed project was
reduced in scope through the deletion of major items in Parts 2 and 4. The reduced project was then
further diminished through the non-completion of studies in Parts 1 and 2 due to altered circumstances.
There was a partial offset to the reduction in scope and non-completions by the addition of TA from
investment bankers (Part 4). As shown later, to compare actual and forecast costs meaningfully, the
forecast costs have to be adjusted to reflect the impact of the deletions (see Schedule 1). Set forth below
are details on changes to the project and the actions taken based on the recommendations of the
consultants.
(i) Part 1. Because more was accomplished under existing contracts financed by Loan 2592-
AR than had been expected, the Part 1 studies, as completed, involved less work and less cost (-54.5%)



4
than anticipated, but, nonetheless, led YPFSA to install telemetric control systems and to continue
studying an implementation plan for tertiary recovery.
(ii) Part 2. YPFSA did not complete the study of the gas treatment facilities at the Lotena
fields and the related study of dew point separators. Initial investigation showed that further investment
was not worthwhile. SC (which excluded YPFSA from participation in the study for underground gas
storage) deleted the study due to considerations of cost and doubts about whether the study might be
more appropriately carried out by private investors. Foregone expenditure on the storage study
amounted to US$9.96 million. Because of the discontinued studies on the Lotena fields, the actual cost
of Part 2 was 65% less than the expected cost (adjusted for deletion of the storage study) .
(iii) Part 3. These studies focused on improving refinery operations, export facilities, and
automating storage and dispatch plants. Following the completion of feasibility studies on changing the
capacity of certain pipelines, YPFSA took no action because the pipelines were sold to other investors.
The other studies resulted in YPFSA's discarding, installing or advancing the preparation of works. The
actual cost was 13.5% less than expected.
(iv) Part 4: SC. Under Part 4, consultants prepared a manual establishing environmental
standards for development drilling, and completed an initial study of SC's organization. SC is using the
manual, but the manual(s) relating to exploratory and production drilling are pending. Since, in the
opinion of SC, a proper policy framework was prompting satisfactory private participation in the sector
(para. 17), the hydrocarbon promotion unit was not established. Total expenditures were 19.1% greater
than expected.
(v) Part 4: YPFSA. YPFSA reduced the project scope by deleting the overseas training
component and the TA to install an improved MIS. With Bank agreement, YPFSA added the advice of
investment bankers to advance the introduction of its shares on equity markets. The foregone
expenditures for training and the MIS amounted to US$4.76 million. Consultants established
environmental monitoring programs related to only a few projects identified in Part 3. As compared with
forecast costs adjusted to reflect the deletion of TA for MIS, actual Part 4 expenditures by YPFSA
were 126.3% higher. (In late 1993, YPFSA discontinued discussions about the possibility of Bank
funding for a study of further improvements to the accounting/budgeting system--expected cost: US$4.0
million.)
13.   Cost. Without adjustment to take account of the reduction in project scope, the forecast cost
(US$40.1 million) is not comparable with the actual cost (US$19.1 million). After adjustment for
reduction, the actual and forecast projects are reasonably comparable, and, as shown in Schedule 1, the
adjusted (reduced) forecast cost (US$23.9 million) is comparable to the actual cost (19.1 million).

** Reduction of original forecast: US$4,760 thousands representing the expected cost of TA (never executed) for,
respectively, the installation of a modem management information system (US$4,000 thousands) and training
(US$760 thousands).
(b) Changes: YPFSA, Financing and Timetable
14.    YPFSA as a Private Company. Following the first offering (July 1993--para. 5), YPFSA and
the Bank began to prepare for loan negotiations on a proposed oil industry environment rmitigation
project. In this connection, the Bank sought the agreement of YPFSA to more stringent financial
performance covenants (a quick ratio not less than 1.2:1 and a debt/equity ratio not less than 40:60) than
had prevailed in earlier loan agreements on the grounds that the more stringent covenants were
appropriate to borrower's changed status as a private company in a competitive world. YPFSA objected
that the proposed covenants were too onerous and that the terms and conditions of the proposed Bank
loan were not competitive with what was available on international credit markets. The Bank and
YPFSA did not find common ground on this issue. Accordingly, YPFSA halted (August 1993)
preparations for negotiations, and, thereafter, progressively limited its applications for disbursements
from Loan 3416-AR. The last disbursement was on July 5, 1994; YPFSA prepaid (September 15,
1994) the outstanding balance. How the changed status of YPFSA impacted on project financing and
the project completion date is set forth below.
15.    Composition of Financing. While reductions in the scope of the project led to reductions in
project cost, and therefore the level of financing, the composition of such financing reflected the decision
of YPFSA to limit the use of Bank funding. Schedule 2 shows actual Bank financing at US$8.3 million;
YPFSA/SC furnished the balance of US$10.8 million. Reduced due to changes to the project, the
corresponding appraisal forecasts were, respectively, US$12.8 million and US$11.1 million. (At
appraisal, the sources of financing were: the Bank, US$28.0 million; YPFSA/SC, US$12.1 million).

16.    Timetable.  At appraisal, the expected period of execution was December 15, 1991 to
December 30, 1994. Due to bureaucratic delays after loan negotiations, the project actually began six



6
months late--June 11, 1992, when the first consulting contraet was signed. The project ended about five
months early--July 5, 1994, on the occasion of the last disbursement from Loan 3416-AR (para. 14).
(c) Reduced Need for the Hydrocarbon Promotion Unit
17.   SC. Under Part 4, SC employed consultants to study its organizational needs; but did not
transfer the national data bank from the YPFSA and did not establish the hydrocarbon promotion unit.
Concerning the national data bank, the transfer was not effected due to lack of space at SC Without
such transfer, SC passes requests of potential bidders for information on available acreage to YPFSA.
Concerning the unit, its creation was initially delayed because, in the context of lean government
budgets, the SC was obliged to secure reliable funding from non-government sources if the unit were to
achieve operational status. This did not happen, with the result that the creation of the unit languished.
However, as time passed, it became clear to SC that the unit was not really needed, that the objective of
improved private participation was being satisfactorily met through the rules for privatization and such
regulation as promoted competition among the natural monopolies of the sector.
E. Project Sustainablity
18.   YPFSA. Provided that the works resulting from the project are properly maintained and
operated, there is every reason to believe that the efficiency improvements which they embody shall be
sustained over the economic lives of the works. YPFSA's status as a private company is also likely to be
sustained, as its profitability, market standing, and competitive position are strong. Further, a political
decision to reintroduce state control seems remote at this juncture. Concerning environmental
protection, while quantitative data are not available to measure the benefits of avoided environmental
damage, presumably the benefits remain (or are sustained) since they originated in connection with
project construction and should not disappear as a consequence of project completion.
19.   SC.   Part 4 led to the preparation of an environmental standards handbook for development
drilling. The objective of increased private participation in the sector was achieved to the satisfaction of
SC without establishing the hydrocarbon promotion unit and without the transfer of the national data
bank from YPFSA. SC's progressive disinterest in the promotional unit seems justified, but the wisdom
of leaving the national data bank at YPFSA remains to be seen.
F. Performance
20.   The Bank and the Beneficiaries. Results under the project are the starting point for judging
the performance of parties to the project. As the objectives of the studies benefiting the YPFSA were
substantially achieved and appear likely to be sustained, so the performances of YPFSA and the Bank
should be judged satisfactory. Since the objectives of the TA benefiting SC also appear to have been
achieved, the performance of the government should be judged satisfactory. The same judgment should
apply to the Bank.
H. Assessment of Outcome
21.   A Good Project. Results with respect to the studies and TA benefiting YPFSA and SC were
positive. Hence, the outcome of the project merits an overall rating of " satisfactory".



7
I. Future dperations
22.   No Further Projects. As a private company, YPFSA has access to commercial credit markets
in a way that was not possible in the past. Given such access, the Bank is not planning future lending
operations in the hydrocarbon sector of Argentina.
J. Key Lessons Learned
23.   Key Lessons. The efficiency gains under this project provide no obvious lessons. The
privatization of YPFSA demonstrates the importance of commitment on the part of political authorities
to the objectives of the project. The privatization of YPFSA also demonstrates that, in connection with a
multi-loan, economic stabilization and restructuring operation, it is important that the Bank ensure that
the successive loans properly "link" together to advance or achieve the final objective(s) of the
operation. Another lesson relates to the realities of a privatized sector. The retention of the data bank by
YPFSA may be perceived by othe oil companies as a sign of preferential treatment on the part of the
Government and may lead them to defer needed investment in the sector. In retrospect, the Bank should
have impressed on SC the importance of transferring the data bank from YPFSA to a neutral location
with open access to all interested parties. This would have the impact of enhancing competition in the
sector and would remove concerns of preferential treatment by the Government.

Appendix to Part I: Comments of YPFSA and the Government
Note: Respectively dated December 6 and December 14, 1995, the comments of YPFSA and the
Government have been edited as indicated with brackets to improve their clarity or to achieve
editorial consistency with the rest of Part I. The Government's corrections of Part II (Table 6)
concerning the work of consultants have been directly incorporated into Part II and are not set
forth below. Also not set forth below is the Government's disclaimer concerning facts and
judgments on that part of the project executed by YPFSA.
Comments of YPFSA: "After examining the above mentioned report, YPFSA has no important
comments to make about the development of the Project.
"However, we are pleased to express our satisfaction with regards to the Bank's
performance and to thank [the Bank] as well for the assistance offered every time it was
requested."
Comments of the Government: "[Set forth below are].. .the comments of the Subsecretaria de
Energia... Obviously, these comments relate only to the component financed by the World Bank
and carried out by Subsecretaria de Combustibles (SC).
"The first [comment] is a general [one--namely] that the Federal Hydrocarbon Agency
(FHA), which is... cited in the [subject ICR], is an institution contemplated in the [proposed]
amendment of Law 17.319, the Hydrocarbon Law. [Currently,] Law 17.319 is being amended by
National Congress. Therefore, pending completion [of] the amendment process by the National
Congress and its promulgation by the National Executive Power, the FHA [does not exist] and
shall not function.
"The consultant ['X'], who carried out part of the study financed by.. .Loan 3416-AR, only
outlined the tentative organizational structure of the FHA, assigning a reduced part of its time and
resources to [such study]. To implement the FHA, the execution of a deeper [organization] study
...shall be necessary; [and] until the amendment [of the Hydrocarbon Law] is approved, the SE shall
not [take action on the study.]
"On various pages of the ICR..., it is stated that the objective of the project was [only]
partially achieved or inadequately completed because it was believed that the...the hydrocarbon
promotion unit [was not created] within.. .the SC. Also having not formed the promotion unit, it is
doubted that the objectives of attracting private participation in the petroleum and natural gas
industries can be reached.
"Concerning the [above, the following] should be said:
"a) The authorities of the SC decided, having reevaluated the [concept] of the... unit, that it
would be more useful for energy policy... .to assign the funds for the reorganization of the SC to the
training of personnel.. through courses [offered locally or abroad].



9
"b) It is difficult to believe that the non-creation of the... .unit is going to affect the success of
petroleum policy in the sense that the private sector would not be part of the development of the
sector. Energy policy in the developed area of hydrocarbons.. .consists of establishing rules for the
deregulation of 'upstream ' petroleum and natural gas activities and [of establishing] regulation [to
promote] competition in areas characterized by natural monopolies. [Such rules and regulations]
are the unique conditions for success, as has been shown by production increases for natural gas
and petroleum and by increments of investments in 'upstream' and 'downstream' [facilities]. To
maintain that, without the Unit, there [are inadequate] incentives [to attract] the private sector to
complete investments in exploration and development seems to be a [chancy proposition].
"Another question meriting commentary is that the national data bank, which... contains in-
formation on exploration..., belongs to the Secretaria de Energia and not a private company. The
data bank is located at YPFSA because... the Secretaria... [lacks sufficient physical space]; but it is
required that other companies interested in [exploration activities] have access to the data bank on
conditions equal to that of YPFSA."

1/ One minor criticism which applies to all parties pertains to the choice, made during negotiations, of December 15, 1991
as the starting date for the project. Given that negotiations began on October 8, 1991, the negotiators allowed only eight
weeks for completing the tasks relating to loan processing (Board approval, loan signing, and effectiveness) and the signing
of consultancy contracts (agreement on "short" lists, evaluating proposals, negotiating contracts). Clearly, this represented
an unrealistic estimate of the efficiency of all parties. Fortunately, the choice of December 15, 1991 was not a major factor
affecting the timetable of project implementation. The late start reflected the fact that after Board approval (November 19,
1991) YPFSA and the Govemnment did not move promptly to fulfill their own bureaucratic requirements for loan signing
(March 12, 1992) and effectiveness (June 9, 1992).

S   Bank telexes to YPFSA, dated respectively 04.14.92 and 04.16.92, indicated " no objection" to extension of existing contracts.
6    On 04.08.93, Bank informed YPFSA that under Loan 3416-AR it would only finance that portion of the contract covering the field work; and would not finance the
storage and pumping stations. The Bank reconfirmed its position in a communication to YPFSA dated June 21, 1993.
7   After YPFSA renegotiated the contract to expand the scope of services, Bank limited its disbursements to apply to only those services defined in the original
contract.

'1   On 10.06.93, Bank agreed to reduce scope, and therefore the cost, of consultant services.
I   This study was supposed to determine the security and useability of a geological formation for underground storage of natural gas. The formation was referred to
as the Beazley Canyon. If found acceptable, the Beazley Canyon formation would have provided natural gas storage at a location convenient for serving metropolitan
Buenos Aires.
