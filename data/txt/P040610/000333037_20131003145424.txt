1.1 Context at Appraisal
The Rajasthan Water Sector Restructuring Project (RWSRP) was consistent with the Bank’s
2001 Country Strategy, which focused on strengthening the enabling environment for
development and growth as well as supporting critical interventions to benefit the poor. The
project promoted more sustainable development and use of Rajasthan's increasingly scarce
water, particularly for agriculture, which accounted for 33 percent of state gross domestic
product (GDP) and 70 percent of employment. More specifically, RWSRP sought to increase
the productivity of irrigated agriculture through improved surface irrigation and strengthened
agricultural support services and, hence, the efficiency of how agriculture uses water.
Embedded in the project’s theory of change was that achieving these goals would contribute
to sustaining agricultural and rural growth in the state, improving rural incomes, and
reducing poverty in rural areas. This was considered especially important for Rajasthan as the
rural sector accounted for 77 percent of the population, the majority (74%) of which were
poor. Improving water resources management and agricultural performance were therefore
considered to be critical in reducing poverty in the state.
India's largest state geographically, Rajasthan was (and is) a low-income state, and had, at
appraisal, about 10 percent of the country’s land, 5 percent of its population, and 1 percent of
its water resources. Rajasthan was (and is) a desert state, where agriculture accounted for 83
percent of water consumption, and increasing water scarcity was punctuated by frequent
droughts. According to the Government of Rajasthan’s (GoR) Water Resource Vision 2045
(1999), the state had 16.05 billion meter3 (bm3) of economically usable internal water
resources, 17.9 bm3of external surface water from other states under various agreements, and
7.4 bm3 of replenishable ground water. Projections at the time indicated rapidly increasing
demand for water for domestic and industrial use, and they recognized that the state did not
have the water required to serve all of its irrigable land (approximately 100 bm3). The critical
challenge was to ensure that Rajasthan could better manage the long-term sustainable use of
its increasingly scarce water resources, particularly by improving the efficiency of water use
for agriculture.
The main sectoral issues identified were: (a) weak capacity and uncoordinated effort among
water sector departments – Water Resources Department (WRD),1 Ground Water (GWD),
Indira Gandhi Nahar Project (IGNP) and Command Area Development and Water Utilization
(CAD&WUD) – to carry out integrated planning, allocation, and sustainable management of
water resources; (b) a weak regulatory framework for managing water resources; (c) poor
management practices in the operation of irrigation systems, leading to inequitable and

 This was formerly the Irrigation Department and was renamed Water Resources Department during the
Project. The ICRR will use the department’s current acronym, WRD.

unreliable water availability, low water use efficiency, low agricultural productivity, and
rising water tables resulting in waterlogging and salinity; (d) financially unsustainable
delivery of water services resulting from high recurrent cost dominated by salaries and low
cost recovery; (e) lack of beneficiary participation in scheme management; (f) weak
agricultural support services in irrigated areas; (g) unsustainable use of groundwater in a
number of areas, driven in part by low electricity tariffs for groundwater pumping; and (h)
weak institutional capacity for resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R).
The Bank had extensive experience working with Rajasthan to develop different sectors. In
the rural sector, experience with other Bank-assisted projects in forestry, diversified
agricultural support, and rural water supply and sanitation provided valuable experience for
grassroots and participatory approaches to rural poverty alleviation.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The PDO had 2 distinct elements which were to: (a) strengthen the capacity for strategic
planning and sustainable development and management of surface and groundwater
resources in Rajasthan; and (b) increase the productivity of irrigated agriculture through
improved surface irrigation systems performance and strengthened agricultural support
services, involving greater participation of users and the private sector in service delivery in
Rajasthan.
Key Performance Indicators at appraisal2 were:
      1. State Water Resources Planning Department (SWRPD) established and fully
         functional
      2. preparation and application of integrated and environmentally sustainable river basin
         plans in the 4 highest priority basins
      3. full implementation and evaluation of 3 community ground water pilots and
         development of sustainable ground water management strategy
      4. rehabilitation of canal irrigation system in about 620,000 ha area
      5. operational efficiency improved by 5 percent in rehabilitated canal irrigation systems;
      6. increase in irrigated area up to about 90,000 ha
      7. up to 620 well-functioning and financially sustainable water user associations
         (WUAs) established
      8. full funding of O&M program on a needs basis
      9. improve water charges collections to 90 percentage of assessed charges per annum
      10. increased yields (up to 20 percent for cotton, mustard, and wheat)

11. increase farm household incomes per year (up to about Rs 20,000, Rs 15,000 and Rs
    5,000 in major, medium and minor schemes, respectively)
The PDO did not change when the additional finance (AF) was approved in March 2010;
however, some targets were revised (see below for more details).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The PDO of the original project did not change during implementation of the original credit
or with the additional financing approved in March 2010. No key performance indicators
(KPIs) were dropped during implementation of either the original credit or additional
financing; however, the targets for some of the KPIs were revised from the original project
appraisal document (PAD) at the time of the additional finance:

schemes, respectively)                           schemes, respectively)

The purpose of providing additional financing in 2010 was to enhance the project’s impact
and development effectiveness through (a) scaling up of certain activities and completing the
balance works; and (b) undertaking some new activities (within the original project
components) to consolidate the overall water resources planning and irrigation service
delivery improvements, and in this context, the original PDO was considered appropriate.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
PAD estimated that the project would directly benefit 250,000 farm families and stimulate
additional demand for labor of about 29,000 jobs per year, equivalent to about 8.7 million
person-days per year. The agreement for AF estimated 8,285 additional farm families would
benefit and the additional demand for labor would be 2,610 jobs per year, equivalent to 0.8
million person-days per year. Most of the labor requirement would need to be satisfied by
hired labor, which opens greater employment and income opportunities for the landless.
Other downstream, off-farm employment generated in transport, marketing, and agro-
processing was not quantified. Construction of civil works for the project was expected to
generate an additional temporary five-year increase in labor demand in the project area.
The formation of WUAs in the irrigation schemes was expected to effectively involve the
farmers in irrigation system management and to empower the rural population, including
poor people, women, and disadvantaged people. Formation of community groups in
groundwater pilots was expected to involve the community in groundwater management.
Improved environmental management capacity would benefit the communities by reducing
pollution, preventing water-related diseases, and improving public health.

1.5 Original Components
The project consisted of the following three components:
Component A: Water Sector Institutional Restructuring and Capacity Building

This component supported: (A1) establishment and capacity building of SWRPD; (A2)
modernization of management information system (MIS); (A3) water resources research
fund; (A4) information, education, and communication (IEC) programs; (A5) capacity
building for sustainable ground water management; (A6) piloting commercialization of
surface irrigation; and (A7) strengthening of R&R institutional capacity.


                                             4
Component B: Improving Irrigation System Performance
This component supported: (B1) formation and fostering of WUAs; (B2) participatory
rehabilitation of selected irrigation schemes; (B3) strengthening agricultural support services;
and (B4) dam safety works.
Part C: Project Management

This component supported project management unit (PMU); project monitoring and
evaluation (M&E); training and consulting services; and incremental recurrent expenditures
under the project.

1.6 Revised Components
At the mid-term review (December 2005), GoR proposed to drop:
   1. Subcomponent A6: Piloting commercialization of surface irrigation canal system on
      about 6,000 ha areas;
   2. rehabilitation of three irrigation schemes with total culturable command area (CCA)
      of 18,079 ha under Subcomponent B2; and
   3. dam safety work on six dams under Subcomponent B4.
These changes did not affect the overall project design and the team and the government
agreed that the project development objectives could still be met. The Bank agreed with
GoR’s proposal and confirmed this through Bank’s Management Letter of March 23, 2006.
In 2008, the funds from the canceled activities were reallocated to the rehabilitation of the
right bank main canal of the Chambal scheme, a new activity under Sub-component B2 of
the project at the request of the GoR. This was confirmed by the Bank’s Management letter
of July 3, 2008.
Under the additional financing approved by the Bank in March 2010, the following new
activities were added to the original project components:

Component                                        New Activity
Component A         Up gradation of the hydrological information system (HIS)
                    Rehabilitation of Bhakra canal system adding about 50,000 ha of
                    additional area
Component B
                    Installation of Automatic Water Measurement and Recording System
                    (SCADA) on pilot basis
Component C         Water sector studies
The additional finance also scaled up some ongoing activities from the original credit. With
the additional finance, the Bank and the Borrower agreed to revise some of the KPIs targets
as described in Section 1.3 above, as reflected in Section F of the Data Sheet, and described
in Annex 2.

                                               5
1.7 Other significant changes
To finance the Tsunami Emergency Reconstruction Project SDR 9.948 million were
cancelled from the original credit RWSRP in accordance with a request from the
Government of India (GOI) dated April 29, 2005. A further SDR 6.6 million was cancelled
in 2008, when there was some reallocation of the remaining credit. An additional credit of
SDR 12.4 million was approved by the Board in March 2010.
The closing date was extended three times. Leading up to the original closing date of 31
March 2008, GoR requested a 2-year extension to enable it to complete the balance on-going
works for orderly closure of the project. Implementation had been hampered in the first 2
years of the project due to issues beyond the control of GoR, including: (a) a severe drought
in 2002-03, which diverted department staff and administrative machinery for drought relief
works; and (b) State Assembly elections in 2003 and 2008, and National Parliament elections
in 2004 and 2009, which triggered the model code of conduct and diverted project staff to
election duties. Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), GOI approved the request in
principle but it was agreed to grant the extension in two 1-year phases, with phase 2
contingent upon progress achieved during the first extension year. The first extension year
was from 31 March 2008 to 2009. After sufficient progress in the first year, the second phase
of the extension was granted on March 26, 2009. The third extension took the form of an
additional financing, which extended the closing date from March 2010 to March 2013.
Although the project used about 95 percent of the estimated project cost (in INR), including
the AF, a credit amount of SDR 18,366,693.08 was cancelled at the end of the project due
to: (a) devaluation of INR against SDR during the project period; (b) use of grant money
available to the GoR under the European Union State Partnership Program (EU-SPP) from
January 2007 onwards for software activities, including studies under Component A; and
(c) savings from the non-implementation of HIS and SCADA activities under the
additional financing. As mentioned in earlier paragraphs, the impact of these credit
cancellations on achieving the PDO was marginal.

                2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Key factors and issues on quality at entry. The rationale for the Bank's involvement was
strong and the PAD comprehensively analyzed the background issues to justify the Bank's
intervention. The PAD drew well on lessons from earlier projects and followed the spirit of
the World Bank’s Water Strategy (1993 and 2003 versions). This strategy shifted the
emphasis of investment from discrete infrastructure development to a multi-sectoral approach
with a greater focus on policy, institutional, human development, and improved service
delivery as well as on financial resources for sustainability of systems.
Assessment of Project Design. The project PDO had two distinct elements - institutional
development and improved irrigation service on the ground – and focused on outcomes for

                                              6
which the project could reasonably be held accountable. The KPIs listed in Annex 1 of the
PAD were appropriate to the PDO.
The original project had two main components divided into eleven subcomponents, almost
all of which were generally appropriate, 3 though some were complex (for example,
subcomponent on piloting commercialization of surface irrigation). The Additional Financing
added implementation of HIS with a view to strengthen the existing system in the state, under
Component A; rehabilitation of Bhakra canal system in about 50,000 additional area; and
installation of SCADA on pilot basis under Component B; and some studies under
Component C of the original project. The motivation behind adding these activities was
sound.
GoR demonstrated its commitment to the project during preparation by adopting the State
Water Policy in 1999, which gave the framework for much of the institutional aspects of the
project (such as separation of overall water resources planning from service delivery and
participation of WUAs in the irrigation management). It also completed a State Water
Resources Plan, constituted a State Water Resources Council and a Standing Committee on
Water Resources, adopted a water sector R&R policy, doubled water charges in April 1999,
and passed the Rajasthan Farmers' Participation in Management of Irrigation Systems
(RFPMIS) Act in 2000.
The following key risks to achievement of PDOs and its sustainability were identified at
appraisal: (a) extent of commitment by GoR and sector institutions to the reform agenda; (b)
inadequate funding of O&M; (c) failure to provide timely and adequate counterpart funds;
(d) delayed action on the restructuring of the water departments; (e) failure to establish
effective inter-departmental coordination and project management arrangements; (f)
ineffective project management; and (g) failure to establish adequate incentives for long term
viability of WUAs.
Quality at entry was not measured.

2.2 Implementation

a. Factors outside the control of Government or implementing agencies
Following the Tsunami in December 2004, SDR 9.948 million was cancelled from the Credit
and reallocated to Tsunami Emergency Reconstruction Project in April 2005. Changes in the
rate of exchange between the SDR and the INR justified cancelling a further SDR 6.6 million
from the Credit in March 2008. Four major elections at the state and federal levels in 2003,
2004, 2008, and 2009, forced the stoppage of procurement under the project for a period of
about three months in each election cycle as per the election model code of conduct,
reallocated most of the officers and staff in the state to election duties, and resulted in delays.

3
    A possible exception to this was Subcomponent A7, R&R, which did not relate to anything else in the project.



                                                        7
b. Factors generally subject to Government control
SWRPD was established by GoR through a Cabinet Decision in October 2006, and it became
fully functional in January 2008. A recruitment freeze has been successful in cutting the
numbers of staff in WRD and GWD but has resulted in a shortage of technical staff.
Although the original State Water Policy of 1999, and the revised State Water Policy of 2010
state that the Government shall introduce the periodic revision of water rates and tariff
structures to enable the full coverage of O&M expenditures, GoR has not revised water
charges for the irrigation since June 2004. There seemed to be a marked reluctance on the
part of GoR to employ consultants, causing delays in awarding contracts for the MIS and
M&E, and contributing to the non-implementation of the HIS and SCADA.

c. Factors generally subject to implementing agencies' control
The rehabilitation of canals seemed to get off to a good start with 83 percent of the contracts
awarded (by estimated value) within the first year of project (by October 2003). However,
dam safety works started more slowly due delays in finalizing flood hydrology, which
required the approval of the Central Water Commission (CWC), GOI. There were additional
delays in finalizing remedial measures. There were inordinate delays in awarding contracts
for the management information system MIS and M&E. The contract for MIS was not
awarded until March 2008, close to the originally planned closing date for the project. GWD
was also slow to award consultancies for the groundwater component.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization
Design: Progress against KPIs was to be monitored as an integral part of project
implementation. In addition to quarterly M&E, an external agency was to be contracted to
carry out more in-depth and quantifiable M&E of project outcomes.
Implementation: The base line survey was completed in 2001. The PMU prepared regular
progress reports based on data provided by the implementing agencies; however progress on
M&E was hampered by delays in contracting and interruptions in M&E contracts. The PMU
was required to engage an M&E agency by 30 June 2003; however, it did not contract the
M&E agency until 2005. The agency produced five monitoring reports and an impact
assessment in 2008, with findings derived from a comprehensive survey in 2006/7 among
900 households in 30 irrigation schemes in the project area. This provided good information
on a number of subjects that were not otherwise measured during routine monitoring
activities. However, the contract of M&E agency ended in October 2009 and a new contract
for M&E was not issued until September 2010. The final M&E report by the M&E agency
was received in May 2013. In addition, the Agriculture Department (AD) employed a firm to
monitor activities related to agriculture from 2005 to 2011, after which they used the
framework created by that firm to conduct their own surveys up to kharif 2012.
Utilization: Monitoring of physical and financial progress was used in regular project
reports. Information collected by the monitoring consultants has been used in this ICRR.

                                              8
Much of the monitored information is based on data from 75 percent of the irrigation
schemes in the project, as data in remaining schemes were incomplete. Based on the delays
in awarding contracts for M&E agency and delays in development of the MIS, the sense of
ownership of the M&E system by the government appears to be low.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
At appraisal, the safeguard policies triggered by the project were environmental assessment
(OP/BP 4.01), pest management (OP 4.09), indigenous peoples (OP/BP 4.10), involuntary
resettlement (OD 4.30) and safety of dams (OP/BP 4.37). There are no issues with
compliance to the above policies. Based on the Bank’s Operational Policy (OP) 4.01, the
project category at the time of preparation and approval was “A” and involved a full
environmental assessment (EA), so GoR completed a sector environmental assessment
(SEA). The summary EA – including resettlement and rehabilitation (OP 4.12), tribal
development strategy (OP 4.10), and environmental management framework, environmental
management plan (EMP) and performance indicators based on the SEA study and public
consultations – was integrated as part of project design. As per OP (4.01), the project ensured
environmental mainstreaming in water sector projects through preparation and
implementation of project specific “environmental management guidelines and action plan”
and state specific “field operational manual on environmental management”. Under OP 4.09,
integrated pest management (IPM) and integrated nutrient management (INM) strategies
were prepared and implemented.
The implementation of physical works under the project did not trigger any resettlement
issues as per OP 4.30. Nevertheless, GoR adopted an R&R policy for the state’s water
resources development projects, and established a dedicated Directorate for Resettlement and
Rehabilitation to implement the R&R policy. Under OP 4.10, a tribal development strategy
was agreed for the project, and tribal development plans (TDPs) were prepared and
implemented for the 20 irrigation schemes under the project where members of scheduled
tribes constituted more than 25 percent of WUA members.
Sixteen dams were included under the project for dam safety works at appraisal. As required
by the OP 4.37, GoR had constituted an independent Dam Safety Review Panel (DSRP) to
review the dams and finalize the dam safety works for the dams financed under the project.
Dam safety works in 8 dams financed under the project were implemented based on the dam
reviews and approval of the DSRP. The remaining eight dams were not taken up under the
project as flood hydrology could not be finalized. These are small dams with low storage
capacity and the GoR is committed to complete the dam safety works to secure the safety of
these dams from the state fund. A robust arrangement exists within the WRD, GoR to ensure
the safety of dams. In 1991, Rajasthan established a Dam Safety Organization (DSO) within
the WRD, headed by Superintending Engineer, to review and monitor the safety aspects of




                                              9
all dams in the state.4 To ensure safety of all large dams in the state, the relevant Chief
Engineers from WRD are responsible inspecting the dams and submitting inspection reports
to the Dam Directorate before and after each monsoon season. Based on these reports, the
Dam Directorate prepares a Health Status Report of all large dams each year and submits it to
the CWC, GOI for review/comments. The comments/recommendations of the CWC are then
implemented by GoR.5
Procurement: Overall, procurement under the project was Moderately Satisfactory.
Rehabilitation of canals works with 83 percent of the contracts awarded (by estimated value)
within the first year of project. However, there were delays in awarding contracts for the dam
safety works, and consultancies relating to MIS and M&E. There were delays in addressing
deficiencies pointed out by the external audit in the levying of liquidated damages, as well as
in dealing with procurement issues identified under the procurement post review and follow
up on the observations identified, mostly due to inadequate capacity. At times, procurement
was hampered by delays in processing and awarding contracts and in granting of extension of
contract time.
Financial Management: The project used the existing government systems for budgeting,
accounting, funds flow, internal control, and audit, which enabled sustainable capacity
development of government staff without incurring additional costs for setting up a new
entity and devising additional guidelines and procedures. The project confirmed that the
disbursement system based on financial management review implemented under the project
during the additional financing phase worked better than the traditional disbursement method
based on statements of expenditure, which helped them improve expenditure reporting and
claims submission and reduced queries raised by external auditors. Compiling project
expenditure reports from 50 locations managed by several departments and divisions of
WRD and GWD proved challenging to the Project Accountant. When designing future
projects, the reporting should be based on accounting records maintained by the Auditor
General (Accounting & Entitlement), who is responsible for compiling accounts for the
Government. There are no outstanding audit reports as on date. The project audit report for
the financial year 2012-13 is due by September 30, 2013.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The SWRPD established under the project is functioning as a regular department, and is
funded by the GoR from the state budget to finance its activities like any other departments
of the state. RWSRP successfully initiated participatory irrigation management and
transferred responsibility for O&M of minor canals from WRD to WUAs. These WUAs have
necessary legal backing and incentives in place to sustain and perform their mandated roles
and responsibilities. Recognizing that WUA institution requires long-term support beyond

4
    The DSO was renamed as “Dam Directorate” in 2005.
5
    More information relating to safeguards in RWSRP are available in Annex 2.



                                                       10
project-supported trainings and workshops, the GoR is committed to provide continuing
technical assistance from WRD, for their sustainability and effectiveness. Similarly, GoR is
also committed to provide long-term technical and other needed support to gram panchayat
level committees (GPLCs) and groundwater management associations (GWMAs) in the
ground water pilot areas through the GWD to maintain their effectiveness. Currently, about
37% of the O&M costs of the irrigation systems are met, and the current water charges, even
if collected 100 percent, are not adequate to cover the full O&M costs. However, the
responsibilities of collecting water charges and O&M of the minor level canal system has
now been transferred to WUAs, and the WUAs have been authorized to retain the 50 percent
of the water charges collection amount for O&M works. Also, GoR has recently enacted the
Rajasthan Water Resources Regulatory Commission Act, 2012, to establish an independent
Rajasthan Water Resources Regulatory Commission (RWRRC) with a mandate to determine
the water tariff structure and to decide the bulk water charges to meet the full O&M needs of
the system. From above, it is clear that GoR is committed to move in the direction of meeting
full O&M costs, and with the combination of the above mentioned measures, full O&M
requirements are expected to be met in the medium to long term.

                                       3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The objectives, design and implementation were highly relevant to country and global
priorities and that Bank’s CAS at appraisal, and they remain so today. They aligned with the
six priority reforms 6 in the water sector in the Country Strategy of FY 2009-2012.
Agriculture will continue to play an important role in alleviating poverty in Rajasthan, and,
given the strong impact that irrigation has on agricultural productivity and growth, continued
reform and investment remains a priority.




6
  These six reforms on page 15 of the CAS include: 1) enabling water policies and institutional and legal
frameworks to improve stewardship of the resource; 2) inter-sectoral approaches at the basin level that integrate
surface water with ground water; 3) restructuring of public sector institutions (including through capacity
building and the strategic realignment of incentive structures and skill mixes) and the establishment of new
institutions (including regulatory authorities, WUAs, river basin agencies and public-private partnerships); 4)
decentralized and participatory service delivery mechanisms with a particular focus on improving customer/user
service, enhancing accountability and transparency and extending service to the poor; 5) modern management
practices and technology applications, including improved O&M through asset management planning and the
development of a comprehensive knowledge base and decision support tools; 6) financial sustainability of
resource management and service delivery through rational charges and tariffs and improved financial
management including removing distorting subsidies and moving towards user charges that reflect at least
O&M costs.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The project development objective has 2 distinct elements:
Part 1: To strengthen the capacity for strategic planning and sustainable development
and management of surface and groundwater resources in Rajasthan.
The capacity for strategic planning and sustainable development and management of surface
and groundwater resources in Rajasthan has increased with the establishment of a new
SWRPD and the strengthening of GWD. The groundwater pilots have shown that
groundwater management by the community can be successful. The three KPIs associated
with this element were achieved:
   1. The SWRPD is fully functional and discharging its mandated functions. This was the
      most critical and important institutional reform/restructuring achievement under the
      project because it separated the multi-sectoral water resources planning function from
      the water service delivery functions. Before SWRPD, each department involved in
      water management (such as WRD, Drinking water supply department, etc.) worked
      independent of each other. As consequence of the establishment of a new SWRPD
      under the project, the institutional capacity of the GoR for the strategic, coordinated
      and multi-sectoral planning and management of the water resources has been
      strengthened, and SWRPD now functions to ensure consistency of any new water
      schemes in the state with the river basin plans prepared by the SWRPD.
   2. River basin plans for all 15 river basins in the state have been prepared against the
      target of 8 plans. These river basin plans are being utilized for coordinated and multi-
      sectoral planning and management of the water resources in the state.
   3. Three community ground water pilots were implemented and evaluated. The
      objective of these pilots were to develop and demonstrate an institutional model for
      the sustainable ground water management at the aquifer level through community
      organizations, and this model was successfully developed and demonstrated. Based
      on these models, the GoR is drafting an enabling groundwater management law for
      adoption throughout the state.
Other indicators, such as implementing a computerized MIS were largely met by the project
end. Upgrading the existing state-wide HIS could not be implemented due to difficulties
within WRD in setting and reviewing the highly technical specifications for such a
sophisticated system and the lack of eligible firms to take on the contract even after two
rounds of biddings. After two rounds of bidding there was no time left under the project to
proceed with the activity, however, its impact was marginal and the project was still able to
meet the PDO targets. Considering the overall performance of the component, and taking
into account the non-implementation of the HIS, the achievement of this objective is
Moderately Satisfactory.

Part 2: To increase the productivity of irrigated agriculture through improved surface
irrigation systems performance and strengthened agriculture support services,
involving greater participation of users and the private sector in service delivery in
Rajasthan.
The rehabilitation of surface irrigation with a cultivable command area of 652,568 ha and the
increased participation of water users have helped to increase the productivity of irrigated
agriculture by improving the performance of the surface irrigation system in the project area.
Of the 8 key performance indicators associated with this element, 6 indicators were largely
met or exceeded:
1. The canal irrigation system was rehabilitated in 652,568 ha area, against the target of
   670,000ha (achievement 97.4%);
2. Operational efficiency improved in rehabilitated canal irrigation systems by 24 percent
   against the target of 10 percent (achievement 240 percent);
3. The gross irrigated area increased from by about 146,386 ha against a target of 100,000
   ha (achievement 146.4%);
4. The project created 525 well-functioning WUAs, against the target of 546 WUAs
   (achievement 96%). These WUAs are managing the irrigation water in their area of
   operation and collecting water charges. They are retaining 50 percent of their water
   charges collected for O&M works;
5. Ratio of actual yield/AF target (%) achieved for Wheat, Mustard and Cotton are 103%,
   109% and 98% respectively and thus the yield targets exceed on average.
6. Farm household annual incomes increased by 134 percent on the basis of actual weighted
   average. The breakdown by scheme-size is:
     Scheme size                      Revised Target                   EOP Valuea
     Major                                  25,000                      42,380
     Medium                                 18,750                       5,700
     Minor                                   6,250                       3,050
      a.   in 2009/10 prices

However, the remaining two key indicators are only partially achieved:
7. On average about 37 percent of the O&M funds needed for sustainable operation were
   being met; and
8. About 37 percent of water charge collections are happening against the target of 90
   percent collection of assessed charges per annum.
As the amounts allocated for O&M of the rehabilitated systems are not adequate, the full
costs of system O&M are not being recovered and water charges have not been increased,
there is a risk to the medium to longer term sustainability.
Under the additional financing, the piloting of SCADA could not be implemented as no
eligible bidder was available even after two rounds of biddings, and thereafter no time was

                                             13
left under the project to proceed with the activity. However, its impact was marginal and the
project was still able to meet the PDO targets for this component. Considering that most of
the performance indicators for this component were achieved, and taking into account some
risks to sustainability due to inadequate provision of O&M funds and the low recovery rate
for water charges, the achievement of this objective is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
Combining the above, the overall achievement of the project PDO is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency
The estimated overall economic rate of return (ERR) is 20.4 percent, lower than the PAD/AF
combined projected ERR of 25.9 percent. Similarly, the project’s overall financial rate of
return (FRR) is estimated to be 24.7 percent, compared with the PAD and AF estimated
FRRs of 28 percent (for 619,192 ha of CCA) and 20.6 percent (for 47,307 ha of CCA)
respectively. 7 The estimated economic net present value (NPV) is Rs 3.58 billion at a
discount rate of 12 percent (same discount rate as in PAD), which is 64 percent less than the
PAD/AF estimated NPV of Rs 9.91 billion, after adjusting to 2013 constant prices using
price index based inflators. Annex 3 provides more details.
The main reasons for the observed deviations in the rate of return to investments and NPVs
are: (a) the agriculture production technology adoption rate was 49 percent less than the 100
percent rate projected in the PAD; (b) a slow build-up of incremental benefits due to
prolonged rehabilitation investments; (c) the benefits from 47,307 ha in Bhakra canal
actually added to the project during AF have not yet started; and (d) incremental yields of
wheat, gram, cotton and cluster bean are 17 to 82 percent less than PAD/AF projected targets.
Despite exceeding many targets – such as: (a) command area irrigated by 4 percent,
(b) incremental irrigated area by 16 percent;8 (c) incremental crop yields by 9 to 15 percent in
the case of mustard and pearl millet) – missed targets for technology adoption rates and crop
productivity and delayed implementation pulled down the ERR. The estimated farm financial
income increased by 55 percent among project farms compared to non-project farms, but was
still 16 percent less than the PAD/AF target increases at constant 2013 prices. The project’s
overall better performance in terms of physical achievements, such as the actual incremental
irrigated area being 16 percent more than the target and the incremental yield of mustard
(which occupies 35% of the cropped area) being 15 percent greater than the target, are more
than offset by under achievements in the agricultural support services, resulting in lower
returns to project investments. Although the combined ERR of 20.4 at ICRR is lower than

7
  Financial rate of return for PAD and AF could not be combined since, only limited worksheets of PAD EFA
are available and those are not the final versions.

  The project has irrigated a maximum of 482,013 ha (2011/12). Average area irrigated (2009/10 to 2011/12) by
the project is 433,464 ha (excluding AF area). AF projected irrigated area is 37,306 ha. Including AF projected
irrigated area, actual irrigated area for combined PAD/AF is taken as 470,770 ha.



                                                     14
the estimated PAD/AF combined ERR of 25.9 percent at appraisal, it is substantially above
12 percent and therefore, the efficiency is deemed to be Satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Taking into account the moderately satisfactory achievement of the highly relevant
objectives and the satisfactory efficiency, the overall outcome rating is Moderately
Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Poverty Impacts. The project benefited about 222,300 farm families, of which 55 percent
are small and marginal farm holders with less than 2 ha, by enhancing their average annual
financial income (weighted by number of farmers) by Rs 23,560 per farm (2.94 ha) in the
project area. It is estimated that project beneficiaries and average incremental financial farm
income are 14 and 26 percent, respectively, less than the PAD/AF targets. Small and medium
farm holders (1 to 4 ha) account for 43 percent of project beneficiaries, with an average
holding size of 2.1 ha. At 2013 prices, incremental project financial benefits of Rs 16,825 per
farm (2.1 ha) will potentially shift at least two family members above the poverty line due to
project interventions. By end of project, about 191,180 persons (equal to 38,235 families)
benefited from the poverty alleviation impacts due to project-led incremental financial
benefits.
Improved irrigation water delivery and agricultural support services have generated
additional farm jobs annually for 21,380 persons in the project area. Assuming one job per
family, about 21,380 marginal farm holder and/or landless families in the project villages
rose above the poverty line.9 Overall, about 59,615 families benefitted from the improved
irrigated agriculture-led poverty alleviation impact.
Gender Aspects. The PAD did not focus on gender but the Final Evaluation Report shows
good (23% of the WUAs interviewed) participation of women in the WUA meetings, and
women are members of the managing committee of about 10 percent of WUAs.10
Social Development. The project has been able to successfully mobilize communities for
participatory management of irrigation and related issues as outlined in the RFPMIS Act
2000. The Act enables the formation of WUAs, distributary committees (DCs), and project
committees (PCs), collectively known as water users’ organizations (WUOs), and has
stipulated their roles, functions and powers.

TDPs for the 20 irrigation schemes under RWSRP, where members of scheduled tribes (STs)
constitute more than 25 percent of WUA members, were implemented. TDPs focus on
training and livelihood support for tribal WUA members. Members of scheduled castes (SC)
and STs were represented in the managing committees of about 79 percent of WUAs. Small
farmers were represented in 97 percent of the management committees.
Social assessments of three pilot groundwater schemes were completed in 2006 and used for
community mobilization, capacity building, and formation of GPLCs. The communities in
the groundwater pilot areas participated effectively in groundwater sharing and management.
The implementation of physical works under the project did not trigger any resettlement
issues. As part of the project preparation in October 2000, GoR adopted an R&R policy for
all state water resources development projects and established the Directorate for
Resettlement & Rehabilitation. GoR decided in June 2011, to adopt the National R&R Policy
(2007) to address R&R issues in infrastructure development projects throughout the state.
The provisions of this policy on certain aspects are better than what is available in the R&R
policy framework agreed for the project. To build the capacity to manage R&R, training on
land acquisition and resettlement for WRD Engineers was organized by Irrigation
Management and Training Institution (IMTI), Kota, under the project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The creation of a separate SWRPD was the most important institutional reform initiative
under the project by separating multi-sectoral water resources planning and allocation
functions from service delivery functions. GoR established the SWRPD through a Cabinet
decision in October 2006. It is operational and performing its mandated functions. Some
noteworthy achievements of SWRPD include: (a) finalization of the revised Rajasthan Water
Policy 2010, environmental management guidelines, and a field operational manual for
environmental management of water sector projects; (b) preparation of river basin plans for
all 15 river basins in the state; (c) proposed revision of water charges for consideration of the
Cabinet; and (d) review and clearances of projects for various water uses (irrigation,
drinking, municipal, etc.) to ensure coordinated multi-sectoral water resources planning and
allocation. The establishment of SWRPD has strengthened institutions in the area of water
resources planning and environmental management. SWRPD is a permanent department with
a clear role and responsibilities, and the GoR is providing funds to this department from the
state budget to finance its activities.
ID was reorganized and renamed WRD; its water resources planning responsibilities have
been transferred to SWRPD and responsibility for O&M of minor canals and some
distributaries in the project area have been transferred to WUAs. Bearing in mind that there
were no WUAs in the state before the project, the formation of 525 WUAs, 46 DCs, 2 PCs,
and the involvement of WUAs in the collection of water charges and in irrigation water
management and O&M works within their area of operation is a considerable achievement
that represents an important institutional development for the management of the water

                                               16
resource and has led the way to the formation of about 1163 WUAs throughout the state ( see
section 2.5 above). GoR has committed to provide continuing support to WUAs to enable
them to perform as hoped. Similarly, the formation of 70 GPLCs and 3 GWMAs under the
three groundwater pilots is a considerable achievement in developing community based
sustainable ground water management institutional model at the aquifer level.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The project has influenced GoR’s thinking about the management of water resources sector
in a significant way:
1.   The State Assembly has recently passed The Rajasthan Water Resources Regulatory
     Commission Act of 2012, to establish an independent regulator in the water sector with a
     mandate to set water tariffs for all uses of water and transparent administration of bulk
     water entitlements to various water users’ entities.
2. RWSRP influenced the design of other projects undertaken by GoR, such as the
   Rajasthan Minor Irrigation Improvement Project financed by Japan International
   Cooperation Agency and the Rajasthan Agricultural Competitiveness Project financed by
   the World Bank.
3. Based on the institutional model developed for the ground water management and other
   lessons learned in ground water management pilots implemented under the project, the
   GoR is drafting an enabling law for the community managed sustainable of the
   groundwater at the aquifer level.
4. GoR has scaled up the formation of WUAs for irrigation system management forming
   638 more WUAs in other irrigation schemes across the state outside the RWSRP.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops:
Not Applicable

                      4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The factors influencing the sustainability of the PDOs outcomes are:
1. Commitment of GoR to reform agenda. GoR demonstrated its commitment to the
   reform process during preparation and appraisal with the passing of a State Water Policy
   (1999), and a legislation defining user-managed organizations in the water sector. During
   implementation, it created a new SWRPD through a Cabinet Decision in October 2006.
   It then revised State Water Policy in 2010 providing the policy framework for the
   management of water sector and passed the Rajasthan Water Resources Regulatory Act,
   2012 to establish an independent regulatory institution in the water sector with a mandate
   to determine the water tariff structure and manage the transparent administration of bulk



                                              17
     water entitlements to various sub-sectors. Considering the above key institutional, policy
     and regulatory reform actions already completed by the GoR, this risk is Moderate.
2.    Functioning of WUAs. The WUAs formed under the project are legally empowered
     and elected institutions under the RFPMIS Act of 2000. These WUAs are collecting
     water charges and retaining 50 percent of the collected water charges for O&M works,
     are carrying out O&M works and irrigation water management in their area of operation,
     and are also empowered to collect additional money from their members to manage their
     affairs. Therefore, these WUAs have necessary legal backing and incentives in place to
     sustain and perform their mandated functions. Thus far, 442 WUOs have been provided
     with permanent offices and the GoR is committed to provide permanent offices to
     remaining WUOs. Management of the minor level canal system has been handed over to
     all 525 WUAs elected under the project. IMTI, GoR conducted 290 training courses and
     provided trainings to about 7,950 WUO members and 6,951 WRD officers. GoR has
     scaled up the formation of WUAs in the state and has formed about 638 more WUAs in
     other schemes outside the project. The GoR is committed to provide continued support to
     WUOs and to create a dedicated cell at the state level in the office of the Chief Engineer
     and Additional Secretary, WRD, to monitor and support the fostering and capacity
     building of WUOs in the state. Considering the above key institutional, policy and
     regulatory reform actions already completed by the GoR, this risk is Moderate.
3. Provision of O&M costs: Currently, about 37 percent of the O&M funds needed for
   sustainable operation are being met through water charges and other resources. Also
   about 37% of total water charges are currently being collected (against a target of 90%).
   However, the responsibilities of collecting water charges and O&M of the canal system
   has now been transferred to WUAs, and the WUAs have been authorized to retain the 50
   percent of the water charges collection amount for O&M works. As a result of these
   changes and incentives introduced by the project, the water charges recovery rate is
   expected to improve considerably in 2-3 years. WUAs are also leveraging resources from
   government schemes such as MNREGA etc. The State Water Policy (2010) also
   emphasizes that water tariffs will be set towards meeting the full O&M cost, and as a
   follow up action to this policy, GoR enacted the Rajasthan Water Resources Regulatory
   Commission Act, 2012 on August 29, 2012, to establish an independent Rajasthan Water
   Resources Regulatory Commission (RWRRC). RWRRC is mandated to determine the
   water tariff structure, and to decide the bulk water charges to meet the full O&M needs
   of the system. From above, it is clear that GoR now has the adequate policy, regulatory,
   and institutional arrangements in place and is committed to move in the direction of
   meeting full O&M costs, and with the combination of the above mentioned measures,
   full O&M requirements are expected to be met in the medium to long term. Considering
   the above facts, this risk is Significant.




                                              18
Overall rating: The overall risk rating is considered Moderate, since government
commitment to the water sector reform and WUAs formation are more important to
sustaining the PDOs and these risks are rated as moderate.

                   5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry. During project preparation, which
started in 1994 and ended in 2001 (about 7 years), the Bank encouraged GoR to draft and
adopt a State Water Policy and to pass the Rajasthan Farmers’ Participation in Management
of Irrigation Systems Act 2000. The Bank identified, facilitated the preparation of, and
appraised the project in such a way that the project was quite likely to achieve the planned
development outcomes and was consistent with the Bank's fiduciary role. While laying down
a bold plan for institutional development of water resources management, the design of the
project had some shortcomings:
1. The project design was involved a two-part PDO, that added to the project’s complexity.
   The KPIs listed in Annex 1 of the PAD were appropriate to the PDO. The original project
   had two main components divided into eleven subcomponents, which also added to the
   project’s complexity.
2. The PAD proposed the restructuring of ID (now renamed WRD), yet it gave little
   explanation of the existing structure and the nature of the restructuring proposed;
3. The intention to introduce a new organizational structure for agriculture extension
   delivery in a water resources project was optimistic; and
4. The feasibility of piloting commercialization of surface irrigation was not established
   during the lengthy project preparation.
Considering the above, the Bank performance rating for quality at entry is Moderately
Satisfactory.
Quality of Supervision. The Bank conducted a total of 24 supervision missions under the
leadership of the same task team leader, which provided consistency in the dialogue and
technical support program. The Bank Project Team had the appropriate skills mix and
professional experience to provide good technical advice, contribute to good quality control
measures in construction works, and assist with implementation. During the missions, the
Bank clearly and candidly brought out critical concerns and issues affecting the project
implementation and project effectiveness for action by GoR, and these were also conveyed to
the Government through mission aide-memoires and Management Letters.
During the additional financing, the Bank provided services of an international expert to the
project to prepare the bid documents for the HIS and SCADA activities, though these two
activities could not be finally implemented by the project in spite of two round of bidding as
no bidder was found eligible.

                                             19
By project end most of project activities were completed and most of the project indicators
were met. By extending the project duration and supplying an additional credit, the Bank
increased the chances of success of the project. At the time of the additional financing, the
Bank showed flexibility in agreeing to waive a covenant of the Project Agreement from the
original project requiring GoR to raise water charges to cover the full cost of O&M of
irrigation systems on the understanding that the government would ensure that O&M was
fully funded. This reflected global lessons on the financing of O&M that had been collected
while the original project was being implemented. However, the Bank was not successful in
persuading GoR to fully fund O&M in spite of raising this issue with the government
through Management Letters and also during missions and joint reviews at the state and
central government levels.
The Bank could have been much more severe by suspending disbursement when GoR did not
comply with covenants regarding water charges and funding O&M. The threat of this, when
given by the Bank at the MTR in December 2005, did seem to produce some reaction in
making the SWRPD separate from WRD. Taking into account the shortcomings described
above, the performance rating for supervision is Moderately Satisfactory.
Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance: Taking account of the two ratings
above and the moderately satisfactory rating for outcomes, the overall Bank performance
rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
Government Performance. As described in previous sections, GoR demonstrated its
commitment to the goals of RWSRP during preparation, through implementation, and there
are indications of continuing support for reforms and institutions now that the project has
ended. It successfully leveraged resources from other donors, for instance, a grant from EU-
SPP to fund capacity building of SWRPD and IEC, MIS and water sector studies related
activities originally under RWSRP. The Government showed good initiative in requesting the
additional financing to enable the project to be further extended in order to achieve its
objectives.
Implementation of some reforms actions was delayed. For example, a new SWRPD was
established in October 2006. The transfer of irrigation and land holding records by the WRD
to the WUAs was very slow. Another shortcoming was the failure to fulfill the covenant to
increase water charges to cover the full cost of O&M of irrigation systems, but it had agreed
to cover the shortfall from its own resources. However, the amount provided by GoR has not
met the full O&M requirement.
The Government has made considerable progress in downsizing the WRD. In September
2001, the 1396 revenue staffs of WRD (patwaris), who assess and collect water charges,
were transferred from WRD to the Revenue Department (RD). However, this severely
disrupted the collection of water charges and resulted in low recovery. Recognizing this, RD
transferred about half of the patwaris back to WRD in September 2004 but the working

                                             20
strength of revenue staff is now less than 300. It is now expected that those WUAs that do
not have patwaris will engage their own to assess and collect water charges. Considering the
above facts, the Government's performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
Implementing Agencies Performance. WRD successfully rehabilitated irrigation systems
for 652,568 ha and established 525 WUAs, 46 Distributary Committees (DCs), and 2 Project
Committees (PCs). Irrigation water distribution has improved considerably improved in some
areas. Dam safety works in 8 dams (of the planned 16 dams) were completed and these dams
were made safer under the project. As required by OP 4.37, GoR constituted an independent
Dam Safety Review Panel (DSRP) to review the dams and finalize the dam safety works for
the dams included under the project. The dam safety works in above 8 dams were
implemented based on the dam reviews and approval of the DSRP. A robust arrangement
exists within the WRD, GoR to ensure the safety of dams. The remaining 8 dams were not
taken up under the project as flood hydrology could not be finalized. These are dams with
low storage capacity, and the GoR has committed to complete dam safety works from state
fund to secure the safety of these dams.
GWD has been strengthened and has successfully implemented three pilot groundwater
schemes.
The AD successfully implemented a large program of demonstrations, temporary seed
production, and training.
SWRPD has prepared river basin plans for all 15 river basins. Though HIS and SCADA
activities were not completed, in the overall project context, its impact on project outcome
was marginal. Considering above and on balance, the performance of the implementing
agencies is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Taking account of the two
ratings above, the overall Borrower performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

                                     6. Lessons Learned

Managing complexity in complex sectors: A Bank project designed to address the multiple
PDOs and technical and policy reform issues, like most of those in the water sector, is
unlikely to achieve its objectives in a project cycle of 5 to 6 years. This most often requires
repeated extensions, resulting in inefficient use of Bank’s resources and delayed benefits. It
is important to separate the reform vision (long term) from the actions to be achieved in a
single project cycle (short-term). This is all the more necessary for project in low income
states, where the absorptive and management capacity of our clients may need to be
increased before smooth implementation is possible.
User fees for water are politically charged and not easily reformed: The sustainability of
rehabilitated irrigation schemes hinges on the appropriate operation and timely maintenance
of those schemes. This requires a steady flow of funding through user fees, subsidies, or a


                                              21
combination of both. One major lesson from this operation is that mandating the increase of
fees does not necessarily results in increased fees. The legal covenant on this issue could not
be met. Moreover, increased fees do not necessarily translate into increased revenue if the
incentives to pay are not in place and collection rates are not sufficient. A recent review of
the World Bank’s Water Strategy identified full cost recovery of water services delivery is
desirable economically but rarely achieved in practice. It noted that underpricing of water
supply services is widespread, even in upper-middle-income and high-income countries. This
is an intractable challenge for which teams globally are still searching for sustainable
solutions.
Invest appropriately to increase client capacity: Low institutional capacity of government
departments and implementing agencies, which is all the more pronounced in low-income
states, will negatively impact project implementation and outcomes. In addition to providing
needs-based training to staff and officers of government departments and implementing
agencies, more consistent technical assistance may be needed to generate the behavior
change and skills upgrading required to manage more technically sophisticated water
management systems. For instance, more intensive technical support was needed to guide
the management of very technical contracts, such as for MIS, HIS, and SCADA under this
project.
Developing WUAs is a long-term process: Institutional capacity building of WUAs takes
substantial long term efforts and support, much beyond the training and capacity building
that can be provided within a single project period. It is important therefore, that the client
have an in house program to provide technical support, training, and capacity building to
WUAs. In addition, WUAs should be legally empowered to collect and retain a portion of
water charges, and to raise additional funds, including from their own members, to carry out
their mandated functions and to be financially sustainable.
Sustainable groundwater management is best done at the aquifer level through the legally
empowered community organizations: To achieve sustainable management of groundwater, it
is essential to have commitment of the community. Information, education and
communication are essential for motivating communities to the need for restraint and
cooperation in the use of groundwater. This takes a lot of time but can be made to work with
enabling legislation together with the active and continued technical support to the
community organizations by the project and by the government or other support network on a
longer term basis beyond the project period.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
The Borrower has commented that some of the facts and figures in the ICRR need to be
corrected. Borrower has also commented that ICRR is disproportionately focusing on
negatives, resulting in unbalanced and wrong conclusions/ratings and most of the ratings are
based on subjective judgments and are not properly explained and justified, and has

                                              22
requested that all ratings related to project performance as well as the Borrower’s and the
Bank’s performance be upgraded. The Bank Team has considered the comments of the
Borrower and has made necessary changes in facts and figures, however, the overall ratings
remain as is.
(b) Co-financiers: Not Applicable.
(c) Other partners and stakeholders: None.

Project Component A: Water Sector Institutional Restructuring and Capacity Building
Subcomponent A1 - Institutional capacity building and creation of SWRPD: The project
helped to establish a new SWRPD, which was created by a GoR Cabinet decision in October
2006. The primary role envisaged for SWRPD was to establish the framework for ensuring
the optimal, sustainable, and equitable development and use of the state's water resources on
a multisectoral basis. SWRPD is headed by Secretary level officer of the GoR and a Chief
Engineer (CE) level officer is its technical head. SWRPD includes officers mainly from
WRD with one each from AD and GWD and consultants having need based specialization.
SWRPD has 56 sanctioned posts of which 52 are filled, comprising 24 technical, 26
administrative, and two experts on contract. At the time of writing, the posts allocated to AD
and GWD were vacant. Within SWRPD, units have been established for Environment, Water
Planning, Interstate Rivers, Research & Development, Coordination and Monitoring, and
Agriculture, which contains a sub-unit for Water Tariffs.
The Environment Unit: This unit has published: (a) Environmental Guidelines and Action
Plan of SWRPD for Water Sector in Rajasthan, (b) Field Operation Manual for Environment
Management of Water Resources Projects, and (c) The first Annual report of SWRPD on
Environmental Status. The unit prepares environmental reports on IPM and INM. This Unit
has studied restructuring and strengthening water-related departments and conducted base-
line surveys of six components utilizing grant fund under EU-SPP.

The Water Planning Unit: This unit procured an international consultancy for the Planning
of Water Resources in Rajasthan State in December 2010 at a cost of Rs 140 million. The
product of this consultancy was preparing plans for all river basins in Rajasthan. This unit
was responsible for preparing the Water Resources Regulatory Commission Authority Bill,
which was placed in the State Legislative Assembly in April 2012 and was passed by the
Assembly on August 29, 2013.
Interstate Unit: This unit deals with water policy issues and implementation of action plans
of (a) State Water Policy and (b) Rajiv Gandhi Water Conservation and Development
Mission. The Unit is nodal agency for construction of rooftop water harvesting structures on
WRD buildings.
Research & Development Unit: This unit signed and administered a contract with State
Remote Sensing Application Center for a GIS-based Water Resources Development Plan,
financed by EU-SPP. The unit also arranges for impact assessment studies of IEC campaigns.
Coordination and Monitoring: This cell is responsible for: (i) coordinating with all line
departments for smooth functioning of the program and monitoring of the program; (ii)
Organization of the twice-yearly reviews by EU of the program; (iii) Capacity building of
PRIs and WUOs for sustainable water resource management through Gram Panchayat
IWRM planning; and (iv) Procuring consultancies to provide technical assistance and M&E.
Agriculture and Water Tariff Unit. This unit is responsible for preparing the proposal for
amendment of water tariffs for the consideration of the GoR on periodic basis. The unit has
an extensive IEC program.
Restructuring of the Irrigation Department. The project supported the restructuring and
capacity building of the ID. This involved changing its name to WRD, and reorganizing its
functions consequent to the establishment of a new SWRPD for planning, and transferring
responsibility for O&M of minor canals to WUAs. Above restructuring action were
completed: The project built the capacity of WRD in the areas of planning, environmental
management and financial management. The project supported training, study tours and
public awareness programs. Investment included computerized MIS, equipment and
communications systems. There has been a recruitment freeze throughout the project, which
has resulted in a considerable reduction in numbers of sanctioned posts and staff in WRD, as
shown below.

Institutional strengthening of environmental management for sustainable management
of water resources. GoR established an Environment Unit in SWRPD (see above) and a
Water Cell within the Environment Department. Because physical works under RWSRP are
limited to rehabilitation of existing systems, significant negative environmental impacts were
not expected. Supervision missions reported that the project has focused on improving the
environmental knowledge base, tools, processes and management capacity in the state. The
project has positively enhanced the environment by reducing the very small areas subject to
waterlogging, salinity and flooding as shown below.

Integrated Pest management (IPM) and Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) strategies
were prepared and implemented. Effective awareness campaigns were undertaken with the
support of AD. The Monitoring and Evaluation Report states that in the project 77,743 soil
samples and 11,217 water samples were analyzed for the benefit of farmers. Farmers were
motivated for application of balanced doses of the fertilizers to supplement the need of N, P,
and K as per soil testing results. There was increasing demand by the farmers for bio-
pesticides and thus efficient use of fertilizers.
Some important achievements under the project from environmental management
perspective are: (i) Development of Environmental Management Guidelines and Action Plan
for SWRPD for Water Sector in Rajasthan; (ii) Publication of the first Annual Report of
SWRPD on Environmental Status; (iii) A “Field Operational Manual on Environment
Management of Water Resources Projects” for WRD field staff and engineers; (iv)
Enhancing stakeholder awareness towards IPM and INM practices and (v) Institutional
improvements and training. The detail is included in the following paragraphs.
Field Operational Manual for the Environment Management of Water Resources
Projects: SWRPD manages the environmental program for the Water Resources projects in
the state and is responsible to develop and issue guidelines and for monitoring all applicable
environmental legislation and regulations in the water sector. SWRPD developed a “Field
Operational Manual for the Environment Management of Water Resource Projects to guide
field staff of the WRD in environmental management throughout water sector projects. The
manual was prepared following three stakeholder meetings/ workshops. It has been made
available to all WRD staff at AE level and above and on WRD’s web site
www.waterresources.rajasthan.gov.in .



                                              30
Environmental Management Guidelines and Action Plan of SWRPD for Water Sector
in Rajasthan: These guidelines propose an action plan for SWRPD that will not only
improve environmental awareness and management in the water sector of the state but will
also act as a tool to strengthen SWRPD’s data bases, environmental awareness and
management. These guidelines were finalized by number of consultations and workshops
with stakeholder departments and published and adopted by the GoR. These guidelines were
circulated to all officers of WRD along with stakeholder departments like Agriculture,
Pollution Control Board, Ground Water, Forest, Industry etc. and are also available on the
Department’s web site.
Annual Report of SWRPD on Environmental Status: The Department has started
collating water resources data related to the environment, based on formats of monitoring
provided by these guidelines. This collation of data from each stakeholder department has
resulted in an Annual Report of SWRPD on Environmental Status. This will be a regular
activity of SWRPD, which will be updated and published each year and put on the WRD web
site, so that it can be shared widely and used as a planning and data tool. This activity will
improve monitoring and evaluation process within SWRPD.
Integrated Pest Management and Nutrient Management in the Project: The use of
pesticides and fertilizers is important for agricultural development; however, improper
selection and use can result in environmental health concerns. The Environmental
Assessment for the RWSRP recognizes the need to improve pesticide and other agro-
chemical management in the State. The project supported activities to improve awareness
and practices on appropriate agro-chemical selection, management, and use through IPM and
INM activities. It is important to highlight here that AD has introduced following initiatives
on IPM/INM activities: (a) pre seasonal ‘agricultural input campaign” before kharif and rabi
season for 30 days every year at Gram Panchayat (GP) level. In these campaigns farmers are
made aware of all practice packages on IPM, INM, micro irrigation, improved seed,
fertilizers, implements, soil testing through mobile vans etc. (b) The literature on IPM/INM
in Hindi was also distributed to farmers. (c) Soil health cards have been prepared. (d)
Fertility status under INM is also available on the web site of AD (www.rajasthankrishi.gov).
However, despite this considerable effort the “adoption” survey conducted by the AD
showed that adoption of these practices was relatively low. Average adoption of all
technologies was about 51%, however adoption of IPM and INM was 18% and 27%
respectively. The project arranged training on IPM/ INM to WUAs, farmers and
departmental officers through IMTI, Kota, as shown below:

Capacity building through training and workshops: The project through IMTI at Kota
trained staff on environmental management. IMTI from January 2004 to February 2013 has
trained 357 engineers and agriculture professional on environmental management issues. In
2012-13, IMTI conducted three courses on INM/IPM to 41 participants from WUAs and four
courses on Environmental Management and Social aspects to 50 department’s staff and
engineers.
Subcomponent A2 - Modernizing the MIS: There were initial delays in awarding contracts
for the MIS. The subcomponent that was eventually implemented comprised:
1. Mailing and messaging system
2. Budgeting and financial management system
3. Water resources information system (WRIS) and geographical information system (GIS).
4. Procurement of hardware
All WRD and GWD staff at the level of executive engineer and above now has and use
official e-mail accounts. GoR introduced its integrated finance management system with
assistance from the European Union State Partnership Program. The ability to manage letters
of credit was added in April 2013. The WRIS was completed, and 492 officials of SWRPD,
WRD and GWD were trained to use the program. WRD and GWD were provided with 225
desktop computers, printers and UPSs and 6 laptops. Budgeting and financial applications for
WRD were developed. The implementation of the MIS activities is promoting replacement of
manual operations in the above area with the computer based MIS. The continued operation
of this subcomponent would benefit from separate budget lines for the maintenance of the
system. Because much of this subcomponent was financed by other sources, only about 5%
of the amount allocated for MIS under the project were spent. 39 computers (corresponding
to one per office building) have been provided for GPLCs. Software to interpret the results of


                                             32
rainfall and groundwater level readings into water availability and recommendations for
cropping patterns were also developed.
Subcomponent A3 - Water resources research fund: It was proposed in the PAD that, the
SWRPD would set up a water resources research fund (WRRF). The WRRF was to be
administered and funded through SWRPD and to be guided by a research advisory
committee. Priority were be given to studies that address: cross-sectoral issues in water
management and planning; engineering and hydrology; environmental issues; basin
planning and modeling; water markets and prices; groundwater regulation and pricing;
farmer and other user participation; roles of women, marginal farmers and other target
groups; water efficient irrigation and new technologies; and irrigated production and
sustainability issues (including IPM). SWRPD requested proposals for research but no
useful or unique proposals were received. Moreover, other institutions such as Central Arid
Zone Research Institute, State Institute of Agriculture Management and agriculture
universities were carrying out similar studies. In view of above, no studies were done under
RWSRP.
Subcomponent A4 - Information, education, and communication (IEC) programs: The
IEC program objective was to communicate and disseminate information at a number of
levels to a variety of audiences to support project activities. These levels ranged from the
statewide generic messages on the critical nature and importance of Rajasthan's water
resource conservation and its sustainable management, to the specific IEC requirements to
support WUAs in participatory rehabilitation of irrigation systems, agricultural support
program, groundwater and surface irrigation pilots. The IEC program supported technical
assistance, publications, media coverage, workshops, seminars, village animators, exchange
visits, etc. Much of this work was carried out by the Agriculture Unit of SWRPD funded by
a European Union Grant for a State Partnership Program.
Subcomponent A5 - Capacity building for sustainable groundwater management: The
two main objectives of the component were to (i) strengthen the capacity of the GWD for
groundwater management, and (ii) to test institutional model for community-managed
sustainable groundwater management at aquifer level. The subcomponent was designed as a
tightly integrated set of activities to address these objectives and consisted of the following:
(a) community-driven and -implemented pilot projects to develop and test groundwater
management approaches in three pilot locations; (b) IEC to generate awareness of emerging
problems, and broad-based public support for management; (c) strengthening Rajasthan's
GWD as a scientific and data collection and dissemination organization; and (d) research on
key issues related to groundwater management. The participatory pilot projects tested and
provided practical experience in community-driven groundwater management. The IEC
activities built a broad base of awareness of the state's groundwater problems and
management options. Strengthening the GWD developed the scientific database and
analytical skills essential to monitor groundwater conditions and understand the actual
viability of potential management options. The data generated by the GWD can now be used


                                              33
by the SWRPD in the comprehensive planning of surface and groundwater resources. The
research activities provide insights on key elements of groundwater pricing, options for a
legal framework and supporting regulation that have been identified as initiatives for
sustainable management of groundwater.
a. Community-driven groundwater management pilots: The project supported three pilot
schemes for a community-driven approach to ground water management, involving the
establishment of groundwater conservation districts (GCD) covering identified aquifer areas
where problems exist in depletion and quality. The objective was to develop and test
approaches and practices for community-based groundwater management in three pilot
aquifers in Sikar, Rajsamand and Jodhpur districts, representing different hydro-geological
conditions. Each pilot scheme involved the development of several Gram Panchayat Level
Committees (GPLCs) and federation of these GPLCs in an aquifer level Ground Water
Management Association (GWMA). The GPLCs and the GWMA in each pilot area were
supported by an NGO and a TSG. The three aquifer pilot schemes included the formation of
70 GPLCs and three GWMAs16, installation of 67 piezometers to monitor groundwater levels
installation of 15 rain gauges, construction of 325 groundwater recharge structures (140
ponds, 59 renovation of ponds, 18 percolation tanks, 14 dams, 52 check dams, 42 rooftop
rainwater harvesting structures) with 15 percent contribution from the community. The pilot
groundwater projects are summarized below.

The communities in the pilot areas have adopted measures to control the demand for
irrigation water, including replacing high capacity pumpsets with lower capacity pumpsets in
Jodhpur, prohibiting the construction of new wells, reduction in irrigated area, switching to
crops such as barley and mustard which consume less water than rice and sugarcane and
adopting sprinkler irrigation. In the three pilot areas, rainfall is measured daily and water
levels in the piezometer wells are measured each month. Annual groundwater recharge is
estimated and shared with GPLCs and GWMAs. These project interventions have resulted in
reduced groundwater extraction in Rajsamand and Jodhpur but over-extraction of
groundwater continues in Sikar and requires more time and efforts to achieve the water
balance. Under the project, seven office buildings for GPLCs and GWMAs have been
completed and a further 20 are nearing completion.
b. Strengthening GWD: This included the installation of 783 piezometers to monitor
groundwater levels throughout the state, purchase of four ultra-violet spectrometers, deep
penetration resistivity meter, 38 GPS handsets, 70 water quality testing kits, remote sensing
data and software for data analysis and construction of two office buildings. GWD organized
three training programs for its staff and exposure visits for farmers and staff to areas in
Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh to demonstrate good practice. Seventy GWD staff was
trained at IMTI, Kota and National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee.
c. Sustainable groundwater management activities: Sustainable groundwater management
in the aquifer pilot areas involves 4 important activities viz: (i) measurement of changes in
the water levels in the piezometers, (ii) scientific assessment of annually replenishable
groundwater recharge in the aquifer area, (iii) actual measurement of groundwater extraction
from all existing bore wells and tube wells in the aquifer and (iv) adopt demand control
measures to ensure that the annual withdrawal of groundwater from the aquifer does not
exceed the annually replenishable groundwater recharge. GWD has organized training
programs to educate the farmers about various measures required to reduce groundwater
extraction for sustainable development. This has been achieved in the pilot areas. GWD has
also organized training programs in each pilot area to inform the GPLCs and GWMAs about
crop water budgeting and allocation of available ground water recharge for different purposes.
d. Monitoring water levels in piezometers: GWD has been monitoring the changes in the
water levels every month in the piezometers constructed in three pilot areas. Similarly water
levels are monitored three times a year in the piezometers constructed in other districts under
the project. This data has been used for calculating annually replenishable groundwater


                                              35
recharge. The data collected on the water levels and groundwater recharge is shared with the
GPLCs and GWMAs.
e. Scientific assessment of groundwater recharge: GWD has estimated the yearly
replenishable groundwater recharge based on the rainfall data recorded at the rain-gauge
stations in the pilot areas and the fluctuation of water levels monitored in the piezometers.
The data on annually replenishable groundwater recharge in each aquifer has been shared
with the GPLCs and GWMAs. Using the data on water levels monitored in 783 piezometers
constructed under the project GWD has prepared and published reports on groundwater
resources in all 33 districts in the state.
f. Measurement of Actual Groundwater Extraction: GWD has estimated the groundwater
extraction from the aquifer assuming a uniform rate of withdrawal at 6000 cubic meters per
well per year. This does not represent the actual groundwater extracted by the wells. The
need for installation of a water meter on each well for measurement of actual groundwater
extracted by all wells in the aquifer was realized. The farmers from three pilot aquifers were
willing for installation of water meters on their wells. Therefore, to start with, GWD has
installed 1600 water meters on irrigation wells in the pilot aquifer in Rajsamand district.
This has been attempted for the first time in the country. Water meter readings are recorded
and maintained by the farmers and the district Geologist of GWD. This data is used for
calculating the actual groundwater extracted from the aquifer and for taking appropriate
demand control measures by the GPLCs/GWMAs to reduce ground water extraction. The
need and utility of installing water meters on wells has been accepted by the GPLCs and
GWMAs from other two aquifers as well. GWD has to follow up with GoR for installation of
water meters on wells in the other two pilot areas even after the closure of the project.
g. Demand Control measures: GPLCs and GWMAs from the three pilot areas have adopted
various demand control measures to reduce groundwater extraction for agriculture use. These
include change in cropping pattern, reduction in irrigated area, and switch to low water
consuming crops, adopting sprinkler irrigation system and prohibiting construction of new
wells. These measures have proved effective in reducing groundwater extraction from
aquifers in Rajsamand and Jodhpur districts but have not brought desired results in Sikar
district where over extraction of groundwater continues.
h. Publication and Data dissemination: GWD has published the reports on (i) groundwater
resources in all 33 districts in the State and (ii) chemical quality of groundwater in all
districts.
i. Customized Software: The customized software for GIS enabled dynamic groundwater
resource information with statewide application developed by a consultant was tested and a
few improvements have been suggested by the Chief Engineer, GWD. The customized
software would be finalized and made available to all district offices and GPLCs from three
pilot aquifer areas.



                                             36
j. Reports: GWD has prepared the final status and impact report on community based
aquifer level groundwater management pilots for the three aquifer areas.
The project is considered to have been successful in educating the communities in the pilot
areas to consider the aquifer as a unit for planning groundwater abstraction so that on
average abstraction does not exceed the groundwater recharge. The additional recharge from
groundwater recharge structures constructed has been estimated to amount to 4.878 million
cubic meters per year.

Table 5 Overview of groundwater recharge achievements
                                          Rajsamand         Jodhpur      Sikar      Total
Additional recharge (million m3/yr)           1.677           0.581       3.620      5.878
Percent of rainfall recharge                   12.8            4.4         11.5
Rainfall recharge (mm/yr)                       32              23          51
Cost of recharge structures (Rs. M)           14.97                                  77.03
Cost Rs per Mm3/yr                           Rs 8.93

Based on the numbers above, if one considers that average irrigation uses 4,000m3 of water
per hectare per year, the capital cost of an additional ha of irrigation attributable to the
recharge structures at Rajsamand would be Rs35,700/ha (about US$714/ha). The effect of
improved canal lining on groundwater levels has not been studied.
Subcomponent A6 - Piloting commercialization of surface irrigation: Early in the project,
GOR identified an area of about 14,000 ha in the Khara system of Bhakra irrigation project
for a pilot project for a commercial water services delivery utility to be owned and managed
by farmers. However, neither the farmers nor the state found this to be feasible and the
subcomponent was dropped from the project following the MTR.
Subcomponent A7 - Strengthen R&R institutional capacity: With little expense by the
project an R&R Directorate within WRD was established in 2002. In 2011, GOR adopted
the National R&R Policy 2007. Training for WRD engineers in land acquisition and
resettlement was organized by IMTI under the project. R&R of families affected by new
projects are implemented by the project authorities in accordance with national R&R
policy.
Subcomponent A8 - Hydrological Information System (HIS): Under the Additional
Credit, it was proposed to support upgrading and modernization of the existing
meteorological and hydrological network but, mainly due to the reluctance of WRD to hire
expertise to help to prepare and process the technically sophisticated bid documents. This
resulted in late initiation of bidding process, and in spite of two rounds of bidding, no
responsive bid was received. By then there was not enough time left to continue with
further processing, and the HIS could not be implemented.

Project Component B - Improving the performance of the irrigation system.
This was the main investment component of the project consisting of three closely integrated
and coordinated subcomponents with an over-arching objective of improving the productivity
of irrigated agriculture and water use efficiency in 87 surface irrigation schemes with total
cultural command area over 652,000 ha across the state. The component brought about a
significant shift in the share of responsibility for the management of irrigation systems from
solely that of the government to a situation where the community, through WUAs, could take
over direct management and control of the irrigation systems below the head of the minor
canals. Upstream of this point, WUAs have been empowered with greater influence through
the establishment of 46 distributary committees (DCs) and two project committees (PCs).
Farmers, through WUAs, were involved in the planning and implementation of rehabilitation
works, including financing of 15 percent of costs for the works on canals with a capacity of
less than 10 cusecs (0.28 m3/s).
Subcomponent Bl - Forming and fostering WUAs: When the project started, there were no
WUAs in Rajasthan. Following the passing of the RFPMIS Act 2000 during project
preparation and the RFPMIS Rules 2002, the project supported the forming and fostering of
525 WUAs, 46 DCs and two PCs in the project area primarily through social mobilization
and training. As the WUAs have the tenure of 5 years, WRD has so far conducted three
elections of WUA’s managing committees in 2002 and 2007 and 2012 respectively. Works
on 519 canals with a capacity of less than 10 cusecs were executed through WUAs and with
a contribution of 15 percent of the cost from the WUA. Memoranda of Understanding
(MOU) between ID and each of 525 WUAs that have agreed to take over the management
and maintenance of their irrigation systems have been signed transferring to WUAs
responsibility for maintaining their systems and for water distribution among users.
Permanent offices have been provided for 421 WUAs, 19 DCs and two PCs: GOR has agreed
to finance the completion of the permanent offices for the balance WUOs. Members of WUO
committees expressed happiness for these permanent offices as these buildings are now used
for storing records and as site offices when supervising maintenance works, as well as for
meetings.
Some WUAs have been federated at the distributary level into 46 DCs, which serve as the
focal point for coordination among the WUAs, and between the WUAs and the irrigation and
agriculture support service providers. Two PCs, for Gang and Bhakra canal systems, have
been formed. At the end of the project, a total of 573 WUOs (525 WUAs, 46 DCs and 2 PCs)
were functioning in the project area. These WUAs are collecting water charges, maintaining
the systems, and managing irrigation water distribution to its members within their area of
operation. The formation of the remaining 61 WUOs (5 WUAs, 43 DCs, 13 PCs) was not
possible during the project due to local disputes in the case of the five WUAs, and due to
changes required in the Rajasthan Farmers' Participation in Management of Irrigation
Systems Act of 2000 (RFPMIS), for the remainder, as the minimum number of members to
form the General Body was not available. It is understood that the necessary steps have been


                                             38
initiated by the GoR to amend the Act to enable the formation of the remaining DCs and PCs.
There are now over 1700 WUAs in Rajasthan, many of which are in the irrigation schemes
other than the schemes covered under the project. This clearly indicates the up-scaling of the
formation of WUAs in the state.
The project supported activities to ensure that the WUAs are transformed into viable and
financially sustainable institutions. This consisted of IEC and training programs
implemented through IMTI. Four NGOs covering six Water Resources Divisions were
recruited as institutional advisors and social motivators to work with WUAs in the project.
The project provided training, interstate exposure visits and mass awareness training camps,
targeting different stakeholders (staff, WUA presidents and committees, and general body
members). The majority of the training was provided by the IMTI, Kota, as shown below.
This is a considerable achievement.

A total of 6,320 officers and 6,484 farmers attended these courses. This equates to
approximately 11 persons trained per WUO (although it is likely WUO office bearers
attended more than one training). This is backed up by the Final Evaluation Report where
training was reported to have covered 71, 82 and 93 percent of major, medium and minor
WUA executives.
The PAD refers to the importance of partnerships to ensure the long-term sustainability of the
WUAs. The evaluation report shows that there are varying degrees of cooperation between
the Department and WUAs for planning of operation and maintenance, where WUAs in
minor schemes report a much higher level (>67%) of cooperation and assistance than those in
the major schemes (<36%). Therefore, these partnerships need to be institutionalized,
strengthened and continued beyond the project period. .
Funding WUOs: GOR has issued an order that 50 percent of the demanded water charges
collected by WUAs should be returned to WUOs, with the WUA receiving 42.5 percent, the
DC 5 percent, and the PC 2.5 percent. Collection of water charges is obviously very
important, but it has not always been very efficient as shown in the table below. There are
reports that in some cases revenue records are not available to WUAs and as a result WUAs


                                             39
are not able to correctly record the irrigated area for assessing the water charges and collect
water fees. Another reason for the low collection rates has been uncertainty about the
mechanisms for handing over of fees and the return of 50 percent to the WUAs in some cases.
It is imperative that in the post project period the WRD makes every effort to ensure clarity
on the mechanisms for fee collection and subsequent reimbursement to the WUAs, including
transaction times. In other projects the some farmers have voluntarily increased the amounts
they pay to their WUAs to ensure there is adequate for O&M of their canals.

The monitoring consultants based their results on 2011/12, the latest year results available
to them. Unfortunately this was a year in which water charges were waived in 11 districts
due to drought. However, removing the schemes in these 11 districts from the analysis does
not affect the overall result: the average is still 37 percent.
Funding O&M programs: RWSRP has prepared scheme wise O&M budget requirements
since 2010/11. The estimated requirements have increased to about INR 410/ha and
Rs 340/ha for 2011/12 and 2012/13 respectively, a large increase over the INR 150/ha
(approx.) actual expenditure in 2008/09 and 2009/10. MGNREGA is reported to have
provided INR 50.5 million for O&M in the project area in 2011/12. A slight increase to
Rs 51.9 million is estimated for 2012/13. For 2012/13, the estimated requirements for a CCA
of 652,568 ha (Rs 221.9 million) equates to approximately INR 340/ha, still well short of the
Rs 1175/ha for medium and major and Rs. 588 for minor recommended by the 13th Finance
Commission; however, this FC norm presumably include establishment costs. According to
information received from the CE, WRD, Jaipur, the average establishment cost in 2012/13
for all projects in the state, excluding Gang and Bhakra canals and Indira Gandhi Nahar
Pariyojna, was Rs 513/ha. The amount spent on O&M works was Rs 90/ha. Adding Rs 56/ha
for the contributions from MGNREGA and WUAs would give a total of Rs 659/ha, a long
way (Rs 479/ha or more than five times what was actually spent) short of the weighted norm
of Rs 1138/ha for the project area. From above, it is clear that the amount allocated for O&M
works is inadequate.

The amount provided by GOR for works (Rs90/ha/year) is about 16 percent of the amount
required (Rs569/ha/year).
In 2012/3 it was estimated that WUA would contribute Rs 55.5million. This seems to be an
overestimate. The amount to be contributed by farmers (assuming CCA of 652,568 ha, an
irrigated cropping intensity of 66 percent, full water fee collection and weighted water fee of
Rs 191/ha17) would be Rs 82.3 million, of which 42.5 percent would be returned to WUAs,
i.e. Rs 35 million. In 2011/12 WUAs were only able to contribute Rs 13.5 million (though

  Water charges were last changed in 1999. Based on those charge rates and the average cropping pattern, the
average charge would be Rs. 191/ha. Collection efficiency at appraisal was 80%. See PAD page 53.

this was a drought year and in some districts water fees were waived). Water charges were
last changed in 1999.
Subcomponent B2 - Participatory Rehabilitation. The project supported the participatory
rehabilitation of 87 irrigation schemes (7 major, 36 medium, and 44 minor) by WUAs and
the WRD. Work has been completed in all the schemes. Rehabilitation rectified system
deficiencies and restored canals to their original design capacity through activities – such as,
silt and vegetation removal, removing unauthorized outlets, fixing authorized outlets,
re-sectioning channels and strengthening of banks, providing lining in specific reaches where
justified, replacement of damaged lining, restoring free-board, repairs of deteriorated
structures, construction of additional cross-drainage structures, construction of improved
canal regulating and discharge measuring structures.
The rehabilitation of Chambal right main canal was added to the project in 2009. The
rehabilitation works were implemented by the WRD, but WUAs were involved in the
planning, designing, and execution of the rehabilitation works within their area of influence.
WUAs only participated in the rehabilitation of their minor canals where the capacity of the
canal was less than 10 cusecs (28 l/s). In these cases, farmers, through the WUAs,
contributed 15 percent of the rehabilitation costs for the portion of the irrigations system to
be transferred to their control. About 150 WUAs were not required to contribute 15 percent
because their minor canal had a capacity greater than 10 cusecs. An independent organization,
headed by CE (Quality Control) was responsible for quality control and quality assurance of
the works. At the field level, quality control engineers conducted tests on concrete, mortar,
bricks and other materials, soils, and compaction of earthwork. Four zonal quality control
laboratories were established with field laboratories at each construction site for routine tests
on earthwork and concrete. A quality control manual for the project was published and issued
to all concerned, and the OK Card system was introduced to ensure that work could not
proceed until approved. Although early supervision reports drew attention to the need for
better curing of plaster work and compaction of earthwork, the quality of construction was
generally reported to be satisfactory or quite good. The works, excluding Chambal main
canal, are summarized below.

Rehabilitation of canal networks has reduced transmission losses and significantly improved
the availability of water in the middle and tail regions of the distributaries and minor canals
resulting in improved equity in water distribution.
Subcomponent B3 - Strengthening agricultural support services: This subcomponent
was designed for strengthening of agricultural extension services in the project area through
the introduction of multidisciplinary (irrigation, agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry,
etc.) technical support groups (TSGs), and public-private sector coordination for technology
transfer to farmers. The activities funded included (i) the introduction of TSGs at various
levels to support the WUAs, (ii) field demonstrations of improved production practices, (iii)
pilots for delivery of extension services through NGOs, (iv) support to agriculture research,
(v) strengthening of other support services and (vi) training for staff of line departments. The
AD was responsible for coordinating and implementing this component.
Key Results: The project conducted about 36,000 demonstrations and 54,000 seed
production demonstrations and trained large numbers of farmers. As a result the cropping
intensity has increased from 104 percent in 2004-05 to 161 percent in 2011-12.
Documentation of adoption rates by AD indicated that about 50 percent farmers are now
using improved seeds and following the demonstrated crop and water management practices,
such as soil test based fertilizer application and irrigation at critical stage(s) of crop growth.
With and without project increases in productivity ranges from 9 percent for cluster bean to
42 percent for mustard, 19 percent for wheat and 18 percent for cotton. On-farm water use
efficiency has also increased from 2.3 to 2.7 kg/cubic meter of water for wheat (16.8%), and
from 1.7 to 2.1 kg/cubic meter of water for mustard (25.0%).
Introduction of Technical Support Groups at various levels to support WUAs was
designed to “promote interdepartmental coordination to improve the delivery of agricultural
services to farmer”18. During the course of the project a State Coordination Committee was
established and met regularly and approved annual work plans. District Technical Support
Groups were established in all 24 project districts while a reported 324 Technical Support
Groups were established at the WUA level.
The attempt to introduce a new organizational structure for agriculture extension delivery
was an ambitious task, particularly for a project where the lead implementing agency is the
WRD. During project preparation, the need for a new approach to extension was no doubt
real (as shown by the adoption by Rajasthan of ATMA19), as is the need to much better
integrate water management and agriculture extension at the field level. However it is
doubtful that the RWSRP was the most appropriate platform for this type of change, given
that the AD was not the lead implementing agency.

  Agriculture Technology Management Agency, an initiative from the World Bank funded National
Agriculture Technology Project, which has been scaled up throughout India.

Field Demonstrations of Improved Production Practices was the major activity of the
component, accounting for approximately 21 percent of the proposed budget and 16 percent
of the final expenditure. The demonstrations followed four main themes, crop management,
sprinkler and drip irrigation, small pond with drip, and small pond with well. Over the project
life a reported 36,300 crop demonstrations were conducted (against an original target of
16,500). This is a massive achievement, and would account for touching close to 15 percent
of farmers in the project area (assuming one demonstration per farmer).
Adoption Rates. An important element of demonstrations is the adoption of the technologies
by both the farmer hosting the demonstration and by his neighbors. The AD carried out
surveys to determine the adoption rates of 29 technologies, including use of line sowing, IPM,
INM, seed treatments, water saving techniques etc. Based on the data provided the average
adoption was 51 percent. Impressively high adoption was recorded for interventions related
to improving water use efficiency (awareness of participatory irrigation systems, awareness
about critical stages of irrigation, using water saving devices). On the other hand, the main
interventions of IPM and INM showed very low adoption rates. Unfortunately this survey did
not include a control area to assess the impact of the project against the regular activities of
the AD, which include many of the same interventions as the RWSRP. The resources at the
disposal of the AD have increased massively in recent years (over 500% from 2005/5 to
2012/13), and it is highly likely that this has had a significant effect on technology adoption
and productivity across the state. The Impact Evaluation Report shows that productivity in
the project area is higher than outside, supporting the reported adoption rates.
On farm seed production was identified during the project implementation as a major
impediment to productivity, and a major focus was placed on the promotion of this activity.
Curiously this intervention is also referred to in various places in project documentation as
“on farm seed production demonstrations”, when it is evident that these were intended as
seed production interventions only. It is reported that 54,256 of these were conducted during
project implementation, accounting for a production in the order of 20,000 tons of seed, of
which approximately 45 percent was used as seed, the remainder sold as grain or consumed
in the household.
While the seed production intervention removed a short-term deficit in the availability of
quality seed, there was no attempt to link this with either the state seed corporation, or the
potential purchasers of this seed. It would appear that this was not designed as a permanent
solution to the seed supply issue. Discussions with staff and farmers confirmed that this was
likely to be a one off activity. During the project period the seed replacement rate in
Rajasthan has increased dramatically, heavily supported by the RKVY, and other centrally
funded agricultural schemes. Even though this intervention will not provide an ongoing
source of seed, seed availability (for the major crops) should not be a limiting factor after the
project.
Pilots for extension delivery through non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were
tested through the engagement of seven NGOs covering seven schemes (one dropped out in

                                               44
2006) and a report was finalized in March of 2008 from the remaining six. During the project
extensions two NGOs were dropped, and work continued on a cost-sharing basis with the
remaining four, that were deemed to have better performance. Discussions with various
persons suggest that the experience met with mixed success: it was thought that the NGOs
were good at the social mobilization but were weak on technical issues.
Support for Agricultural Research was funded for 27 short-term research projects covering
a range of topics. The results of these studies were reasonably well disseminated, through
field days, as well as through the literature and materials generated by the project and in
some cases these were promoted through the TSGs. The topics covered included micro
irrigation on various crops, enhancement to fruit production, pest management, crop
diversification, conjunctive water use, soil amelioration, nutrient management and irrigation
management. In the brief report summarizing the research findings, it is pleasing to see that
many delivered management advice that could be readily and easily adopted by farmers; for
example research on enhancing fruit set in cucurbits found that fruit set and highest net
returns could be obtained by the application of Ethrel (plant growth regulator) at 30 and 45
days after sowing.
Strengthening other support services mostly included training for farmers, WUAs and
TSGs. The project claims to have trained 585,797 farmers, a remarkable feat, particularly
given the project covers about 220,000 households. It is however acknowledged that in many
cases the same farmers attended training covering different topics in different years. This
training has no doubt contributed to the reported adoption rates and subsequent increases in
productivity. However, given this mass exposure it is somewhat surprising that the
penetration was not higher. This type of training should be more closely scrutinized for its
effectiveness before replication. In addition a number of exposure visits were undertaken
both inter and intra state. In addition a number of AD staff were trained at IMTI on various
topics, including crop improvement, soil fertility, INM, plant protection, irrigation
scheduling etc., during the course of the project IMTI trained over 6000 officers from the
various line departments.
Soil testing was given a major focus under the project, with the objective of improving
farmers’ understanding of soil test based nutrient application. This component was
undertaken in conjunction with the strengthening of the soil test laboratories. During the
course of the project approximately 78,000 soil and 11,000 water sample were analyzed,
interpreted and results distributed to farmers in the form of ‘soil health cards’. In addition,
the data were used to create soil fertility maps, some of which can be viewed on the AD’s
internet portal. It is understood that some of these maps were produced at a level that would
be useful to the WUA and its membership, however it is uncertain how widely (if at all) these
were distributed (none were visible in the WUAs visited by the mission). These maps could
be of great use at the WUA level to assist farmers without access to soil testing facility, to get
an idea of his soil nutritional requirements, similarly these could be useful for local (private
and state) fertilizer distributors, to better assess the fertility demand. Use in this manner was


                                               45
not reported. It is also not clear if the demand for soil testing has increased (as a result of
project interventions). However, it is likely that with the Central Governments support for
soil test based nutrient application; these laboratories will be well utilized. Unfortunately the
Adoption Rate Study undertaken by the AD did not include a question related directly to the
use of soil testing. Instead it included questions related to use of basal dose of fertilizer, use
of gypsum, top dressing with urea, use of organic fertilizer and use of INM. These showed
mixed results, for example farmers knowledge on top dressing with urea was very high (90%
of farmers), however knowledge of INM is relatively low (27%).
During the early supervision missions the quality of the district level planning for the
agriculture activities was found to be more or less business as usual with much room for
improvement. The idea of developing a Participatory Irrigated Cropping System (or
Participatory Development of Irrigated Cropping) was introduced as a concept for the
improved planning at the WUA level (minor) level in June 2005 and followed up in
subsequent missions. At the MTR it was suggested that one such plan be developed and
shared with the Deputy Directors of each district. Subsequently training programs were
organized to facilitate this process (at the College of Technology and Engineering, Udaipur,
IMT, Kota and at the Water Technology Centre of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University).
In May 2008 ten schemes were identified for piloting this planning process and six were
completed by six schemes by June 2010. However progress on this activity was not reported
on subsequently and there is no evidence of institutionalization of this process.
Subcomponent B4-Dam safety remedial works: The objective of the component is to
ensure the safety of head works supplying irrigation schemes to be rehabilitated under the
project. 16 dams were included under the project for dam safety works at appraisal. As
required by the OP 4.37, GOR had constituted an independent Dam Safety Review Panel
(DSRP) to review the dams and finalize the dam safety works for the dams included under
the project. All the dam safety works financed under the project were implemented based
on the dam reviews and approval of the DSRP. The dam safety works in above 8 dams
were implemented based on the dam reviews and approval of the DSRP. Remaining 8
dams were not taken up as flood hydrology could not be finalized. These are small dams
with low storage capacity, and the GOR is committed to complete dam safety works to
secure the safety of these dams, and is not a significant issue. A robust arrangement exists
within the WRD, GOR to ensure the safety of dams. A Dam Safety Organization (DSO)
headed by Superintending Engineer was established in the WRD in 1991 with the objective
to review and monitor the safety aspect of the dams in the State (the DSO was renamed as
“Dam Directorate” in 2005). To ensure safety of all large dams in the State concerned
filed Chief Engineers of WRD are responsible for inspection of dams and to submit
inspection reports at pre monsoon and also post monsoon time to the Dam Directorate, and
based on these reports, the Dam Directorate prepares Health Status Report of all large
dams every year and sends to independent central organization, namely, Central water
Commission (CWC), GoI New Delhi for review/comments, and the


                                               46
comments/recommendations of the CWC in this regard are implemented by GoR.
Therefore robust institutional arrangement exists in WRD GoR for ensuring safety of
existing dams.
Subcomponent B5 - Installation of Automatic Water Measurement and Recording
System: Under the Additional Credit, it was proposed to install automatic water
measurement and recording systems in the Gang and Bhakra canal systems but, mainly due
to the reluctance of WRD to hire expertise to help to prepare and process the technically
sophisticated bid documents, it was not possible to receive responsive bids in the time
available and this subcomponent was dropped from the project.
Project Component 3 - Project Management
Individual project subcomponents were implemented by the respective line departments. A
PMU was established, with primary responsibility for interdepartmental coordination,
procurement, financial management, annual and quarterly reporting and project M&E. This
component funded provision of office equipment, computers, training, consultancy services
and some limited incremental recurrent expenditures.
Throughout the project implementation cycle, the PMU was adequately staffed, and though
frequent changes did take place at the leadership position of PMU, the overall PMU
performed satisfactorily.

                           Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A.      Project Benefits and Expected Returns in PAD/AF
The project objectives are (i) to strengthen the capacity for strategic planning and sustainable
development and management of surface and groundwater resources in Rajasthan and (ii)
increase the productivity of irrigated agriculture through improved surface irrigation systems’
performance and strengthened agricultural support services, involving greater participation of
users and the private sector in service delivery in Rajasthan.
Project economic analysis in the PAD was done at two levels. First, economic impact for the
whole project covering 619,192 ha from 91 surface irrigation schemes was assessed through
13 farm models representing major, medium and minor schemes for different agro-climatic
regions. Scheme level impacts were quantified and aggregated for the overall project. Second,
combined impacts of project components were quantified for two projects representing each
scheme category. For AF, economic analysis was done by assessing the economic impact for
the major scheme covering 47,307 ha, through representative farm models using five crop
budgets.
The PAD and AF analyses have been integrated (see Appendix 1) to assess the combined
targets and compare with actual achievements by the end of the project. For this, project
targets have been aggregated; directly (for CCA, irrigated area, project beneficiaries), using
area as weights (for crop yield, employment), and based on price index based conversions to
constant prices (for costs and returns)20. Benefit flows were computed over a 30-year period.
The analysis was done at 2013 prices using an opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent.
Import/export parity prices were estimated for internationally traded farm
inputs/commodities. Various standard conversion factors (SCF) are used to convert financial
costs to economic costs: for dam safety (0.83), scheme rehabilitation (0.88), recurrent
maintenance (0.89), agriculture support services (0.98), and remaining items (0.9). Project
analysis considered all project costs, except the water sector institutional restructuring and
capacity building component, which will have state-wide impact. Based on the proportion of
the project CCA to statewide irrigated area, 10 percent of water sector institutional building
component cost is included with other project component costs. About 90 percent of the total
project costs are captured in the project analysis.
The project identified a target of 258,285 farm families 21 to be directly benefited by the
project. All project-benefited farmers would adopt improved production technologies to
improve their farm output, stimulated by the improved delivery of irrigation water and

20
  Hereafter, the discussions are based on the combined results of PAD and AF analyses.
21
  PAD reported direct beneficiaries vary from 250,000 (p.7) to 251,000 (p.50). As per PAD EFA worksheets,
direct beneficiaries are 251,185. We have taken the lower projection, which is mentioned as 250,000 in the
PAD main text. AF reported 8,285 direct beneficiaries.

agricultural support services under the project. Project analysis focused on quantifying
benefits from two major sources namely (A-1 and A-2); (i) increased irrigated area by
11,6075 ha, and (ii) increased crop productivity by 21 to 50 percent for major crops (wheat,
mustard, gram, cotton, cluster bean and bajra) covering 451,702 ha of irrigated crop area.
Additional demand for labor was projected at 31,610 person jobs per year, equivalent to 9.5
million person days per year (mostly of hired labor)22, to provide employment and income
opportunities to small landholders and/or landless families.
The combined Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the overall project was estimated at 25.9
percent, with a net present value (NPV) of Rs 9.91 billion. Projected ERRs varied widely
from 20 percent to 43 percent for major schemes, 37 to 40 percent for medium schemes, 19
to 25 percent for minor schemes. Sensitivity analyses were based on lower percentage of
operational WUAs, lagged project benefits and implementation delays as the most critical
risks which independently reduced the project’s overall ERR substantially to less than 19
percent. The financial rate of return (FRR) for the overall project was projected at 28 percent
in PAD (for 619,192 ha) and 20.6 percent in AF (for 47,307 ha).23 The analysis also assessed
the financial impacts of the project for representative farms. Average farm holding size
varied widely across scheme types: 5 to 6.6 ha for major schemes, 1.3 to 3.1 ha for medium
schemes, and 1.6 to 2.2 ha for minor schemes. The projected increase in financial net income
for representative farms varied from 37.8 to 42.7 percent for major schemes, 79.1 to 82.8
percent for medium schemes, and 31.5 to 44.7 percent for minor schemes in the project area.
PAD/AF analysis was based on the following key assumptions (Appendix 1 and Table 2): (i)
irrigated area will increase from 335,627 ha to 451,702 ha, (ii) increase in irrigated crop yield
per ha for major crops (occupying 84% of the area) like wheat by 0.75 t/ha, mustard by 0.44
t/ha, gram by 0.35 t, and cotton by 0.27 t/ha, (iii) base line crop yields to remain same
without the project (WOP) also, (iv) improved crop yields to be realized by all project
beneficiaries covering 451,702 ha of cropped area, (v) adoption matrix followed crop yield
increments (10%, 20%, 30%, 25% and 15%) over five year time frame to stabilize and
technology/income adjustment over a 10-year period starting from 5 percent to 100 percent.

B.      ICR Estimation Methodology
Project economic cost at constant 2013 prices, estimated for economic analysis, is INR
10,546 M, by adopting same approach followed in PAD EFA for apportioning the
component wise costs. This captures about 95 percent of the total project costs. For
comparability, financial prices of non-traded goods and services have been adjusted using
varying SCFs (0.83 to 0.90) and cost and benefit flows have been calculated with 12 percent

22
   PAD estimated 29,000 additional farm jobs per year (p.7). No separate estimation is done for AF. Projected
additional farm jobs are scaled up in proportion to increase in irrigated area projected for AF.
23
   Financial rate of return for PAD and AF could not be combined since, only limited worksheets of PAD EFA
are available and that too are not the final versions used in the PAD.



                                                     49
opportunity cost of capital over a period of 30 years, in line with the PAD analysis. Parity
prices are estimated for tradable inputs and outputs by taking the projected prices in constant
USD for the mid-year of the project life and converted to 2013 constant prices by using
MUV index. PAD estimated costs and benefits are also converted to 2013 prices for
comparing with ICR results. Finally, annual project recurrent costs are included at the rate of
2 percent of investment costs for the remaining project life.
PAD/AF methodology was applied to the extent feasible in order to update estimated project
returns for ICR analysis, at 2013 prices. A majority of the data used for ICR estimation has
been collected from impact assessment study undertaken by external agencies as well as by
the Agriculture Department (AD). Final evaluation report (2013)24 covered a total of 900
farm households from 30 project sample irrigation schemes (major/medium/minor) and 180
farm households from six control irrigation schemes. Project sample farms are distributed
among scheme types by major (5), medium (10) and minor (15) and equally among the
locations (head, middle and tail) within the irrigation scheme both for the project and control
sample.
There were variations in the design and quality of implementation of the study, including the
representativeness of control schemes for scheme types and inconsistencies in the quality of
project database on physical progress. Lack of systematic documentation of
output/outcome/impact data, as part of project M&E, constrained the estimation of project
benefits. For instance, complete set of final EFA files and data used for PAD, scheme wise
irrigated area used as baseline (BL) in PAD, excel files and data used in BL study, and
actual year-wise irrigated area for 21 project schemes (mostly medium and minor schemes),
and disaggregated scheme-wise primary sample data used for final impact study are not
available. In re-estimating returns for the ICR, attempts were made to overcome some of
these limitations through use of information derived from other sources25 such as Impact
study report (2013) by AD, published statistics from secondary sources, and triangulation
from discussions with implementing agencies and field visits during the ICR mission.
Returns to agriculture were estimated using a representative model with respect to major
crops, (wheat, mustard, cotton, gram, cluster bean and bajra), which together account for 89
percent of the gross irrigated area on a representative farm. Three major agro-climatic
regions, Northwestern plains zone (major schemes), Semiarid eastern plains zone (medium
schemes), Sub-humid southern plains zone (minor schemes) are considered to capture non-

crop budgets and farm models. Major rained crops are soya bean, cluster bean, bajra, gram
and maize. For irrigated and rain fed crops, differences in yield, crop mix and net income
between representative project and non-project farms were used to estimate the incremental
benefit from the project (A-2 and A-3).

C.       Quantification of Benefits
Irrigated area impacts: Rehabilitated CCA by the project is 652,568 ha, marginally less (2%)
than the projected target of 666,499 ha. Number of irrigation schemes taken up for
rehabilitation investments, came down from 91 to 87 and extra CCA (47307 ha) was added
for AF (A-1). Based on the latest data available, irrigated area has gone up to a maximum of
482,013 ha (2011/12). This did not include the projected irrigated area of 37,305 ha in AF.
Including this, total area irrigated is assessed at 519,318 ha at full project development26.
This is 55 percent more than the baseline irrigated area (335,627 ha) and 15 percent more
than the targeted irrigated area (451,702). This has been achieved by the rehabilitated
irrigation schemes delivering irrigation water more efficiently now. Final evaluation report27
has documented that; (i) water delivery efficiency has increased from 55 percent (2003/04) to
79 percent (2011/12) in the rehabilitated schemes and (ii) water use efficiency at scheme
level has gone up by 20 percent during the same period. Increase in irrigation system
performance efficiency by 24 percent achieved by end of the project is much higher than the
targeted level of 5 percent.
Since the irrigated area is likely to fluctuate over years depending on variations in rainfall,
average irrigated area during the three-year period ending 2011/12 (TE 2012) is considered.
Average irrigated area is estimated at 433,464 ha. Including the irrigated area projected in AF
(37,305 ha), economic analysis considered 470,770 ha as the average irrigated area by the
project, distributed across major (85%), medium (12%) and minor (3%) schemes, for the
remaining project life. This is still 40 percent more than the base line irrigated area and 4
percent more than the targeted irrigated area (Table 11).




26
   It can be safely assumed that the targeted irrigated area in AF will be fully realized since AF is taken up in
major scheme and project’s physical achievement in terms of irrigated area by end-project exceeded the
projected target in PAD. Performance efficiency of rehabilitated major schemes in irrigation water delivery far
exceeded the performance of medium and minor schemes as documented in the final evaluation report by
external M&E.

target and realized values are for “with project” situation. Ratio is for realized to target value. Annual financial
income is at constant 2013 prices

Total project benefited farm families is 14 percent less than the target. This is due to 2
percent shortfall in CCA covered and relative change in the composition of scheme types in
favor of major schemes, where average farm holding size is more than two times higher than
that of medium and minor schemes. Direct project beneficiaries are estimated at 222,300,
distributed across major (38%), medium (51%) and minor (11%) schemes.
Productivity and income impacts: Realized crop productivity levels (Table 12) exceeded the
targets in case of wheat, mustard, and bajra by 3, 9, and 10 percent, respectively. These crops
account for 75 percent of the irrigated crop area. In the case of other crops (cotton, cluster
bean, and gram), realized productivity levels are less by 2 to 29 percent. These crops occupy
16 percent of the irrigated crop area (Appendix 3).
Farm financial income achieved by end of the project is 9 percent less than the target (Table
11). Average farm holding size increased between PAD (2.57 ha) and ICR (2.94 ha). This is
due to the fact that the relative weights among the scheme types changed during
implementation. In PAD, distribution of CCA among major, medium, and minor irrigation
schemes, respectively, are; 54, 31, and 15 percent. In ICR, distribution of CCA among major,
medium and minor irrigation schemes, respectively, are; 66, 28, and 6 percent. After
standardizing the farm size, shortfall in farm financial income increased from 9 to 21 percent.

Technology adoption rate: Agriculture support service (ASS) activities started from 2003/04
onwards, and intensified, more or less matching with the progress in rehabilitation
investments. Technical support groups (TSG) at district level (24) and WUA level (324)
covering all project schemes provided technical support in planning and implementing the
field demonstrations. The project has implemented 96,975 on-farm demos during the project
period. These demos focused on popularizing production technologies (grain and quality seed
production), resource efficient practices (INM, IPM, crop diversification, micro irrigation,
farm machinery and implements). Through on-site trainings at demo villages, about 580,000
farmers are covered in total for exposing the demonstrated technologies, almost saturating all
the project villages. Based on the impact study report by AD, agriculture technology
adoption rate is estimated at 51 percent (of the farmers). The PAD projection of all irrigated
area (hence all farmers) coming under improved production technology is overestimated.
Despite the projection of 2/3rd farmers adopting improved technology in AF, overall
combined (PAD and AF) projected adoption level remains close to 100 percent.28 However,
it is noted that despite increased crop productivity levels realized across major irrigated crops
and improved adoption rate of demonstrated technologies by the farmers, the observed rates
of adoption and productivity changes are not commensurate with the intensive TSG-led
transfer of technology interventions in the project area. It is therefore important to sustain the
increased productivity levels already achieved and enhance it further by promoting efficient
use of water and other inputs.
Incremental Benefits: Table 13 summarizes the end of the project incremental impacts as
documented in PAD/AF and compares them with the ICR estimated values. The results are

Target represents combined values for PAD and AF and Realized refers to ICR estimated value. Both target and
realized values are incremental (difference between “with” and “without” project situation). Ratio is for realized
to target values. Annual income is at constant 2013.

Actual incremental irrigated area is 16 percent more than the target. Mustard and bajra,
occupying 37 percent of the irrigated area registered 9 to 15 percent higher incremental
productivity than the target. Incremental crop production is substantially higher than the
target for cotton and oilseeds, driven by increased area and productivity, but much lower than
the projected targets for wheat, pulses and coarse grains. Apart from area shift in favor of
mustard, less than the projected increase in crop yields and adoption rates are the major
reasons for the observed shortfall in crop production. ICR estimated incremental farm
financial income is 16 percent less than the target. Annual farm jobs generated are 32 percent
less than the target.

D. Economic and Financial Analysis
All Schemes: PAD and AF estimated project economic rate of return (ERR) at appraisal,
respectively are 26.5 percent (for 619,192 ha of CCA) and 21.4 percent (for 47,307 ha of
CCA). When both PAD and AF are combined, ERR came to 25.9 percent for the project at
appraisal (Table 4). The ICR estimated (PAD and AF combined) project ERR is 20.4 percent,
which is lower than the projected combined ERR of 25.9 percent at appraisal. Although, the
combined ERR of 20.4 percent at ICR is lower than the combined ERR of 25.9 percent at
appraisal, it is substantially above 12 percent, and therefore, efficiency is deemed to be
satisfactory. In calculating the ERR, all project costs were included as per PAD
methodology, and set against the incremental benefits arising from expanded irrigated area,
increased crop productivity and improved adoption of production technologies. The ICR
estimates translate into an NPV of Rs 3.58 billion with a discount rate of 12 percent as used
in the PAD/AF analysis. The estimated NPV is 64 percent less than the PAD/AF estimate of
Rs 9.91 billion (adjusted to 2013 constant prices using price index based inflators). Delayed
implementation of the project activities resulted in the reduction of present value of both
costs and benefits, but benefits are impacted much more than the costs, resulting in lower
ERR. Similarly, overall project’s financial rate of return (FRR) is 24.7 percent, compared

By Scheme Types: Incremental financial farm income for all schemes by end project is
estimated at Rs 23,557 per year for an average farm size of 2.9 ha. This varied widely across
scheme types. Major schemes accounted for 66 percent of the CCA and 85 percent of the
irrigated area. Medium and minor schemes together accounted for 34 percent of the CCA and
15 percent of the irrigated area. Maximum annual farm income is registered in the major
schemes (Rs 10,500 per ha). Medium and minor schemes together recorded annual farm
income of Rs 4,225 per ha, which is 60 percent less than the realized per ha farm income in
major schemes. ERRs, estimated by scheme types, varied from a maximum of 25.3 percent
for major schemes to 13 percent for medium schemes and 13.5 percent for minor schemes,
which are lower than the PAD/AF estimated ERRs for major schemes (20% to 43%),
medium schemes (37% to 40%) and minor schemes (19% to 25%)30. ICR analysis revealed
substantial variation in the returns to investment across scheme types with major schemes
performing much better than medium and minor schemes considered together.

   ICR estimated ERRs by scheme types cannot be compared with the PAD estimated ERRs since, in PAD, only
two schemes are considered for each scheme type. Out of six such schemes considered for PAD EFA, two
schemes are covered in the final impact assessment survey but primary data by schemes is not available to
repeat the analysis.

Figure 1 Performance efficiency by Schemes

Final impact evaluation of RWSRP (2013) 31 assessed the performance of 66 irrigation
schemes by evaluating the irrigation water delivery and water use efficiencies before and
after rehabilitation investments. The study concluded that major schemes performed much
better than the medium and minor schemes as follows: Rehabilitated major schemes
delivered the irrigation water more efficiently than the medium and minor schemes (figure1).

water delivered to water user groups to annual volume of irrigation water released at head,
improved from 56 percent before rehabilitation to 83 percent after rehabilitation, an increase
of 47 percent in major schemes. For medium and minor schemes considered together,
delivery efficiency improved from 52 percent before rehabilitation to 71 percent after
rehabilitation, an increase of 37 percent. Similarly, water use efficiency, expressed as the
area irrigated per million cubic meters (ha/MCM), has increased by 24 percent in the
rehabilitated major schemes as compared to 15 percent increase in the rehabilitated medium
and minor schemes.
Improved performance efficiency of major schemes in relation to medium and minor
schemes as above resulted in significant jump in irrigated area in the major schemes post-
rehabilitation period. Incremental irrigated area due to the project is estimated as 135,143 ha.
Share of major irrigation schemes in the incremental irrigated area is 77 percent and the rest
came from medium and minor schemes. In major schemes, irrigated area expressed as a
percentage of CCA improved from 68 percent (before rehabilitation) to 92 percent (after
rehabilitation), an increase by 24 percent of CCA. In medium and minor schemes, irrigated
area expressed as percent of CCA increased from 19 percent to 32 percent due to
rehabilitation investments (figure 2).

Incremental crop productivity in case of wheat and mustard, occupying 73 percent of
irrigated area is higher in major schemes by 29 and 58 percent, respectively, as compared to
the medium and minor schemes (figure 3). Consequently, average farm financial income in
major schemes is 1.5 times higher than the medium and minor schemes. Appendix 4

E. Main Reasons for lower Economic Returns
Major reasons for the observed deviations in the rate of return to investments and NPVs are;
(i) slow buildup of incremental benefits due to prolonged rehabilitation investments, (ii) the
benefits from 47.307 ha in Bhakra canal added to the project at the time of AF have not yet
started, (iii) achieved incremental wheat, gram, cotton and cluster bean productivity are less
by 17 to 82 percent as compared to PAD/AF projected targets, and more importantly, (iv)
agriculture production technology adoption rate is 49 percent less than the 100 percent
assumed in the PAD. Despite the project’s over achieving of targets such as; (i) command
area irrigated by 4 percent, (ii) incremental irrigated area by 16 percent, (iii) incremental crop
productivity by 9 to 15 percent in case of crops like mustard and bajra, missed targets in


                                                 57
overall technology adoption levels, and crop productivity for major crops like wheat coupled
with delayed implementation of project interventions, pulled down the rate of return to the
project investments. ICR estimated farm financial income increased by 55 percent in the
project benefited farms over WOP levels, but still 16 percent less than the PAD/AF targeted
farm income levels for the project beneficiaries at constant 2013 prices. Project’s overall
better performance in terms of physical achievements like actual incremental irrigated area
being more than the targeted levels by 16 percent and higher incremental yield in mustard by
15 percent which occupies 35 percent of area, are more than offset by under achievements in
the agricultural support services resulting in lower returns to project investments.
PAD sensitivity analysis highlighted the sensitivity of projected ERR to lower percentage of
operational WUAs, lagged project benefits and implementation delays, which reduced
projected ERR to less than 19 percent. Since sustainability of WUA remains an issue during
the post project period, sensitivity of ICR estimated ERR to WUA sustainability was tested
following the same methodology adopted in PAD. Limiting sustainability of WUAs to 50
and 33 percent, to be reached in phases over next three years, for the remaining project life
has depressed the ERRs to 16.2 and 14.1 percent with substantially reduced NPVs by 64 and
86 percent, respectively. This highlights the fact that ICR estimated rate of return to
investment is contingent upon the WUA operations being sustained beyond the project
implementation period.

F. Employment and Poverty Impacts
The project benefited about 222,300 farm families (of which 55% are small and marginal
farm holders with less than 2 ha) by enhancing their average annual financial income by Rs
23,560 per farm (2.94 ha) in the project area. ICR estimated project beneficiaries and average
incremental financial farm income are less by 14 and 16 percent respectively as compared to
the PAD/AF targets. Small and medium farm holders, (1 to 4 ha), account for 43 percent of
the project beneficiaries, with an average holding size of 2.1 ha. At 2013 prices, incremental
project financial benefits of Rs 16,825 per farm (2.1 ha) will potentially shift at least two
family members above the poverty line due to project interventions. By end-project (2013),
about 191,180 persons (equivalent to 38,235 families) are potentially benefited by poverty
alleviation impact due to project-led incremental financial benefits. Improved irrigation water
delivery and agricultural support services have generated additional farm jobs annually for
300 days for 21,380 persons in the project area. Assuming one job per family, about 21,380
marginal farm holder and/or landless families in the project villages are shifted out of poverty
line at 2013 prices. Overall, about 59,615 families are benefited by the improved irrigated
agriculture led poverty alleviation impact.

Introduction
Due to deferred maintenance, the conditions of irrigation system in Rajasthan was in
dilapidated condition and efficient utilization of water was not being done, particularly the
tail enders were not receiving their due share of water. Major challenges being faced by
water sector include: i) Sustainability, ii) Productivity, iii) Investment, iv) Water
Management and v) Water pricing. Government of Rajasthan (GOR) approached the World
Bank in the year 1994 with the request to provide assistance for Rajasthan Water Resources
Consolidation Project (RWRCP). After prolonged pre-project discussions, the World Bank
agreed to provide financial assistance to GOR under Rajasthan Water Sector Restructuring
Project (RWSRP) in the year 2002.
RWSRP was for six years duration and was proposed to be completed by 31st March 2008.
The project period was extended twice for one year each from the original project closing
date March 31, 2008. These extensions were given due to delays in project implementation
for reasons beyond the control of the GOR. These reasons included (i) severe drought in the
first year of the project (2002-03) in the state that diverted departmental staff and
administrative machinery for drought relief works impacting project implementation, and (ii)
State Assembly and National Parliament elections in the second year of the project (2003-04),
resulting in the imposition of model code of conducts and diversion of project staff on
election duties that adversely affected award of contracts and project implementation. After
two extensions, date of completion was further extended up to 31st March 2013 with
additional financing in year 2010. This project has been implemented in 652568 hectares of
Culturable Command Area (CCA) covering 7 major, 36 medium and 44 minor irrigation
projects in Rajasthan besides enhancing safety of 8 dams. In addition to 87 irrigation
schemes, the rehabilitation of Chambal Right Main Canal, which is common carrier channel
for supply of water between Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (MP), was also subsequently
included the Project in the year 2009 with the contribution of MP to the extent of 75.4
percent.
The additional financing and the extended period of 3 years (April 1, 2010 to March 31,
2013) was proposed to be used to (a) utilize the available credit under the ongoing project (of
about US $ 28.1 Million equivalent) (i) complete left over dam safety/canal
rehabilitation/modernization works and (ii) scale up/consolidate some of the ongoing
activities and (b) to utilize additional financing of US $ 19 Million equivalent (i) complete
up-scaled canal rehabilitation/modernization works in Bhakra Canal System in an additional
area of about 50,000 ha and (ii) undertake and complete new activities to enhance overall
water resources planning and irrigation services delivery improvement.

Operationalization of SWRPD
a. Structure of SWRPD: As a part of long-term activities and for functioning of SWRPD
   initially 60 (subsequently revised to 56 numbers) numbers of posts (26 numbers
   Technical, 26 numbers Supporting staff and 4 numbers Expert on contract) have been
   sanctioned by GOR vide order No. 1116 dated 14.07.2006.Out of 56 sanctioned posts, 52
   posts have been filled (24 numbers Technical, 26 numbers Supporting staff and 2
   numbers Expert on contract). SWRPD is headed by a Chief Engineer and comprises
   officers from WRD, Agriculture, GWD and Accounts. Two subject specialists have also
   been appointed on contract basis.
b. Environment, Water planning, Interstate, Research & Development, Co-ordination &
   Monitoring and Water tariff units within SWRPD have been created and are functional.
   SWRPD is the secretariat for council / committee constituted by GOR for overseeing
   policy framing, utilization, planning and development of water resources (i) State Water
   Resources Council (SWRC) chaired by the Chief Minister and (ii) Standing Committee
   on State Water Resources (SC) chaired by Chief Secretary.
c. SWRPD also heads a state level coordination committee constituted to have planning
   based on micro watershed basis and to have close coordination between water related
   departments (August 2011).
d. Budget: Separate budget head has been provided for department since financial year
   2006-07.
Achievements of SWRPD
Policy matters: Revision of state water policy:
a. SWRPD prepared revised State water policy in accordance with National Water Policy
   2002 and recommendations of Expert Committee constituted by GOR in June 2004.
   Revised State Water Policy has been adopted by GOR in February 2010;
b. GOR adopted (June 2011) National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007 to
   address R&R issues in infrastructure development projects across all sectors in the State.
c. State Water Resources Regulatory Authority is also proposed to be established in the
   state. The draft Act has been approved by the state cabinet and is under consideration
   with state legislature for approval;
Planning, allocation and regulatory functions: In conformity to state water policy, all the
new water utilization projects are being cleared by SWRPD after assessment of the water
availability in the basin. Proposals for linking of Parbati, Kalisindh, & Chambal Rivers have
been prepared which is under consideration with GOR; District wise, block wise and basin
wise reassessment of groundwater resources; Study on planning of water resources of
Rajasthan has been got conducted and is in advance stage of finalization; GIS based water
resources digital maps have been prepared with the assistance of State Remote Sensing


                                             72
Application Centre Jodhpur; “Field Operational Manual for the Environment Management
in Water Resource Projects” for the Rajasthan State for guiding the field staff of the WRD
Rajasthan to mainstream environmental management from planning, implementation to
O&M stages in Water Sector projects has been developed and disseminated to all the staff
through workshops; To enhance the monitoring of environmental aspects and identify an
action plan for SWRPD, “Environmental Management Guidelines and Action Plan of
SWRPD for Water Sector in Rajasthan” has also developed.
Annual Report of SWRPD on Environment named as “State of Environment Report” has
also been published. This activity is contributing in improving monitoring and evaluation
process within SWRPD.
Tribal area plans: There are 20 irrigation schemes located in 3 districts of Udaipur,
Dungarpur and Banswara under RWSRP where tribals constitute more than 25 percent of
WUA members. In accordance with the Tribal Area Development (TAD) strategy agreed for
the project, TAD plans have been prepared and these have been reviewed and cleared by the
Bank for its implementation. All TADPs focusing on training/capacity building of and
livelihood support to tribal WUA members. The concerned Executive Engineers have been
designated as Nodal Officers for implementing TADPs. IMTI, Kota has been assigned the
‘training and capacity building’ component of all TADPs.
Coordination and monitoring function: Prepared “Field Operational Manual for
Environment management in Water Sector”;
Pricing function: Proposals for revision of water tariff prepared, which are under active
consideration of the GOR; Thus the SWRPD has accomplished its most of the mandates.
This is a continuous process and would continue even after closure of RWSRP.
Institutional Capacity Building: As a part of capacity building of water sector institutions,
framework has been developed to present training needs across all the levels and different
functional area of management under water sector. For the purpose of the training of the
framers, officials of WUAs and trainers IMTI Kota at state level have been strengthened.
IMTI, Kota caters the training needs on water management related issues. Training to 20
officers of different departments (Water Resources, GWD, Agriculture and Environment) at
NEERI was imparted in March 2004; Training to 15 officers of Water Resources &
Environment Department held at HCMRIPA, Jaipur regarding Environment Management;
Training on Quality Assurance Management and key construction procedures organized with
the active support of World Bank. IMTI has completed 18 mass awareness camps at scheme
levels wherein the details of various schemes in the tribal area were explained to the farmers.
Training of Trainers has also been conducted under the project. The 36 master trainers
created under the project have been conducting further training for the WUAs in the Tribal
areas.
Financial Progress: Against a provision of INR 189.86 Millions, the expenditure incurred
under the project is only INR 186.531Million. However, this gap is due to fact that during the

                                              73
implementation of the RWSRP, another project i.e. State Partnership Program (SPP) with
grant from European Union for similar activities taken up and state government is
implementing the functions of SWRPD under SPP. Thus, the project objective of this sub –
component has been fulfilled.

Subcomponent A2 - Modernize the MIS
At the time of commencement of RWSRP in 2002, the use of MIS was limited and the water
sector departments were mostly relying on manual data to generate reports for decision
making, which was time consuming and insufficient. Under this subcomponent, Management
Information System (MIS) was introduced with:
   e-messaging: The staffs of the rank of the Chief Engineer, Additional Chief Engineer,
    Superintending Engineer, and Executive Engineer have been assigned official e-mail
    accounts.
   Up-gradation / Development of Water Resource Information System (WRIS) / State
    level Water Resource Database: New, Water resource Information System has been
    designed to handle both regular and ad-hoc queries to automate the process of generating
    reports. Development of web based GIS enabled ‘Water Resources Information System’
    (WRIS). WRIS is a repository of data and processed information of wide spectrum of
    water resource domain pertaining to state of Rajasthan. WRIS enables users and
    stakeholders to maintain up-to-date information on projects, dams, reservoirs, canals,
    anicuts, surface and ground water resources including recharge, chemical analysis and
    water quality of available water, crop. WUAs etc. WRIS was launched in July 2011.
    Training in WRIS applications has been given to 492 officials of WRD, GWD and
    SWPRD has been imparted.
   232 numbers of computers with printers & UPS along with 6 laptops with an expenditure
    of INR 15.85 Million have been procured. Training has been imparted to officers/
    officials of the levels to accustom them with the use of computers.
   Water Resource Geographic Information System (GIS) is for spatial data management
    and store time dependent spatial data. The purpose of this system is to integrate with the
    WRIS and provide a spatial view of state water resources data. GIS application (ARC
    GIS) is being used by GWD. As a part of WRIS the consultant has developed GIS
    module
   Preparation of digitized maps of 14 river basins for developing GIS based water
    resources development plans. Initially the digital maps were based on 17 layers. Now an
    additional layer of canal network is also being added. These GIS layers would help WRD
    in its basin wise planning of basins, which can also, be useful for the tasks related with
    development and sustainable use of water resources of the state.




                                             74
   State government introduced ‘Integrated Finance Management System – IFMS’ for
    budgeting and accounting purpose.
Financial Progress: Against a provision of INR 376.96 Millions, the expenditure incurred
under the project is only INR 20.242 Million. However, this gap is due reduction in cost of
consultancies and availability of computers at much lower cost. Thus the project objective of
this sub –component has been fulfilled.

Subcomponent A3 - Water Resources Research Fund
This sub-component was provided) to support studies addressing to (i) cross-sectoral issues
on water management and planning, (ii) engineering and hydrology issues (iii) environmental
issues, (iv) basin planning and modeling, (v) water markets and prices, (vi) ground water
regulation and pricing, (vii) farmers and other users participation, (viii) role of women and
other target groups, (ix) water efficient irrigation and new technologies and (x) irrigation
production and sustainability issues (including IPM). This was basically enabling provision
to support need based research in water sector. As a part of that some proposals were invited
but none of them were found unique and useful. It was also realized that central and state are
also carrying out similar studies. Therefore, to avoid unnecessary duplication, no activity
under this project was taken up.

Subcomponent A4 - Information, Education and Communication
Project adopted IEC strategy and activities for creating mass awareness among community to
improve water situation through participatory approach. State wide generic messages on
critical nature and importance of water resources, its conservation, and sustainable
management, requirements to support WUAs in participatory rehabilitation of surface water
including irrigation systems and groundwater resources and their sustainable management
were developed and disseminated among all the stakeholders. Extensive IEC campaign (Jal
Abhiyan) was launched in December 2005. Pamphlets, banners, posters, and newsletters
were used to convey messages for conservation and sustainable utilization of water resources
of the state.
Financial Progress: Against a provision of INR 42.86 Millions, the expenditure incurred
under the project is only INR 14.80 Million. However this gap is due to fact that the state
government is implementing the functions of SWRPD under SPP. Thus the project objective
of this sub–component has been fulfilled.

Subcomponent A5 - Capacity Building for Sustainable Ground Water Management
Groundwater pilots in three aquifers, located in Sikar, Rajsamand and Jodhpur districts which
represent different hydro-geological conditions, were taken up for its development and to test
the approaches and practices for community based aquifer level ground water management.
The works on these pilots have been successfully completed.



                                             75
Communities in these pilot areas have been organized into 70 Gram Panchayat Level
Committees (GPLCs) and these have been federated into 3 Ground Water Management
Associations (GWMAs) at the aquifer level and have been registered under Registration of
Societies Act. Re-elections have been conducted and 64 GPLCs & 1 GWMA were formed.
All the physical activities envisaged under these pilots have been completed. These include
installation of 66 piezometers, 15 rain-gauge stations, installation of 1600 water meters,
preparation of 9 layer GIS maps with the help of Regional Remote Sensing Service Centre,
Jodhpur, training to GPLCs about measuring of daily rainfall at the 5 rain-gauge stations in
each pilot area, recording changes in the water levels in the piezometers by the GWD, and
construction of 325 groundwater recharge structures to augment to groundwater recharge, by
the GPLCs with 15 percent community contribution. In addition to 66 piezometers in pilot
area, additionally 783 piezometers have also been installed under the project (total 849
piezometers).
Daily rainfall data and water levels in key observation wells are being recorded by the
GPLCs. The system established for maintenance of records by the community has brought
transparency and confidence of the community in the system and the process.
Water meters have been installed on 1600 wells within the aquifer area in Rajsamand district
to measure actual extraction of groundwater for agriculture.
7 office buildings for GPLCs and GWMAs have been completed and works of another 20
buildings are nearing completion. Construction of remaining 46 office buildings has been
delayed for various reasons like non allotment of land to GPLCs/GWMAs by the
Government, delay in contracting works and contractual disputes. GOR propose to complete
remaining buildings even after closure of the project.
Monitoring of water levels every month in the piezometers in three pilot areas is being done.
Yearly replenishable groundwater recharge is being estimated on the basis of rainfall data of
rain gauge stations in pilot areas and the fluctuations of water levels monitored in the
piezometers, which is being shared with GPLCs and GWMAs.
Financial Progress: Against a provision of INR 677.88 Millions, the expenditure incurred
under the project is INR 267.332 Million. However, this gap is due to (i) during execution, it
was noticed that number of ground water recharge structures required/ feasible are lesser in
comparison to those contemplated during project preparation, (ii) actual cost of ground water
recharge structures reduced in comparison to that envisaged during project preparation and
(iii) some of the office buildings for GPLCs and GWMAs could not be constructed due to
non-availability of land and other reasons. Nevertheless all the important physical works
have been completed and thus the project objective of this sub –component has been fulfilled.

Subcomponent A6: Piloting Commercialization of Surface Irrigation
During initial stage of the project, such activity was not found feasible, since the beneficiary
cultivators and state was not ready to implement this activity. During the MTR, the State

                                              76
government decided to reduce the cost of the project; so no activity was carried out under this
sub-component and was dropped.

Subcomponent A7 - Strengthen R&R Institutional Capacity
Prior to RWSRP, there was no separate unit for overseeing rehabilitation and resettlement
and R & R of oustees was being done by field officers without any guidelines and policy:
R&R policy for all the state's water resources development projects was adopted by GOR in
October 2000. Directorate for Rehabilitation and Resettlement was also established in WRD
in the year 2002. Subsequently, GOR has adopted (June 06, 2011) National Resettlement and
Rehabilitation (R&R) Policy 2007 to address R&R issues in infrastructure development
projects across all sectors in the state.
As a part of capacity building in managing R&R, the training on land acquisition and
resettlement for WRD Engineers was organized by IMTI, Kota under the project.
Resettlement/rehabilitation of families affected by new projects is being done by project
authorities in close coordination with district revenue officers and the principles laid down
the R&R policy are being followed.
Financial Progress: Against a provision of INR 64.06 Millions, the expenditure incurred
only Rs. 0.075 Million. However important activities of this sub-component have been
completed and thus the project objective of this sub –component has been fulfilled.

Project Component B: Improving Irrigation System Performance

Sub-component B1 - Forming and fostering of WUAs
During the project preparation, as a part of major reform initiative in the Water sector GOR
enacted the RFPMIS Act 2000 on November 20, 2000. After starting of the project GOR
notified RFPMIS Rule 2002 on October 22, 2002 enabling formation of WUOs in the project
area. WUOs were formed to take over management and maintenance of minor canal level of
irrigation system for efficient and economical use of water.
The elections for WUAs, distributary committee, and project committee were conducted by
officers of concerned divisions of WRD with the assistance of district administration after
preparation of voter list. In the year 2002-03, 500 WUAs, 78 Distributary Committee (DC)
and 2 Project level Committee (PC) have been formed. As per RFPMIS Rules 2002, the
tenure of WUA is five years. Accordingly, elections for second term were held in the year
2007-08 wherein 525 WUAs (including 20 WUAs under new area of Bhakra canal system),
46 DC and 2 PC were formed in project area in the year 2007-08 (Annexure 2). The
formation of remaining WUOs could not be completed due to litigation proceedings in the
court and for want of amendments in the Act 2000 & Rules 2002. Elections for the third term
are in progress and so far 120 WUAs have been formed. Capacity building training has been
imparted to all the elected WUA office bearers. IMTI Kota has imparted training to trainers


                                              77
(TOT) of the WRD. These TOT conduct more hand-on training directly with WUAs and
departmental staff. Three exposure trips of presidents of DCs and PCs have been organized
to Andhra Pradesh; After rehabilitation, minor level canal systems have been handed over to
523 WUAs for O&M of the canal. For enhancing capacity, and for promoting effective
functioning and fostering of farmers organizations, 4 NGOs covering WUAs of 6 Water
Resources Divisions (Sirohi, Jawai Canal Division Sumerpur, Pali, Chittorgarh, Jaipur and
Dausa) of WUOs were engaged with contract value of INR 3.76 Million. Office
accommodations to 374 WUAs, 19 DC and 2 PC have been provided; WUAs were provided
with command area maps as well as other documents in order to equip them in familiarizing
with the inventory and terrain of the command area so that they can perform their function
with ease;
Financial sustainability is a prerequisite for running of any institution and hence initial cash
incentive support of INR 1000.00 had also been provided to each of the WUAs. Other basic
facilities such as office furniture, stationery etc. has also been provided to these WUAs. Bank
accounts have been opened for all the WUAs; GOR has issued order that 50 percent of
collected water charges/tax distributed amongst Water Users’ Association, Distributary
Committee and Project Committee for maintenance of the system under their control. About
35 percent of the WUAs have received share of collected water charges/tax.
As a part of participatory rehabilitation of canal works, 519 works on minor canals having
discharge less than 10 cusec were got executed through WUAs (cost of completion as INR
366.70 Millions) with their contribution @ 15 percent of cost in the form of cash and/or kind.
515 of such works have been completed and another 4 are in progress and would be
completed through state government fund;
Financial Progress: Against a provision of INR 101.84 Millions, the expenditure incurred
under the project is INR 60.486 Million. This gap between project provision and actual
expenditure is mainly due to non- completion of some of the WUOs office buildings.
However all the important activities have been completed and thus the project objective of
this sub –component has been fulfilled.

Sub–Component B2 - Participatory Rehabilitation of Irrigation Schemes
In addition to 87 irrigation schemes, canal rehabilitation works in the Chambal Right Main
Canal (which is the common carrier of water between Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh) was
included in the Project in 2009. Total expenditure of Rs. 1603.30 Million was incurred for
this work. As per the agreement between the Government of Rajasthan (GOR) and
Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) the expenditure on common carrier of water (i.e.
Chambal Right Main Canal) is required to be shared in the ratio of 75.4 percent by the
GOMP and 24.6 percent by the GOR. Therefore only Rs. 394.5 Million (which is equivalent
24.6 percent share of GOR) has been charge under the RWSRP.
Financial progress: Against a provision of INR 5844.42 Millions, the expenditure incurred
under the project is INR 6826.38 Million. The main reason of the excess under this sub-

                                              78
component is due to price escalation during the implementation period of 11 years. All the
important physical works have been completed and thus the project objective of this sub–
component has been fulfilled.

Sub-Component B3 - Strengthening of Agriculture support service:
Institutional strengthening: For promoting inter-department coordination and effective
implementation of various activities, a state level Coordination Committee headed by
Commissioner of Agriculture was set up. It has representation from irrigation, animal
husbandry, cooperation and other relevant line departments. 12 meetings of SCC have been
convened. Operational unit under the Directorate of Agriculture at Jaipur looked after the
implementation, progress of ASS component. District Technical Support Group (DTSG) at
all 24 districts of the project area Technical Support Groups in 324 WUAs levels have been
constituted for the project and are functional. The work of delivery of extension services was
completed on pilot basis in seven irrigation schemes spread over different agro-climatic zone
through 7 selected NGOs in the year 2009-10. Need-based equipment and implements were
provided for strengthening 60 soil testing laboratories and adaptive trial centers. 77743 soil
samples and 11217 water samples were collected and analyzed from the project area and
results were used to determine the crops and nutrient application. TSGs undertook baseline
surveys during the project period for 281 WUAs (2677 surveys) and data recorded during the
surveys were used for preparation of action plans. 4722 general meetings were organized at
the WUA levels to discussed and prepare the Action plan.
Capacity building of framers and line department staff: Training courses for capacity
building of the field functionaries have been organized at several reputed training institutes
like GBPUAT, Pant Nagar, MPUAT Udaipur, IMTI Kota, DOR Hyderabad, TNAU
Coimbatore etc. The departmental officials, engaged in the project activities were trained on
various agricultural aspects like INM, IPM, Water management, Soil health, PRA etc. In
these training programmes more than 617 officers participated as Master Trainers and more
than 18751 as TSG members. Trainings were organized at the demonstration sites in which
more than 0.58 Million WUA farmers participated and learnt about various aspects of
improved agriculture with the objectives to increase the crop productivity and farm income.
DOA organized 14 exposure visits cum training programs for TSG members and 96 for
WUA farmers. The participants visited various places /fields in nearby states where lot of
work on improved agriculture and water management has been done. At state level 8 and at
WUA level 3921 awareness workshops were organized. One six days training on
participatory irrigated cropping system was held at WTC, Coimbatore. Training on mass
media production of bio pesticides/bio agents was held at Directorate of Oilseeds Research,
Hyderabad.
Support to agriculture research: 23 research studies were awarded to the selected research
institutes /NGOs for carrying out need based research on participatory mode. All the studies



                                             79
have been completed successfully. The recommendations generated were finalized and
circulated in the field for adoption.
Demonstration of improved implements and micro-irrigation systems: For promoting
use of improved farm machinery and implements 3546 demonstrations on farm machinery
and implements were organized in the project areas. 75 and 78 demonstrations were also
organized on sprinkler irrigation system and drip irrigation system, respectively. 4000 soils
surveys were conducted.
On-farm demonstrations: 36300 demonstrations on various improved crop production
technologies, INM, IPM, crop diversification were organized in the project area. To increase
the seed replacement rate and make the farmers aware about role of quality seed in
agriculture, enhanced program on on-farm seed production in the project areas was taken up
and 54263 demonstrations were organized. The seed produced under this activity so far was
shared by the WUA farmers as seed. On farm seed production demonstration are also being
taken up in the project area to enhance the Seed Replacement Rate (SRR) of such crops,
improved seeds of which are less in availability to the WUA farmers. During Kharif 2011,
2700 demonstrations on seed production of Sorghum, cluster bean, moong bean, soya bean,
black gram etc. were organized. Digi cum drip demonstration in cotton in two districts
Sriganganagar and Hanumangarh are in progress. Total 46 diggis (Sri Ganganagar 27,
Hanumangarh 19) were constructed in the project area. In cotton crop 10 drip system (Sri
Ganganagar 6, Hanumangarh 4) were installed. Drip demonstration in cotton crop –3
demonstrations on drip irrigation in cotton crop in two districts (Bhilwara 2, Chittorgarh 1)
had been installed.
Impact evaluation: Impact Monitoring consultant conducted 3 surveys during 2004-05,
2006-07 & 2008-09 and has submitted all the reports. Now Impact Monitoring is being done
departmentally by the Agriculture Department. Impact study indicated that rehabilitation of
canal network has reduced transmission losses and significantly improved the availability of
water in the middle and tail regions resulting in improved equity in water distribution. About
40 percent farmers are now using improved seeds and the demonstrated crop and water
management practices like soil test based fertilizer application and irrigation at critical
stage(s) of crop growth.
Financial progress: Against a provision of INR 581.57 Millions, the expenditure incurred
under the project is INR 407.864 Million. However, this gap is due to saving in various
consultancies, saving in supervision cost, minor savings under other sub-heads. All the
important physical activities have been completed and it has played a key role in increasing
crop yields and improving famer incomes.

Sub-Component B4 - Dam Safety work
Total 16 dams of which 3 leftover dam namely Alnia, Gambhiri and Morel and remaining
work of Parbati dam from the earlier implemented World Bank assisted Dam Safety Project
were included in the project. Of these 16 dams, safety works on 6 dams were proposed to be

                                             80
dropped during MTR (December 2005) since the finalization of their hydrology dully vetted
by CWC and thereafter finalization of remedial dam safety works through DSRP would be
very time consuming and it was not possible to award any contract and complete remedial
works during project period. The GOR also decided during the MTR, to reduce the cost of
the project. As such dam safety works on 6 dams were dropped. During the extended period
from April 2010, the remedial measure on 2 more dams could not be finalized and due to
time constraint, dam safety works on these 2 dams were dropped from the project. Finally
dam safety works on only 8 dams were undertaken. GOR intends to carryout remedial works
on dropped 8 dams from its own resources. As per Development Credit Agreement, Dam
Safety Review Panel (DSRP) was established by GOR in September 2002 and again revived
in October 2011, to provide technical review and approve of each safety proposal, to review
and advice on any distress situation/problem, as and when these arise, during actual
implementation of dam safety works. DSRP panel discussed rehabilitation works of Alnia,
Gudha, Gambhiri, Nandsamand, Orai, Jetpura, Juggar, Mashi, Parbati, Abhayapura dams
during its 16 meetings.
Financial progress: Against a provision of INR 847 Millions, the expenditure incurred
under the project is INR 1049.216 Million. The main reason of the excess under this sub-
component is due to (i) price escalation during the implementation period of 11 years and (ii)
execution of additional works as per recommendations of DSRP. All the important physical
works have been completed and thus the project objective of this sub–component has been
fulfilled.

Component C - Project Management
This component supported establishment of a Project Management Unit (PMU) to ensure the
effective implementation and coordination of activities that involves several government
departments (i.e. SWRPD, GWD, agriculture and environment). All legal covenants have
complied with except revision of water charges. Meanwhile GOR is providing budgetary
support for O&M of the works for the schemes taken up for rehabilitation under RWSRP
through various scheme till water rates are revised.
Financial Progress: Against a provision of INR 44.24 Millions, the expenditure incurred
under the project is INR 107.21 Million. The main reason of the excess under this sub-
component is due to increased cost of establishment during project implementation period.

Additional Financing
Under RWSRP – additional financing mainly 3 activities were required to be completed: (i)
rehabilitation / modernization of canal in 47307 ha of additional CCA in Bhakra system, (ii)
implementation of SCADA in Gang – Bhakra irrigation scheme; and (iii) implementation of
Hydrological Information System (HIS). The rehabilitation works on Bkakra canal system
have been completed with an expenditure of Rs.413.68 million.



                                             81
The activity under SCADA and HIS were new initiatives for Rajasthan, and adequate
knowhow was not available and staffs were also not trained. This resulted in initial delay in
preparations for these activities. However, the contracts for SCADA and HIS could not be
awarded as no bidder was found responsive even after invitation of bids twice. Thereafter
due to time constraints, these activities were not likely to be completed within project period.
Accordingly, the DEA, GOI was requested by GOR to cancel these activities in September
2012.
RWSRP - additional financing also supported few water sector studies i.e. preparation of
operation and maintenance manual, recycling of used and waste water, water pollution,
reducing transmission and distribution losses, improving water use / operational efficiency.
However, GOR decided not to utilize funds against these studies from the RWSRP because
the grant money was available under SPP-EU grant for similar studies. Under SSP a number
of studies under water sector have been awarded including (i) Water Auditing & Bench
Marking of the irrigation project, (ii) preparation of IWRM plan, and (iii) study on planning
of water resources of Rajasthan which includes preparation of long term plan and policy for
development and management of the water resources of, both surface (internal & external)
and ground water on comprehensive and integrated basis.

Assessment of Objectives, Design, Implementation and Operational experience
Assessment of project objectives: The project development objectives were in consistence
with GOR and GOI, water sector management policies relating to restructuring and capacity
building of the water sector institutions for strategic planning and management of water
resources in the State of Rajasthan, as well as improving the irrigation service performance
through active participation of beneficiary farmers in the irrigated agriculture. In view of
GOR, the project development objectives of the project were well conceived and appropriate.
The GOR is also of the view that development objective of the project have been largely
achieved.

Assessment of Project Design:
Component ‘A’ A new State Water Resources Planning Department (SWRPD) was created
and made operational with a view to separate the overall water resources planning
functioning for various uses from the water use specific service delivery function. The
officers and staff of the different water sector institutions in the State of Rajasthan i.e. GWD,
SWRPD, WRD, AD, ED were provided trainings on various aspects of water resources
planning and management, as a part of institutional capacity building. As described above,
most of the planned activities under this component were completed, which resulted in
meeting the first development objective of the project.
Component ‘B’ ,Consequent to the above mentioned activities undertaken and completed
under the project, water use efficiency increased from 30 percent to 40.4 percent, reliability
of water delivery from head to tail increased, agriculture productivity increased for wheat
from 2.0 tons/ha to 3.89 tons/ha and for mustard 1 tons/ha to 1.68 tons/ha. Rehabilitation of
dam has improved the life of old existing dams and is safe. Therefore in summary, most of
the planned activities under the component were successfully implemented under this project
which has resulted in meeting the second project development objective relating to
Improving Irrigation System Performance.

Assessment of Project Implementation and Operational experience:
The project became effective from March 22, 2002 and was originally scheduled to be
completed in six years’ time period by March 31, 2008. However, the project could actually
be completed on March 31, 2013 with 2 extension of one year each in 2008 and 2009 and


                                                 83
thereafter 3 year’s extension with Additional Financing in the year 2010. These extensions
were given due to delays in project implementation for reasons beyond the control of the
project implementing agency i.e. GOR. These reasons for the delays are: (i) This was the first
multi-sectoral project in water sector in Rajasthan involving various water related
departments and many innovative activities such as formation of WUAs, GPLCs, ground
water pilots projects, new separate department (SWRPD). It took considerable time to
complete all these activities. (ii) This was a new project of its kind involving various line
departments, to establish proper coordination between these departments substantial time was
taken. (iii)The canal rehabilitation/ modernization works took considerable time in
comparison to what had been contemplated during project formulation, since the works were
required to be executed in limited working season in view of running of canals for long
period. (iv) As per DCA, the remedial measures under dam safety sub-component were to be
executed after finalization of hydrology by CWC followed by approval of remedial works by
DSRP. This took significant time.
In addition to above, the factors affecting the progress, which were beyond the control of
GOR include: (i) a severe drought in the first year of the project (2002-03) in the State that
diverted departmental staff and administrative machinery for drought relief works which
impacted project implementation, and (ii) State Assembly and National Parliament elections
in the second year of the project (2003-04), resulting in the imposition of model code of
conducts and diversion of project staff on election duties that adversely affected award of
contracts and project implementation.
Due to above reasons, the project took more time than anticipated. However overall most of
the planned activities were completed.

5.       Project impact assessment of the project
Within project area:
        The creation and operationalization of SWRPD has contributed in multi-sectoral
         planning, better policy advice to GOR for example preparation of revised river basin
         plans, new water sector projects are being approved by SWRPD, publication of
         guidelines regarding environment management, adoption of R&R policy etc.
        One of the intended outcomes from the project is sustainable inter-sectoral allocation
         and use of increasingly scarce water resources in the state along with strengthened
         environmental capacity.
        Participatory irrigation management concept has been implemented in the project
         with encouraging results. Duly elected WUAs are in place and have taken over the
         operation and management of distributaries and minors of the canal system in the
         project area. Active involvement of WUOs in water management, resulting in water
         reaching up to tail, disputes among the farmers reduced, water delivery and water use
         efficiency increased.

                                               84
      Some important achievements and value addition under the project from
       environmental management perspective are: (i) Development of Environmental
       Management Guidelines and Action Plan for SWRPD, (ii) An annual publication of
       “State of Environment” report as a regular work of SWRPD and (iii) A “Field
       operational Manual on Environmental Management” for Irrigation Department field
       staff and engineers, (iv) Enhancing stakeholder awareness towards IPM and INM
       practices and (v) Institutional improvements and Trainings.
      The ground water pilot with its early success has brought a paradigm shift in terms of
       adopting aquifer as a unit for sustainable groundwater management by the community.
       The aquifer management pilot has also been a game changer in terms of thinking in
       the sector for sustainable groundwater management in the aquifer. Further scale up
       would lead to sustainable use of groundwater through community participation;
      Rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation systems have improved the water use
       efficiency with improved delivery of surface water resulting in increased agricultural
       production and subsequent farm incomes in the project area. The farmers after
       implementation of the project are getting water with better reliability as compared to
       pre project condition. Based on data collected for 66 schemes, various performance
       indicators are as under.
      Water use efficiency at scheme level (expressed as the area (ha) irrigated per Mm³ of
       annual water supply at the head works and is ratio of total annual area irrigated in the
       scheme to total annual supply at the head works) has increased up to 253.78 ha/Mm3
       from 211.39 ha/Mm3 (2003-04) (refer Annexure 6/1).
      There is a considerable diversification in the cropping pattern in the area. Crops like
       Isabgol, Allovera (which were till recently unknown crops in the state) are fast
       expanding in the project area and around. The irrigated farming is attracting farmers
       for enhanced area under vegetables and short duration herbs’ cultivation. The
       coriander, cumin, garlic, methi, tomato chilies etc. are already known crops, the area
       of which (although very low) is also expanding gradually.
Outside project area
      The RWSRP has also influenced the design of other projects being undertaken by the
       GOR e.g. Rajasthan Minor Irrigation Improvement Project funded by JICA wherein
       385 WUAs were formed before starting the canal rehabilitation work and multi-
       sectoral and participatory approach has been adopted. New water sector projects are
       being cleared by SWRPD.

6.       Assessment of performance of the Bank
The Bank support to the project is encouraging. The Bank has regularly offered critical
suggestions for improving project implementation. World Bank supervision missions have
been taking place at regular intervals. The project implementation benefited from a high
degree of continuity in responsibility both from the Bank & GOR. During entire period of
implementation period, core Bank task team remained unchanged. GOR’s implementing
agencies remained the same throughout the project period although there were changes in
team leadership. However, the changes did not affect project implementation. These factors
contributed to a smooth supervision experience and improved follow up and timely action on
implementation issues. 20 formal supervision missions took place at the rate of two per year,
but the Bank’s supervision was continuous and part of Bank team was based in Delhi and
task manager and selected staff visited the project sites in between formal supervision
missions. The team members of the supervision mission, being renowned experts in different
areas, provided high quality of technical and managerial advice on several issues, including
water sector institutions, participatory irrigation management, procurement, financial
management, agriculture extension services, groundwater, and environmental issues etc.
Mission field visit and Aide Memorie greatly helped in guiding implementing agencies for
realizing project outputs. World Bank’s norms and guidelines for quality control mechanism
were effective to improve quality of work. The Bank assisted and guidance to the field
engineers and staff from time to time in achieving the quality of rehabilitation works. The
Bank’s missions have played the role of a facilitator and partner in development, which has
had a healthy impact on borrower. Additional financing provided a boost to development of
the most critical area of the state. Another important outcome of RWSRP with active support
of Bank is creation of State Water Resources Planning Department, which has facilitated
inter-disciplinary and multi sectoral planning of water resources in the state and a way
forwards towards creation of Rajasthan Water Regulatory Authority. Supervisory mission of
Bank provided valuable guidance and support for creation of these apex bodies. The
reimbursement of funds was smooth and timely.
A very good working relationship was established and continued throughout the entire
project period among Bank staff, the GOR and its implementing agencies. The supervision
missions played a supportive role in the development of participatory irrigation development
policy. The technical advice and support provided by the successive missions contributed to
identification and resolution of several implementation issues. In view of the above, the
quality of Bank’s supervision was highly satisfactory

7.       Assessment of Borrower’s own performance
The overall performance of GOR was satisfactory as explained below: -
        RWSRP was designed a new and innovative kind of project. Despite of complexity
         and challenges GOR was able to complete the project.



                                             86
      Most of the planned activities under the project were completed, which included: (i)
       creation of SWRPD, (ii) enhancement of environment management skill, (iii) revision
       of state water policy, (v) institutional capacity building of GOR officers and farmers
       (vi) establishment of WRIS, (vii) rehabilitation of canal system under 87 irrigation
       schemes, (viii) dam safety works at 8 dams, (ix) formation of 525 WUAs, and
       transfer of canal systems to 523 WUAs (x) implementation of 3 aquifer level
       community based ground water pilots including formation of 70 GPLCs, (xi)
       strengthening of agriculture support services in the project area.
      All the project performance indicators under the project were achieved.
      Discounting the exchange rate, fluctuation and dropping of few activities the project
       was able to spend the project amount in terms of Rs. 8526.456 Million at the end of
       the project as against the original project estimated cost Rs. 8305.07 Million. In
       addition to above Rs. 413.68 Million were also spent under Additional Financing.

Lesson Learnt
      All the water sector projects should be designed on multi-sectoral approach.
      Involvement of project beneficiaries groups is the key to create ownership of project
       intervention and their sustainability.
      The procurement of civil works should be taken up after detailed investigations and
       designs.
      WUAs have been formed in a big way in the state for the first time. Although there
       had been substantial improvement in the working of WUAs, still more is required to
       be done with strong political commitment so that system generated under RWSRP is
       sustainable. Continuous training and capacity building of WUAs is required.
      Rajasthan Water Resources Regulatory Act, which is yet to be approved by State
       Legislature Assembly, should be enacted.
      Establishment of strong M&E system to monitor project progress and assessment of
       impact is essentially required with dedicated staff.

Future operation of project
The SWRPD is a separate department like any other existing department of the state
government. The SWRPD is also listed in the GoR Rules of Business like any other
department of GoR. A separate budget head has been provided to the SWRPD by the GoR
and the annual allocation under the state budget is also made to SWRPD like for any other
department. Therefore, after the closure of RWSRP on March 31, 2013, the SWRPD would
continue to function like any other regular department of GoR for carrying out its roles and
responsibilities from the budgetary support of GoR. It is worthwhile to mention that the
establishment cost of the SWRPD under the project was designed to reduce from 85 percent

                                             87
in the beginning to 20 percent by April 2007. Accordingly since 2007 the GoR is providing
80 percent of the establishment cost of SWRPD from its own budget. After the project closer
on March 31, 2013, the GoR would continue to support the SWRPD like any other
department of GoR to enable it to perform its mandated functions from the State budget.
Water Users Organization (WUOs): The 573 WUOs are the legal entities with specific
roles and responsibilities, and are required to continue and function as per the provision of
said act. The Managing Committees of WUOs have fix tenure of 5 years and therefore the
fresh elections are required to be held at the interval of 5 years. Accordingly, elections have
already held in 2002-2003 and 2007-2008 respectively and the third term elections of the
WUOs are already under way. It may be emphasized that under the said Act these WUOs are
permanent institutions and will continue to function in future as well as per the provisions of
the said Act. As a matter of fact, in addition to the 573 WUOs formed under the RWSRP,
similar associations have also been formed by the GoR in a number of other irrigation
schemes outside the project as a part of the GoR policy to form WUOs in all the irrigation
schemes in the state, in phases in medium term. The GoR has also established IMTI, Kota
since 1984. IMTI, Kota was the responsible agency for the training and the capacity building
of the WUOs under the project and IMTI Kota would continue to play this role even after
closure of the project as part of the mandate. It is also mentioned that, to ensure the
operational sustainability of WUOs, RFPMIS Act, 2000 has a provision permitting the
WUOs to raise resources/amount from their members to meet their day to day operational
costs including their office expenditure.
GPLCs and GWMAs in ground water pilot areas: 70 GPLCs and 3 GWMAs have been
formed and registered under the Society Registration Act and would continue to function
under the technical guidance and overall support of Ground Water Department, GoR even
after the closure of the project.
Rehabilitation of canal systems in 87 irrigation systems: Rehabilitation works of 86
irrigation schemes were already completed by the project closure and in the remaining 1
scheme (Parwan), some of the rehabilitation works which could not be completed by project
closer, are under implementation and would be completed from state fund. In all above
mentioned schemes the tertiary (minor) level canal systems have been handed over to the
WUAs for their operation and maintenance. However, the main and the distributary canals
would be operated and maintained by WRD, till a decision is taken by the GoR to hand over
these higher level of irrigation system to the WUOs over a period of time for O&M purposes.
For the purpose of O&M of the irrigation systems, 50 percent of the water charges collected
by the WUOs are returned back to them to undertake the O&M works at the tertiary level of
the canal system. It needs to be emphasized that the Rajasthan State Water Policy, 2010
stipulates provision of full O&M cost for providing the sustainable irrigation service delivery
and accordingly the GoR is committed to revise the water charges to meet the full O&M
requirement, and pending the above revision of water charges, the GoR is committed to



                                              88
support the O&M activities through budgetary support/other financing sources from
Central/State schemes such as MNREGA and MP/MLA local area development fund etc.
Dam safety works: Under the project 8 dams were taken up for dam safety works. Of these
8 dams, dam safety works in 6 dams have been fully completed by project closure. In
remaining 2 dams also, about 90 percent dams safety works have been completed by project
closure, and the GoR is committed to complete the remaining 10 percent works from the
State fund.
Other Assets: In addition to institutional and physical activities mentioned above, some
other assets have also been created under the project. These include (i) acquiring of
computers and hardware/software for the implementation of Management Information
System in WRD, SWRPD and GWD, (ii) purchase of scientific equipment as a part of
strengthening of institutional capacity of GWD and (iii) scientific equipment for the
strengthening of laboratories of Agriculture Department. These, and such other assets
acquired under the project would be operated and maintained by the respective
departments/agencies of GoR even after the project closure.
Borrower’s comment on ICRR
General Comments: The draft ICRR is disproportionately focusing on negatives (what have
not happened) than on positives (what have happened/achieved) under the project, and
therefore, giving distorted picture, and resulting in unbalanced and wrong conclusions/ratings.
Further, there are a number of inconsistencies in the text, and most of the ratings are based on
subjective judgments and are not properly explained and justified. Therefore, the narratives
and the facts and figures in the draft ICRR are required to be appropriately corrected.
Following facts and figures need to be corrected:
(i)    The para relating to construction of GPLCs/GWMAs (at Page 64) needs to be
       modified as “Of the total 73 office buildings for GPLCs and GWMAs, 39 office
       building have been completed. The construction of remaining 34 office building has
       been delayed due to delays in allotment of land to GPLCs/GWMAs by the
       Government, delay in contracting works/contractual disputes. However GOR is
       committed to complete these remaining office buildings even after closure of the
       project”.
(ii)   Under Para 2.8 (at Page 65) dealing with the incentive/support to the WUAs one more
       line needs to be added as “Consequent to signing of MOUs between the WUAs and
       WRD for the transferring irrigation management and O&M responsibility to WUAs,
       the GoR has also provided financial incentive support to the WUAs for the payment
       to Water Master engaged by the WUAs @ Rs. 1500.00 per month per WUAs for the
       first year, Rs. 1000.00 per month per WUAs for second year and Rs. 500.00 per
       month per WUAs for third year, beginning from the year 2010, under the project.



                                              89
(iii)       Under Para 5 dealing with Project Impact Assessment of the Project (at Page 72)
            following points needs to be appropriately added after sub Point 5(a)(vi):–
           Water use efficiency at scheme level (expressed as the area (ha) irrigated per Mm³ of
            annual water supply at the head works and is ratio of total annual area irrigated in the
            scheme to total annual supply at the head works) has increased by about 20 percent
            (up to 253.78 ha/Mm3 from 211.39 ha/Mm3 ).
           Water delivery efficiency (expressed as the percentage of the “Total annual volume of
            irrigation water delivered to user groups to total annual volume of irrigation water
            released at head) has increased by about 24 percent (up to 79.43 % during the year
            2011-12 from 55.24 % during initial period);
           Reliability of water delivery at user group level (expressed as the ratio of “annual
            volume of irrigation water actually delivered to water users groups to annual volume
            of irrigation water agreed to be delivered to water users by WRD”) increased from
            0.53 to 0.78 from initial stage of the project to the end of the project
           The overall change in crop production per unit Water Delivered Ratio has been
            increased from 501.03 to 807.71 Ton per MCM for wheat and from 753.85 to
            1114.32 Ton per MCM for mustard
           The overall change in crop production in rupee per unit of water delivered has been
            increased from INR 44.59 Lac to INR 96.94 Lac per MCM for wheat and from INR
            151.02 Lac to INR 203.23 Lac per MCM for mustard

Results Framework Analysis - PDO indicators:
(i) Under the first part of the PDO only one project performance indicator, namely relating
    to preparation of river basin plans has been mentioned. This needs to be corrected and
    three more key PDO indicators, namely: (a) SWRPD established and fully functional, (b)
    three community ground water pilots implemented and evaluated, and (c) fully
    operational MIS, should be added. Further, progress against all these above four
    indicators needs to be correctly represented and analyzed. For example, on the indicator
    relating to the preparation of river basin plans, the factual position is that against the
    original target of the preparation of 4 river basin plans, and the revised target of
    preparation of 8 river basin plans, the SWRPD has prepared draft river basins plans of all
    15 river basins of Rajasthan State and has circulated these draft plans in March , 2013 to
    the various concerned department/agencies of GoR for their comments, if any, and based
    on comments received all the 15 river basin plans are expected to be finalized in next 2 to
    3 months. From above it is clear that for all the practical purposes, against the targets of 8
    river basin plans, all the 15 river basin plans have been completed by project closure
    itself and therefore the progress against this indicator is almost 200 percent. GoR would
    like to emphasize that all the above mentioned 4 key PDO 1 indicators have been
    achieved under the project.

                                                  90
(ii)   Part 2 of the PDO:
(a) Indicator on Improved surface irrigation systems performance by rehabilitation -
    Last line of the comments under this indicator needs to be modified as “Of the 87
    schemes canal rehabilitation works in 86 schemes have been fully completed and even in
    remaining one scheme (Parwan) over 41 percent were already completed by project
    closer and the remaining works under progress and expected to be completed in next 3 to
    4 months from State fund. Therefore the achievement under this indicator is almost 100
    percent. “
(b) Indicator on Improved surface irrigation systems performance by improved system
    operation efficiency – Details given under this indicator are OK.
(c) Indicator on Established, well-functioning and financially sustainable water users
    associations (WUAs) – The write up in the draft ICRR needs to be revised to reflect the
    factually correct position. The target numbers for the formation of water users
    organizations (WUOs) were subject to revision based on demarcation of boundary of
    WUOs under the actual area covered under the project. Based on this, the target number
    of WUOs [consisting of minor canal level water users associations (WUAs), middle level
    Distributary Canal level committee (DCs) and higher level Project level committee
    (PCs)] required to be formed under the project needs to be corrected as 634 WUOs (530
    WUAs, 89 DCs & 15 PCs). Against this target achievement is 573 WUOs [525 WUAs
    (99%), 46 DCs (52%) & 2 PCs (13%)] which is about 90 percent of the overall target.
    The remaining 5 WUAs could not be formed due to local disputes and the balance 43
    DC/13 PCs could not be formed due to the legal problem of shortfall in the requirement
    of number of Electoral College for electing the DCs/PCs which needs amendment in the
    existing RFPMIS Rules.
The GoR would like to emphasize that all the 525 WUAs formed under the project are fully
functional. All these WUAs have their offices, bank accounts, are maintaining the necessary
records required under RFPMIS Act, 2000 and are also discharging their mandated roles and
responsibilities under this act, such as (i) distribution of irrigation water to its member, (ii)
collection of water charges (iii) maintenance of irrigation system under their area of
operations. A number of training programmes under the project were organized for these
WUAs for building their capacity. However it is true that the level of performance of these
WUAs is not the same in all the schemes. Based on the survey conducted by third party
M&E consultant, more than 70 percent of farmers (71.3% in major, 72% in medium and
72.9% in minor schemes) were of the view that performance of the services provided by
WUAs is satisfactory. Analysis also shows that low performing WUAs are either draught
area or where the inflows in the storage reservoir are irregular, thus having low incentive to
perform. The GoR recognizes that these WUAs are the new institutions and it will require
longer term support for improving their performance and to become sustainable institutions,
and GoR is committed to provide such support as a policy.


                                               91
In RWSRP 525 WUAs have been formed out of this about 360 WUAs are fully functional in
terms of (i) water distribution to farmers (ii) collection of water charges (iii) maintenance of
irrigation system. Rehabilitation works of canal having discharge less than 10 cusecs have
been done with community contribution of 15 percent amounting to Rs. 367.5 Million, and
construction of office buildings have been executed by the WUAs themselves. Bank accounts
have also been opened by them. After rehabilitation, minor level canal systems have been
handed over to 523 WUAs for O&M of the canal and the WUAs has started the O&M of the
canal system under their jurisdiction. In due course of time distributaries, main canals and
other structures etc. will also planned to be handed over to WUOs.
Capacity building and effective functioning of WUOs is key agenda of state Government,
and the State Government is committed to implement it as matter of policy. After the project
closure, the capacity building program, including trainings, workshops would be imparted to
WUOs from state plan fund through IMTI Kota. It is further stated that in addition to the 573
WUOs formed under the RWSRP, in all 1163 WUOs have been constituted on in other
irrigation schemes in Rajasthan. Office buildings for WUOs that could not be completed
during the project period would now be completed from state plan fund, essential furniture
shall also be provided to WUOs after completion of buildings. For all such activities related
to WUOs, GoR has allotted the budget of Rs.51.0 million during 2013-14. From above, it is
clear that the GoR is serious and committed to upscale the formation and fostering the WUOs,
and also to implement the continued capacity building program to ensure the From above it is
also clear that achievement under this indicator is over 90 percent.
Indicator on Full cost recovery of system O&M costs: It is true that the collection of the
water charges has fallen. This is because of the fact that the strength of the 1396 revenue staff
of WRD in position is less than 300 against the requirement of 1396 and remaining posts are
lying vacant, and as a result rate of recovery has fallen considerably. Further, Government
from time to time had waived off the water charges due to natural calamities such as drought,
hail storms etc. which adversely affects the water charges collection target. However, now
that the responsibility of collection of water charges has been transferred to WUOs and that
the WUOs have started the collection of water charges from the members, rate of recovery is
expected to improve considerably in coming years. This is also because the WUOs have the
incentive to collect the water charges as 50 percent of the water charges amount collected by
them is transferred back to them towards for O&M expenditure.
Indicator on Full funding of O&M requirement: The government is committed to provide
sufficient budget for O&M of irrigation system. The State Water Policy also state that water
tariffs will be set towards meeting the full O&M cost, and therefore, the GoR is committed to
move in that direction. Also in the irrigation schemes covered under the project, the lower
level canal system has been handed over to the WUOs for irrigation management and for
carrying out the O&M works, and the WUOs are provided the 50 percent amount of the
water charges amount collected by them towards for O&M expenditure. In addition, O&M
support is also being provided under some rural scheme of the GOI such as MANREGA etc.


                                               92
Thus, with the combination of the above mentioned measures, full O&M requirements are
expected to be met in the medium to long term. These facts are required to be reflected while
analyzing the progress under this indicator.
Indicator on Increased yields for cotton, mustard and wheat: Details given under this
indicator are OK.
Indicator on Restored area under irrigation: Details given under this indicator are OK.
Indicator on Increased farm household incomes: Details given under this indicator are OK.

PDO Ratings:
PDO part 1: GoR does not agree with the “Moderately Satisfactory” rating of the PDO 1
given in the draft ICRR. All the 4 key performance indicators, namely: (a) SWRPD
established and fully functional, (b) 8 river basin plan prepared, (c) three community ground
water pilots implemented and evaluated, and (d) ) fully operational MIS, have been achieved,
and therefore, to rate this PDO as “Moderately Satisfactory” is unjustified and unfair, and
this needs to be rated as “Satisfactory”.
PDO part 2: GoR does not agree with the “Moderately Un-Satisfactory” rating of the PDO
part 1 given in the draft ICRR. Of the 8 key performance indicators, 6 have either exceeded
their target or have been largely achieved, and the reaming 2 indicators relating to water
charges and provision of O&M amount have also been partially met. Therefore, in view of
above, to rate this PDO as “Moderately Unsatisfactory” is unbalanced, unfair and unjustified.
GoR is of the view that the rating of this PDO should be modified to “Satisfactory” in the
draft ICRR.
Bank Performance Ratings: GoR is of the view that the Bank performance ratings is highly
satisfactory during the entire project cycle, and therefore, GoR does not agree with the lower
ratings given in the draft ICRR. During the preparation stage, the Bank worked closely with
the GoR and provided high quality technical advice and assistance in designing the project.
During project implementation stage, the Bank quality of supervision has been commendable.
World Bank supervision missions have been taking place at regular intervals, with in
between need based short missions. The project implementation benefited from a high degree
of continuity in responsibility from the Bank, and during entire period of implementation
period and Bank core task team comprised of required skill mix and of highly qualified
experienced professionals, including Team Leader, remained unchanged. The Bank team
members provided high quality technical and managerial advice on various project
implementation related issues, including water sector institutions, participatory irrigation
management, procurement, financial management, agriculture extension services,
groundwater, and environmental issues etc. During each supervision missions/short
visits/review meetings, the Bank has offered professionally sound and constructive
suggestions to the various implementing agencies of the GoR for improving the project
implementation progress, and has also raised key/critical issues having bearing on the project


                                              93
implementation progress as well as on achieving the project development objectives at all
levels of the Government, including with the Chief Secretary to the GoR. Mission field visits
and Aide Memoire greatly helped in guiding implementing agencies for realizing project
outputs. World Bank’s norms and guidelines for quality control mechanism were effective to
improve quality of work. Another important outcome of RWSRP with active support of Bank
is creation of State Water Resources Planning Department, which has facilitated inter-
disciplinary and multi sectoral planning of water resources in the state and in preparing a way
forwards towards creation of Rajasthan Water Regulatory Authority. A very good working
relationship was established and continued throughout the entire project period among Bank
staff, the GOR and its implementing agencies. The supervision missions played a supportive
role in the development of participatory irrigation development policy. The technical advice
and support provided by the successive missions contributed to identification and resolution
of several implementation issues. In view of the above, the quality of Bank’s supervision was
highly satisfactory.
Borrower Performance: GoR does not agree with the Moderately Satisfactory ratings given
in the draft ICRR. It needs to be recognized that RWSRP was the first multi-sectoral project
undertaken in water sector in Rajasthan, involving various implementing agencies, and with
many new and innovative activities such as establishment of a separate state water resources
planning department (SWRPD), piloting a institutional model for the community based
sustainable ground water management on aquifer level, preparation of river basin plans,
formation and fostering of water users associations (WUAs) and transfer of irrigation
management responsibilities to these WUAs in about 87 irrigation schemes, however, in-
spite of complexities and challenges involved GOR has successfully completed the project.
As explained in detail in the Borrower ICRR, most of the planned activities under the project
were completed. These include: (i) creation and operationalization of a separate SWRPD, (ii)
enhancement of environment management skill, (iii) revision of state water policy, (v)
institutional capacity building of GOR officers and farmers (vi) establishment of MIS (vii)
rehabilitation of canal system in 87 irrigation schemes, (viii) dam safety works at 8 dams,
(ix) formation of 525 WUAs, and transfer of canal systems to these WUAs (x)
implementation of 3 aquifer level community based ground water pilots including formation
of 70 GPLCs, (xi) strengthening of agriculture support services in the project area. The
project has also met most of its project performance indicators. In view of above, the GoR is
of the view that the overall performance of the GoR is Satisfactory.
Other comments:
(i) Revision of water charges: Proposal for approval of revision of water charges has been
    prepared by the SWRPD and submitted to the Government and the matter is in active
    consideration of the government.
(ii) Water Resources Research Fund: Under this project Research Advisory Committee was
     formed and the proposals from various institutions have been invited, but no
     new/innovative proposals were received. Later on GoR has received grant from EU-SPP.

                                              94
   Under EU-SPP a number of studies under water sector have been taken up—i.e., (i)
   Water Auditing & Bench Marking of the irrigation project; (ii) preparation of IWRM
   plan of villages; (iii) study on planning of water resources of Rajasthan which includes
   preparation of long term plan and policy for development and management of the water
   resources of, both surface (internal & external) and ground water on comprehensive and
   integrated basis etc.
(iii)Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization: It is
     mentioned in the draft ICRR that “monitoring of physical and financial progress was
     limited to tracking the physical and financial progress and there is no evidence of this
     being used by project management to improve the efficiency of project investment”. This
     statement is factually incorrect. The M&E reports were capturing the project performance
     indicators as well besides the physical and financial progress and were all M&E reports
     received were used both at the PMU as well as at the government level for the purpose of
     review and taking corrective measures on a regular basis for improving the project
     implementation progress and project effectiveness. This fact was also explained to ICRR
     mission during their visit to Rajasthan.
(iv) Safeguard and Fiduciary compliance: Dam Safety Organization (DSO) headed by
     Superintending Engineer was established in the year 1991 with the objective to monitor
     the safety aspect of the dams in the State, and the DSO was renamed as “Dam Directorate”
     in 2008. To ensure safety of all large dams in the State concerned field Chief Engineers
     of WRD are responsible for inspection of dams and to submit inspection reports at pre
     monsoon and also post monsoon time. Dam directorate in terms prepares Health Status
     Report of all large dams every year and same is sent to independent body CWC, GoI
     New Delhi. Comments regarding deficiencies in Health Status Report and in the report
     of CWC are implemented by GoR. Therefore robust institutional arrangement exists in
     WRD GoR for ensuring safety of existing dams. The WRD has also prepared the
     “Guidelines for Operation and maintenance of Irrigation Structure” in year 2010. For the
     dam safety works under the project, an independent Dam Safety Review Panel (DSRP)
     was established to provide technical review of each safety proposal, as per the legal
     agreement and all the dam safety works under dam safety sub-component under the
     project were carried out only on approval of the DSRP.
(v) Non-Irrigation Water Uses: The project subcomponent relating to the “Establishment and
    operationalization of the SWRPD” was designed to create an institutional arrangement
    for planning of water for various uses, including non-irrigation uses of water, and the
    SWRPD is discharging this responsibility, including preparation of river basin plan for
    use of water for various uses. For example, no new construction of water project for any
    uses can be taken up in the State without approval of SWRPD. Therefore, the statement
    in the draft ICRR to the effect that little attention, if any, was paid to non-irrigation water
    is factually incorrect, and need to be corrected.
