The only\n            change is adding to the items to be financed out of the\n            proceeds of the credit under the category three of\n            disbursement the 'operating costs for the supervision\n            of sub-projects'. 'Operating costs' means the\n            incremental expenses incurred on account of sub-projects\n            implementation, including office equipment and supplies,\n            vehicle operation and maintenance, communication and\n            insurance costs, office administration costs, utilities,\n            travel, per diem and supervision costs of locally contracted\n            employees. In addition to the new definition, it is\n            important to highlight that the Amendment is retroactive as\n            of the effectiveness date of the credit agreement, and that\n            the disbursement table is amended to include operating costs\n            under category (three). This change responds to government\n            request to cover part of the operating costs associated with\n            the supervision of the sub-projects given the fiscal\n            constraints consequence of the economic crisis that reduced\n            the budgetary revenues."}, "docdt": "2010-07-27T00:00:00Z"}
