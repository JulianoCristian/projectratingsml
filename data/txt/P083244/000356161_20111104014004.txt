Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is that indigenous and Afro-Honduran groups have
increased participation in the holistic development processes of their communities and
their nation. This will be achieved by strengthening the communities' local capacity to
build sustainable organizations, development projects, and cultural identity.

the second pillar, the GOH's aim was to decentralize and strengthen local development by
creating an instniment - the De~ntralj,Z!ltio~,and Local DevelopmentPrograrn - to implement
this strategy. As part of this stfategy, the Gem strengthened its efforts to address the persistent
problems faced by indigenous groups by: ,(i) 'reactivating ·the National Cultural Council; (ii)
creating the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Ethnic Cultural Heritage; and (iii) promoting a
variety of complementary programs andproject$.

Rationale 'for Bank's assiStance; Duting'tpe World'Bank's Country Assistance Stratt::gy (CAS)
consultations in 2003, the: GORteiteratealts:commitment to improving the, living conditions ,of
the country's most vulnerabfegroups, pamcl.darly ethnic communities, and asked the Batik to
continue its support through the NR program implemented by the FHIS. The Bank had provided
overarchingsupport to the FinS since"the early nineties to implement several programs under its
responsibility, including smaJl~sca1esocial and eeonomic, infrastructure· sub-projects and lOO,al
institutional strengthening. The NR' sub-program under the Fourth. SoCial Investment Fund
Project, financed a modestpilot-of,smaU-scale sUb:.;projects benefiting poor families in Honduras'
indigenous cOJilmunities. The preparation of the Bank;;.financed self-standing NR investment was
carried out concurrently with the implementation ofthe FifthSocialInvestmeni Fund Project, an
SDR47;1 milHon{tJS$63.6 miUion 'e~uivalent)operation, approved in December 2000 and closed
on March 31, 2'()06.· The;Bank'S'iong-term n(Jationsbipwith FHIS and the indigenous and afro-
Honduran federations and people exceeded that of other international agencies, and was seen by
the GOH as key to ensuring the effective participation of the federations in decision-making
within a context of transparency and social auditing.,

As 'stated "in, the PAD, the PD01Was; '.!that indigenous and Afro-Honduran groups have increased
participation in the holistic development processes of their communities and their,nation. This
will be achieved by strengthening the communities' local capacity to build sustainable
organizations, development projects; and, cultural, identity}' Progress.towards achieving the
PDOs was to be measured against thefon0wing"put~meindicator~:

(1) At least 400 indigenous lUld afro..Ho~duran Comrn~t1ityDevelopmentPlans (COPs) were to
   . be incorporated into Strategic;Municipal Development Plans (SMDPs);
                                  to
(2). At leaSt five institutions, were finance p~ of the ,nine Strategic Ethnic Development Plans
     (SEDPs);                                 ", '
(3) At least 50 municipalities were to finance sub-projects included In the CDPs prepared by
     indigenous 'and,afto•.uonduran com~unities;,
(4)At least'40'percent ofbeneficiaries were to be women; , ,,'                ,
(5) At least 70 percennof"Sub"projectslW'ere;to hav~ 'sustainable ~aintenance systems in operation;
(6) At least 70 percent oj th~ sub-projects were to be implemented in accordance with the
     established parameters of time, quality, ~d~l1d~t;and, .
(7) Each of, the nine indi~enousand 'afro~Hondufan ,groups were'to have developed and
     implemented at least twocross..outting sub;;'prc;Uec~that',wouldserve to strengthen th,e
     indigenous people as a whole (culturally, linguistically, and historically). Examples of this
     type of proJect might be a community center that would serve several communities.

The project aimed to benefit about 450,000 people (180,000 of them women) from 2,000
indigenous and afro-Honduran communities located in 15 of the 18 Departments of Honduras.

1.5 Original Components

The project design included the following components:

Component A - Participatory Development Planning (2.94 percent of total financing). This
component supported a process of participatory development planning among the indigenous and
afro-Honduran groups by financing the: (a) provision of training to the indigenous groups and
federations to actively participate in the local CDP; (b) .provision of technical assistance to
identify sub-projects; (c) processes/activities to encourage federations to work more closely with
municipalities; (d) training of facilitators to assist participating communities in carrying out a
needs assessment reSUlting in a CDP and a list of priority sub-projects; and (ii) preparation of
these CDPs and sub-projects. Sub-projects were to be further prioritized in regional micro-
planning meetings, and subsequently, at the level of each indigenous group, using a fixed set of
selection criteria (including, inter-alia, poverty, land tenure, and significance). Each of the nine
federations was then to prepare a strategic development plan outlining the vision, mission, and
goals for its membership over a three- to five-year period. The development of these plans was to
be led by federations, based on an agreed participatory methodology, using existing plans, when
available, as a starting point. Aspects of these strategic development plans were expected to feed
into municipal and national development plans.

Component B - Grants for sub-projects (82.63 percent total financing). This component
supported the financing of community-executed suf>.:projects (during appraisal it was estimated
that 600-700 would be funded). Each subproject was to average around US$20,000, with no
minimum or maximum floor for financing.

Resources were to be allocated proportionately among the nine indigenous groups, based upon
2001 Census data, while guaranteeing a minimum allocation for the five smallest groups. Sub-
projects were to be executed by the communities, using the community-driven development
(CnD) methodology applied in previous NR operations and articulated in the project's
Operational Manual (OM). Project funds were to be transferred directly to a community-based
Project Implementation Committee (PIC) with an elected leadership.

Component C - Capacity building and institutional strengthening (14.43 percent total
financing). This component supported: 0) capacity building of indigenous groups to lead their
development process; (ii) institutional strengthening of the project unit (NRU) located within the
FHlS; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation.

Activities to be financed under this component included training and technical assistance to
communities in: (a) participatory development planning; and (b) project identification, execution,
operation, and maintenance. The NRU was vested with the responsibility for managing the
project in close coordination with federations, PICs, community facilitators, and FHlS
supervisors. This component also included operational costs (FHlSINRU staff, recurrent costs


                                                3
 for offices,mobilization and equipment) amounting to about US$1.1 million, more than half
 financed by the GOH.

 1.6 Revised Components. The original components were not modified.

 1;7 Other Changes

  Reallocations between expenditure categories. On April 15, 2009 the Bank authorized a
  reallocation of Credit· proceeds as requested by the GOH. The amount allocated for grants I[Illd
  consultant services was increased (the former by about 5.5 percent and the latter by more than
  three times) and training and goods were decreased by 20 percent and about 30 percent,
. respectively. The reallocation responded to an increase in the demand for sub-projects and the
  need to strengthen on-site monitoring. In July 2010, the Bank authorized about US$lmillion of
  the Gredit as retroactive financing covering operating costs incurred by the FIllSINRU since
  effectiveness, which was originally allocated to the GOH'scounterpart funding .. This second
  reallocation responded to a drastic reduction in government budgetary revenues in 2009 and 2010
  due to the tight fiscal situation resulting from the international financial crisis.

 Extension of closing date; The Credit's original closing date of May 31, 2008 was extended three
 times at the request of the GOH. The first extension -for a period of 18 months to November 30,
 2009-was granted on the basis of the need for more time for the implementation of sub-project
 activities given the delay in Credit effectiveness. The extension was granted based on compliance
 with an Action Plan agreed between the FillS and the Bank. The second extension, requested for
 a period of three months, (to February 2010) was to take into account the disruption caused by the
 sudden removal of the Zelaya government in June 2009, (while the Bank assessed the political
 situation, it paused implementation of its portfolio, which lasted six months) and would allow the
 newly elected government adequate time to close project activities. A third extension to July 31,
 2010 was approved by the Bank in February 2010 to allow the new administration to complete
 the horizontal projects and the pesticide· training, the need for which was identified late in
 impiementation.

 2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

 2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

 There was an ex-post evaluation carried out by the GOH as well as an OED review of the
previous PNR program, which were both quite positive.. The ex-postevaluation indicated that the
PNR had been very successful in meetings its objectives and in targeting its resources to
extremely poor communities and households. The evaluation wso laid out the flows of the
original PNR, in particular with respect to lack of controls and accountability at the community
level in the admi:ilistration of cash transfers. This was a key finding that influenced the design of
the new operation. The OED review had concluded that the NR Program had provided substantial
benefits to the indigenous peoples of Honduras, that government ownership was high, and that
subproject sustainability was likely. From both the ex-post evaluation and the OED review, the
Project drew lessons and it incorporated them into its design. These included the need to: (i)
finance both materials and. technical assistance (t.a), to ensure subproject sustainability; (ii)
intensify capacity building at the community level; (iii) bridge the divide between federations and
municipalities by ensuring that planning in communities is compatible with municipal plans, and
that Indigenous Development Plans were shared with local government; and (iv) promote


                                                 4
 indigenous unity by discouraging splintering of federations - hence the decision to have the
 Lenca represented by one federation instead of the four it had recently broken into.

 The Project preparation team designed the PNR as a foUow-on project to the then on-going
 Nuestras Raices program. This made sense given that the Bank team was under a tight
 preparation timeframe, and was buoyed by the findings of both the ex-post evaluation and the
 2002 OED evaluation of the PNR cited above. In addition, the project-specific financial capacity
 assessment conducted during the preparation phase found that FHIS had established a strong
 administrative unit with many years of experience implementing and managing Bank and other
 intemationalagencies-fmanced infrastructure-type projects.

Project design was informed by a social assessment, summarized in the PAD. While the
assessment adequately described the structure of the indigenous federations and the relationship
with indigenous communities, it did not sufficiently address the political economy issues reiated
to the power struggle between federations, communities, and municipalities. Specifically, the
Project design deviated significantly from previous operations in that money would now flow
directly to communities instead offederations - although federations would still have a role in
deciding which communities received projects (based on the review process described in Section
1.5). .The S.A. did not fully assess the desire of federations to keep control of finances nor the
position they would find themselves in when faced with deciding which communities received
funds. The result was that, besides often pushing the Bank to channel money to them during the
project's implementation period, federations also awarded as many projects as possible to
communities to keep their constituents satisfied,' This led to a proliferation of very small projects,
leading to other implementation problems described in Section 5.1 of this report.

1.1 Implementation

In April 2007, the Bank te~ carried out a mid-term review (MTR) concluding that the NR
ratings were unsatisfactory in almost all areas. However, field visits confirmed that resources
were reaching the poorest and often most remote indigenous popUlations and that, by and large,
there was great community involvement and ownership in project design, implementation, and
social audits; and substantial in-kind contributions from community members. It was decided to
continue the project based largely on this finding, and therefore a doo,.iled action plan was agreed
between FHIS and the Bank dealing with specific issues involving implementation, staffing,
fiduciary, safeguards, and monitoring and evaluation. Within two months of the MTR, FHIS had
complied with all but one action (the· contracting of a qualified firm to undertake the impact
evaluation study). Consequently, the project improved its implementation progress as attested by:
(a) an increase in disbursements from 10 to 82.3 percent of the total Credit; (b) the completion of
aU indigenous groups' participatory planning processes; (c) the submission of about 1,645 sub-
projects to FHIS for approval, of which 1,266 had already started implementation; and (d) the
satisfactory resolution of most ofNRU staffing issues                                   .

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

The results framework included seven outcome and 13 output indicators. Most of these were
process-oriented, indicating the ability of communities to prepare and implement projects, but did
not provide a good metric for the strengthening of communities' capacity to build sustainable
organizations and reinforce their cultural identities. Two indicators were never monitored: (i) the
outcome indicator - "at least 400 indigenous and afro-Honduran Community Development Plans
(COPs) were to be incorporated into the SMDPs"; and (ii) the quality dimension included in the
outcome indicator - "at least 70 percent of sub-projects were to be· implemented in accordance

                                                 5
with the established parameters of time, quality, and budgef' -be:cause an appropriate metric.was
notdefmed.      .                                                .

Had the impact evaluation been contracted at the outset of implementation, it might have been
possible to adjust indictors to better measure progress in these areas - for example, the IE may
have eliminated the indicator on the number of CDPs incorporated into SMDPs, once it became
clear that the FillS could not undertake the necessary work with the municipalities to ensure this
happened. In fact, the original Terms of Reference.for the IE included suggestions for alternative
indicators to better capture progres~ toward the overall and speCific POOs. However, FillS's first
attempt at contracting the impact evaluation ended in the Bank's canceling the action due to
deviation from Bank procedures, and it was only contracted and carried out in 2009. Retrofitting
the PDOs (requiring Board approval) was discussed by the Bank management after the MTR, but
it was decided not to pursue it because disbursements already had exceeded 82 percent, the .
project had consistently been rated as unsatisfactory, and the Credit was expected to close in
about one more year (at the initial closing date of May 2008). Further complicating the M&E
issue was the unreliability of the· FillS's .database, which was due to the lack of a monitoring
system that could draw from multjple data sources, including a management information system
and surveys. This made tracking project indicators difficult for the Bank supervision teams. The
aforementioned impact evaluation cowd not rely on baseline data, and therefore, could not gauge
the change in results.

2.4 Safeguard and. Fiduciary Compliance

Fiduciary. The financial management (FM) assessment carried out during preparation found that
indigenous communities had limited financial management capacity to handle Credit proceeds,
and led to recommendations that communities be provided with intensive training to build their
capacity to manage finances. The Procurement assessment found that FillS, through its previous
experience in managing other Bank-fmanced projects, met the Bank's minimum procurement
capacity requirements. FillS was staffed with a procurement department supportedbya
procurement assistant; a draft procurement plan had been reviewed by the Bank teani. The
procurement assessment also found that the project communities were not familiar with Bank's
procurement procedures, in particular the Bank's "Community Participation" modality and
recommended that training be provided to these communities.

During implementation, the FillS - and in tum the programs it administered, including the PNR -
- was··affected by recurrent staff rotation following changes in the national administration. This
meant the replacement of managerial, technical and administrative staff, with appointments often
made on th.e basis of political allegiance; rather than technical competence. This \ led to
weaknesses in FM and procurement, and the Bank addressed them through an institUtional.
approach involving high level authorities, and coordination with IDB and other donors in
establishing a common approach to address FillS operational weaknesses. Sevetal actions were
taken to improve these capacity deficits, including, among others, the: (a) institutional assessment
of Procurement and Financial Management aspects; (b) technical assistance; (c) preparation of an
improvement plan; (d) a workshop to discuss and analyze the institutional assessment and
improvement plan and ongoing institutional improvement actions; (e) portfolio coordination
meetings among FillS project teams; (f) joint Bank supervision missions of all Bank projects
managed by FillS; (g) coordination meetings with IDB to monitor the agreed common approach
to FillS issues; and (h) repeated operational training dedicated only to FillS staff on fiduciary
requirements and practices. Because the Bank was addressing financial management and
procurement issues with the FillS from a broader, institutional platform rather than a project-


                                                 6
specific one, and 1:Jecause this was considered a long-term process, the Batik supervision team did
not suspend disbursements.

Environmental safeguards. The project was given a B environmental rating during ,the
preparation phase because at that time it was thought that mostly small-scale infrastructure sub-
projects in sensitive areas were to be fmancedby the Credit, thus requiring an environmental
assessment, which was carried out by the Government during preparation. However, the
Pesticides safeguard was not triggered during preparation, although productive (e.g., agricultural)
subprojects were eligible' for financing, and these ~s of projects typically do trigger the
Pesticides safeguard. ' This was an oversight on the part of the Bank preparation team that had
consequences during implementation., 'In March 2009 the Bank supervision team discovered that
the purchase and use of pesticides was part of some subprojects. Upon fmding this, the
Government and the Bank hired two local consultants to review all productive sub-projects and
assess the magnitude of the pest management issue (April- July 2009). Following this review,
training of 335 indigenous producers in five departments was completed (January - July 2010).
This training involved instruction on the safe and proper handling and use of pesticides, as well as
alternatives to the use of these products, and the final review of the mitigation by Bank safeguard
specialists was highly positive. The Bank's promotion of this training serves as an example of
how to add value in a safeguards-related area without actually triggering the applicable policy.
Although the project's closing date was extended; the team'decided to take SAT's advice and did
not trigger OP 4.09 on Pest Management, as this would have required a firSt-order restructuring
and by then it, was too close to the end of the project's lifecycle to proceed in this manner.
Agrochemical use did not originate with PNR, but it is disappointing that the EMP for the project
was not SUfficiently nimble to accolint for,'the use of ,chemical pesticides at the time that
productive sub-projects became eligible for support. Though this problem was detected relatively
late, from that point forward the team was able to put a quick and effective remediation plan into
place and to marshal the resources needed for its implementation.

Supervision teams also found that although the project provided some training to communities in
preparing environmental datasheets for sub-projects: (i) the safeguard logs were generally of poor
quality; (ii) the training provided was insufficient; (iii) there was a lack of supervision and
environmentally-related technical assistance to the communities; and (iv) there was often a lack
of qualified expertise at the FlllSINRU to supervise the implementation of these safeguards.

Indigenous people. The project itself was considered to be an IPDP, which was consistent with
the Bank's Operational Directive 4.20 (or the revised 4.10) - see discussion in Section 2.1 above.
The project files attest to the indigenous people's compliance throughout the entire
implementation cycle and for the last two and a half years the Bank's team included, a specialist
in indigenous issues in supervision missions.

2.5 Post-completion 'Operation/Next Phase

The IeR team was· informed that given the unsatisfactory rating 'of the NR project, Bank
management has decided notto fmance a follow up operation.             '

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

At preparation. The project PDQs were consistent with the following pillars of the 2002
Honduras Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY2003-2006: (i) strengthening social
protection for specific vulnerable groups; (ii) reducing rural poverty; and (iii) enhancing
investment in human capital. The PDOs continue to be relevant at Credit closing, consistent
with the human capital development pillar of the FY07-10 CAS, specifying the cO.ntinued
strengthening of the capacity of afro-Honduran and indigenous peoples to manage their own
development as one of its sub-strategies. Accordingly, the ICR is of the view that the project's
PDOs continue to be highly relevant.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Assessment of PDO achievements. The stated PDO overall was "to increase the participation of
the Borrower's indigenous and afro-Honduran peoples in the holistic development process of
their communities and their nation." The PDO was to be achieved by "strengthening the
communities' local capacity to build sustainable organizations, development projects, and cultural
identity" (specific PDO).

Achievement ofoutcome indicators.
The ICR has evidence that 1,666 sub-projects were approved and integrated into strategic plans
for each indigenous group, and 1,517 completed by Credit closing. However, while this
accomplishment indicates that the overall objective of increasing participation of indigenous
peoples in the development of their communities was achieved, it does not by itself indicate
achievement of the specific project development objective - that is, the strengthening of
communities' local capacity to build sustainable organizations, development project~, and cultural
identity. In fact, unfortunately the M&E design did not include an appropriate metric to measure
these PDOs nor a baseline to llleasure the envisaged changes.

As a proxy to assess achievement of the specific PDO, the ICR had to rely on findings from the
qualitative evaluation which shows: (a) positive, but marginal impact of infrastructure sub-
projects on the quality of life in communities, particularly those focused on housing
rehabilitation; (b) female involvement benefiting from productive sub-projects but failing short of
the agreed targets; (c) marginal impact on communities' capacity to organize themselves; (d) an
increase in the participatory decision making process in some communities; (e) no visible
increase in productivity in the agricultural sub-projects (farming of corn, coffee, beans, sugarcane,
bananas); (f) other sub-projects involving animal husbandry along with daily-related sub-projects
generated some marginal improvement in the income of the participants; and (g) communities
feeling that they are better prepared to address poverty challenges.

The NR project attained or surpassed the following outcome indicators:

(a) Outcome indicator 2: Five institutions (Secretarfa de Agricultura y Ganaderfa [SAG).
Secretarfa de Educacion Publica [SEP}, Secretarfa de Sa/uti Publica [SSP}, Instituto Nacional
Agrario [INA}, and Instituto Nacional de Formacion Profesional [INFOP}J and three other
projects (programa de Bosques y ProtecciOn Rural [PBPR), Proyecto de Desarrollo

                                                 8
 Microempresarial para Personas Pobres e Indigenas [PRODEMIN]. and Programa de,
 Desarrollo Integral de Pueblos Aut6ctonos [DIPAJ) financed part of the nine Strategic Ethnic
 Development Plans, thus attaining. the target set at apprais~l.

 (b) Outcome 'indicator 5: Completed infrastructure sub-projects representing 13.5 percent of the
 total are by and large sustainable; and about 70. percent of the completed productive sub-projects
 have sustainable maintenance systems in operation, reaching the target set at appraisal.

 The NR. project feU short in achieving the targets for the following outcome indicators:

 (a) Outcome indicator 3: Only 20. out of the expected target of 50. municipalities financed sub-
 projects included in the Community Development Plans prepared by the indigenous and afro-
 Honduran communities; faIling short. by 60. percent the target set at appraisal;

(b) Outcome indicator 4: 27 percent of project beneficiaries and 36 percent of facilitators were
women, falling short by 32 percent the target of at least 40. percent; and

(c) Outcome indicator 6: About 90. percent, of sub-projects were implemented according toa
revised chronogram and budget reaching the target of 90. percent. However, there is no
information regarding the quality of these projects, thus the target was partially achieved.

The following outcome indicators were not achieved:

(a) Outcome indicator 1: At least 40.0. indigenous and afro-Honduran Community Development
Plans were to be incorporated into Strategic Municipal Development Plans; and

(b) Outcome indicator 7: Each of the nine federations will have developed and implemented at
least two crosscutting sub-projects that serve to strengthen the indigenous people as a whole.
Eight crosscutting sub-projects were approved by NR but only seven were completed by Credit
closing.

Weighing the above, in particular the lack of an adequate metric to assess achievement of the
specific PDO, the ICR rates the achievement of the NR project to its stated objectives as
moderately unsatisfactory, consistent with the rating provided by the last supervision mission.

Output (or intermediate outcome) indicators. The NR project achieved or surpassed the
following output indicators:

(a) 1,665 indigenous community participatory diagnoses were finalized' and incorporated into the
nine Indigenous Development Plans, surpassing by 11 percent the target of 1,50.0. (output
indicator 1);                                                                            ,

'(b) Nine Strategic Development Plans were developed and completed' by Credit closing (Olitput
 indicator 2).

(c) 1,517 approved sub-projects were implemented and completed, more than twice the expected
target of 50.0. (output indicator 3);

(d) 90. percent ofthe participating communities reported that the sub-project fmanced by the NR '
was their priority, 12.5 percent above the target of 86 percent (output indicator 4);


                                                9
(e) 90 pen:(entof the sub-projects are benefiting communities in the. bottom fifth. of the poverty.
ranking scale, 28.6 percent above the 70 p~rcent target (output indicator S);

(f) At least 95 percent of the s~b-projects showed no accounting problems, 18.7 percent above the
target of 80 percent (output indicator 6);

(g) About 77 percent of external supervisol1' contracted by the FInS received an evaluation rating
of 50 percent or more by men and women, surpassing by 54 percent the target of 50 percent
(output indicator 9). About 92 percent of the facilitators contracted by the communities received
an evaluation rating of 80 percent or more by men and women, surpassing by 37 percent the
target of 50 percent (output indicator 10).

(h) The NR project cycle was incorporated in the FInS' overall management information system
(output indicator 11); and

(i) At least 62 percent of community members participated in one training module (and 23
percent completed 4 training modules, surpassing the 20 percent target - output indicator 13).
However, as described elsewhere in the ICR, the training provided was ofteQ. untimely and
insufficient.                         .

In the view of the IeR, the achievement of output indicator number 5 is an extremely
important accomplishment of the NR project. It demonstrates that, despite all the
implementation issues described in this report, the subprojects reached the poorest segments of
the Honduran population.

The NR project partially achieved the targets set at appraisal for the following output indicators:

(a) At least 35 percent of the approved sub-projects were implemented by women, surpassing by
40 percent the target of 25 percent; about 17 percent of paid labor went to women, falling short
by about 66 percent the target of 50 percent; and about 27 percent women were included in
Project Implementation Committees, falling short by 32 percent the target of 40 percent (output
indicator 7);

(b) At least 61 percent of beneficiaries were trained in community development planning, 22
percent above the target of 50 .percent; and 23 percent of trained beneficiaries were women,
falling short by 42 percent with respect to the target of 40 percent (output indicator 8). However,
there was no assessment made by FInS concerning the quality and effectiveness of the training
provided, nor a validation of the training modules ~nd materials; and

(c). About 31 percent of the participants in community assemblies approving the sub-projects
were women, falling short by about 22 percent with respect to the target of 40 percent (output
indicator 12).

3.3 Efficiency

For reasons explained in Annex 3, it was not possible to estimate a cost-benefit or cost'"
effectiveness of the NR project. Instead, the ICR utilized the findings of the evaluation
commissioned by the FInS and carried out in a random sample of 200 communities during the
second half of 2009 (Annex 9, Endeavour 2009). The methodological characteristics of this study
are explained in Annex 3.


                                                10
Given the difficulties in· designing an appropriate metric to observe and measure changes in the
specific PDOs, as explained earlier, the study utilized as a proxy the following observable
indicators: (i) long and short-tenu employment generated by the NR; Oi) changes in productivity;
(iii) commercialization of the approved productive sub-project outputs; (iv) access to credit; (v)
gender among NR beneiiciaries; (vi) degree of organizational strengthening; and (vii) degree of
participation of members of the community in the NR-related decision making processes. When
possible, these indicators were observed among both the sample of NR communities and the
control group. The findings are summarized in Annex 3 and complement the evidence already
articulated in the Data Sheet and in section 3.2.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Given that no appropriate metric was incorporated in the results framework to measure
achievement of the specific PDO and that the attainment of the agreed outcome and output
indicators is a mixed story, the ICR rates the overall outcome of this Project as moderately
unsatisfactory.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

An assessment of whether adequate arrangements were in place to help avoid or mitigate risks to
development outcomes, carried out during the ICR field mission confinued that:

a) FHIS (including the NRU) has no national budget allocation after October 31, 2010, when the
three-month closing grace period granted by the Bank came to an end;
(b) Most of the FHISINRU-re1ated staff's contracts expire on July 31, 2010 and were not
extended. Only a skeleton staff remained at NRU (financed by GOH) to bring the NR accounting
to an orderly end by October 31, 2010;
(c) The FHIS seems unwiHingto pursue any dialogue with the GOH to ensure continuation of the
NR',
(d) Most of infrastructure projects completed under the NR had a limited impact on securing the
continuation of a holistic community process among beneficiaries; and
(e) Some of the completed productive sub-projects will not be sustainable after July 31,2010.

The ICR field mission was made aware that the IDB is currently financing an operation -
Desarrollo Integral de los Pueblos Indigenas (DIPA) - supporting some, but not all of the areas
previously financed by the NR project. The ICR does not know what will happen to the activities
financed by DIPA once, the financing of the lOB comes to an end. For aU of the above reasons,
this ICR rates as high the risk that development outcomes will not be maintained.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry. Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

Preparation took nine months from identification to appraisal and included heavy beneficiary
involvement, including six training workshops facilitated by the Bank team with representatives
of the nine indigenous federations. The preparation team consisted of highly qualified and
experienced specialists who were familiar with the preparation and implementation of the
previous Social Investment Funds operations. One task team leader (TTL) was responsible for


                                               11
the entire project. preparation cycle and also for the supervision of the then-ongoing Fifth Social
Investment Fund Project, thus providing welcomed continuity during preparation.

The Bank team demonstrated a, rich understanding of the Honduran social and economic context
in indigenous and afro.;.Honduran communities and reflected this knowledge in the project design.
Social and institutional assessments were also carried out, and the Bank team incorporated in the
design key recommendations provide,d by the impact evaluation study carned out for the Fourth
Social Investment Fund. The most significant finding of this study was related to the poor
management of the "cajas rurales." Accordingly, the GOH and the Bank team agreed not to
provide additional support to this scheme under the new NR operation. The Bank team also
factored in lessons learned from other operations in the region, such as the Nicaragua Social
Investment Fund, the Guatemala Local Development Project, the IDB-financed Peru Fondo
Nacionai de Compensacion y Desarrollo Social (FONCODES) III, and several related projects in
northeast Brazil. In addition, the preparation team incorporated key elements of GOH's
indigenous strategy into project design. The Bank team maintained close coordination during
the preparation cycle with the IDB, which was financing complementary operations to the NR
project (Programa de Apoyopara Pueblos Indigenas y Negros - PAPlN), and was in the process
of preparing the Programa de Reduccion de la Pobreza Enfocada a Pueblos Indigenas y Negros
(REPEPIN).

 Despite these positives, there was a key oversight in the social and institutional assessments and
 in the project design that led to several implementation problems. Specifically, the social
assessment failed to properly assess the political economy risks posed by the flow of funds
directly to communities instead of federations - a deviation from past practices. This removed
resource management .from the federations, but· the project design awarded these same
organizations the decision-making power to award SUbprojects to communities. Furthermore, the
project design did not include a minimum amount for the subprojects. These two design
characteristiCs paved the way for federations to award as many subprojects as possible, with the
aim of pleasing as many of their respective constituents as possible. Once this ha,ppened,
implementation problems snowballed. The explosion in the number of subprojects meant that the
FHIS and the PNR could not carry out the various tasks·assigned to them under the project - i.e.,
providing technical assistance to communities in the preparation of subprojects, particularly the
productive subprojects; and working with municipalities and federations to bridge the growing
gap between them that had been identified during project preparation. .This led to delays in
subproject implementation and therefore a delay in disbursements, which then led to a push for
more productive subprojects by. the Bank team was told, the highest level of government officials,
in the belief that they would disburse faster. This led to a further stretching of the FHISINRU
capacity to provide technical assistance, given their previously mentioned limited experience with
this type of project. The work to bridge the, gap between'local government and federations was
never carried out, because FHIS was overwhelmed just trying to provide sufficient technical
assistance to indigenous comtriunities.

The institutional assessment failed to anticipate the high growth in the nu,mber of subprojects that
took place because the project design did not designate a floor for subproject fmancing, and the
implications for the FHISINRU capacity to carry out its responsibilities. This may be explained
in part because the self-standing NR project was conceived as a repeater operation built on the
strengths and lessons learned from the previous five Social Investment Fund Projects, but one that
would expand coverage and therefore have greater development impact.                   While it is
understandable why this project was seen as a repeater project (as explained in Section 1), in
reality, the proposed NR project changed from a short-term cash-for-Iabor NR component (in
construction and maintenance of rural access roads, pathways, canals, and rural airstrips) included.

                                                12
 in the past Social Investment Fund Projects, to a community-driven development program (for
 mainly productive and social infrastructure projects) following the community execution
 methodology developed by FillS for both indigenous and non-indigenous communities. As such,
 it was more than simply a repeater project, and this had implications for preparation and
 implementation that were not fully realized.

 The Bank team could not carry out an economic analysis of the proposed project given that the
 specific social rate of return could not be estimated ex-ante because of the demand-driven nature
 of the NR sub-projects. To address this gap, the Bank team rightly insisted on the inclusion of an
 impact evaluation study from the outset to assess the cost-effectiveness of the NR as compared to
 a control group of communities. The fiscal implications during and after implementation of the
 project were expected to be manageable and included: (i) covering the administrative costs of the
 FillS, particularly the NRU; and (ii) the partial financing of community developed and
 implemented sub-projects. In general, no additional recurrent costs were expected from this NR
 project.

  A draft OM including the first-year operational and procurement plan was not available at the
  time of project appraisal. The OM was approved by FillS and given a no-objection by the Bank
  six months after effectiveness. In addition to the lack of an approved OM, the subsidiary
. agreement between the Finance Ministry (the Borrower's representative) and the FillS (the
  implementing agency) was not ready at the time of Board approval.

 Rating criteria. Considering the shortfalls of the Bank team at preparation, in particular the
 oversights in the institutional capacity and social assessments, and the lack of an OM by the time
 of project launch, the ICR rates the Bank team performance at preparation as moderately
 unsatisfactory.

 (b) Qual~ty of Supervision. Rating: Satisfactory.

Implementation fell under the responsibility of three TTLs. The first one, in charge of the entire
preparation cycle, was also responsible for the supervisions undertaken by the Bank from Board
approval (May 2004) and Loan effectiveness (January 2005) until the end of August 2006, at
which point a second 1TL took over. The tenure of the second TTL continued until the end of
December 2009, with a third TTL managing the project for the final seven months of
implementation and the closing of the Credit on July 31, 2010. The transitions in supervision
leaderships were smooth and wen planned.

After Board approval, thirty field supervision missions were undertaken, including the Mid-term
Review and the ICR field mission (July 2010), in addition to missions focused solely on financial
management and procurement. Throughout implementation, the team included local operational
staff in the Honduras office who engaged withNR staff on a weekly basis, and a financial
management specialist. The above implies that in the 67 months elapsing from effectiveness to
the closing of the Credit, the Bank carried out on average one supervision mission every two
months, thus maintaining close oversight of project implementation. The project file contains two
Project Supervision Reports (PSRs) and 17 Implementation and Supervision Results Reports
(ISRs) for a total of 19 reporting instruments, indicating that these were updated in the system
about once every three and half months. Almost every Bank supervision mission included a
procurement and financial management specialist to review the fiduciary compliance by the
Borrower. In addition, the Bank carried out several in-depth random post procurement reviews,
including field visits to some sub-projects, as well as financial management review missions
during the life of the project. For the most part, supervision missions included the appropriate
                                                13
skill-mix to carry out their envisaged terms of reference as attested in Annex 4 of the ICR,
including three pest management/environmental specialists (one from headquarters and two
locally recruited) once this issue was identified in March 2009.

Most of the Bank supervision missions were             in        attempting to address the several
preparation and implementation issues detailed elsewhere the             Accordingly, in the early
stages of the implementation cycle, the focus of supervision was on inputs (the preparation ofthe
sub-projects by the participating communities along the corresponding training), while mid-way
onwards the focus was to ensure, riot always successfully, that the processes (implementation of
the sub-projects, disbursing the Credit proceeds to beneficiaries, monitoring, on-site technical
support) were carried out in accordance with the OM. Lack of a baseline and impact evaluation at
the project's start and of periodic implementation evaluations prevented the Bank from
systematically gauging achievements towards the PDOs, Nevertheless, the visits to the sub-
projects provided the Bank team some sense of whether the sub-projects were achieving results.
Some of the action pians agreed with the FIDS to                          such as the revamping of
the financial management systems and the· inclusion of       municipalities in this scheme, were
only partially or never fully addressed and solved,               hu:luding      carrying out of an
impact evaluation study, came to fruition at        end             Visiting hard-to-reach project
communities by the Bank team meant at times                over 800 kilometers in one day, thus
limiting the coverage and scope of supervision in terms of overall number of sub-projects being
financed by the NR. Meetings with the federations were         and difficult at every mission, and
at times, confrontational.

The findings of each supervision mission were conveyed to Bank management clearly and in a
straightforward .          including the                                         shortcomings, and
pol:enltuti risks, Ratings were consistent with                        the supervision reports, .

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Pej~fOlrmiiUlc:e. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

According to current ICR rating guidelines, the overall Bank performance is rated moderately
satisfactory because the rating at the preparation stage was         unsatisfactory and at the
supervision stage satisfactory.




The counterpart preparation team was comprised mainly by :FIDS staff assigned to the
implementation of the NR· component under the then ongoing Fifth Social Investment Fund
Project, along with key GOH officials from the Ministries onnterior (responsible for REPEPIN),
Education, and Health, one representative of each participating federation, and other donors,
including the IDS. In addition to the Bank              missions, the FIDS conducted about six·
preparation workshops with various representatives                         that were to benefit
from this project.

Because the design ofthis operation was set up as a         to the thenmongoing Bank-financed
Fifth Social Investment Fund project, the Bank team interacted with a highly qualified and
seasoned technical counterpart team of professionals, who were also involved in the day-to-day

                                               14
implementation of the above-meQ,Uoned. operation. Accordingly, the technical counterpart staff
was largely familiar with Bank-related operations, in particular the fiduciary ones corresponding
to procurement and financial management albeit, with the latter, there were many issues that were
not yet fully addressed by the FIDS.

The FillS took into consideration some lessons learned from the implementation of previous
social investment funds, including inter-alia: (a) effective targeting of resources to benefit
extremely poor communities and households; (ii) the participation of the federations in promoting
the proposed project in the indigenous communities, while ensuring that transfers were made
directly to communities; (iii) the inclusion of the priorities identified by the communities; and (iv)
the promotion of gender equity.

However, supervision reports of the NR component under the Fifth Social Investment Fund
Project dating back to mid-2003 pointed to implementation weaknesses that the counterpart
preparation team did not appropriately address during the preparation of the NR project and were
again present during the implementation cycle. Key among these weaknesses were: (a) the
cascade training was ineffective, not going beyond the first layer of community people trained;
(b) municipalities were totally absent from NRactivities; (c) there were signs of corruption; (d)
the then ongoing Social Investment Fund project had not implemented any control mechanism to
ensure transparency and accountability; (e) the NR component under the investment fund project
did not address relevant community issues of land tenure, access to education and health, housing,
transportation, potable water and sanitation, electrification,etc, which were becoming more
acute; (f) the impact of the NR activities was not sustainable (once the 15 day-pay was stopped,
labor ceased to exist); (g) there were no observable changes in community behavior; and (h) and
the objective of strengthening cultural identity had notbeen achieved.

The entire preparation process took place under one elected administration, thus ensuring the
political support for the continuity ofthe social policies underpinning the proposed NR operation.
While this continuity was· also reflected at the level of the FIDS in charge of the preparation
activities with one Minister in command of the institution from 2002-2006, this was not the case
with the NRU, which experienced two project coordinators during the preparation phase (2002-
2003 and 2003-2005) with the corresponding overhauling of technical personnel.

Weighing the strengths and weaknesses shown by the Borrower during the preparation cycle, in
particular the neglect to follow upon key institutional capacity gaps previously identified as early
as July 2001 and then again confirmed in July 2003, which had significant adverse effects on the
implementation cycle, the ICR rates the Borrower performance during the preparation stage as
moderately unsatisfactory.

Rating at implementation: Moderately unsatisfactory

The project preparation and· implementation cycles transcended three elected governments. With
each change of government there were also changes in the management of the FIDS and the NRU,
resulting in an overhaul of technical personnel, which adversely affected the physical and
fmancial implementation progress of the NR project: FIDS had five Ministers during the
implementation cycle while NRU had five project coordinators. Because the FIDS and the NRU
were fully financed by counterpart funds, the Bank team was practically ignored with regards to
the appointments of key staff, many of whom were selected based on their political connections .
rather than skills. It was only towards the latter part of the implementation cycle that Bank
started requiring no-objections to fill in key vacancies in the NR.


                                                 15
  Before the de-facto government put in place after the departure of President Zelaya, there was
  continuity and support by the GOH with respect to the sector policies and priorities underpinning
  the project design. And the timely allocation of counterpart funds was the only dimension of
  governme~.t performance that was consistently rated as satisfactory by the various Bank
. supervision missions until the arrival of the de-facto government. During the de-facto government,
  the Bank supervision missions were temporarily suspended and the implementation of project
  activities, especially the fiduciary·· ones (procurement and disbursements), experienced a
  slowdown until the completion of the presidential election at the end of2009.

All audit reports were submitted to the Bank with a significant delay averaging from 4 to 6
months, thus preventing the GOH and the Bank team from adopting a proactive· and timely
attitude to address qualifications. Some audit report observations were not followed up by the
FHIS in a timely manner, while others were never addressed. In this latter case, the GOH through
its Ministry of Finance should have ensured a more effective response

up on audit observations, and the appointment of unqualified staff at the FHIS and NRU, the ICR
rates the Borrower performance at implementation as moderately unsatisfactory.
                                                         .                    .
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance. Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

The implementing agency was the FHIS through the NRU. As reported iii several ISRs, the
project suffered from personnel turnovers, bringing with each change not only new staff, some of
them unfamiliar with the project and the Bank's fiduciary procedures, but also different
management styles. Technical staff at theNRU was retained under· short-term monthly contracts
for most of the implementation cycle, which proved to be unproductive and contributed to the
high turnover of personnel.

The NRU was largely understaffed and lacked the appropriate organizational arrangements to
carry out the required day-to-day fiduciary management tasks and to provide effective and timely
on-site monitoring and technical support. It had no management decision-making freedom,
having to relay its fmdings and recommendations to an understaffed FHIS. In addition, FHIS had
very little prior experience in managing productive subprojects. Compounding these issues, the
centralized and overly complex management procedures at the FHIS were out of sync with the
highly decentralized nature of the NR. Moreover, there was not qualified staff in procurement
and financial management for a significant portion of its implementation history. By March 2009,
six months before the closing of the Credit (before being extended twice'to the new closing date
of July 31, 2010), the Bank supervision team reported the NRU as having 15 people none of
whom was a qualified procurement official, and that some procurement related documentation
was lost or missing.                   .

In addition, several Bank supervision reports attested to a lack of good communication between
the FlllSINRU and the communities, and also between the federations, adding to a confusion of
roles. Several Bank supervision reports indicated that the NRU was not appropriately following
up on agreements reached during previous supervision missions, in particular with the required
on~site monitoring, provision of technical support, fmancial management, and monitoring and
evaluation.

The fact that most of the. audit reports, as well as some financial management statements, were
qualified indicates that the FHISINRU did not exercise all the required care in ensuring
co~pliance with procurement and fmancial procedures as agreed in the Credit Agreement. This


                                                16
is also reflected and confirmed by the several U ratings provided by the Bank supervision
missions to project, procurement, and financial management. The last ISR rated procurement ~md
financial management as moderately unsatisfactory.

On a more positive and final note, based on the project files, the ICR recognizes the
incredible effort of the last two project coordinators and their teams, to continue moving
things forward under a difficult political environment, and with very limited authority and
resources. It is the shared view· of the ICR and the Bank team that if it were not for these
efforts, the likely outcome of this project would have been more limited.

Weighing the strengths and weaknesses mentioned above, in particular the lack of on-site
monitoring and provision of technical support and the lack of follow up on financial management
recommendations from audits; the ICR rates the overall implementing agency performance as
moderately unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance. Rating: Moderately
unsatisfactory.

According to current ICR rating guidelines, the overall Borrower performance is rated
moderately unsatisfactory because the ratings of the government performance at the preparation
and implementation stages were rated moderately unsatisfactory as were those of the
implementing agency.

6. Lessons Learned
  (a)     Social assessments are critical not only to identify appropriate cultoral practices
          but also to consider tbe political economy of project design at every pbase for
          every stakeholder in the process. While the project did carry out a thorough social
          assessment, which considered whether the Government was politically committed to
          the project's objectives and design, the analysis did not include an assessment of
          political economy issues related to federations. This limitation, as discussed in the
          ICR, proved to be a critical oversight on the part of the social assessment which posed
          serious challenges for implementation.
  (b)     Carrying out of an appropriate and tborough institutional capacity assessment
          during preparation is strongly recommended to improve implementation readiness,
          even for repeater projects. A fresh look at the institutional capacity, considering the
         changes in project design, is likely to contribute to more appropriate implementation
         arrangements, a realistic implementation schedule, as well as appropriate mitigation
         measures from the Borrower at the outset ofthe implementation cycle.
  (c)    Appropriate monitoring arrangements are needed from the outset of project
         implementation to improve management effectiveness. The monitoring system
         should rely on data from management information system and various types of
         evaluation. A timely I.E. could have identified early-on the need to adjust indicators
         to ensure that progress towards the PD~ could be measured. The inability of FHIS to
         contract a firm to carry out the impact evaluation and the Bank's lack of leverage to
         force the issue had significant implications for the overall success of the project. The
         design of an impact evaluation should have started during project preparation, to
         ensure its timely completion and to recognize its centrality to project success.
  (d)    Periodic implementation and process evaluations both during start-up and
         during implementation are recommended. During program start-up, process

                                             17
           evaluations can be. used to monitor implementation so that bottlenecks can be·
           addressed speedily and good practice can be incorporated into the design. After the
           program stabilizes, a process evaluation can be used· to provide on-going feedback to
           management. In the PN&;a process evaluation after operational issues were detected
           could have helped management assess the continued relevance of some of its activities
           and procedures articulated in the Operational Manual.
   (e)     A project's risk analysis should include an assessment of the impact of all risks
           materialiZing during implementation. The story of the Nuestras Raices Project
           implementation might be described as a "perfect storm," where all the risks identified
           during preparation materialized during implementation. Had it been the case that only
           one·or two of the risks materialized, the mitigation measures identified during project
           preparation might have been sufficient to address ii.             However, with the
           materialization of all risks, the FHISINRU quickly became overwhelmed to the point
           where it was nearly impossible to recover.
   (t)     In social fund type projects, it is critical to consider identifying a floor on
           subproject amounts or a limit on the number of subprojects that can be financed.
           A minimum eligible amount for subproject financing and/or a limit on the number of
           subprojects that could be financed would have avoided the explosion of subprojects
           that were approved, which in tum overtaxed the FHISINRU capacity to provide t.a.,
           supervision, and management of subproject impacts. Such a design characteristic
           should have been detected during the institutional assessment, when the FHISINRU
           capacity to carry out its preparationl~upervision role was completed.
   (g)     The Bank should consider adding a. staffing clause to future operations, whereby·
           it will have some control over staffmg decisions made for project implementation
          teams. Had one been included at the outset of project implementation, the Bank team
          might have been able to mitigate the numerous staffing changes that occurred during
          the project's life.
   (h)    When unforeseen environmental and social impacts occur during
          implementation, the Bank should, react flexibly and quickly to mitigate effects.
          When tbeBank supervision team first identified the use of pesticides in subprojects, it
          was discussed withmanagemerit whether to formally trigger the Pesticides safeguard,
          which would have required an amendment to the Credit agreement and possibly Board
          approval. The team and management decided instead to move right away to
          mitigation, given the overarching need to ensure that public safety was protected from
          the possible misuse and mishandling of pesticides, and considering that such an
          amendment would have been a lengthy process that could have delayed mitigation
          measures. The result was that all mitigation measures were completed quickly and
          prior to the Credit's closing, and the Bank's assessment of the quality of the mitigation
          measures (e.g., publication of safety materials and community training in alternatives
          to pest management) is excellent.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

This section describes the outputs of each ofthe three components included in the original project
design. The assessment is primarily based on the Aide-Memoires, PSRsIISRs, Audit
FMRs, the evaluation study, and the July 2010 field ICR mission.

Two cost tables are presented to substantiate the evidence provided in this Annex:
documented expenditures by component and by source of financing at appraisal and at
the writing of this feR (Table A2.1); and (b) the documented expenditure by category and by
source of financing at appraisal and at the time anhe writing of this (Table A2,2).

Component A - Participatory Development Planning by Ethnic
A2.1 below, this component estimated at appraisal to cost US$OA9
Bank Credit), ended up documenting expenditures amounting to US$O.S5
minion from the Bank Credit and US$0.05 million from GOH), 122,4 per.cent of the
estimated at appraisal.

This overspending is mainly attributed to the significant increase in     number. of facilitators
required in carrying out the training activities needed to prepare memb'ers of             1,665
communities and their federations in the local developing planning process ""!".,euu",,
target of 600.,700 communities. The reallocation of Credit proceeds
2009 increased the category of consultants by 47 percent (from an original allocation
SDRs to 1,102,724 SDRs).

Under this component: (i) a total of 9 indigenous strategic plans were                are not
strategic but rather a sequential list of possible investments); (H) about 678    tacilitators
trained in sub-project preparation methodology; (iii) 1,655 Project Executive Committees and
12,800 community members trained in the preparation of sub-projects; and                  sub-
projects were prepared and submitted to the FillS for review and approval.

Rating component A. Given the achievement described above, the ICR rates                    overall
implementation of this Component A as satisfactory.

Component B - Grants for Subprojects, According to Table A2.1, this component "''''",,,,,,,,..,'>
appraisal to cost US$12.5 million (funy financed by the Bank Credit), ended up
expenditures amounthlg to US$11.88 million (fully financed by the
the total estimated at appraisaL The slight under-spending is mainlyexp!ained by the
appraised estimates were based on an average unit cost for a sub-project of           US$20,OOO,
while reality proved that the average cost of a sub-project was in the order of US$7,

Under this component a total of 1,517 sub-projects were completed. These SUb-projects included,
inter-aHa: 221 infrastructure resulting in 2,553 household-related improvements; 32 educational
centers rehabilitated; 36 potable water projects; 20 drainage; and 1,362 productive, mostly
agriCUltural income generating activities. This component benefited about 73,000 people of the
participating communities, among them, 41,125 heads of households. These SUb-projects covered
different sectors of the economy, such as, inter-alia: ecotourism (restaurants, taxis, mot-taxis,
hotels), artisan fishing, grain farming, animal farming, dairy production, and potable water. Seven
horizontal subprojects were completed. In the best-case scenario, these horizontal sub-projects



                                               21
  will only provide the civil works at the closing of the Credit, being by themselves necessary but
  not sufficient to induce a holistic community development process as aimed by the NR PDOs.

  Rating component B. Despite the above-mentioned achievements, there were also many
  shortcomings in the implementation of this component. Accordingly, weighing the
  accomplishments with the shortcomings, the ICR rates the overall implementation of this
  Component B as moderately satisfactory.

  Component C - Capacity Building and Institu~oilal Strengthening. According to Table A2.1
  below, this component estimated at appraisal to cost US$2.91 million (US$1.31 million financed
  by the Credit and US$1.6 milliollby GOH), ended up documenting' expenditures amounting to
  US$2.89 million (US$1.48 million from the Bank Credit and'US$1.41 million from GOH), 99
           of
  percent the total estimated at appraisal. The financial savings derived from the unsatisfactory
  attempt to built institutional capacity at the FInSINRU and the indigenous federations to
  effectively manage and monitor the progress of the project implementation was compensated with
  additional operating costs incurred in 26 more months beyond the original closing date of May
  2008.

  In July 2010, the Bank approved a request by the GOH to use about US$1 million                    of
  uncommitted Credit proceeds as retroactive fmancing co~sponding to operating costs since
  effectiveness that were fully absorbed by the GOH. With this measure, the GOH would be able
  to free that amount of money to: (i) cover expenses of a skeleton NRU staff during the grace
  period (August-October, 31, 2010); (ii) complete activities of unfmished horizontal sub-projects;
  and (iii) assess the sustainability status ofa large sample of completed productive sub-projects.

  Rating Component C., Weighing the shortfalls of this component, in particular a consistent
  unsatisfactory management of the NR by the FInSINRU throughout the entire implementation
  cycle with the strength of having fmally completed an evaluation study, the ICR rates its
  performance as moderately unsatisfactory.              '

  According to Table A2.1, the total project cost estimated at appraisal was US$16.60 million
  equivalent, corresponding US$15 million equivalent from the Bank Credit (90 percent of the
  total) and USS1.6 million equivalent from the GOH (l0 percent of the total). This latter amount
  was allocated by the GOH to fmance the operational costs associated with the staffing of the
  FInSINRU, offices, mobilization of staff, and office equipment. At the time of the writing of the
  ICR, the total documented expenditure amounted to USSI5.32 million equivalent (92.3 percent of
  the total estimated at appraisal) of which USS13.86 million came from the Credit (90~5 percent of
  the total spent) and USS1.46 million equivalent came from the GOH (9.5 percent of the total
" spent).

   The slight shortfall in disbursing the totality of the Credit stems mainly from: (i) the significant
   delays in executing the project; (ii) the significant lower average cost of the sub-projects as
   compared with the estimated average at appraisal (about one third) resulting in about 15 percent
   less spending in the grants category as envisaged at appraisal (Table A2.2); and (iii) the
   insufficient accomplishments of Component C with respect to the envisaged targets set at the
   appraisal.

  About US$880,OOO of the balance in the Special Account was already committed, but not yet paid

  The insufficient (untimely and largely deficient) training provided during the implementation
  cycle, resulting in the bulking of training modules in one training session and thus delivering less
  training activities than envisaged at appraisal explains the shortfall of this category of expenditure.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
No social rates of return were estimated for any of the 1,666 sub-'projects that were approved and
financed by the NR projects, of which 1,335 were completed at the time ofthe writing of the ICR.
Given the demand-driven nature of the NR operation, the specific social rate of return could not
be determined ex-ante for any ofthe sub-projects before approval by FHIS.Furthermore, given
the shortcomings of the PHIS monitoring system, amply described in section 2.3 of this ICR
report, social rates of return were not calculated at the implementation completion of the
approved sub-projects. Accordingly, a rigorous cost-ben.efit analysis could not be undertaken for
the NIl to gauge the flows of benefits and project costs over time.

In addition, the lack of an impact evaluation study at the onset of the implementation cycle,
including a comparable group of ethnic communities not benefiting from the NR financing,
prevented the ICR from undertaking a rigorous cost-etTective analysis of the NR project  other
words, lacking two or more courses of action from the early stages of the impiementation cycle
and gathering the required cost and outcome information, hindered the carrying out of a cost-
effectiveness analysis.

In the absence of the above infomlation, the ICR utilized the findings of a recent evaluation study
commissioned by the FHIS and carried out during the second semester of 2009 to assess the
economic analysis ofthe NR project (Annex 9, Endeavour 2009). The objective of this study was
to measure the 'impact of the NR's PDOs in a random sampie of 200 communities - 100
participating in the project (about 7.5 percent of the total communities that completed the
implementation of an approved sub-project) and another comparable 100 non-participating
communities~ The random sample was selected with a 95 percent confidence interval.

This evaiuation study had both qualitative and quantitative dimensions. The qualitative analysis
was carried out through 10 focus groups among key community stakeholders totaling about 120
participants. Each focus group had an average of 12 participants including representatives of the
ethnic federations, community beneficiaries, and leaders and technical staff associated with the
implementation of the approved sub-projects. The quantitative analysis was done under the
propensity score matching process methodology among participating and non-participating
communities (the unit of measurement was the community, not the sub-pn~ject undertaken by the
same),

Given the difficulties in designing an appropriate metric to observe and measure changes in the
stated PDOs, the study utilized as a proxy the following observable indicators: (i) long and short-
term employment generated by the NR; (it) changes in productivity; (iii) commercialization of the
approved productive sub-projects outputs; (iv) access to credit; (v) gender among NR
beneficiaries; (vi) degree of organizational strengthening; and (vii) degree of participation of
members of the community in the NR~related decision making processes. When possible, these
indicators were observed in the sampie of NR participating communities and the control group.
The following preliminary findings complement the evidence already offered in the Data Sheet
and in section 3.2 ofthe ICR.

The following preliminary findings were derived from the analysis of the sampled communities
with approved productive sub-projects:

Finding 1. There was no visible impact in generating long-term paid and non-paid employment
in the participating communities' catchment area. On the other hand, as compared to the control
group, the NR generated a 2 and 3 percent increase in paid and non-paid short-term employment,

                                               24
respectively, of about 104 days or less in the agricultural sector of the sample participating
communi~ies while the sub-project was being implemented. This short:-term paid and non-paid
employment ceased to exist once the implementation of the approved sub:projects came to an end.

Finding 2. The NR had no impact on improving the productivity or in increasing the cultivated
area of the productive sub-projects related to corn, coffee, beans, sugar cane, and bananas
fmanced by the project.

Finding 3. As compared to the control group, the NR generated a slight surplus of about 2
percent in the cattle sector (horses, donkeys, and mules), 3.5 percent in the poultry farming
(chickens and eggs) and 11 percent in the dairy (milk) related sub-projects that were sold in the
local markets by the participating communities. However, the corresponding income generated
by these sales was marginal. Communities did not receive appropriate marketing training from
the NR to commercialize their surplus production.

Finding 4. Access to fmancial credit was 4 percentage points higher in the NR sample .
communities than in the control group. The largest source of additional financing for these
communities originated from the '.'cajas rurales" scheme (not supported by the NR project, 'but
already inexistence prior to the launching of theNR). In some cases, as witnessed by the ICR
field mission in the municipality of Siguatepeque. Department of Comayagua, one unsuccessful
productive sub-project was eventually converted by the sub-project partners into a successful
"caja-rural" scheme.

The following preliminary findings were derived from the analysis of the sampled communities
with approved socially related infrastructure sub-projects:
                                        ,                 -


Finding 5. As compared to the control group, housing improvements financed by the NR project
benefited 21 percent of the sampled participating communities. About' 36 percent of the
participating households improved their access to water and 7.7 percent improved the sanitary
conditions inside their homes. -The study assumes that improvement in the sanitary conditions of
the household also improved their morbidity rates.

Finding 6. The infrastructure suh-projects financed by the NR had no impact on improving the
accesS to roads among participating communities. The assumption made by the study is that the
amount allocated by the NR to this type of SUb-projects was too small -to have an observable
impact.

The following are other preliminary findings of this study. As compared to the control group, the
NR did not strengthen the organizational capacity of the sampled participating communities as
envisioned by the PDOs. The NR did induce participation of the benefited communities in the
decision-making processes related to the design and implementation of their approved sub-
projects. The impact on gender equity is a mixed stOl)' as already explained in the Data Sheet and
section 3.2 of the ICR. Finally, as already mentioned elsewhere in the ICR, the NR benefited the
poorest of the poor communities in Honduras, thus it had an effective poverty-reduction targeting
mechanism.           -

Summary of Borrower's ICR

ICR - Main Conclusions

I.     Review of the Execution of Objectives and Components

The primary objective set forth in the PD~ of the Nuestras Raices Program (PNR) was to secure
the participation of the indigenous and Afro-Honduran groups in the logistical development
processes of their .communities and their country. The foregoing was based on the execution of
three major compopents:

(a)    Participatory Development Planning by Ethnic Group

       The Program identified community microplanning as the key component for achieving
       the established objectives. As a result, communities prepared 1,605 local development
       plans, which were incorporated into a macroplan-the Nine Participatory Strategic Plans
       for the Indigenous and Afro-Honduran Communities of Honduras (PEPDINH).

(b)    Grants for Subprojects

       Based on this planning at various levels of organization, 1,666 subprojects were executed
       at the community level (1,517 completed by Credit closing), of which 86.5 percent
       related to production in the areas of agriculture, livestock, and commerce. A wide range
       of projects· based on the potential in each area was developed. characterized by
       agroecological factors, geographic location, and markets, among other things. thereby
       generating primary projects on food security through basic grain production, livestock
       production, agribusiness, and fish farming, as well as subprojects covering tourism,
       artisanal craft, and other areas. Similarly, 13.5 percent of all the subprojects addressed
       basic social infrastructure needs in communities. These very subprojects had been
       identified as priorities by the communities, the most important of which were the
       construction of potable water and basic sanitation systems, education centers, access
       roads, bridges, and the construction and improvement of houses and infrastructure with a
       view to strengthening cultural identity. This had an immediate impact on local capacities
       through job creation, an improvement in the ability to form associations, and the
       development of entrepreneurial and managerial capacities in hundreds of indigenous and
       Afro-Honduran communities in Honduras. The Program has thus contributed to an
       improvement in poverty indicators in the participating communities.

(c)    Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building

       As an extension of the indicators of the aforementioned components, the Program had an
       impact on capacity building at the community level in the areas of community
       assessment, administration, purchasing, and contracting. The fIrst process entailed the
       training of 630 facilitators, the majority of whom were indigenous farmers trained to pass
       on the knowledge acquired to their communities. Although the process created new
       leadership positions in communities and federations, it also had a number of limitations
       with respect to tJte execution process because, owing to the low level of education of
       these facilitators, their limited knowledge of training methods and techniques for adults.
       and their inexperience in group management, a number of them were only capable of
       conveying information and not knowledge.


                                              29
ll.     Results

At least 400 Community Etbnic Developnient Plans will be incorporated into the Municipal
Development Plan. Owing to disagreements between leaders and municipal corporations, this
objective was not achieved on a large scale. However, there was close collaboration in at least 20
municipalities, particularly with respect to implementation of infrastructure works.
At least five institutions are providing partial· financing for tbe Nine Strategic Development
Plans. The Ministries of Agriculture, Health, and Education, as weUas the Solidarity Network
 [Red Solidaria], INFOP, and INA, have partnered with FHISIPNR to implement production
projects and works.
At least 50 municipalities will finance .subprojects tbat have been included in tbe
Community Development Plans prepared by the Indigenous and Afro-Honduran
Communities. Only 20 municipalities co~financed the subprojects, but did not contribute to the
development plans for the municipalities.
At least 40 percent of tbe project. beneficiaries are women. Based on the follow~up analysis,
27 percent of the beneficiaries were women, members of the PIC and the CCS, while 36 percent
of the facilitators were women.
At least 70 percent of the funded subprojects will have sustainable maintenance systems in
operation. The initial follow-up assessment of execution revealed that 90 percent of the
subprojects were sustainable. This rate fell to 70 percent in the second assessment
At least 70 percent of the subprojects are implemented within the specified time, quality,
and budget parameters. Owing to the unrealistic time frames set forth in the plans,. none of the
subprojects was executed within the specified time .frames. However, 90 percent of these
subprojects were executed within realistic time frames for each type of subproject.
Each of the Nine Indigenous and Afro--Hondllf'an populations will have developed and
implemented at least two cross--cutting subprojects aimed at strengthening the indigenous
population as a wbole (in terms of.culture, language, history). By Credit closing, with respect
to the ten planned cross-cutting projects, seven had been completed and accepted. two were at the
design stage, and one had been partially executed.

ill.    Products by Component

Component I: Participatory Development Planning by Ethnic Group
This objective was fully achieved in a highly efficient and participatory manner as the same
federations, along with their technical units (UTEFIN)•. drafted the respective plans. These plans
included aU of the communities' investment initiatives. In addition, this process benefited from
technical assistance provided by professionals hired for that purpose, and by FHISIPNR experts.
In that regard. 1,605 communities developed their participatory community assessments, which
incorporated investment initiatives for development. These initiatives were incorporated into each
of the strategic plans for each ethnic group. A total of Nine Strategic Plans for Indigenous
Development were developed and implemented. Furthermore, women accounted for 31 percent'
of the participants in activities carried out by the Project Implementation Committees for the
facilitation, supervision, and coordination of the various subprojects.

Component ll: Grants for Subprojects
The objective was not fully achieved with respect to a number of projects that were poorly
executed and achieved a low level of sustainable results, owing to a design flaw in the actual
Program. It had not been established that demand would primarily pertain to production projects,
using time frames and automated processes based on the project cycle, thereby neglecting human
development per se, which may also call for systematic training processes over a period of up to
10 years. The achievement rate of this objective was 70 percent. It bears noting that the

                                               30
investment process did not start until the·third year of implementation of the Program, owing to
organizational and planning delays and to ongoing changes in management at institutions such as
in the Coordination Unit, and the consensus processes with federations involved in its execution.

Therefore, once the strategic plans were developed, the investment execution process was
initiated. A total of 1,666 subprojects were approved, 1,605 of which were developed from the
Strategic Plans for Indigenous Development, and were executed as follows:

              1,517 were fully executed as planned;
              42 were partially funded, with the termination of contracts for various reasons; and
              107 related to community training-Project Implementation Committee (PIC) and
              the Comite de Contraloria Social (a community watchdog committee).

Ninety percent of the communities indicated thatthe executed subprojects were their priority, and
90 percent of the communities that executed subprojects are below the poverty index of 0.5. The
follow-up assessment revealed that 62 percent of the residents participated in the organization
module, but only 23 percent completed the four training modules. Thirty-five percent of the
projects were managed by women, who also accounted for 27 percent of the members of the
Project Implementation Committees. However, 17 percent of wage payments were made to
women (this rate varies for each ethnic group owing to cultural trends and customs).

Component m: Institutional Strengthening and Capaeity Building
A measurement of the results indicators for each component showed that most of the
commuriity's members were involved in the planning process, thus indicating that community
meetings facilitated a high rate of participation in the process. With respect to execution of its
projects, the qualitative impact assessment revealed that over SO·percent of the participants were
satisfied. Similarly, most of the beneficiaries participated in the training process implemented.
However, the participation rate during training was low because it was characterized as a service.
Over 50 percent of the population also expressed satisfaction with the training received (the
PECINH methodology).

With respect to the rating given by beneficiaries for the participation of the federations, 80
percent expressed satisfaction with the role of the federations, in particular in the areas of
management, follow-up, and conflict resolution. A different picture emerges, however, in the
communities with respect to the participation of municipalities. Of the 121 communities in which
the PNR was present, only 20 were involved in the implementation and support of the subprojects.
However, most· of the indigenous and Afro-Honduran populations believe that the Program
helped develop their knowledge" skills, and ability to better organize themselves, administer
financial resources, and make better decisions with respect to the purchase of materials used for
their projects, thereby helping improve their living conditions, particularly in terms of food
security and better housing. The impact assessment indicates an expected 3 percent improvement
in the population's poverty indicators, compared to.control groups used for assessment purposes.

IV.    Cost and Financing
The Nuestras Raices Program - Phase V was funded under Loan Agreement No. 3892-HO
between the International Development AssociationIWorld Bank and the Government of

Honduras· for a total of 10,100,000 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) and a country contributlon of
US$1.6 milliondoUars. Pursuant to an amendment of this agreement on July 26, 2010, Part A.2
includes the definition of Operating Costs, which are ''the incremental expenses incurred on
account of subproject implementation, including office equipment and supplies, vehicle opemtion
and maintenance, communication and insurance costs, office administration costs, utilities, travel,
per diem, and supervision costs of locally contracted employees." The total amount stood at
9,928,864.47 SDR, which was accounted for in full to the World Bank. The difference
(171,135.53 SDR) is attributable to the fluctuation rate between the donar and the SDR, which
was not calculated based on the conditionality for the final,deadline extension.

V.      Impact on Institutional Development

The Program had an impact on the following areas of institutional development:
       (a)    Local capacity building in communities for project management and
              administration;
       (0)    The development of planning tools at the micro level in communities and the
              macro level in each of the country's indigenous and Afro-Honduran"
              communities;                                    ,
       (c)    The strengthening of community participation in decision making and self-
              management;
       (d)    The development of human capital through non-formal tmining in administmtion,
              leadership, decision making, etc.; and        .
       (e)    Increased transparency through the Comites de Contraloria Social.

VI.     Sustaim~bilUy
            •          8. view to ensuring sustainability, the Nuestras Raices Program - Phase V
                 developed processes targeting human development, resulting in the training of
                 630 trainers         the indigenous and Afro-descendant communities. In order to
                           executive members of the PICs and the CCSs, over 12,800 members of
                these           were also tmined in PECINH methodology, thereby building local
                 capacity for project administmtion and management.
            ~    Seventy percent of investments executed by the Program were considered
                sustainable. Owing to the fact that infrastructure projects were designed for
                communities, they were executed and managed" by local organizations, in
                particular the council or water authority. Mechanisms were established for the
                maintenance          sustainabiHty of the works (these may vruy depending on the
                type               bridges, potable water systems, basic centers, and schools).
            •   Given          nature, production projects have built the capacity for organizational
                development, internal regulations, reinvestment, and job creation; they have also
                developed        community's capacity to repay funds. However, the phenomenon
                of channeling "community projects". toward community microenterprises
                managed         community groups exists, with increased specialization, requiring
                support, as wen as systematic and ongoing training, based on the competitive
                activity      which they are involved. Similarly, indigenous organizations have
                generated a number of synergistic initiatives with public and private institutions
                to facilitate the strengthening and sustainability of the subprojects.

VII.   Lessons
Modifications to the       Modifications were made to the Program's Operational Manual as
it was geared toward the execution of infrastructure works. Modifications were therefore


                                                32
necessary to meet the needs of the execution process for production subprojects with respect to
training, supervision, and oversight tools.

Management: The Program's CoOrdination Unit operated with an inadequate structure that
affected its ability to achieve greater effectiveness and efficiency in the development of
guidelines established in' the Agreement, primarily with respect to its                      priority
areas. The Unit had limited human resources in financial areas.an4:'was              in the areas of
gender equality, municipal development, and monitoring and evaluation,              to resoivethese
problems, a team of investment specialists was established by geogt'ttphic area. to manage, follow
up, and monitor field activities covered in strategic planning notim:~ludedin this Agreement. In
addition to the foregoing, the ongoingtumover of staff. from the coordination to the technical
units of the PCU, as well as senior officials from the Program's lead institution, imposed a
number of limitations on execution of the Program.

Ti'8ining and Technical Assistaftce: Although the Program developed local capacities through
training of facilitators and accorded priority to the hiring of local staff to provide technical
assistance to the subprojects, this proved inadequate for consolidation of the development process,
owing to the absence of proper and timely follow-up to strengthen the lmowledge and structures
of community stakeholders.

Involvement of LOcal Governments in the Execution of the Progr**m: Efforts to ensure the
participation of the municipalities failed to achieve the proposed objective. The processes to
establish closer ties among all the parties involved throughout the country did not have the impact
needed to spur various comprehensive development initiatives in' the context of the Program.
Efforts must therefore be made in the future to overcome this major constraint

Participation by Women: Although women participated throughout the execution of the .
Program, their level of participation was low~ owing in part to the fact that, with the exception of
those established for the creation of the PICs and the CCSs, the feU did not establish the
necessary strategic guidelines. Even at the local           significant elements of a culture of
inequality with respect to women remain.

Decentralization: The design and execution of the Program are effectively in accordance with
the guidelines of the decentralization strategy that previous Government administrations had been
promoting; they have therefore been recognized as long-term processes. One of the Program's
main achievements is the high level of participation of the communities in the planning, resource
administration, and decision-making processes. The Program also facilitated greater geographic
distribution, channeling resources directly toward hundreds of communities that for several
decades had received no institutional assistance, thus providing direct benefits to close to 1.2
million people. However, this dispersion of projects generated high operating costs for the FillS,
leading to the processing of over 20,000 payments, check deliveries, supervision costs, and so
forth.

Program's Contribution to the Indigenous Communities: Communities strengthened their
management capacity (in the areas of organization, planning, and resource administration) and
imprOVed their living conditions in' terms of housing, basic sanitation, education, health,
contribution to food security, and temporary and permanent job creation. The Program also
significantly strengthened cultural identity through the construction of buildings designed to bring
the cultures of the indigenous and Afro-Honduran communities together.

VDI.    Monitoring and Evaluation

Monitoring and evaluation was linked to the indicators established in the PAD, and was broken
down as follows: (a) Annual Program Planning (Annual Operating Plan); (b) Procurement Plan;
(c) Half-Yearly Reports; (d) Impact Assessment, etc.
The peu also developed internal control tools such as the FHIS's management system (GIS), a
database, and surveys to measure results indicators, etc. For the impact assessment, the
Propensity Score Matching method was used and, owing to the absence of a baseline, indicators
from the poverty maps were used, as these indicators offered the advantage of being able to
establish, with the help of data from the National Statistical Institute of Honduras (INE), control
and processing groups that could facilitate the creation of counterfactual scenarios for the
comparison of these groups.
