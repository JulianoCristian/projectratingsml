Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
Dear Sir, 
 
We refer to the Credit Agreement between International Development Association (the 
“Association”) and Republic of Honduras (the “Recipient”) dated August 18, 2004, with respect 
to the above-captioned Project (“Credit Agreement”). Capitalized terms used in this amendment 
letter (“Amendment Letter”) and not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the 
Credit Agreement. 
 
Pursuant to your letter dated July 21, 2010 wherein a request is made to amend the Credit 
Agreement, we are pleased to inform you that the Association agrees to your request and 
consequently proposes to amend the Credit Agreement as follows: 
 
(1) 
A new definition of “Operating Costs” is included in Part A.2 of Schedule 1 to 
the Credit Agreement, placed in alphabetical order, (and the existing definitions are consequently 
renumbered to keep the alphabetical order) to read as follows: 
 
‘“Operating Costs’ means the incremental expenses incurred on account of Sub-projects 
implementation, including office equipment and supplies, vehicle operation and maintenance, 
communication and insurance costs, office administration costs, utilities, travel, 
per diem
 and 
supervision costs of locally contracted employees.” 
 
(2) 
The table set forth in Part A.1 of Schedule 1 to the Credit Agreement is hereby 
amended to read as set forth in the Annex to this Amendment Letter. 
 
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing and dating this 
Amendment Letter in the spaces provided below.  This Amendment Letter shall be executed in 
two counterparts, each of which shall be an original. The provisions set forth herein shall become 
effective retroactively as of January 19, 2005, upon receipt by the Association of the copy of this 
Amendment Letter countersigned by you.
