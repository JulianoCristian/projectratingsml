"Ratings of the First Nuestras Raices\n            Project for Honduras were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory; the risk to development outcome\n            was high; the Bank's performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and the Borrower's performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Social assessments are critical not only to identify\n            appropriate cultural practices but also to consider the\n            political economy of project design at every phase for every\n            stakeholder in the process; appropriate monitoring\n            arrangements are needed from the outset of project\n            implementation to improve management effectiveness; periodic\n            implementation and process evaluations both during start-up\n            and during implementation are recommended; the bank should\n            consider adding a. staffing clause to future operations; and\n            a project's risk analysis should include an assessment\n            of the impact of all risks materializing during implementation."}, "docdt": "2011-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
