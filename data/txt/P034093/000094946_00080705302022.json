outcome of the project was\n            satisfactory, and sustainability is likely, with substantial\n            institutional development impact. Lessons drawn from the\n            project address primarily, the importance of realistic\n            reform targets, even if they are ambitious, for they provide\n            the stimulus for government reform support, commitment, and\n            wider participation in structural adjustment lending.\n            Likewise, appropriate counterpart in terms of scope, and\n            level of authority, is particularly important, since it\n            provides the highest, and continuous political support. But\n            reform program actions should be based on execution, with\n            specific control by local authorities, to provide the\n            benefit of timely budgeted allowances. Furthermore,\n            extensive, and specialized technical assistance (TA) is\n            necessary to implement institutional reforms, because not\n            only, changes in systems, and processes are required, but\n            because reforms are difficult to implement, complex, and\n            time-consuming, and, most importantly, TA provides the\n            professional skills required in a changing environment. This\n            cannot be achieved without responsive donor partners, whose\n            assistance, and effectiveness proved critical in the\n            provision of a timely, and high-quality TA."}, "docdt": "2000-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
