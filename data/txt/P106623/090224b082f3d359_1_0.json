moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            greater attention needs to be paid to implementation\n            capacity at project outset, beyond the successful completion\n            of a previous project. Implementation capacity assessments\n            should also include an evaluation of project staff relative\n            to project scope, and a skills assessment of staff needed to\n            conduct key tasks. A better training process for financial\n            management and procurement is necessary in the context of\n            complex project design. It would be good to provide training\n            in a timely fashion, and refresher training sessions when\n            there are significant changes to project staff. Task teams\n            should provide frequent and varied training opportunities to\n            address these challenges. Projects where countries are\n            reimbursed for eligible expenses should look into\n            difficulties with the project design in the event of slow\n            disbursement at the beginning of the project. Slow\n            disbursement may be a result of a lack of understanding of\n            eligible expenses or project design, or of financial\n            difficulties in raising funds to make payments, even if they\n            are reimbursed at a later date. Greater cultural\n            consideration should be given when designing project\n            activities and targets for indicators. Marginalization and\n            stigma may also impede implementation, such as de-emphasis\n            of certain key populations among other more acceptable\n            groups, reluctance for surveys of these groups to take\n            place, and poor outcomes due to late presentation to\n            treatment and care."}, "docdt": "2015-05-28T04:35:03Z"}
