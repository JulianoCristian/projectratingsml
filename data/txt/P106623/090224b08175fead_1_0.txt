                         The project would support the implementation of the 2008-2013 Barbados National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan, specifically to increase:
                         - Adoption of safe behaviors, in particular amongst key populations at higher risk.
                         - Access to prevention, treatment and social care, in particular for key populations at higher risk.
                         - Capacity of organizational and institutional structures that govern the NAP.
                         - Use of quality data for problem identification, strategy definition and measuring results.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Barbados is making progress in combating HIV/AIDS. Barbados has eliminated mother to child HIV transmission (MTCT) since 2007 and 100% of identified HIV positive pregnant
                         women received a complete course of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to reduce MTCT in 2012. The rate of AIDS related mortality has dramatically decreased, related to the greater
                         availability of ART. Observed and modeled epidemic trends indicate that the rate of incident HIV infection in Barbados is static or declining. The available data indicate that Barbados

                         is on track to achieve MDG 6 (halt or reverse HIV/AIDS) by 2015. The country has expanded access to HIV testing services for most at risk populations (MARPs). Coverage of
                         those eligible for ART services under national guidelines has been above 80% since 2010 and well exceeds the project target of 60%.

                         The Grant Scheme to support civil society organizations (CSOs) was launched in September 2011. To date, a total of 22 proposals have been submitted, of which 11 were approved.
