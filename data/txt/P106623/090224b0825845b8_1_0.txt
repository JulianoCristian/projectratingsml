                         particular amongst key populations at higher risk. - Access to prevention, treatment and social care, in particular for key populations at higher risk. - Capacity of
                         organizational and institutional structures that govern the NAP. - Use of quality data for problem identification, strategy definition and measuring results.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This Project was approved on August 7, 2008 and has been effective since January 6, 2009. To date, a total of US$29.25 million has been disbursed under the Project representing
                         83.56 percent of the total loan.

                         The Project supports the National HIV/AIDS Program, under which, a number of significant results have been achieved. AIDS-related mortality has dramatically decreased due to the
                         greater availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Coverage of those eligible for ART services is above 80 percent since 2010, which exceeds the project target of 60 percent. Since

                         2007, Barbados has eliminated mother to child HIV transmission and 100 percent of identified HIV positive pregnant women have received a complete course of ART to reduce
                         mother to child transmission. Access to HIV testing and targeted testing services for key populations has been extended. The Grant Scheme to support civil society organizations
                         (CSOs) has provided funding to 30 CSOs.
