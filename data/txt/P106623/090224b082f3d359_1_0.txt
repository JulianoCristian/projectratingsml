F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project would support the implementation of the 2008-2013 Barbados National
HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan, specifically to increase:


                                                 vi
  - Adoption of safe behaviors, in particular amongst key populations at higher risk.
  - Access to prevention, treatment and social care, in particular for key populations at
higher risk.
  - Capacity of organizational and institutional structures that govern the National AIDS
Program (NAP).
  - Use of quality data for problem identification, strategy definition and measuring results.

                                                     distinguish the indicator from
                                                     the target. Additional clarity
                                                     was also provided on some

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

Country/Sector Background and Rationale for Bank Assistance

1.     Barbados is the easternmost country in the Caribbean and had a population of 277,000 at
the time of Project appraisal in 2008. At that time, the Caribbean Region had the highest Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevalence among adults outside Sub-Saharan Africa. The
estimated prevalence rate for Barbados increased from 1.3% in 2001 to 1.5% in 2005, and HIV/
AIDS was the greatest burden of infectious diseases in Barbados for the 15-49 year age group. In
comparison, estimated HIV/AIDS prevalence in 2005 according to UNAIDS was 1.1% in the
Dominican Republic, 1.5% in Jamaica, and 3.3% in the Bahamas. The National Strategic Plan of
Barbados 2005-2025: Global Excellence, Barbadian Traditions, identified HIV/AIDS as one of the
major threats to its overall success as it endangered the country's human capital, putting productive
capacity and economic growth in peril. The potential for escalation in the burden on welfare
services and increasing treatment costs was significant. Such a negative impact on the productive
population combined with increases in the aged population could create a cost to the country that
was monetarily and socially unsustainable.

2.      The World Bank (hereafter the Bank) has been providing technical and financial assistance
in the area of HIV/AIDS to Barbados since 2001. The Caribbean HIV/AIDS I-Barbados Project
for US$15 million (P075220; Loan: IBRD #7066), which closed in 2007, achieved high levels of
awareness, treatment, and care, but was less successful in inducing the level of sustained behavior
change required to impact the epidemic's prevention and control. Given the success of the First
Project and the remaining unfinished work, the Government of Barbados (GOB) requested a
follow-on project to contribute to tackling the outstanding challenges. The US$35 million World
Bank Loan was based on the estimated total Project cost of US$94.39 million. US$89 million was
for investment costs and operational costs, and US$4.5 million was for technical assistance; the
balance included a front-end fee and price contingencies. The GOB requested the Bank to provide
budget support for 35% of investment and operational costs and to finance 80% of technical
assistance costs. The GOB requested the loan in part to ensure sustainability and commitment of
funding to the National HIV/AIDS Program while improving accountability and multisectoral
coordination of the Program. The Bank’s assistance was justified in the context of the public goods
nature of support to HIV/AIDS prevention and control. At the time of Appraisal, the Bank was the
only source of external funding as other sources such as the Global Fund against AIDS, TB and
Malaria targeted lower-income countries. However, after the first year of Bank financing through
the Second HIV/AIDS Project, the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)
and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding also came about, mainly focused
on providing additional technical assistance in support of the National HIV/AIDS Program.2




2
  CDC funding from September 30, 2009-September 29, 2014 totaled US$1.62 million. PEPFAR funding was also
provided for the Caribbean HIV/AIDS Regional Training program; however, information on the specific amount was
not available at the time of this ICR.

                                                      1
1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators

3.     The Project Development Objectives (PDOs), as listed in the Loan Agreement dated
September 25, 2008 and in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) 3 was as follows:
The Project would support the implementation of the National Strategic Plan for HIV Prevention
and Control 2008-2013 (NSP), specifically to increase:
- Adoption of safe behaviors, in particular amongst key populations at higher risk.
- Access to prevention, treatment and social care, in particular for key populations at higher risk.
- Capacity of organizational and institutional structures that govern the NAP.
- Use of quality data for problem identification, strategy definition and measuring results.
4.     Key performance indicators (KPIs) in the Loan Agreement (Section II) were consistent
with those in the PAD.

      Behavior change
      • Maintain the percentage of young people 15-24 years spontaneously indicating sexual
         relations as a way of transmitting HIV at least at 90% from 2008 to 2013.
      • Increase the percentage of:
             o Sex workers who report the use of a condom with their most recent client from 80%
                 in 2008 to 95% in 2013.
             o Men who have sex with men (MSM) who report the use of a condom the last time
                 they had sex from 65% in 2008 4 to 75% in 2013.
             o Young people 15-24 years reporting the use of a condom the last time they had sex
                 with a non-marital, non-cohabitating partner from 21% in 2008 to 31% in 2013.

      Access to prevention, treatment and social care
      • Increase in the number of people from key populations at higher risk accessing preventive
         services from 250 in 2009 to 500 in 2013.
      • Maintain the percentage of HIV-positive pregnant women receiving a complete course of
         antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis to reduce the risk of mother to child transmission
         (MTCT) above 95% in the period from 2008 to 2013.
      • Maintain the percentage of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) on Antiretroviral Treatment
         (ART) achieving virologic success in the last 12 months above 70% in the period from
         2008 to 2013.

      NAP Capacity
      • Increase in the funds spent by Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) under results-based
        agreements with the National HIV/AIDS Commission (NHAC) to facilitate the
        implementation of program interventions for key populations at higher risk in the period
        from 2008 to 2013.

  The wording of the PDO in the loan agreement dated September 25, 2008 is slightly different than that in the PAD
but does not translate to any difference in substance. Similarly, there is a slight difference in the PDOs listed in the
Data Sheet of the PAD and in the main body of the document, but this does not translate to a difference in substance.
4
  This baseline figure is listed as 64% in the PAD.

                                                           2
      M&E
      • An evidence-based Strategic Plan for the period of 2013-2018 prepared before Project
        closing, taking into account surveillance and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) data
        available under the Project.

1.3   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

5.      The PDO was not revised. However, the KPIs were modified in the First Restructuring
(July 19, 2011) as follows: (i) all nine KPIs were rephrased to distinguish the target from the
indicator, (ii) indicators were refined to improve clarity of the definitions, and (iii) targets were
revised for indicators for which updated information was available. Overall, the changes were
minor with the exception of the following: (i) KPI #4 (increase the percentage of young people 15-
24 years reporting the use of a condom the last time they had sex with a non-marital, non-
cohabitating partner) – the target for 2013 was revised from 31% to 65%; (ii) KPI #5 (increase in
the number of people from key populations at higher risk accessing preventive services) was
changed to specify and set targets for key groups from a target of 500 in 2013 for key populations
at higher risk to 75% for MSM by 2012 and 70% for Female Sex Workers (FSW) by 2012;
however, no comparable data was provided for the baseline; (iii) KPI #8 – there was a reduction
in the amount of funds available to be spent by CSOs under results-based agreements from
$502,000 to $150,000 by 2013 given the limited number of CSOs operating in the country and the
slow start to the CSO grant system.

6.     The Second Restructuring (March 5, 2013) involved changing the final target year for
survey completion from 2012 to 2013 for three indicators (KPI #2, #3 and #5) and the target for
one indicator (KPI #4).

7.      The Third Restructuring (November 25, 2013) extended the KPI target dates for all
indicators (and Project closing date) by one year to November 30, 2014.

8.      Intermediate performance indicators taken from the National AIDS Program’s framework
were listed in the PAD, but were not reported in the system after the first Implementation Status
and Results Report (ISR). The exclusion of the intermediate outcome indicators (IOIs) is also seen
in the revised Results Framework presented in the First Restructuring Paper which includes only
the nine KPIs. The Bank team formally monitored only those indicators agreed on with the
Government and included in the Loan Agreement.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries

9.      The primary target group defined in the PAD were key populations at higher risk. This
included male and female Sex Workers (SW); MSM; prisoners and drug users (DU); PLHIV and
with disabilities; youth, especially out-of-school; and unemployed women; further details on each
of these groups is provided in a beneficiary assessment in the PAD (Annex 6 of the PAD). Main
key populations at higher risk for the Project are considered to be MSM, FSW, and youth based
on the KPIs and discussions during the ICR mission. Figures in the PAD show that youth was the



                                                 3
largest key population targeted at roughly 12.3% of the total population, while the size of the MSM
and SW populations were 1% and 0.6-2.24% respectively.

1.5     Original Components

10.     The Project had two components which were closely linked to the PDOs. A summary of
these components is provided below; a detailed description is available in Annex 12:

Component 1: Prevention and Care (US$89.65 million, US$31.4 million loan)
This component aimed to contribute to the implementation of the NSP, specifically where the
following three Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEPs) are concerned:

        Sub-component 1: National Program Coordination and Institutional Strengthening. 5 This
        program aimed at strengthening the ability of the public sector, private sector and civil
        society partners to coordinate, monitor and evaluate their activities and use data to
        continually increase the quality of their programs.

        Sub-component 2: Scaling up Prevention Efforts.
        This program aimed to increase access to preventive services, especially among key
        populations at higher risk, and including Behavior Change Communication (BCC) and
        provision of condoms.

        Sub-component 3: Improving Diagnosis, Treatment & Care.
        The goal of this program was to increase the length and quality of life of PLHIV. The
        program aimed at increasing PLHIV access to diagnostic services, treatment services (ART
        and treatment for opportunistic infections (OIs)) and social care and support (counseling,
        support groups, drug addiction therapy, and home care).

Component 2. Institutional Strengthening5 (US$4.47 million, US$3.6 million loan)
The objective of Component 2 was to provide institutional strengthening via training and technical
assistance that was not funded under the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) 6 component. While
routine surveillance, seroprevalence and behavioral surveys, and quality audits were carried out
under Component 1, the second component included non-routine training and technical assistance
to review the surveillance system, putting sero- and behavior surveillance and quality audits in
place, and assisting with standardization of data collection methodologies, particularly in the case
of behavior surveillance. This component financed training and technical assistance on M&E,
management, surveillance, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of HIV/AIDS and other
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), to support the implementation of the Strategic Plan.

5
  There was some overlap in the naming of components and subcomponents. Institutional strengthening under
Component 1 refers to institutional strengthening as implemented under the NSP; support was provided in the form
of budget support. Comparatively, Component 2 on institutional strengthening refers to non-routine training and
technical assistance activities; support here was provided in the form of technical assistance.
6
  The World Bank defines a SWAp as “…an approach to a locally-owned program for a coherent sector in a
comprehensive and coordinated manner, moving toward the use of country systems. SWAps represent a …shift in the
focus, relationship and behavior of donors and governments. They involve high levels of donor and country
coordination for the achievement of program goals, and can be financed through parallel financing, pooled financing,
general budget support, or a combination.” In this Project, the Bank and GOB funds were pooled.

                                                         4
1.6       Revised Components

11.     Component 2 was revised to include the development of a health information system (HIS)
as part of the First Restructuring due to the need to improve the capacity for evidence-based
planning. The HIS cost US$2.8 million, which was financed by the Government and the World
Bank, and did not require reducing investment from other activities as it fell within the scope of
technical assistance.

1.7       Other Significant Changes

12.       In addition to the changes listed above, the Project was restructured three times:

      •   First Restructuring: This entailed an increase in Bank financing of Component 2
          expenditures for goods and consultants’ services from 79% to 100%, due to the difficulty
          by the Government of Barbados in providing counterpart funding and due to the impact of
          the global economic and financial crisis. This was done in response to a letter dated July
          29, 2010 by the GOB which requested this increase.

      •   Second Restructuring: Changes aimed to: (i) strengthen leadership and capacity of the
          Project by further engaging the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to support the NHAC in
          coordinating across non-health line ministries to accelerate the level of disbursements and
          procurement, monitoring and evaluation and supervision functions to the Ministry of
          Health (MOH); (ii) increase the percentage of Bank financing of Eligible Expenditures
          Program (EEPs) under Component 1 from 35% to 65% to accelerate the disbursement in
          order to fully utilize all of the funds to achieve the PDOs.

      •   Third Restructuring: The Project Closing Date was extended by one year to November
          30, 2014 in order to give the Borrower time to complete outstanding activities, including
          the first stage of implementation of the HIS, Behavioral Surveillance Survey (BSS) results
          for FSW and MSM, and organization of consultative sessions for the NSP. The extension
          of the Closing Date was also expected to allow for full utilization of the undisbursed
          amount of US$8.75 million.

2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.     Soundness of the background analysis: This Project was prepared as a follow-on
operation to the Caribbean HIV/AIDS I-Barbados Project. Background analysis included in-depth
beneficiary and institutional assessments, and incorporated lessons learned from the previous
Project (general lessons and those from the results of a Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review
of the First Project in November 2006), as well as from HIV/AIDS projects that tackled the
epidemic head-on such as through the provision of condoms and needle exchange programs
(Brazil, Thailand and Uganda) and those that focused on the political and social environments and
on policies and legislation (Jamaica and other countries in the Caribbean). In addition, the Project’s


                                                   5
emphasis on key populations at higher risk was appropriate as the epidemic was considered to be
focused among these populations. In general, the background analysis was found to be sound.

14.    Assessment of the project design: The PDOs and design of the Project were in line with
the goals of the National Strategic Plan, the Pan Caribbean Partnership Against HIV/AIDS
(PANCAP) and the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM)’s Caribbean
Regional Strategic Framework. The project design took a comprehensive, multisectoral approach
to addressing HIV/AIDS, and took the needs of the various high-risk groups into consideration.
The implementing agency, the NHAC (established in 2001), had previous experience in working
with the Bank (under the First Project) and worked in partnership with many different Ministries,
CSOs, and community and religious groups.

15.      Implementation arrangements, as specified in the PAD, could have benefited from
improvements in two key areas. First, the PAD notes that the Project would not require a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) since the National AIDS Response was considered integrated
according to the World Bank’s project implementation arrangements classification criteria. This
was because the majority of activities would be carried out by civil servants and preexisting
departments and units, with major ministries reporting to NHAC. However, the PAD also notes
the existence of few dedicated posts of HIV Coordinators, and that many government employees
were assigned responsibility for HIV coordination in addition to their regular duties. In light of
this, the Project would have likely benefited from a PIU, ideally one that included representation
from the NHAC and MOH. In addition, the implementation arrangements state that the
institutional and implementation arrangements for the Second Project would be similar to those
for the First Project, without adequate consideration of the change in size and scope from the First
to the Second Project, and of the transfer of the NHAC from the supervision of the Prime Minister’s
Office to the MFYS. Greater consideration could have been given to the changes in the size and
scope of the Second Project. Inconsistencies in the Project documents such as the PAD and the
Project Operations Manual on expenditures eligible for reimbursement also led to some confusion
early on in the Project. The GOB sought a formal Legal Opinion on the interpretation of eligible
expenditure.

16.     Second, the Project was financed by an innovative lending approach – a SIL of US$35
million with disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) where a SWAp was followed for Component
1 activities and traditional investment lending for Component 2. 7 This approach, while innovative
and supportive of government programs, also presented potential challenges in terms of
implementation due to difficulties in understanding and executing reimbursable expenditures.
Eligible expenditures were not initially submitted for reimbursement as there was a lack of clarity
in some line ministries on which expenditures qualified for reimbursement and the process by
which reimbursement occurred. The Project design and the co-financing mechanism (where the
Bank co-financed a percentage of eligible expenditures of the government program), while

7
  For Component 1, the use of a SWAp approach emphasized country ownership and capacity building; the
simultaneous use of DLIs provided an emphasis on the achievement of results. DLIs ranged in value from $1.5-$11.5
million, and provided flexibility in cases of partial compliance while requiring the GOB to submit a time-bound action
plan for achievement of results going forward. Loan funding was pooled with government funding to finance the NAP
in Component 1, while loan funding was disbursed against government contracts in Component 2. For Component 2,
traditional investment lending was acceptable given the focus on technical assistance.

                                                          6
challenging, was necessary to preserve fiscal space for health, which was a concern at the time of
Project preparation.

17.    High-level government commitment: The GOB was highly committed to the Project.
The request for this Project came from the Prime Minister, and was approved by Cabinet. In
addition, the institutional assessment section of the PAD notes that the national response to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic in Barbados is mainly led by the GOB, once again highlighting the
commitment of the government.

18.     Assessment of risks and mitigation measures: Several risks were identified in the PAD,
but the overall risk rating was low. One of the risks identified as low, namely the vulnerability of
the economy to external shocks, materialized during the course of the Project and the economic
downturn resulted in Project restructuring (First Restructuring). In retrospect, the vulnerability of
the economy to external shocks should have been rated as a moderate risk given the economic
climate at the time. Speed of implementation in the early stages was affected by insufficient
implementation capacity – the mitigation measures highlighted that the Bank would provide
funding, technical assistance, and training for planning and M&E purposes. However, in at least
one instance, training on Financial Management was provided only at the later stages of the Project
when it should have been provided much earlier.

2.2    Implementation

19.     Implementation Challenges (Pre-Midterm Review): Implementation capacity was
insufficient at the beginning of the Project with implementation arrangements continued from the
First Project despite the change in PDOs and substantially larger scope of the Second Project. This
lack of capacity was compounded by a lack of technical expertise among key staff necessary for
successful implementation. Finally, as noted by the PAD, despite the existence of a multisectoral
framework to implement the National HIV/AIDS Project, the reality was quite different on the
ground.

20.     The Project continued to face capacity challenges until the Second Restructuring of the
Project, which occurred after the midterm review (MTR). The MTR, held December 5-9, 2011
identified three major weaknesses: (a) lack of effective leadership and weak capacity of the NHAC;
(b) lack of coordination between the NHAC and the MOH, the main implementing agency of the
Project; and (c) delayed implementation and underutilization of available loan funds. The Second
Restructuring resulted in a turning point for the Project which had previously been facing
challenges and was rated Moderately Satisfactory for PDO and Moderately Unsatisfactory for
Implementation Progress (IP) after the MTR. These issues posed the biggest challenges to Project
implementation, and are discussed in further detail below:

       a. Lack of mandate, weak capacity, and poor coordination: The Project design required
       the NHAC to take the lead on coordinating the national response across agencies and on
       monitoring Project implementation. However, other agencies often had competing
       priorities and did not always report eligible expenditures on a regular basis. In addition, the
       NHAC had previously been under the Prime Minister’s office but was transferred under
       the MFYS as the Project started. This transfer may have resulted in the perception of a

                                                 7
       reduction in the mandate of the NHAC, and may have hindered their ability to lead a
       successful, robust national response. The possibility of the chair of the National HIV/AIDS
       Commission stepping down prior to the Second Project commencing was raised as a
       concern, and occurred during the course of the Project. This concern was heightened
       considering a successor would be new to the role, not carrying the mandate from the Prime
       Minister’s office, be tasked with implementing cross-Ministry coordination and reporting
       without the previous mandate, with less visibility and authority, and implementing a new,
       larger-scale project with a more elaborate design.

       In addition, the NHAC had insufficient capacity as Project implementation began. Staff
       with certain areas of technical expertise were needed at the NHAC, and the MOH was
       theoretically able to provide this expertise, but ended up not doing so due to a lack of
       coordination between the two agencies as a result of poorly-defined roles prior to the
       Second Restructuring of the Project. Such was the case in the M&E and procurement
       functions. As the Project progressed, the NHAC staff proved to be strongly committed and
       took on the task of self-teaching where possible and drawing applicable expertise from
       related areas of their background. The Bank also provided technical assistance.
       Nonetheless, improved coordination between the NHAC and the MOH at the initial stages
       of the Project, and perhaps a more proactive effort by the GOB to seek assistance on issues
       that were unclear in the early stages of the Project, would have been beneficial. It would
       also have been beneficial if the Bank had provided additional clarification where Project
       arrangements were concerned, particularly with regard to reimbursement of eligible
       expenditures.

       b. Delayed implementation and underutilization of available loan funds: More than 40
       officials received financial management and procurement training in several line ministries
       at Project Launch. However, the training provided appeared to be inadequate; in addition,
       some staff left and others received no training until late in implementation. A repeated
       theme during the ICR mission was the initial lack of clarity and subsequently, different
       interpretations, on items that qualified for reimbursement, and how the reimbursement
       mechanism worked. The mechanism of incurring costs first to receive reimbursement later
       was thought to be difficult by some as it meant they needed to find money to spend in the
       first place, which was challenging as the country was going into a recession. Officials were
       thus getting mixed messages on the need to conserve spending in general, while at the same
       time being encouraged to spend for reimbursable items. As the cost-cutting exercise also
       began in government at that time, there were fewer people available to do the needed work.
       This was further complicated by inconsistencies in the PAD and the Project Operations
       Manual which provided conflicting information on whether capital works were eligible for
       reimbursement.

       In addition, the location of the Bank’s loan center in Brazil and its financial staff in DC
       resulted in slower and more challenging communication where financial management and
       loan disbursement was concerned.

21.     Implementation Strengths (Post-Midterm Review): The MTR proved to be a pivotal
turning point for the Project, and provided excellent inputs on where improvements could be made

                                                8
by the Bank and GOB. Due to the candor of the review, those involved were forced to face the
shortcomings of the Project. The Permanent Secretary of Investment in the Ministry of Finance
and Economic Affairs at the time became personally involved and held a meeting with
representatives from the different ministries aimed at identifying reimbursable expenses and
providing clarity on the reimbursements. Subsequently, implementation improved significantly,
particularly in the two areas summarized below:

       Area 1. Capacity strengthening and strengthening of the multisectoral response: The
       increased coordination role of MOF in support of disbursement and financial management
       functions; of procurement, monitoring and evaluation and supervision functions to the
       MOH; and the establishment of a Project Director housed at the MOH resulted in a
       substantial, rapid improvement in implementation. The multisectoral coordination between
       the different agencies improved and roles and responsibilities of the different ministries
       were clarified. In addition, the establishment of the Project Director post housed at the
       MOH also made it easier to have direct contact with the Bank for assistance when needed.
       The appointment of the Project Director also meant there was now a central focal point for
       relevant MOH activities. As a result of these different factors, the Project picked up speed
       to the point where it was able to compensate for the implementation challenges faced in
       the first half of the Project.

       Area 2. Strengthening of M&E culture: The strong emphasis on identifying and
       reporting expenses for reimbursement and on the achievement of DLIs by the Permanent
       Secretary after the MTR highlighted the importance of M&E efforts. By the time of the
       MTR in 2011, training in M&E had begun to take effect, and the momentum generated by
       the Permanent Secretary further highlighted the importance of these activities. These
       improvements are demonstrated in the achievement of PDO #4.

2.3    M&E Design, Implementation and Utilization

22.     Design: M&E for the Project used existing indicators from the NAP’s framework. These
indicators were developed using the UNAIDS core indicators as guidance, with input from the
Bank team. There appeared to be some confusion over the list of 39 indicators tracked by the NAP
as some within the MOH felt their input was not taken into consideration, while others within the
NHAC did not feel they received feedback and support on which indicators were relevant for the
country. The Project design focused on regular reporting of nine KPIs as the Project’s Results
Framework.

23.      In terms of targets, the ICR mission found that initially, there was a strong feeling among
the GOB that some targets had been set too high. Had this been taken into consideration, however,
it may have led to lower targets being set, and the Project may not have had such a catalytic impact
in terms of behavior change. In general, indicators were found to be appropriate for monitoring
the key populations described in Section 1.4 of this ICR. Given the size of some target populations
(e.g. as was the case with the PMTCT indicator) it may have been preferable to measure progress
in terms of raw numbers instead of percentages.




                                                 9
24.    Implementation: Even though the Project did not regularly report on the IOIs, the Bank
monitored the achievement of the indicators listed in the entire NAP’s framework through its Aide
Memoires and in discussions with the GOB. Information from these additional indicators, where
relevant, has been used in assessing the achievement of the PDOs for the purpose of this ICR.

25.     Implementation of M&E activities was difficult at the beginning of the Project. Baseline
information was not available for the most-at-risk populations (MSM and FSW), and tracking
progress on some indicators proved to be problematic, partly because of the conservative society
in which they were measured and because comprehensive key population programming did not
exist at the time that Project implementation began. Identification and subsequent survey of the
MSM subpopulation may have also been hampered by a former member of the NHAC that later
made media statements indicating a lack of tolerance for MSM. The BSS for MSM, at the time of
Project completion, only managed to recruit 126 of an intended 400 participants.

26.     While the MOH had the M&E skills that may have helped overcome some of these
difficulties, the NHAC was unable to tap into these, likely as a consequence of poor
communication. As a result, the designated officer at the NHAC (who did not have an M&E
background) had a steep learning curve coupled with the responsibility of monitoring the 39
indicators listed in the NAP’s framework. Indicators were initially difficult to monitor, but there
was strengthened capacity and improved M&E performance during the Project, particularly
following the MTR restructuring when the MOH took over the M&E function and coordinated
with NHAC for indicators related to the non-health sector response.

27.     There were several M&E systems that the Project aimed to strengthen, namely the MHNI-
MIS, HIV/AIDS and STI Surveillance, Sero-prevalence Surveys, Knowledge, Attitudes, and
Practices (KAP) Survey, Health Facility Survey, and an Environmental Health Assessment. Given
the results-based Project design, technical reviews were also conducted by an independent agency
twice. Altogether, these activities strengthened the M&E capacity in the country. The ICR mission
found that M&E began to be seen as important by the various groups involved as the Project
progressed, and an M&E culture began to develop.

28.     NHAC placed strong emphasis on monitoring and evaluating its outputs, developed an
M&E training plan, and conducted biennial meetings to which other organizations were invited to
participate. The NHAC also strengthened capacity to the extent that it was able to take over
administration of the KABP from the MFYS in 2013; previously it had relied on the MFYS to
provide financing and manpower for the survey interviewers. Over time, there was an
improvement in M&E efforts, and surveys began to be conducted on a regular basis instead of ad-
hoc. However, a gap still exists in key epidemiological and behavioral data where MSM and FSW
are concerned.

29.      Utilization: Despite the lack of a clear data dissemination and communication plan,
utilization of M&E took place in several ways. Dissemination took place in the form of annual
reports, while monthly coordinator meetings were held to provide a forum for discussions. Biennial
research symposiums were also conducted where research and M&E information were presented.
This helped the NHAC’s partners to identify information needed for their specific programs; data



                                                10
was also used to plan programs within the various ministries. Survey results were also used
internally by partners of the NHAC to help modify their programs.

30.    Utilization of M&E data was also key to the development of the evidence-based Strategic
Plan for 2014-2018. This is discussed further in Section 3.2 of this ICR under PDO #4.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

31.    No safeguard policies were triggered by the Project.

32.     Fiduciary compliance: In addition to the difficulties in understanding the Project design
(see Section 2.2 of this ICR) and the delay or lack of financial management training to some key
Project officials, the design of the Project coupled with the difficult role played by the NHAC as
coordinator under the MFYS meant that there were some difficulties in monitoring Project
expenditures. No reporting system specifically identified HIV/AIDS-related expenses, and line
ministries with reimbursable expenditures did not always list these expenditures in an easily-
identifiable manner. Accountants for the ministries also had competing priorities and were not
always able to provide a comprehensive list of expenses related to the Project. Auditors for the
Project had to visit the different ministries and on occasion, audit reports were delayed because
they had to pull information from many different places. While challenging in terms of execution,
fiduciary compliance of the Project was moderately satisfactory. Further details on Project
Expenditures, including details of the Special Audit, are provided in Annex 13.

33.     Procurement: There were some difficulties faced with procurement at the initial stages of
the Project, which may have been compounded by the initial lack of clarity over its reimbursable
design. In particular, there was some missing information, and a lack of ownership of the
procurement plan at NHAC. The Bank provided additional training in response, suggested
improvements in coordination between procurement officers at the NHAC and the MOH’s
HIV/AIDS unit, and transferred procurement to the MOH where there was a procurement officer
familiar with the Bank’s procurement processes. It was also difficult to obtain funds for the initial
payments of goods and services, even if they were later reimbursable through the Project. In
addition to difficulties faced as a result of the financial crisis, this was due to the line item
budgeting for each Ministry defined only at one point in the year, and which required seeking
formal lengthy exceptions to access funds outside of that time period. The largest procurement
occurred for the HIS, which involved a competitive process and went smoothly.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

34.     The National Strategic Plan of Barbados 2005-2025 has as Goal 3 the continued reduction
in the spread of HIV/AIDS and minimization of its negative impact, improved information
systems, research, and M&E to support decision-making with respect to HIV/AIDS and the
creation of a national multi-sector HIV/AIDS Program. Thus, HIV/AIDS is seen as an important
issue in the long-term development of Barbados.

35.    The NHAC is operating after Project completion, and an evidence-based Strategic Plan has
been developed for 2014-2018. A large part of the Project involved building institutional and M&E

                                                 11
capacity for the country, both within and beyond the HIV/AIDS program. This is expected to be
sustainable given that coordination between the different agencies and M&E capacity has
improved during the course of the Project.

36.    The rollout of additional modules of the HIS continues to take place. The HIS collects
information beyond HIV/AIDS and comes with a 5-year warranty which will be useful for
troubleshooting and refinement as it is being deployed around the island.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

37.     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation is thus rated as Substantial. The
Project’s objectives remain highly relevant and aligned with Barbados’ efforts to address
HIV/AIDS. While the Bank does not have a Country Assistance Strategy for Barbados, there is a
Regional Partnership Strategy for the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States. The issue of
HIV/AIDS continues to be highlighted as one of importance in the Regional Partnership Strategy.
In addition, the continued relevance of the Project (which was aimed at supporting the 2008-2013
National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan) and of HIV/AIDS in Barbados, is seen in the development of
an evidence-based Strategic Plan for 2014-2018. HIV/AIDS continues to be seen as a significant
economic issue, and there continues to be room for improvement in the area of discrimination and
stigma. As of the February 2015 ICR mission, the NHAC has been invited by Cabinet to present
an expanded role for itself that would allow it to build on its success in addressing HIV/AIDS and
focus on BCC in the context of other areas of health, such as Non-Communicable Diseases
(NCDs).

38.     The design and implementation of the Project continue to be highly relevant. The focus on
key populations continues to be appropriate given the concentrated nature of the epidemic, and the
strategies employed to address the epidemic within these key populations continue to be seen as
suitable. Successful implementation of the Project required close collaboration between the NHAC
and the MOH, which was not included as part of the original Project design, but will continue to
be important going forward.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

39.     Barbados has seen substantial progress in its HIV/AIDS program from the time this Project
began. While baseline indicators for some KPIs were already impressive at the beginning of the
Project, they continued to show further improvement. As the Bank was the primary agency that
provided funds for the NAP during the course of the Project, achievement of the PDOs can be
considered attributable mostly due to efforts made by the GOB and the Bank.

40.     Achievement of the PDOs are based on the original nine KPIs included in the PAD and
legal agreement, three new KPIs included at the time of the ICR as well as IOIs included in the
PAD. A summary of the indicators is presented below to provide an overview of Project
achievements.

41.   Results against each PDO sub-objective are described below, with additional evidence to
demonstrate achievement of such sub-objectives included where relevant.

PDO sub-objective 1: To increase adoption of safe behaviors, in particular amongst key
populations at higher risk. Rating: Substantial.

•     KPI #1: Percentage of young women and men 15-24 years indicating sexual relations as a way
      of transmitting HIV. Surpassed
•     KPI #2: Percentage of female sex workers reporting the use of a condom with their most recent
      client. Unknown
•     KPI #3: Percentage of men reporting the use of a condom the last time they had sex with a
      male partner. Not Achieved
•     KPI #4: Percentage of young men and women aged 15-24 years reporting the use of a condom
      the last time they had sex with non-marital non-cohabitating sexual partner. Surpassed
•     KPI #11: Percentage of young women and men aged 15-24 who have had sexual intercourse
      before the age of 15. Achieved
•     KPI #12: Percentage of MSM who received an HIV test in the last 12 months and who know
      their results. Surpassed
•     IOI #1: Number of targeted intervention programs for key populations at higher risk. Surpassed

42.    Adoption of safe behaviors was observed where high-risk sex was concerned.
Improvements in condom use when having sex with a non-marital non-cohabitating sexual partner
(KPI #4), and a decline in the proportion having sex with non-regular partners (from 29.4% in
2009 to 12.8% in 2013) was seen. A decline in the proportion of youth 15-24 having sex before
the age of 15 (KPI #11) was also observed. The adult KABP survey also revealed an increase in
condom use among those with 2+ partners from 52.4% in 2009 to 72.6% in 2013; among those
with non-regular partners, these figures were 80% to 86.2% for the same time frame. Consistent
condom use was found to increase with non-regular partners from 48.6% in 2009 to 54.5% in 2013.

43.     An increase in knowledge was also observed among youth and MSM. Almost all youth
surveyed identified sexual relations as a way of transmitting HIV (KPI #1), exceeding the target.
In addition, all MSM surveyed in 2013 and 2014 who received an HIV test in the last 12 months
knew their results, an impressive achievement from a baseline of 50% in 2009.

44.    An increase in targeted intervention programs was seen over the course of the Project,
which likely contributed to the increase in safe behaviors in the youth and MSM populations. The


                                                 13
number of targeted intervention programs for key populations at higher risk increased from 2 in
2008 to 52 in just four years (IOI #1).

45.     Of the three key populations measured by the KPIs, namely youth, MSM, and FSW, the
Project appears to have had a particularly strong impact on youth. Estimates from the PAD place
the youth population at 12.3% of the total population, while the MSM and FSW populations are
estimated at 1% and 0.6-2.24%, respectively.

Specific PDO Target #2: To increase access to prevention, treatment and social care, in
particular for key populations at higher risk. Rating: Substantial.
   • KPI#5: Percent of most at-risk populations (SW and MSM) reached with HIV prevention
       services. Achieved
   • KPI#6: Percentage of identified HIV-positive pregnant women who gave birth in the last
       12 months receiving a complete course of ARV to reduce MTCT. Achieved
   • KPI #7: Percentage of people living with HIV on first line antiretroviral regimen achieving
       virologic success within the first 6 months of treatment. Surpassed
   • KPI #10: Percent of infants born to HIV-infected mothers who are infected. Surpassed
   • IOI #3: Number of PLHIV and/or families accessing the Food Bank. Surpassed
   • IOI #4: Number of CSOs working with most-at-risk populations. Surpassed

46.     A large increase was seen in the percentage of MSM and SW reached by HIV prevention
services (KPI #5). In addition, KPI #6 rates were 87.5% (2009), 92.0% (2010), 100% (2011), 100%
(2012), and 90.9% 8 (2013). Achievement of the PMTCT coverage at 100% for two years of the
Project and of having zero HIV-positive births for the first four years of the Project (KPI #10) was
a notable accomplishment that would have set an example in the region if had it been maintained.
Given the small denominator, it may have been better to monitor PMTCT coverage through raw
figures, and not through percentages given that the occurrence of a single case could deviate the
numbers substantially. As a result of the use of percentages, the 2013 outcomes for KPI #6 appear
to decline by almost 10%, caused by two cases of identified HIV-positive pregnant women failing
to complete ARVs.

47.     The Project was successful in improving treatment outcomes among PLHIV (KPI #7).
Using a definition of <50 copies/ml for virologic success, 70.1% of this group achieved treatment
success. When the criteria was relaxed to <1000 copies/ml within 12 months of treatment, in line
with the World Health Organization (WHO) Early Warning Indicator #8, virologic success was
achieved by 92.5% of the group. As the focus was on maintenance, it is also important to note that
achievement of virologic success based on the WHO Early Warning Indicator #8 (in line with
international standards), was obtained among >80% of the group throughout the duration of the
Project. Close to US$10 million was spent on ARVs throughout the duration of the Project, helping
to ensure free treatment for those in need. The improvement in treatment outcomes reflects the
result of this investment.


8
  A detailed review was conducted by the Project team of the missed cases which revealed several systemic issues:
(i) the rapid HIV tests performed in labor did not provide the result prior to delivery; (ii) the results of previous HIV
tests in other facilities within the health system were not recorded or available to the ANC staff; and (iii) patients
reported stigma as a barrier to early access to care.

                                                           14
48.      Evidence of increased access to social care is available using several measures. An increase
in the number of CSOs working with key populations (IOI #4) was seen over the course of the
Project. 21 CSOs were working with key populations in 2013, and 16 in 2014 – both substantial
increases from a baseline of 2. Of the 34 projects for which CSOs received funding, 27 projects
were conducted by CSOs new to working on HIV/AIDS. 25 projects were fully implemented;
these projects targeted 7 population groups, such as youth (15 projects), persons with disabilities
(2 projects), men who have sex with men/sex workers (6 projects), the general population (2
projects), and ex-offenders, PLHIV, and the elderly, all of which had one project each. Some of
these CSOs, which received funds through the CSO grant system, such as the Family Care
Foundation used funds to provide 46 PLHIV with training that improved their life skills, while
Jabez House, which had not been involved in HIV/AIDS work prior to the Project, trained more
than 75 female sex workers in alternative employment skills, such as hairdressing and business
development. The total number of persons reached by the CSOs were 535. In addition, the number
of PLHIV and/or their families accessing the Food Bank (IOI #3) went from 250 at baseline to a
total of 474 in 2013 - 313 receiving hampers and 161 receiving nutritional counseling.

Specific PDO Target #3: To increase capacity of organizational and institutional structures
that govern the NAP. Rating: High
   • KPI #8: Amount of funds spent by CSOs under results-based agreements 9 (baseline: $0 as
       of 2007; target: US$150,000 in 2014). Surpassed.
   • IOI #2: Number of health care providers trained in HIV testing and counseling according
       to national standards (baseline: 115 in 2006; target: 250 by 2013). Surpassed

49.     An increase in capacity was observed through the activities of CSOs in the country and in
the increased number of health providers trained according to national standards. Based on a desk
review of the Grant Monitoring Reports conducted by NHAC, a total of US$186,848.00 was spent
by CSOs under results-based agreements by 2014 (KPI #8). As an increase in spending does not
necessarily translate to an increase in capacity, additional data is provided to support this PDO.
First, an increase in the number of CSOs in general and in the number of CSOs working with key
populations was seen as discussed under PDO #3. More than fifty strategic partners were trained
in HIV work planning and program development, and over half the line ministries submitted work
plans in line with national guidelines. The number of institutions that incorporated M&E
components into their work plans increased from 8 in 2006 to 27 in 2014. In addition, the NHAC
was able to take over the administration of the KABP survey from the MFYS as a result of their
improved capacity. Finally, an assessment of the CSO Grant System showed improved proposal
writing skills among the 19 CSOs who received training on proposal development.

50.     Improvements in data quality demonstrating increase in capacity were also observed and
are discussed further under PDO #4.

          125 additional people to be trained by 2013). Surpassed

51.     A National Strategic Plan for 2014-2018 (KPI #9), which is strongly evidence-based, has
been finalized and is currently being disseminated. This Strategic Plan incorporates information
from a wide consultative process, epidemiological data, KABP reports, the previous strategic plan,
results from the stigma and discrimination survey, the two M&E assessments (conducted in 2008
and 2013), the CSO grant system consultant report, and the Virtual Health Research Unit (VHRU).

52.    The evidence base used to generate the Strategic Plan was possible due to the quality data
produced through the Project. For example, the Project supported development of the VHRU,
which is accessible to researchers, students, and nongovernmental organizations, and comprises
more than 5,000 scientific publications and reports on HIV in Barbados and the Caribbean. Project
funds were used to conduct M&E training for 683 people (IOI #5), through which the importance
of M&E became clear and data entry began to increase as did the number of institutions
incorporating M&E components into their work plans (PDO #3). Project funds were also used for
the development of a HIS at the national level. This system includes a module on HIV/AIDS, but
also includes other modules relevant to the healthcare system of Barbados. As a result, it is
expected that it will be widely used going forward, resulting in an increase in quality data.

53.   Given the Substantial rating for PDO#1, Substantial rating for PDO #2 and the High rating
for PDO#3 and #4, the overall Efficacy of the Project is rated as Substantial.

3.3       Efficiency

54.     Investments in prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS have been established to be highly
cost-effective. The ICR includes an economic and financial analysis comparing the with- and
without-Project scenarios. This analysis focuses on cases of HIV/AIDS averted, and not on the
beneficial effects of providing treatment or social care to PLHIV, or on improvements in the health
system which the Project also supported. Without the Project, it is estimated that the incidence rate
in 2014 would be 0.64 per 1000 population. However, with the Project, the incidence rate for 2014,
calculated using the reported number of new cases until 2012, is 0.49 per 1000 population. Cost-
benefit calculations assuming the average annual cost of treatment and care as listed in the PAD
of $7,510 and a conservative life expectancy after diagnosis of 10 years reveal that the dollar cost
for each HIV infection averted is $167,027.68 and $4,912.58 for each year of life saved. The total
benefits of the Project based on reductions in incidence until 2014 is estimated to be US$123
million. Using figures from 2013, based on data until 2008 (provided by the GOB) for the average
annual cost of treatment of $4,054 results in total benefits that are marginally lower at US$116
million. Calculations based on the cost of ARVs and average number of PLHIV over the duration
of the Project indicate that the cost of ARVs alone per person per year was $800. 10

55.     The comprehensive approach used by the Project to address HIV/AIDS also resulted in an
overall strengthening of the health system which is vital to the sustainability of preventing,
diagnosing and treating conditions such as HIV/AIDS over time and which will benefit the entire

10
  Total amount spent on ARVs was US$9,565,115 over ~six years (duration of the Project) for the treatment of
~2,000 PLHIV. This is equivalent to ~$800/person/year or $66/person/month.

                                                       16
population over the long run as well. A comprehensive list of the outputs generated through the
Project is provided in Annex 2, most of which involved improving M&E capacity, strengthening
primary health care, changing behaviors, and strengthening institutions. The project was also fully
disbursed, having been extended only once for 1 year. Therefore, on balance, investments in
prevention and treatment, as well as in the health sector were efficient.

56.     Despite the inherent substantial efficiency of interventions carried out under the project, it
must be noted that given the size of the loan (US$35 million) and the size of the Barbadian
population (277,000), achievements made under the project could have been much more
significant. In particular, funds could have been used to finance: (i) improved monitoring of
pregnant women to achieve a sustained rate of 100% PMTCT; and (ii) additional surveys among
the high-risk populations which would have yielded a deeper understanding of the epidemic (such
as the demographics and transmission information about new cases of HIV/AIDS) to enable an
even more successful program and Project outcome. With this untapped potential in mind, overall
Efficiency of the Project is considered to be Modest.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Overall, the Project is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on its Substantial ratings for Relevance
and Efficacy, and a modest rating for Efficiency.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
While the Project did not result in measurable improvements in terms of poverty impacts and
gender aspects, it did result in social development in several areas. First, the Project resulted in the
provision of additional social care to key populations as detailed in Section 3.2, PDO #2. Second,
comparative analysis of data from nationally representative surveys conducted in 2011 and 2014
on Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices on HIV-related Stigma and Discrimination among
Barbadians ages 18 to 64 towards PLHIV, persons in same sex relationships and sex workers (SW)
revealed slightly greater acceptance of these groups in 2014. Some highlights include an increase
in persons disagreeing with the idea they would be ashamed if someone in their family had HIV
(74.1% in 2011; 77.3% in 2014), an increase in the proportion of persons who would be willing to
associate with friends who were sex workers (51.1% in 2011; 57.9% in 2014) and a decline in
those who believe the sexual promiscuity of male homosexuals is the reason for HIV (23.7% in
2011; 18.7% in 2014). These results, however, should be interpreted with caution given the lack
of information on whether the improvements observed from 2011 to 2014 were statistically
significant.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening
The Project had a substantial impact on the institutional capacity and multisectoral coordination
capacity of the NHAC and on building capacity within CSOs. These achievements are discussed
in Sections 2.2, 2.5, and 3.2.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
       N/A

                                                  17
4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes
       Rating: Negligible to Low

57.     The risk to development outcome for this Project is negligible to low. The NHAC is
expected to continue its work, and an evidence-based Strategic Plan for 2014-2018 has been
developed. The Project strengthened overall capacity, improved the multisectoral response and
advanced monitoring and evaluation efforts, increasing the likelihood of technical sustainability.
Given these improvements as well as the achievements of the Project, the risk to development
outcome is low. As of February 2015, the NHAC has been invited by Cabinet to present an
expanded role for itself that would allow it to focus on BCC in areas beyond HIV/AIDS, such as
NCDs, indicating political and institutional sustainability. Financial sustainability is also
promising - the NHAC recently presented its budget to the Cabinet, which is thought to be
sufficient to continue prevention, treatment, and care efforts that were made through the Project.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

58.     The PAD was very detailed, and the Project used an innovative financing mechanism7 and
a comprehensive approach to achieving the PDOs. The Bank provided useful support where
achievement of the PDOs were concerned, and managed to add value in several key areas
highlighted in Section 2.2 of this document. Project preparation went smoothly, and the Project
scope managed to further Goal 3 of National Strategic Plan 2005-2025. The First HIV/AIDS
Project in Barbados was rated as Moderately Satisfactory by the Bank’s Independent Evaluation
Group, and institutional and implementation arrangements that were in place for the First Project
were transferred over to the Second Project. However, the size and scope of the Second Project
were very different than that of the First Project. Consequently, the Project faced challenges where
implementation was concerned. Despite detailed attention to Project design, implementation
arrangements did not fully address capacity gaps that were acknowledged by the Bank (see
Implementation Challenges highlighted in Section 2.2 for further detail on these difficulties).
Improvement in capacity was indeed one of the Project PDOs, but the lack of capacity at entry and
in Project design was only openly addressed in the restructuring conducted after the MTR. The
reimbursable expenditures design of the Project proved to be a challenge to implement due to a
lack of understanding over its complex design, and due to difficulties in identifying funding as
detailed in Section 2.4 of this document.

59.     Nonetheless, the Bank did provide assistance that added value to the Project, and
restructured the Project to address these gaps in capacity after the MTR. These changes resulted
in a substantial improvement to the Project, and also managed to result in building capacity in line
ministries (NHAC and MOH) and in technical aspects such as M&E.




                                                18
(b)    Quality of Supervision
       Rating: Satisfactory

60.     The concerns about gaps in capacity were echoed in the ISRs. In addition to the gaps in
capacity described above, the complex Project design where reimbursement was concerned was
not fully understood by many at the beginning of the Project. This was despite the fiduciary
workshop and financial management training that was attended by over 40 people. As a result,
disbursements were slow in the beginning. Some eligible expenditures were difficult to find
funding for, even if reimbursable. Difficulties in finding funding became more challenging as the
financial crisis hit. However, the Bank was responsive and the Project was restructured in order to
allow for the Bank to assume a greater proportion of the overall costs of the Project, thereby
reducing the contribution from the GOB. In total the project was restructured three times to update
the financing mechanism in response to the financial crisis, provide adjustments in implementation
structure in response to the MTR, and extend the Project in order to achieve the PDOs.

61.     In terms of the Project team, the task team leaders changed three times over the course of
the Project. Nonetheless, the final task team leader had been with the Project since the beginning,
which created continuity. The ICR mission found that the GOB was satisfied with the quality of
the technical assistance received during the course of the Project.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

62.     Quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory while quality of supervision is rated
Satisfactory. Overall Bank performance is thus rated as Moderately Satisfactory, given that there
were minor shortcomings in Quality at entry as discussed above.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.     The government performance in the first half of the Project was mainly through the NHAC.
Given their lack of capacity and the complexity of the Project, it was understandable that they
faced some challenges. Implementation functions were split between the NHAC and the MOH
after the MTR and the MOF took on an increased coordination role. It was then that the different
parts of the government came together and the strengths of each agency became apparent. The
appointment of the Project Director assisted greatly with multisectoral coordination efforts, and
with improving understanding of the Project among the different agencies. Similarly, the role of
the Permanent Secretary for Investment (under the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs) in
ensuring that the relevant officers who needed training on the reimbursement strategy of the
Project received training, and in scheduling meetings between the government representatives up
to a year in advance is laudable. The ICR mission also found that within each agency, there were
highly dedicated staff - those who were in roles beyond their areas of expertise taught themselves
the necessary skills (e.g. the M&E Specialist) or drew from their other areas of experience (the



                                                19
BCC Specialist) though they could have reached out to their counterparts in the MOH who had the
requisite skills.

64.     In general, therefore, the performance on the government’s side is considered Moderately
Satisfactory.

(b)       Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
          Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.     Up until the first half of the Project, the main implementing agency was the NHAC. The
NHAC lacked the capacity and technical expertise to hit the ground running, given the increased
scale and scope of the Project compared to the First HIV/AIDS Project and the lack of a transition
plan. After the midterm review, the MOF and MOH took over some responsibilities – MOF took
on an increased coordination role to support disbursement and financial management functions
and the MOH took over the procurement, monitoring and evaluation and supervision functions.
This separation of responsibilities resulted in an improvement in implementation.

(c)       Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
          Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.     Government performance was Moderately Satisfactory, and the Moderately Satisfactory
rating of the implementing agency is partly due to a lack of transitional arrangements from the
First Project.

6.        Lessons Learned
      •   Greater attention needs to be paid to implementation capacity at project outset, beyond the
          successful completion of a previous project. Implementation capacity assessments should
          also include an evaluation of project staff relative to project scope, and a skills assessment
          of staff needed to conduct key tasks.
      •   A better training process for financial management and procurement is necessary in the
          context of complex project design. It would be good to provide training in a timely fashion,
          and refresher training sessions when there are significant changes to project staff. Task
          teams should provide frequent and varied training opportunities to address these
          challenges.
      •   Projects where countries are reimbursed for eligible expenses should look into difficulties
          with the project design in the event of slow disbursement at the beginning of the project.
          Slow disbursement may be a result of a lack of understanding of eligible expenses or
          project design, or of financial difficulties in raising funds to make payments, even if they
          are reimbursed at a later date.
      •   Greater cultural consideration should be given when designing project activities and targets
          for indicators. Marginalization and stigma may also impede implementation, such as de-
          emphasis of certain key populations among other more acceptable groups, reluctance for
          surveys of these groups to take place, and poor outcomes due to late presentation to
          treatment and care.



                                                   20
     •   When developing indicators focused on small populations, it may be better to monitor
         achievements based on actual figures instead of/or in addition to percentages, as a change
         in n=1 could have a substantial impact in percentage terms.

   •   Adoption of safe behaviors, in particular amongst key populations at higher risk.
   •   Access to prevention, treatment and social care, in particular for key populations at higher
       risk.
   •   Capacity of organizational and institutional structures that govern the NAP.
   •   Use of quality data for problem identification, strategy definition and measuring results.

3.       The first component, which received slightly over $30 million of the $35 million budget,
focused on HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care delivered through the healthcare system,
while the remaining budget of $3.6 million was spent on the second component which focused on
institutional strengthening. While it is commonly recommended when evaluating project benefits
that cost-benefit analyses use with- and without-project scenario when calculating key HIV
indicators. Doing so in the context of the without-project scenario is difficult as it is impossible to
measure the number of people who may have contracted the disease had the Project not been
implemented or if other efforts had been put into place. In addition, the small population size of
Barbados means that HIV incidence data is difficult to collect among key populations of interest.
Reported surveillance data in these populations may not be representative, and as a result, may not
reflect the true number of cases. Further, such an evaluation may underestimate the global and
regional public good nature of the Project, which was a theme consistently emphasized during
Project preparation.

4.       At the time of Project preparation, there were concerns about a growing epidemic in the
Caribbean, which had a prevalence rate of 1.5% in 2005. The MTR of the First Bank-financed
Project indicated that Barbados may see the number of PLHIV grow to 2,900 in 2010 and 4,000
in 2015. With the adoption of generic compounds that were available on the market for patients
initiating antiretroviral treatment, the annual cost of drugs may have increased from US$2 million
in 2007 to US$8 million in 2015.

5.     Comparatively, the Global AIDS Response Progress Report 2012 reported the number of
PLHIV at the end of 2010 at 1,918, approximately 1,000 less than anticipated at the time of the
MTR of the First Project which was cited in the PAD. In addition, a report on the Economic Impact
Analysis of the HIV Epidemic in Barbados for 1984-2008, completed in 2013 and submitted to
the Ministry of Health, reports that HIV prevalence rate in the general population has been under

                                                  29
1% since 1999. However, projections made for 2009-2015 indicate an increase in prevalence above
1% in the population aged 15-49 years old.

6.      Figure 1 shows the annual number of reported HIV and AIDS cases and deaths among
PLHIV prior to the implementation of the Second HIV/AIDS Project (1984-2008). The number of
HIV and AIDS cases remained high, though mortality among PLHIV appeared to be decreasing.
Data in Figure 2 shows the first four years of the Project (2009-2012) – a decrease is seen
particularly in HIV and AIDS cases in the first year, and this decrease seems to have been
maintained until 2012. Incidence data on 2013 and 2014 was not available at the time of this ICR.

7.     Cost-effectiveness calculations for the direct benefits of the Project are provided in the
following sections. Where data was not available, simulations were made. The assumptions and
simulations are as follows:

     •   Population figures until 2012 come from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators
     •   HIV case data until 2012 for the with-project scenario comes from the Global AIDS
         Response, Country Progress Report Barbados 2014; data for 2013 and 2014 are linearly
         projected
     •   HIV case data for the without-project scenario are linearly extrapolated for 2009-2014
         using HIV rates from 2000 onward
     •   An averted infection provides an individual with thirty-four more years of productive life
         which is simply the pension age (66) minus average age of HIV infection – latest available
         data from Global AIDS Response Progress Report 2014 for 2012 suggests that the median
         age is 32
     •   Average working individual productivity is US$15,116 per year using GDP per capita for
         2008 as a proxy for productivity (in 2000 constant USD)
     •   An infected patient will live for 10 years 11 after infection with adequate care
     •   The average annual cost of care per patient after infection with adequate care is assumed
         at US$7,510 (based on a cost study cited in the PAD), and includes pharmaceuticals, labor,
         infrastructure, overhead and other materials
     •   Benefits accrue five years after the infection has been averted for the disease to progress
         and translate into productivity losses and health care costs for the individual

8.     The analysis below is for the entire population as age-specific incidence rates are not
available for multiple years. Table 1 shows the estimated number of new infections in the context
of a without-project scenario. Based on these figures, we see that the incidence rate would have
been 0.55-0.66 per 1000 from 2009-2014 in the absence of the Project.

   Exact figures for Barbados are not available, but figures from one study (The ART Cohort Collaboration. The
Antiretroviral Cohort Collaboration. Life expectancy of individuals on combination therapy in high-income
countries: a collaborative analysis of 14 cohort studies. The Lancet 372: 293 – 299, 2008) suggests that the average
number of years remaining to be lived at age 20 years was about two-thirds of that in the general population. Life
expectancy for Barbados at the time of Project initiation was approximately 75 years, meaning that those receiving
treatment at age 20 could expect to live for 30 years. However, we use the conservative figure of 10 years here to
account for the fact that ~55% of those diagnosed in 2012 (latest estimates) are diagnosed with low CD4 counts
(<350 cells/mm3).

9.      With-project scenario indicators are listed in Table 2. With the project, we see that the
incidence rate per 1000 is 0.50 or lower. Thus, the incidence rate observed is reduced by about a
third in the with-project scenario.

10.     Averted HIV infections and years of life saved are summarized in Table 3. This is the
difference between the newly infected cases in the with- and without-project scenarios. Years of
life saved is the number of infections averted multiplied by the increased productive life caused
by the Project, which is assumed to be 34 years. Project benefits are calculated based on infections
averted. Benefits include averted productivity losses as well as the cost of treatment of HIV/AIDS
and related illnesses, assumed to be US$7,510 per patient per year.

preferable to focus on the impact of specific components, attribution of results by component is
difficult to make, and would likely have resulted in double counting.

12.     Figures listed in Table 3 only include infections averted until 2014, and do not take indirect
benefits into consideration. The economic and financial analysis in the PAD estimate that 283
cases of AIDS would be prevented by 2014; here the figure is 210 using more recent data, where
available. Further, the total Project expenditures ended up 20% lower than originally planned, thus
a 25% reduction in the number of prevented cases can be considered acceptable. It is important to

  Total averted cost of care is calculated to be US$8,494,999 if the cost of treatment per patient per year is
calculated at US$4,054, the most recent figure available from the GOB. This results in a reduction in total benefits
of the Project to US$116,189,964.

also note that total benefits are likely to be an underestimate given that averted cost of care is
calculated based on average life expectancy of 10 years after diagnosis.11

13.     An Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 38.8% was calculated for the Project. The net present
value (NPV) focusing on HIV infections averted is US$31.28 million assuming a 10% discount
rate. Cost-effectiveness of the Project is based on the dollar cost of each infection averted and each
year of life saved. Calculations using the data above find that the dollar cost for each HIV infection
averted is US$167,027.68 and US$4,912,58 for each year of life saved.

14.     The NPV increases as the average life expectancy after diagnosis increases, and decreases
as the cost of treatment declines. Assuming a 20 year life expectancy, the NPV increases to $38.01
million. When a 20 year life expectancy is assumed and the average cost of treatment/person/year
is reduced to $4,054, the NPV is US$31.81 million.

1.   Background
     For the period 2008 to 2013, the aim of Barbados’ National AIDS Programme (NAP) was
     the mitigation of the social and economic impact of HIV and AIDS on the population. This
     goal was outlined in its National Strategic Plan for HIV Prevention and Control, 2008 –
     2013, and the associated programmes and activities were estimated to cost USD $94.39
     million (BDS$188.78 million)over the five-year period. The implementation of the NAP
     required multi-sectoral involvement and the National HIV/AIDS Commission (NHAC)
     was identified as the coordinating body.
     In 2008, the Government of Barbados negotiated a sector investment loan of USD $35.0
     million (BDS $70 million) from the World Bank to execute the Second HIV/AIDS Project
     which would finance a percentage of the eligible expenditures under the NAP and provide
     technical assistance and training to support the implementation of the Programme.

2.   Project Description
     This was the second Project with the World Bank and it sought to build on the successes
     in access to HIV testing, treatment and care which had been accomplished under the first
     Barbados HIV/AIDS Project (2001 – 2007). Specific priorities included strengthening HIV
     prevention programming and introducing behavior change communication. The second
     Project commenced on September 25, 2008 (date of loan signature) and was originally
     scheduled to close on November 30, 2013.

     (i)    Project Objectives
            The Project aimed specifically to increase:
               • Adoption of safe behaviors, in particular amongst key populations at higher
                   risk;
               • Access to prevention, treatment and social care, in particular for key
                   populations at higher risk;
               • Capacity of organizational and institutional structures that govern the NAP;
                   and
               • Use of quality data for problem identification, strategy definition and
                   measuring results.

     (ii)   Project Components
            The project comprised two (2) components as follows:

            Component 1 – Prevention and Care (USD $31.412 million/BDS$62.824 million)
            Loan funding under this component was pooled with government funding to
            finance national programme activities. In its entirety, it was estimated to cost USD
            $89.65 million (BDS $179.30 million) to fund the national programme over the
            period of the Project. The Project loan would finance USD $31.412 million (BDS
            $62.824 million) of this category of expenditure. The Eligible Expenditure
            Programmes were as follows:


                                             39
                •   National Programme Coordination and Monitoring. This aimed to
                    strengthen the ability of the public and private sectors and civil society to
                    coordinate, monitor and evaluate their activities and use data to continually
                    increase the quality of their programmes. The Public Sector – Civil Society
                    Organization (CSO) Grant System was to be developed under the Project.
                •   Scaling up Prevention Efforts. This aimed at increasing access to
                    prevention services, particularly Behaviour Change Communication, HIV
                    and Sexual Transmitted Infections (STIs) prevention and treatment, and
                    condom marketing and distribution, with a special focus on key populations
                    at higher risk.
                •   Improving Diagnosis, Treatment and Care. This programme sought to
                    increase the length and quality of life of PLHIV by increasing their access
                    to diagnostic services, treatment services, as well as social care and support.

            Component 2 – Institutional Strengthening (USD $3.5 million /BDS $ 7.0 million)
            This component focused on institutional strengthening and loan funding was
            disbursed against approved contracts. The Project loan would finance USD $3.5
            million (BDS $7.0 million) of this category of expenditure. Under the NAP, this
            component was estimated to cost USD $4.47 million(BDS $8.94 million) and
            aimed to strengthen agencies and CSOs through training and technical assistance
            in monitoring and evaluation (M&E), management, surveillance, prevention,
            diagnosis, as well as treatment and care of HIV and other STIs.

3.   Project Restructuring
     The Project has been restructured twice throughout the five year Project period; July 19,
     2011 and March 5, 2013.
     The first restructuring was done to allow the project funds to finance the development and
     implementation of a HIS, amend the performance indicators by modifying the wording of
     all nine performance indicators to make the targets easily identifiable, technically refining
     indicators to improve clarity of the definitions and revising the targets, and to allow for
     increased percentage reimbursement of Component 2 expenditures for goods and
     consultants’ services from 79% to 100%.
     The second restructuring was done to modify the institutional arrangements to strengthen
     leadership and capacity, amend four of the performance indicators by changing the final
     target year for three indicators from 2012 to 2013 and by changing the target for another,
     and to allow for an increase in percentage reimbursement of Category 1 Eligible
     Programme Expenditures (EPE) to be financed by the loan from 35% to 65%.

4.   Extension of the Terminal Disbursement Date
     An extension of the terminal disbursement date for the Loan was granted by one year until
     November 30, 2014, to allow time to achieve the Project Development Objectives (PDOs)
     and complete agreed activities.




                                              40
5.     Assessment of the Project
       As the Project comes to an end it is important to determine if the project has achieved the
       project objectives, if the project design was appropriate to achieve the desired effect, if the
       implementation of the project was successful and to describe the operational experience.
       Three types of indicators were used for monitoring and evaluation: (i) project development
       indicators (input, process, and output) to measure progress towards achievement of the
       Project Development Objectives (PDO); (ii) project results indicators that would trigger
       disbursements; and (iii) project monitoring indicators to measure progress in project
       implementation. These were considered in the Government’s assessment of the Project.

         (i)    Project Objectives
               Below is a table showing the Project Development Indicators which were used to
               monitor the achievement of the PDOs, the results which were achieved and
               comments.

      (ii)     Project Design
              The project design could have focused more on specific definitions to avoid
              ambiguity. For example the Project Development Objectives were broad and left
              open to interpretation making it difficult to determine which expenditures were
              eligible for reimbursement and which were not.

              As a result of the original loan structure, the interpretation of the expenditure
              eligible for reimbursement, and the low reimbursement percentage (35% for
              Component 1 and 79% for Component 2) it would not have been possible to have
              loan funds fully disbursed by the original terminal disbursement date of November
              30, 2013. It was therefore necessary to restructure the Loan twice to meet required
              expenditure.
              The original scope of the Project was overly ambitious and an assessment revealed
              that it would not have been possible to implement all of the activities in a five year
              period. For example the original Project included a National HIV Seroprevalence
              Study, for which USD$1.123 million (BDS $2.246 million) was earmarked. This
              study was later found not to be feasible based on the following:
                  • Barbados’ epidemic did not meet the criteria for such a study (i.e. HIV
                       prevalence <5%)
                  • The sample size required was large and logistically impossible (≈50, 000
                       persons)

               Projections of the number of PLHIV were over inflated and this resulted in an
              overestimation of funds required for the purchase of ARVs for the duration of the
              Project. The funds were subsequently reallocated.

      (iii)    Project Implementation & Operational Experience
              Project Implementation was hindered because of the governance structure. A mixed
              model existed, preventing rationale use of resources and reducing cost efficiency.
              The Coordinating Unit was also not adequately staffed to fulfil its function.

6.   Project Achievements of the Government of Barbados
     A major achievement of the Project was its ability to draw down on the full amount of the
     loan (US$35 Million, BD$70 Million) despite low spend in the early stages of the Project
     and the prevailing economic environment throughout the Project.
     Following is a summary of achievements over the life of the Project.
     Behavior Change
       (i) Successful completion of the 2011 survey on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and
            practices of the general population relating to Stigma & Discrimination. Data
            collected showed a decrease in the Stigma and Discrimination towards key
            populations.
       (ii) Successful completion of 2013-2014 of Adult Knowledge, Attitudes, Beliefs and
            Practices Survey. Data collected was used to report on the indicators (see
            assessment of project objectives above) and identified programme gaps.




                                               43
        (iii) The Behavioral Surveillance Survey among MSM provided valuable behavioral
              and biological baseline information on this hard to reach population. The
              information acquired will inform planning for prevention and care services.
        (iv) International Best Practice has been achieved with the successful development and
              implementation of a Behavior Change Communication Programme in the Barbados
              Defense Force.
        (v) An effective collaborative effort by stakeholders to produce and implement the
              2010 National HIV Prevention Plan.
        (vi) The future work in Barbados to address issues and sustain the National HIV
              Programme will have effective guidelines, policies and procedures which have
              been articulated in the 2014-2018 National Strategic Plan for HIV 2014-2018:
              Investing for Results.

      Access to Prevention, Treatment and Social Care
       (i)     Successful development & implementation of stigma and discrimination reduction
               campaigns.
       (ii) Increase in anti-stigma and discrimination programming.
       (iii) Implementation of a strong Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT)
              Programme that has reduced rates of mother to child transmission in keeping with
              international best practices.
       (iv) Expansion of the HIV Testing and Counselling Programme including the
              introduction of Provider Initiated Testing and Counselling (PITC) at all Polyclinics
              as well as the introduction of rapid HIV testing at two (2) polyclinic sites, the
              Ladymeade Reference Unit and select community testing events.
       (v) Accessed members of the MSM population who would not ordinarily receive HTC
              services, and increased access to care through the conduct of the Survey among
              MSM.
       (vi) Achievement of Millennium Development Goal 6a, to halt and reverse the spread
              of HIV as evidenced by a decline in new HIV infections in Barbados.
       (vii) Achievement of Millennium Development Goal 6b, universal access to treatment
              for HIV, with more than 80% antiretroviral treatment coverage throughout the life
              of the Project.
       (viii) Decline in AIDS cases (104 in 2008 to 78 in 2012) and mortality rates (2.4% in
              2008 to 1.5 % in 2012).
       (ix) Achievement of the targets set for the PAHO Elimination Initiative as evidenced
              by a mother to child HIV transmission rate of less than 2% and no reported cases
              of congenital syphilis for more than 4 years.
       (x) Initiation of decentralization of HIV treatment services at two (2) pilot sites.
       (xi) Strengthening Support for People Living with HIV (multi-sectoral approach)
                  a. Conduct of Housing Needs Assessment
                  b. Prioritisation of PLHIV Housing Needs

National AIDS Programme Capacity
        (i) Development and implementation of the Public Sector-Civil Society Grant System.
        (ii) Development of greater partnerships between government and civil society
              partners.
        (iii) Expanded relationships with key populations e.g. MSM and FSW.
                                              44
         (iv) Representation of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning and Intersex
              community on the Board of the National HIV/AIDS Commission.

Monitoring and Evaluation
        (i) Development and implementation of the Monitoring and Evaluation Training Plan.
        (ii) Greater involvement and participation in monitoring and evaluation by strategic
              partners.
        (iii) Release of two (2) comprehensive HIV Surveillance Reports during the life of the
              Project.

7.     Performance of the World Bank
       It is the opinion of the Government of Barbados that the performance of the World Bank
       was as follows:
          (i) Performance during project preparation
          Bank personnel were readily available for consultation as required.
          (ii) Performance during project implementation
                    • The implementation support was generally good.
                    • The online platform required to be used for the upload and approval of
                       withdrawal applications (Client Connection) was not user friendly and
                       technical support was limited.
                    • The switch of Financial Management from Washington DC to Brazil
                       impacted negatively on Barbados’ ability to have financial matters
                       concluded. Difficulties were also experienced as a result of a language
                       barrier.
                    • There was a lack of appreciation of the cultural context in which one could
                       successfully implement programmes for MSM and FSWs in Barbados.
                       Numerous concerns were also expressed about the attempt to bring
                       ‘wholesale’ to Barbados methodologies used in other cultures without any
                       attempt to make the required adjustments.
                    • There was a lack of clarity with regard to the procedures which the
                       Government of Barbados should follow in executing contracts as it related
                       to procurement under Component 2. Procedures for seeking reimbursement
                       under Component 2 were also unclear. Requests for direction from the
                       World Bank on these matters received varied responses, during the life of
                       the Project.

8.     Challenges
       The amounts indicated in the documents of the World Bank with regards to the Loan for
       inclusion of the Estimates of Expenditure for Barbados for each Financial Year were too
       high and could not be attained by the Government of Barbados. It was therefore necessary
       to include smaller projections for each Financial Year.
       There was a delayed start to Project implementation, although approved in August 2008
       the Loan did not become effective until January 2009. In addition, the process of the first
       restructuring was somewhat protracted which hampered implementation of some activities.



                                               45
     Originally, there were too many indicators defined for the loan (45). These indicators were
     not proportionally linked to priorities for interventions and were not appropriate to measure
     the impact of the Project.
     Although 70% of the Loan was the responsibility of the Ministry of Health, the parent
     Ministry with responsibility for the Project was not the Ministry of Health.
     Poor documentation of expenditures resulted at the outset in an inability to seek
     reimbursement from the World Bank. This was rectified in the latter stages of the Project
     when reimbursement for prior year expenditures was sought.

9.   Conclusion
      (i) Lessons Learnt and Recommendations
           • The planning period with regard to loans of this nature should be extended to
              ensure that any hindrances to completion of conditions prior to first
              disbursement are addressed before loan signature.
           • Careful evaluation should be undertaken to ensure that the Project is
              manageable given the resources of Barbados.
           • Extensive review of proposed indicators should be undertaken including giving
              stakeholders an opportunity to comment and taking the cultural context into
              consideration before they are approved.
           • There should be careful evaluation of the financial requirements for inclusion
              in the Estimates of Expenditure over the life of the loan to satisfy the
              requirements in the Loan Agreement.

      (ii)   Sustainability
              • The Government of Barbados established a National AIDS Programme in
                 advance of its relationship with the World Bank, which subsequently resulted
                 in the establishment of the NHAC.
              • Having successfully implemented two loans funded by the World Bank,
                 Barbados intends to build on the successful work which has been done by
                 continuing the implementation of all activities falling under the National AIDS
                 Programme guided by the National Strategic Plan 2014-2018.

     that there could have been potential challenges.
4.   Section 1.1, paragraph 2. The Bank was the only anticipated source of external funding for
     the NAP at the time of Project preparation, however, within the first year of Project
     implementation PEPFAR funding became available within the Region and in Barbados.
     PEPFAR supported key population behavioural surveys, provided laboratory equipment,
     provided additional staff support, improved HIV case based surveillance and supported the
     initiation of rapid testing.

     HIV & STI Prevention and treatment after provision of condoms
6.   Section 2.1, paragraph 13: The environment within which the Project was designed is not
     adequately considered here. We believe that the background analysis was flawed as it was
     based on information which was not context specific. Furthermore, assumptions were made
     with respect to the key populations at higher risk based on international evidence. These
     assumptions were not necessarily translatable to the Barbados situation.

7.   Section 2.1, paragraph 15: The general tone of this paragraph is misleading as the PAD
     made no reference to the need for a standalone or discrete Project Implementation Unit.

8.   Section 2.1, paragraph 15: The quote “there needed to be a piece on transition management
     from the First to the Second Project” should be removed. A more accurate statement might
     be “greater consideration could have been given to the changes in the size and scope of the
     Second Project”. A general statement is preferable to a direct quote. Any direct quotations
     should be excluded from the document.

9.   Section 2.1, paragraph 15: Inconsistencies in the Project documents concerning
     expenditures eligible for reimbursement contributed to confusion throughout the life of the
     Project. To acquire certainty the GOB sought a formal Legal Opinion on the interpretation
     of eligible expenditure. That Opinion is attached for ease of reference.


                                             47
10.   Section 2.1, paragraph 16: The challenges referred to this paragraph were not solely due to
      the implied inability of the local project team to understanding and executing reimbursable
      expenditures but also to the 1) provision of conflicting (i.e. ambiguous) information and
      poor explanations from the World Bank team; 2) flaws in the project design relating to
      project scope and unrealistic activities; and 3) ambiguous information within the principal
      project documents.

11.   Section 2.1, paragraph 18: The rating process used seems inconsistent given that a rating
      of “low” was assigned in relation to the assessment of risks. Although the transparent
      fiduciary environment in Barbados is referred to in the PAD as a benefit, the PAD also
      acknowledged that the economy was vulnerable to external shocks particularly given high
      debt levels. Despite this the Project was given a low risk rating which in retrospect was a
      mistake. Economic impact should have been given more consideration in light of the
      economic climate at the time.

12.   Section 2.1, paragraph 18: This section is misleading – “the mitigation measures
      highlighted that the Bank would provide funding, technical assistance, and training
      for planning and M&E purposes. However, in at least one instance, training was
      provided only at the later stages of the Project when it should have been provided
      much earlier”. The mitigation measures should be stated clearly. It is not clear which
      training is referred to here. Is it training on M&E? It should be noted that little training was
      provided for M&E purposes. Also the last sentence – “However, in at least one instance,
      … earlier” - should be deleted as it adds no value to the paragraph.

13.   Section 2.2, paragraph 19. Although the multisectoral framework necessary to implement
      the Project existed at Project start, the same capacity utilized for the first project was
      erroneously expected to be sufficient for the Second Project which was of much larger size
      and scope and with a more complex design. This paragraph therefore ignores the fact that
      the institutional assessment conducted by the Bank failed to factor in the complexity of the
      Second Project relative to the First Project and failed to highlight the need for additional
      support and resources. Please delete the sentence –

14.   “Finally, as noted by the PAD, despite the existence of a multisectoral framework to
      implement the National HIV/AIDS Project, the reality was quite different on the
      ground.”

15.   Section 2.2, paragraph 19: Reference, without explanation, is made in this paragraph to a
      “lack of capacity” and “lack of technical expertise among key staff”. This needs to be
      addressed.

16.   Section 2.2, paragraph 20: The statement – “The Second Restructuring resulted in a
      turning point for the Project which had previously been facing challenges and which
      was rated Moderately Satisfactory for PDO and Moderately Unsatisfactory for IP
      after the MTR” requires evidence to support this view. The move to address the

                                                48
      underutilization of funds started before the mid-term review and was initiated by the
      NHAC with assistance solicited from the Public Investment Unit and the Director of
      Finance and Economic Affairs.

17.   Section 2.2, paragraph 20 a: This information is misleading given the role of a NHAC chair
      – “The possibility of the chair of the National HIV/AIDS Commission, who led the
      team in the implementation of the First Barbados HIV/AIDS Project, stepping down
      prior to the Second Project commencing was raised as a concern. This concern was
      heightened considering a successor would be new to the role, not carrying the
      mandate from the Prime Minister’s office, be tasked with implementing cross-
      Ministry coordination and reporting without the previous mandate, and
      implementing a new, larger-scale project with a more elaborate design.” The ICR
      should speak to the fact that the shift of the NHAC from the Prime Minister’s office resulted
      in a noticeable lack of visibility and authority which Project implementation. Past and
      present chairmen of the NHAC have never run the HIV Projects. Furthermore, the
      Chairman referred to in the aforementioned text was Special Envoy for HIV, at no time did
      this individual assume Project managerial responsibility. The section starting from “The
      possibility … new to the role”, should be deleted.

18.   Section 2.2, paragraph 20 a: With respect to the sentence, “In addition, the NHAC had
      insufficient capacity in the beginning. Staff with certain areas of technical expertise
      was needed at the NHAC, and the MOH was theoretically able to provide this
      expertise, but ended up not doing so due to a lack of coordination between the two
      agencies as a result of poorly-defined roles at the beginning of the Project.”, it should
      be noted that the Procurement Officer MOH was not assigned at the Project start. Her post
      was later added at the Bank’s recommendation. Unfortunately the need for a dedicated
      Procurement Officer had not been recognized during Project preparation.

19.   Section 2.2, paragraph 20 b: The explanation provided in this paragraph is fully supported
      by the Project team since it accurately captures and explains the basis of the
      implementation challenges.

20.   Section 2.2, paragraph 21: The involvement of the Permanent Secretary (Investment) was
      at the behest of the NHAC through the Director of Finance and Economic Affairs and
      subsequently formalized by the Prime Minister.

21.   Section 2.2, paragraph 21, Area 1: The sentence which reads “The technical expertise of
      the Project Director and those under her also meant that technical oversight could be
      provided to relevant MOH activities” is misleading and should be removed or reworded.
      The sentence currently implies that there was a lack of technical expertise at the MOH prior
      to the Project Director post.

22.   Section 2.2, paragraph 21, Area 1: It is inaccurate to say that the Project Director was
      responsible for improving multisectoral coordination and clarifying the roles and
      responsibilities of different ministries.

                                               49
23.   Section 2.2, paragraph 21, Area 2: In the following sentence – “By the time of the MTR,
      training in M&E had begun to take place, and the momentum generated by the Permanent
      Secretary further highlighted the importance of these activities.”, please change “place” to
      “effect” which would reflect the provision of M&E training since Project start.

24.   Section 2.3, paragraph 23: Since this paragraph refers to the catalytic impact on behaviour
      change, consideration should be given to raising the ICR rating to satisfactory.

25.   Section 2.3, paragraphs 25 & 26: There is a disconnect between the information presented
      in para 25 and 26. Para 25 speaks to the challenges with the BSS and para 26 loosely
      addresses the Ministry of Health’s “M&E skills which would have overcome these
      difficulties”. It is not logical for the NHAC to tap into MH’s skills for a MH activity (BSS
      MSM).

26.   Section 2.3, paragraph 25 requires clarification. The problem with tracking of key
      population indicators rested with the fact that comprehensive key population programming
      did not exist at Project outset. It was therefore very difficult to measure activities/ track
      indicators for programmes now being developed. In addition to this, as mentioned
      previously in the ICR there is a reluctance for persons to identify as MSM or FSW, which
      also hampers monitoring of access to services.

27.   Section 2.3, paragraph 26: It is inaccurate to say that M&E capacity was increased. An
      alternative statement could be “there was strengthened capacity and improved M&E
      performance during the Project”. It should be noted that coordination of indicator data
      collection was being done from the start of the project. In the latter stages of the Project
      the M&E process was further streamlined.

28.   Section 2.3, paragraph 27: The Project did not strengthen the NHAC Management
      Information System (MIS), which never materialized. The Project was supposed to develop
      a MIS for the NHAC but this was vetoed by the Bank on the premise that the NHAC could
      use the MH’s HIS which in one of its earliest iterations included a prevention component.
      As a result, these funds were diverted with World Bank approval to the development of the
      Virtual HIV Research Unit.

29.   Section 2.3, paragraph 28: This sentence on the NHAC strengthening capacity to take over
      KABP administration is incorrect and misleading. First, the Ministry of Family assumed
      responsibility for the KABP because they were conducted among youth and the youth
      portfolio was the responsibility of MFYS. The NHAC assumed responsibility for the 2013
      survey because 1) the focus was different, adults as well as youth, 2) a new methodology
      was being used and 3) as a quality control measure. In addition the core group working on
      the survey protocol and submissions included personnel from the NHAC and the Ministry
      of Health. Also the NHAC adopted the same approach to the Adult KABP as the MH to
      MSM BSS where there was outsourcing re manpower for the surveys while the financing
      was provided by the NHAC.


                                               50
30.   Section 2.3, paragraph 28: The final sentence relating to MSM and FSW epidemiological
      data needs to be in a separate paragraph as the KABP surveys were never intended to be
      the primary sources for these data.

31.   Section 2.4, paragraph 32: Contrary to the wording of this paragraph there was a well-
      defined reporting system for HIV related expenses, with a designated “head” used for all
      ministries. One major challenge was related to the definition of eligible expenditures.
      In addition accounting staff shifted throughout the Project period, there was restructuring
      of ministries, and a lack of continuity of financial management staff with institutional
      memory. Despite these challenges the Project was able to fully document all of the eligible
      expenditures identified within the closing period of the Loan. For these reasons, we believe
      that the fiduciary compliance of the Project deserves a satisfactory rating.

32.   Section 2.4, paragraph 33: There was always coordination between the NHAC Senior
      Accountant and the MH Procurement Officer irrespective of who was leading on the
      process. The comment regarding ownership of the procurement plan is immaterial since
      the procurement plan was the procurement plan of the Project.

33.   Section 2.5, paragraph 35: This paragraph implies a direct benefit to the NHAC as a result
      of implementation of the Health Information System. This is misleading given the intended
      function of the HIS which is expected to measure clinical performance and monitor health
      sector data primarily. The VHRU and its contribution to building M&E capacity should be
      highlighted here.

34.   Section 3.1, paragraph 36: Please remove the direct quotation “discrimination and stigma
      has improved but there is still a lot of work to be done”. Reference can be made to the
      evidence provided such as the data on the National Stigma and Discrimination surveys.

35.   Section 3.1, paragraph 37: - “The design and implementation of the Project continue to
      be highly relevant” – contradicts previous paragraphs on project complexity and its
      negative impact on implementation. It would be more accurate to state that the focus areas
      of the Project (which are in fact HIV Programme components) remain highly relevant i.e.
      scaling up prevention, treatment and institutional strengthening. The HIV epidemic in
      Barbados is described as a “mixed” epidemic with concentrated pockets.

36.   Section 3.2, paragraph 38: Although the Bank was the primary agency providing funds to
      the NAP during the course of the Project, it was not the only agency providing funds to the
      NAP during the course of the Project. The Ministry of Health received grant funds from
      two (2) cooperative agreements with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention within
      the Project time frame. It should be noted that credit may be given to other agencies as
      well.

37.   Section 3.2, paragraphs 40 – 52: This section could be expanded to include the efforts
      involved in the achievement of these results, the context in which these results were


                                              51
      achieved or the efforts in train to sustain these results.

38.   Section 3.2, paragraph 45: This paragraph refers to a “PMTCT rate” but is describing
      “PMTCT coverage”. The word “rate” needs to be replaced with “coverage”.

39.   Section 3.2, paragraph 48: See comment relating to Section 2.3, paragraph 28 with respect
      to the NHAC administration of the Adult KABP survey.

40.   Section 3.3, paragraphs 54 and 55: The Efficiency rating given to the Project seems to be
      based mainly on health sector performance as described in this section of the ICR.
      Paragraph 54 states that “on balance, investments in prevention and treatment, as well
      as in the health sector were efficient”. On the other hand paragraph 55 refers to
      “untapped potential” specifically with respect to PMTCT and surveys on key
      populations, resulting in a reduced rating of “modest”.

41.   This seems unfair given the favorable description put forward in paragraph 54. It also gives
      unbalanced weighting towards PMTCT and key population surveys without significant
      credit or acknowledgement being given other health related achievements such as the
      advances in HIV testing efforts and interventions, or improvements in ARV coverage
      during the Project time frame.

42.   Although the specifics of the strengthening of primary health care initiative are listed in
      Annex 2: subcomponent 1, it would be worthwhile to re-emphasize them in this section of
      the document as a positive contribution to overall Project efficiency, especially since the
      primary health care system serves the entire population of 277,000 as alluded to in
      paragraph 55.

43.   Benefits of the Project therefore went beyond the NAP and extended to the wider health
      system. Given the initial scope of the Project this was an efficient use of resources which
      allowed strengthening of the health system and potential long term impact beyond the
      original anticipated Project scope.

44.   The final Project rating should be consistent with the final ISR rating of “satisfactory”
      rather than “moderately satisfactory”.

45.   Section 3.5, paragraph (a): It is perplexing that a discussion on poverty impacts should be
      included in the ICR given WB pronouncements that the Project is not a welfare Project. In
      addition expenditures deemed to be related to poverty alleviation were explicitly rejected
      by the Bank as noted in the following statement – “Subsequent review by the Bank found
      that US$13.641 million of these expenditures did not qualify as they were purely
      poverty alleviation-related expenditures”(reference page 56 paragraph 3 lines 8 to 10).

46.   Section 5.1, paragraph 57: The inability of the Project team to understand reimbursement
      and other financial aspects despite the provision of fiduciary and financial management
      training begs the question of the training’s relevance to the Project’s needs. Training was
      conducted on a large scale only at the start of the Project in October 2008 with over 30

                                                 52
      people being trained. The fact that such large numbers were trained discounts the fact that
      government restructuring meant changes in staff.

47.   Section 5.1, paragraph 62: This sentence is inaccurate – “The appointment of the Project
      Director assisted greatly with multisectoral coordination efforts, and with building
      capacity within each of the agencies.” Despite the shift in project management to the
      MOH, the multisectoral coordination remained the responsibility of the NHAC and was
      executed by that agency throughout the life of Project. Apart from not having a
      multisectoral coordination role, the Project Director did not have responsibility for building
      capacity within agencies. If there is evidence to support such it should be included in the
      document.

48.   Section 5.1, paragraph 62 and 64: The Project Team’s ability to implement the Project was
      compromised by challenges with the Project design and conflicting information in the
      guidance documents. As the Project progressed, the Team proactively adopted and
      implemented measures to address the attendant performance challenges.

49.   Pages 51 to 53 Annex 12 Detailed Project Components: If this section is supposed to
      correspond to Annex 4 Detailed Project Description of the PAD pages 47 to 50, there are
      some discrepancies noted. First, it is not clear whether this section was intended to provide
      an overview of what the Project was supposed to entail or whether it was designed as
      another forum for presenting Project results. Given there is not a detailed Project
      description anywhere else in the document this section should fulfil that function. Second,
      at different intervals in this section, there are sporadic reports on Project results primarily
      for the MOH namely:
          a. Page 52 para (i) lines 3 to 4 research…factors.
         b. Page 52 paras (i) and (ii) under Sub-component 3: Improving Diagnosis, Treatment
            &Care – results are reported on HIV testing services and treatment respectively.
            Additionally there are some inaccuracies stated with respect to HIV testing
            services, and decentralization of treatment services.
         c. Page 53 para (iii) – results are reported on referral systems to social care
         d. Page 53 Component 2. Institutional Strengthening (US$4.47 million, US$3.6
            million loan) In this section results are being reported – “While routine
            surveillance, seroprevalence and behavioral surveys, and quality audits were
            carried out under Component 1, the second component included non-routine
            training and technical assistance to review the surveillance system, putting
            sero- and behavior surveillance and quality audits in place, and assisting with
            standardization of data collection methodologies, particularly in the case of
            behavior surveillance. This component financed training and technical
            assistance on M&E, management, surveillance, prevention, diagnosis,
            treatment and care of HIV/AIDS and other Sexually Transmitted Infections
            (STIs), to support the implementation of the Strategic Plan.”


                                                53
         e. The purpose of this section needs to be clear as such there should be a level of
            consistency in the information provided.
50.   Pages 54 to 56 Annex 13: An updated financial plan similar to that contained in the POM
      has been provided along with these comments and should be appended to the ICR.
      Explanatory notes will be included in the plan. Within Annex 13, page 56, Component 2:
      Institutional Strengthening and M&E, line 10, please replace “Virtual AIDS Info Centre”
      with “Virtual HIV Research Unit”.

Conclusion

52.   We recommend that the overall Project rating should be Satisfactory rather than
      Moderately Satisfactory for the following reasons:

53.   Despite the poor Project design, erroneous background analysis, inaccurate risk
      assessment, unclear foundation documents, conflicting task team leader interpretations of
      the foundation documents, mismatched resources and capacity - the Government was able
      to overcome the challenges which plagued Project implementation while in the midst of a
      financial crisis.


54.   The Project achieved all of the Development Objectives, surpassed many of the indicator
      targets, was able to demonstrate impact on at least two key population groups, MSM and
      youth.

55.   The rate of Project implementation significantly increased post Mid Term Review and
      surpassed the expectations of the Bank and the Government of Barbados.

56.   Although financial management capacity issues were identified during the first half of the
      Project funds were fully disbursed by Project end. (END)

Sub-component 1: National Program Coordination and Institutional Strengthening. This
program aims at strengthening the ability of the public sector, private sector and civil society
partners to coordinate, monitor and evaluate their activities and use data to continually increase
the quality of their programs. Specific activities would include:

   (i)     Building capacity that would help the GOB and civil society increase their ability to
           formulate a vision, policies, strategies, and plans of action; mobilize financial
           resources; and conduct operations relevant to HIVIAIDS. These activities would
           address issues in intra- and inter-agency communications and coordination, leadership,
           division of labor and adequate work practices and management practices. An existing
           Public Sector-CSO Grant System would be further developed under the project. This
           is described in Annex 6 and in more detail in the Project Operational Manual.

   (ii)    Strengthening surveillance, including the following: (a) continue to routinely report on
           identified HIV and AIDS cases and AIDS deaths, with close attention to confidentiality
           matters; (b) routinely report other STIs cases (Syphilis, Gonorrhea and Chlamydia); (c)
           Continue to carry out sentinel surveillance on pregnant women attending antenatal care
           and blood donors, to monitor general population prevalence; (d) carry out periodic
           seroprevalence surveys among key populations at higher risk; (e) carry out periodic
           KAPB studies of high risk behaviors among key populations at higher risk, looking for
           changes in behavior which may lead to spread of HIV infection, concentrating on
           behavior links between members of these groups and the general population; and (f)
           carry out audits of quality of treatment and care for PLHIV and ST1 patients.

   (iii)   Addressing the critical issue of M&E within the HIVIAIDS Program. Additional M&E
           staff would be hired within the NHAC and MHNI and a system would be set up to
           ensure a pool of trained M&E personnel in the country. A consultant would be hired to
           provide technical assistance and coaching to the new staff. The current M&E system
           would be redesigned to more effectively gather high quality data on a smaller number
           of critical indicators. The new system would facilitate the sharing of data with NHAC,
           the MHNI, and all relevant partners. Analysis and action on data would also be
           strengthened via new institutional arrangements and training. In addition, the safe
           storage of data to prevent loss or breaches of confidentiality would be improved. M&E
           capacity would be increased in the MHNI and other agencies. Capacity building
           includes training in implementation of the M&E plan, training in specific technical
           areas such as questionnaire design and data analysis, and translating results into action.
           Capacity would also be built through the procurement of needed computer systems and
           software. Implementation of the M&E strategy would include collection of baseline
           data for planned activities, monitoring of ongoing work, and final evaluation of the
           HIVIAIDS programming at the end of the project.

Sub-component 2: Scaling up Prevention Efforts.
This program aims at increasing access to preventive services, especially among key populations
at higher risk, and including BCC and provision of condoms. Prevention activities would be

                                                59
implemented in close cooperation between public agencies and CSOs. Among other activities, the
BCC Strategy would be implemented as follows:

The BCC Strategy included:
   (i)   Evidence-Based BCC Design. High quality research would be conducted to determine
         the KAP of key populations at higher risk regarding HIV/AIDS practices. In addition,
         research would be conducted to determine proximal determinants of behavior as well
         as barriers and enabling factors. The results of the assessment of the most vulnerable
         groups (sex workers, men who sex with men, prisoners, and youth) would be used to
         create and test multi-channel high-impact BCC programs tailored to each of the key
         populations at higher risk, as well as to the general population.

   (ii)    Implementation of BCC programs. BCC programs would be implemented over the
           course of the five years to reach key populations at higher risk. Promising existing BCC
           programs in Barbados and the Caribbean would be identified, tested and fine-tuned to
           ensure that they are appropriate for the Barbados context. The interventions would be
           multi-channel including peer communications, counseling, mass media, and social
           marketing.

   (iii)   Management of the BCC strategy. The NHAC manages the BCC strategy and in
           addition to program design and implementation, it is responsible for needed policy
           changes and reporting. The BCC unit is currently understaffed and does not have the
           capacity to meet the challenge of effective BCC. This subcomponent would be
           responsible for the recruitment and hiring of a senior behavior change officer, a junior
           behavior change officer responsible for edutainment, and a junior behavior change
           officer responsible for advocacy. Given the multi-sector nature of Barbados HIV/AIDS
           response, the success of the new BCC program requires the training and coordination
           of the partners including civil society, faith-based organizations (FBOs), PLHIV
           groups, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Tourism, among others.

Sub-component 3: Improving Diagnosis, Treatment & Care.
The goal of this program is to increase the length and quality of life of PLHIV. The program aims
at increasing PLHIV access to diagnostic services, treatment services (ART and treatment for 01s)
and social care and support (counseling, support groups, drug addiction therapy, and home care),
as follows:

   (i)     HIV testing services would be expanded into community organizations, including those
           working with vulnerable groups. The HIV testing training program would be adjusted
           to the new rapid testing protocol, and training would be condensed and made available
           at more convenient times for private providers. The LRU's laboratory would be
           strengthened so that it can offer viral loads and CD4 counts not only for Barbados but
           for other Caribbean countries at cost.

   (ii)    Treatment would be decentralized on a phased basis to the polyclinics that provide free
           government health services to the entire island. This would help eliminating the stigma
           currently associated with the LRU in the MHNI, and would seek to integrate HIV

                                               60
           services with other services provided at the polyclinics. The subcomponent would
           provide HIVIAIDS training for health care workers and social workers in the
           polyclinics. Training would also be made available for private providers. In addition, a
           quality control system would be introduced to ensure that the decentralization of care
           does not compromise the quality of outcomes.

   (iii)   Referral systems to social care would be strengthened, including assigning each
           PLHIV to a social worker. A protocol for systematic evaluations of social care needs
           would be instituted. Counseling for drug use would be made available to PLHIV and
           other highly vulnerable individuals.

Component 2. Institutional Strengthening (US$4.47 million, US$3.6 million loan)
The objective of Component 2 is to provide institutional strengthening via training and technical
assistance that would not be funded under the SWAP component. While routine surveillance,
seroprevalence and behavioral surveys, and quality audits would be carried out under Component
1, the second component would include non-routine training and technical assistance to review the
surveillance system, put in place sero- and behavior surveillance and quality audits and assist with
standardization of data collection methodologies, particularly in the case of behavior surveillance.
This component would finance training and technical assistance on M&E, management,
surveillance, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of HIVIAIDS and other STIs, to support
the implementation of the Strategic Plan.

                                     Annex 13. Project Expenditures

1.    As of the final Financial Management Implementation Support and Supervision Report
(FMISSR), the Project had US$5.75 million of undocumented expenditures remaining with
documentation required to be completed soon after closing, but this has not yet been submitted.

2.      Project expenditures as listed in the final FMISSR (covering the duration of the Project
only), supplemented by a detailed breakdown provided by the GOB using preliminary figures
where available from FY2008-2015 (which includes the Project duration) are provided in the Table
below. Component 1 contains expenditures in four mutually exclusive categories: (i) prevention
and care (activities related to the prevention and testing of HIV/AIDS), (ii) care and support, (iii)
treatment, and (iv) management. Costs associated with PLHIV are covered under care and support
and treatment. While there is some overlap in subcategory names (e.g. clinical staff cost under
prevention and care and care and support) these reflect different expenditures. For example,
clinical staff costs listed under prevention and care refers to staff solely working on prevention and
care activities, while clinical staff costs listed under care and support reflect costs of clinical staff
solely related to PLHIV.

3.      Special Audit: Soon after the October 2012 mission (which was ~1 year away from the
original closing date of the Project and at which point only $11 million of the Project’s $35 million
had been disbursed), a working group led by the Permanent Secretary of Investment of the Ministry
of Finance and Economic Affairs with representatives from 17 line ministries was convened to
review HIV/AIDS-related expenditures from April 1, 2010-March 31, 2012 that had not been
captured under previous IFRs but that qualified for reimbursement. The working group identified
US$26.3 million of expenditures; a Special Audit requested by the Bank found that US$23.349
million of expenditures could be certified. Subsequent review by the Bank found that US$13.641
million of these expenditures did not qualify as they were purely poverty alleviation-related
expenditures, such as groceries and rent. This left a balance of US$9.707 million in eligible
expenditures, of which 65% could be reimbursed as EPEs for a total of $6.309 million. In
summary, of the $26.3 million of expenditures identified by the working group as eligible, only
$9.707 million was found to be eligible and reimbursement was in the amount of $6.309 million.
