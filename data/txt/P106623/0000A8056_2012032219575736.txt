                         The project would support the implementation of the 2008-2013 Barbados National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan, specifically to increase:
                         - Adoption of safe behaviors, in particular amongst key populations at higher risk.
                         - Access to prevention, treatment and social care, in particular for key populations at higher risk.
                         - Capacity of organizational and institutional structures that govern the NAP.
                         - Use of quality data for problem identification, strategy definition and measuring results.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This project is an integral part of the National AIDS Program (NAP) and is one of the main sources of financing for the National Strategic Plan (NSP) 2008-2013. The Bank team,
                         jointly with the Barbados Government team and other development partners, conducted the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the NAP and of the Second HIV/AIDS Project (the Project)
                         from December 5-9, 2011. As part of preparation for the MTR, the project commissioned two assessments on the National AIDS Program (NAP) and of the Second AIDS Project,

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                      Report No: ISR5718



                         which supports the implementation of the NAP. The first assessment focused on the response from the health sector to HIV/STIs and the second assessment focused on the
                         implementation of the Project. These two assessments were well done and provided very useful information and recommendations for the MTR. The National HIV/AIDS Commission
                         (NHAC) organized a two-day workshop with the participation of representatives of the Government, civil society, and the development partners and the findings and
                         recommendations from the two assessments were presented and discussed.

                         The MTR concludes that the Project Development Objectives of the Second AIDS Project remain relevant and consistent with the Barbados overall National Development Objectives.
                         The Project has made significant progress in the areas of (a) maintaining a high level of awareness of HIV among general population and youth; (b) reducing AIDS mortality; (c)
                         preventing mother to child transmission with no babies born HIV+ in the past 4 years; (d) expanding access to HIV testing and coverage of AIDS treatment and (e) improving the
                         surveillance and M&E system. The Ministry of Health (MOH) continues to conduct case-based surveillance for HIV and AIDS according to established international best practice.
                         Collected data show a declining number of newly reported cases from a high of 180 in 2000 to 135 in 2010.

                         However, the Project still faces many challenges: the NAP has expanded services to some high risk groups such as sex workers (SW), but has been less successful in reaching men
                         who have sex with men (MSM), a main driver of the epidemic in Barbados. While there is engagement of Government ministries in the national response, the involvement of civil
                         society organizations (CSOs) is limited. Delays in implementing the CSO Grant System have impacted the ability of the NAP to reach most at risk populations (MARPs). Progress
                         under Component 2 (Institutional Capacity Building) has been limited.

                         The Bank and the Government agreed at the MTR to restructure the project in order to improve the project performance and increase the chance of reaching Project Development
                         Objectives in the remaining two years and to improve sustainability of the overall National Response to HIV/AIDS. Various options of restructuring the project were discussed at the
                         MTR and the Government has informed the Bank that the MOH would assume responsibilities for the implementation of the Project. The government and the Bank will work out the
                         details for the project restructuring in the coming months.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The MTR highlighted three major challenges under the implementation and reached initial agreements on how to move forward:


                                                                                                                                                                                                               Page 4 of 5
                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                       Report No: ISR5718




                         Challenges:

                         1. Underutilization of available funds. As of December 4, 2011, total disbursement of the loan was US$11.1 million (31.7% of the total). The main issue is not under-provision of

                         budget from the Government, but rather underutilization of the budget provided to the NAP. Since 2008, the Government has provided a total of US$39.6 million to the NAP, and
                         actual expenditures until 2011 were US$27.2 million, or 69 percent of the allocation. US$23.9million remains to be utilized before the closing date of the project on November 30,
                         2013.

                         2. Lack of coordination between MOH and NHAC. Current implementation arrangements do not function efficiently. There is little coordination between the MOH, the main
                         implementer of the NAP, and NHAC. This has affected the implementation of the project and the possibility of fully utilizing the loan before the project closing date of November 30,
                         2013.

                         3. Weak capacity and leadership at NHAC. Lack of capacity for fiduciary management and weak leadership have hampered NHAC’s ability to coordinate the national response
                         across agencies and has delayed implementation of the Project. The NHAC has been functioning inefficiently as an implementing agency rather than performing as a coordination
                         body for the NAP.

                         Agreements:

                         Based on the findings and recommendations from the MTR, the Government (MOF, MOH, and MFCSY) initiated discussions as to possibly consolidating project management
                         functions within the MOH, including M&E, fiduciary management, and prevention activities. In particular:

                         •       To ensure the sustainability of the National Response to HIV and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the NAP and project, the financing and implementation
                         arrangements will be restructured;

                         •         MOH will be responsible for implementation of the Second AIDS Project, and the implementation function under NHAC will move to the MOH, including the M & E unit,
                         fiduciary management, and prevention activities;

                         •       The World Bank will explore the possibility of increasing the financing percentage for Component 1 and expanding the definition of eligible expenditures to strengthen health
                         system development within the scope of Project Development Objectives;

                         •        NHAC will retain functions as a coordinating body for the Project. The Government will inform the Bank on how to strengthen the leadership of the NHAC.
