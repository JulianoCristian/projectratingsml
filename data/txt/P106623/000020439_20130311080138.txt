                       PROPOSAL TO RESTRUCTURE
                    BARBADOS SECOND HIV/AIDS PROJECT
                           Loan No. IBRD 7585-BB
                             Project ID: P106623

  A. SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper proposes to introduce changes in the Project Loan
Agreement for the Barbados Second HIV/AIDS Project (the Project) (Loan No. IBRD
7585-BB) to: (i) modify Project’s institutional arrangements to strengthen leadership and
capacity of the Project by transferring coordination, disbursement and financial
management functions to the Ministry of Finance and procurement, monitoring and
evaluation and supervision functions to Ministry of Health; (ii) revise the results
framework by changing the final target year from 2012 when the surveys were expected
to be done, to 2013, the end of the Project for three indicators and the target for one
indicator; and (iii) increase the percentage of Bank financing of Eligible Program
Expenditures (EPE) under Component 1 from 35 percent to 65 percent to accelerate the
disbursement in order to successfully achieve the Project Objectives.

  B. PROJECT STATUS

2.       The US$35 million Loan Agreement for the Barbados Second HIV/AIDS Project
was signed on September 25, 2008 and became effective on January 6, 2009. The Project
is a follow-on project for the Barbados HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project, which
was successfully completed on December 31, 2007. The Government sought the Bank’s
support to finance the implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan over the
period of 2008-2013, and to increase access to prevention, treatment and social care by
key populations at higher risk of HIV exposure. The Project is expected to close on
November 30, 2013.

3.       The Project has two components. Component 1 focuses on Prevention and Care
(US$31.4 million of the loan). This component co-finances the implementation of the
National Strategic Plan for HIV Prevention and Control 2008-2013 and focuses on three
sub-components: National Program Coordination and Monitoring; Scaling up Prevention
Efforts; and Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Care. Component 2 supports
institutional strengthening (US$3.5 million of the loan). This component finances
capacity building in disease management and the health information system.

4.      With the project support, Barbados has made significant progress in combating
HIV/AIDS. Available data indicates that Barbados is on track to achieve MDG 6 (halt or
reverse HIV/AIDS) by 2015. The rate of AIDS-related mortality has dramatically
decreased, due to the greater availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Barbados has
eliminated mother to child HIV transmission since 2007 and 100 percent of identified
HIV positive pregnant women have received a complete course of ART to reduce mother
to child transmission in 2011. The country has expanded access to HIV testing through
the provision of provider initiated testing and counseling, introduction of rapid testing

                                           6
and targeted testing services for key populations. Coverage of those eligible for ART
services has been reported to be above 80 percent since 2010, which well exceeds the
project target of 60 percent coverage. The Grant Scheme to support civil society
organizations (CSOs) has commenced strongly. The behavioral sero-status surveys for
key populations are underway. The results from these surveys will support the
development of more effective prevention activities and better targeting.

5.      However, the Project has been facing challenges and therefore it is rated
Moderately Satisfactory for PDO and Moderately Unsatisfactory for IP. . The Mid-term
review (MTR) identified three major weaknesses: (a) lack of effective leadership and
weak capacity of the National HIV/AIDS Commission (NHAC); (b) lack of coordination
between the NHAC and Ministry of Health (MOH), the main implementing agency of the
Project; and (c) delayed implementation and underutilization of available loan funds.
These weaknesses affected the NHAC’s ability to coordinate the national response across
agencies and delayed the implementation. As of March 5, 2013, US$14.8 million, 42.25
percent of the Loan has been disbursed and the remaining US$20.2 million need to be
fully utilized before the Project closing date on November 30, 2013.

6.     The proposed project restructuring follows recommendations made and
agreements reached during and after the MTR on December 5-9, 2011, and is in response
to a Government letter of November 23, 2012.


  C. PROPOSED CHANGES AND RATIONAL

(a) Institutional Arrangement

7.      Amending Section I of Schedule 2, A. Institutional Arrangements to transfer the
coordination, disbursement, financial management functions of the project to the Ministry
of Finance and under the supervision of the Permanent Secretary of Investment and the
procurement, monitoring and evaluation and supervision functions to the Ministry of
Health (MOH). The Project Director of the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), who is
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Project, will report to the Permanent
Secretary of Investment of Ministry of Finance (MOF) on coordination, disbursement and
financial management and to the Permanent Secretary of the MOH on procurement,
monitoring and evaluation and other technical issues. The new governance structure for
the Project is attached as Annex 1. The Bank has assessed the institutional capacity under
the MOF and MOH for managing fiduciary functions such as financial management and
procurement and found it satisfactory. Under the new structure, the project financial
management officer reports to the Project Director and the MOF oversees the financial
management of the project to ensure the preparation of the financial reports, withdrawal
applications and audits are carried out according to the Bank requirements in a timely
manner. The procurement officer at the MOH, who has trained for Bank procurement
requirement, will manage project procurement. The Permanent Secretary of the MOH
will provide guidance on the technical issues related to HIV prevention and control and
monitor and evaluation. The new management structure will improve the leadership and
management capacity for final project implementation.


                                            7
8.     The revised project governance structure will strengthen project leadership and
improve capacity for better performance. The NHAC will continue to coordinate the
multisectoral national response to HIV including the civil society grant scheme and
behavior change communication.

(b) Results Framework

9.      Amending Schedule 2, Section II A. 1. (b) to change performance indicators as
follows:

       (1) The final target dates for the following three indicators would change from
       2012 when the surveys were expected to be completed to 2013, at the end of the
       project. Due to delays in conducting the related surveys, the data for three
       performance indicators will become available only in 2013.
        Indicator ii: Percentage of female sex workers reporting the use of a condom
           with their most recent client (target: increased from 80 percent in 2006 to 85
           percent in 2013);
        Indicator iii: Percentage of men reporting the use of a condom the last time
           they had sex with a male partner (target: increase from 64 percent in 2007 to
           70 percent in 2013); and
        Indicator v: Percentage of most at risk populations (female sex workers and
           men who have sex with men) reached with HIV prevention services (target:
           for men who have sex with men increase to 75 percent by 2013 and for female
           sex workers increase to 70 percent by 2013).

       (2) The target value for indicator iv would change from 65 percent to 60 percent:
        Indicator iv: Percentage of young men and women aged 15-24 years reporting the
           use of a condom the last time they had sex with non- marital non cohabitating sexual
           partner (target: increase from 21 percent in 2005 to 60 percent in 2013).

10.      The initial target for Indicator iv was achieved and the target was increased in the
first Loan Agreement Amendment from 21 percent to 65 percent in July 2011. The
Government is concerned that this target was set too high and requested to change the
target to 60 percent, which is still way above the initial target of 21 percent and more
realistic.

11.    Annex 2 presents the revised performance indicators for the Project.

(c) Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds

12.    Amending Schedule 2, Section IV. A. General: to increase the percentage of Bank
financing under Component 1 from 35 percent to 65 percent. Annex 3 presents the
revised withdrawal of loan proceeds.

13.    The global economic and financial crisis affected revenue generation in Barbados
and the Project has not been able to implement the activities based on the initial design.
The Government appreciated the Bank’s financial support to its national response to HIV
and would like to fully utilize the loan. Considering the Project is closing on November

                                               8
30, 2013, the Government requested that the Bank increases the financing percentage for
Component 1 to increase loan disbursements in order to successfully utilize the funds to
achieve the Project Development Objectives. The Government is committed to continue
to finance its national response to HIV and maintain the NHAC. During the remaining
implementation period of the Project, it will focus on priority programs and target key
populations, as well as strengthening the health system. The Project Development
Objectives are still attainable.

14.    The proposed restructuring will not trigger any new safeguard policies nor affect
the environmental safeguard rating of the Project.

Annex 2: Revised Performance Indicators

The revised performance indicators are as follows:

     (i)     Percentage of young women and men aged 15-24 indicating sexual relations as a
     way of transmitting HIV (target: maintain a knowledge rate of at least 90 percent during
     2008-2013).

     (ii)     Percentage of female sex workers reporting the use of a condom with their most
     recent client (target: increase from 80 percent in 2006 to 85 percent in 2013).

     (iii)   Percentage of men reporting the use of a condom the last time they had          sex
     with a male partner (target: increase from 64 percent in 2007 to 70 percent in 2013).

     (iv)      Percentage of young men and women aged 15-24 years reporting the use of a
     condom the last time they had sex with non-marital non cohabitating sexual partner
     (target: increase from 21 percent in 2005 to 60 percent in 2013).

     (v)     Percentage of most at-risk populations (female sex workers and men who have
     sex with men) reached with HIV prevention        services (target: for men who have sex
     with men increase to 75 percent by 2013 and for female sex workers increase to 70
     percent by 2013).

     (vi)   Percentage of identified HIV-positive pregnant women who gave birth in the last
     12 months receiving a complete course of antiretroviral therapy to reduce the risk of
     mother to child transmission (target: maintain at a rate above 95 percent during 2008 to
     2013).

     (vii)   Percentage of people living with HIV on first line antiretroviral regimen
     achieving virologic success within the first 6 months of treatment (target: maintain a
     virologic success rate above 70 percent).

     (viii) Amount of funds spent by civil society organizations under results-based
     agreements (target: reach the amount to US$150,000 by 2013).

     (ix)    An evidence-based Strategic Plan for 2014-2018 prepared by June 2013.
