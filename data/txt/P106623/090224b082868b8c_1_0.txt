                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project would support the implementation of the 2008-2013 Barbados National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan, specifically to increase: - Adoption of safe behaviors, in
                         particular amongst key populations at higher risk. - Access to prevention, treatment and social care, in particular for key populations at higher risk. - Capacity of
                         organizational and institutional structures that govern the NAP. - Use of quality data for problem identification, strategy definition and measuring results.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This Project was approved on August 7, 2008 and has been effective since January 6, 2009. The full loan amount of US$35 million has been disbursed and the Project will close on
                         November 30, 20

                         The Project supported the Government of Barbados' National HIV/AIDS Program under which significant results have been attained towards the overall achievement of the Project
                         Development Objectives (PDOs). The results achieved under the Project's results framework, which consisted of nine Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), illustrate the progress

                         made towards the PDOs. Specifically, six of the nine KPIs were fully achieved against the four PDOs, as follows: PDO1 - With regard to the adoption of safe behaviors among key
                         populations, two of the three KPIs used to measure progress were achieved which include the 80% of men who have sex with men (MSM) reporting condom use surpassing the
                         target of 70%, and the 71.7 percent of 15-24 year olds reporting condom use surpassing the target of 65%. PDO2 - Of the four KPIs used to measure an increase in access to
                         prevention, treatment, and social care for key populations at higher risk, 2 of the KPIs were achieved which include 99.6% of young women and men aged 15-24 indicating sexual

                         relations as a way of transmitting HIV, surpassing the target of 90%, and 92.5% of people living with HIV on first line antiretroviral regimen achieving virologic success within the first 6
                         months of treatment surpassing the target of 70%. PDO3 - The one KPI measuring the increase in the capacity of organizational and institutional structures that govern the National
                         HIV/AIDS Program (NAP) was achieved with US$186,848 spent by Civil Society Organizations under results-based agreements surpassing the target of US$150,000. PDO4 - the
                         KPI measuring the increase in the use of quality data for problem identification, strategy definition, and measuring results was achieved with the country now having an Evidence-
                         based National Strategic Plan in place and disseminated which was developed using data from surveys targeting key populations and provides a strategy and results framework to
                         guide and measure progress on the country's national response to HIV. In sum, overall achievement of the PDO is rated as Satisfactory because 2 PDOs were partially achieved
                         while 2 PDOs were fully achieved. The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will include additional information (not currently available) on the three KPIs which were not
