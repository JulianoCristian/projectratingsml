Its objectives are to:\n            (i) modify the Project's institutional arrangements to\n            strengthen the leadership and capacity by transferring\n            coordination, disbursement, and financial management\n            functions to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and by\n            transferring procurement, monitoring, evaluation, and\n            supervision functions to the Ministry of Health (MOH); (ii)\n            revise the results framework by changing the final target\n            year for three indicators from 2012 when the surveys were\n            expected to be done, to 2013, the end of the Project, and by\n            changing the target for one indicator; and (iii) increase\n            the percentage of Bank financing of Eligible Program\n            Expenditures under Component 1 from 35 percent to 65 percent\n            to accelerate the disbursement in order to successfully\n            achieve the project's objectives. The Bank has assessed\n            the institutional capacity under the MOF and MOH for\n            managing fiduciary functions and found it satisfactory. The\n            revised governance structure will strengthen project\n            leadership and improve capacity for better performance. The\n            change to the target date for three results indicators is\n            due to delays in conducting related surveys, the data for\n            which will only become available in 2013. The change to the\n            target for one indicator is intended to scale back a target\n            value which had already been revised significantly above the\n            initial target. The increase to the percentage of eligible\n            Bank financing is in response to the global economic and\n            financial crisis, which affected revenue generation in Barbados."}, "docdt": "2013-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
