Support\n            Credit (PRSC-4) supports the implementation of Cape\n            Verde's first Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy\n            (GPRSP-I). This one-tranche operation is a transitory one\n            between the first and the second PRSC series, which will be\n            based on the GPRSP-II finalized by the Government at end of\n            May 2008. The policy dialogue and the results-based\n            framework under PRSC-4 focus on the following pillars of the\n            GPRSP-I: (i) promote good governance; (ii) develop human\n            capital; and (iii) improve the effectiveness and\n            sustainability of the social protection system.\n            Specifically, PRSC-4 supports selected measures that aim to:\n            (a) improve public expenditure management, reform and\n            modernize the public administration, strengthen\n            decentralization and municipal management capacity, and\n            strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems; (b) improve\n            quality and efficiency of basic health; and (c) modernize\n            and rationalize social protection services, with a focus on\n            improving the normative and operational framework for social\n            protection services at the municipal level. The main risks\n            associated with PRSC-4 are: (i) limited capacity in some\n            ministries to pursue the reform agenda; (ii) decline in\n            external concessional support at a faster pace than\n            expected; (iii) fiscal risks (including accumulation of\n            contingent liabilities and non-discretionary expenditure\n            programs that could cause fiscal slippages and stall\n            implementation of the more sensitive policy reforms); and\n            (iv) continued increase in fuel and food prices could delay\n            further poverty reduction, especially in rural areas, given\n            that most of the food and all oil has to be imported."}, "docdt": "2008-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
