Reduction\n            Support Credit Project for Cape Verde were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: budget support has been catalytic in\n            harmonizing aid to Cape Verde and budget support continues\n            to be highly relevant to the Cape Verdean context. The use\n            of budgetary support enabled the Government to finance key\n            parts of the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\n            (GPRSP) that will be difficult to finance through an\n            investment loan or single sector development policy\n            operation. An additional advantage is the ability to embed\n            sector policy within crosscutting issues such as civil\n            service reform, improved expenditure management, and\n            decentralization to increase the sustainability and impact\n            on service delivery. Budgetary support proved to be a\n            powerful instrument to unify donor assistance and dialogue\n            around a core set of policy actions specifically, the\n            provision of harmonized budget support through the Budget\n            Support Group (BSG) clearly reduced transaction costs for\n            the Government through a reduction in the number of visiting\n            missions and country-specific reporting requirements. This\n            is particularly important for a small country like Cape\n            Verde where the public sector can be easily overwhelmed by\n            aid and requests from donors. Budget support is a\n            sophisticated instrument which requires governmental\n            capacity to design and implement reforms and to monitor\n            their impact. The reliance on national systems also raises\n            capacity issues at all stages of the budget cycle, which\n            were compounded in the Cape Verdean context by the limited\n            number of technical staff and the high turnover of senior\n            staff in several core ministries. Offsetting these\n            constraints requires a combination of capacity building and\n            technical support."}, "docdt": "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
