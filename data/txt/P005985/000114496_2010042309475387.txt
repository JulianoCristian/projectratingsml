Gentlemen:
      Please refer to the Loan Agreement, dated November 18, 1988, between 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and Banco de la 
Nacion Argentina (the Borrower).
      I am pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees to your request to increase the 
Authorized Allocation of the Special Account to $20,000,000 equivalent.  The Bank, 
therefore, proposes the following amendment to the Loan Agreement:
      Paragraph I (c) of Schedule 7 is hereby amended to read as follows:
      "(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to twenty 
million dollars to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited in the Special 
Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule."
      Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by signing and dating the 
attached confirmation copy of this letter and returning it to the undersigned.
      In view of the interest of the Argentine Republic in this matter, a copy of this 
letter is being sent to the Minister of Economy of Argentina.
Yours sincerely,
