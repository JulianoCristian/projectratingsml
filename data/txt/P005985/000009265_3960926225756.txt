MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PR'JPOSED LOAN
TO BANCO DE LA NACION ARGENTINA
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development loan to Argentina for US$106.5 million equivalent is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms with 15
years maturity, a five-year grace period and variable interest rate, and
would help finance an agricultural credit project. The project would be
cofinanced by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for US$105.0
million equivalent.
2.       Background:  Argentina's agricultural sector contributes about 70t
of foreign exchange earnings, 16Z of GDP, and 172 of employment. The
country's diverse agroclimatic base permits production of a wide range of
agricultural commodities that enable the country to be self-sufficient in
most foodstuffs and agro-industrial raw materials. In the recent past, the
sector has performed better than the general economy and in fact has acted
as a brake to a general decline. While overall GDP fell by an annual
average of 2.1Z over the 1980-85 period, agricultural GDP rose at an
average of 2.32. Crop production fell in 1986, however, and cattle herd
liquidation continued to bolster farmer cash flows. While 1987 was
expected to be another year of low output, better weather and stronger
prices appear to have had a favorable impact on the spring planted area of
some crops, in particular soybeans. Agriculture's performance, even in
years of growth, has been below potential. This has been due largely to
low world prices for Argentina's major exports, a shortage of medium- and
long- term credit, high real interest rates, export taxes and macroeconomic
uncertainty. As a result, adoption of modern technology has been
restrained and farmers have not replaced or modernized their machinery
pool. The cost of this has been high in terms of foregone productivity and
depleted soils. In addition, recent price declines of Argentina's
principal exports--cereals, oilseeds and beef--have revealed a serious
vulnerability and reemphasized the need both to diversify production and to
increase the efficiency of production.
3.       The Government has given priority to stimulating agricultural
production and exports as an important element of economic recovery.  Its
medium-term agricultural development program is to pursue the following
sectoral objectives: (a) expand agricultural exports; (b) increase
production of cereals and oilseeds; (c) generate employment; and (d)
encourage natural resource conservation. In addition, to compensate
partially for slumping world prices, the Government has lovered most
agricultural export taxes. This overall strategy has been supported by the
policy package under the ongoing Agricultural Sector Loan (Ln. 2675-AR)
which included a reduction in export taxes, the introduction of
compensatory tax measures, and the removal of restrictions on imports of
tractors and other agricultural machinery.



4.       Previous Bank group support to the Argentine agricultural credit
system has included an Agricultural Credit Project (Ln. 1564-AR) which was
approved in May 1978 to provide medium- and long-term credit for on-farm
investments. This loan was cancelled in 1980 without disbursements because
of: (a) the unfavorable environment for investment due to high inflation
and over-valuation of the local currency; and (b) large inflows of
competing, low-cost credit from foreign commercial banks. Under the Grain
Storage Project (Ln. 1521-AR), due to close shortly, the Bank is financing,
inter alia, a private line of credit for investments in grain storage and
handling. IFC is also financing a US$ 30.0 million credit line for
agroindustrial investments. In addition to Bank-group support, the IDB is
currently financing a four-year agricultural credit program implemented by
the Bank of the Argentine Nation (BNA). Approved in December 1984, this
loan (US$60 million) is already 752 disbursed.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement:  The proposed project would be
consistent with the Bank's efforts to assist Argentina to boost economic
growth, stimulate the agricultural sector and expand export earnings. It
would increase the rate of growth in a vital sector with underutilized
potential and substantial importance for foreign exchange earnings.
Argentina, a world market price-taker, is forced to become more cost-
effective and efficient to maintain competitiveness. In view of the lack
of resources for investment lending in the financial system and the
inability of the Government to provide these resources due to fiscal
restraints and debt burden, the Bank and IDB would help remove an important
constraint. Bank involvement is expected to draw private and provincial
banks into agricultural investment lending through the apex lending
operation proposed. This apex structure is consistent with reforms being
advocated under the Banking Sector Adjustment Loan (Ln. 2923-AR) approved
by the Board on March 29, 1988.
6.       Proiect Obiectives:  The primary objectives of the project would
be to increase agricultural growth, farmer incomes, and exports by
modernizing farm machinery and facilitating the adoption of cost-effective
technology. The project would complement ongoing research and extension
initiatives, seeking to introduce technology into the sector oriented
towards soil conservation, for which there already exists a sound technical
basis. The project would foster greater efficiency in sectoral lending
through the proposed apex operation.
7.       Project Description:  The project would include a nationwide line
of medium- and long-tenm credit to support sectoral investments of US$354.0
million over a four-year period. This credit line would finance such
investments as modern agricultural machinery, on- and off-farm grain
storage facilities, land improvements, orchard establishment, livestock
development, small-scale agro-processing facilities, and working capital
complementary to ti'pe investments.  BNA. a government-owned commercial
bank, would be tL, Borrower and would be the apex institution for the
credit component. It would use Bank and IDB funds to rediscount 82X of
subloans granted to its own retail clients and to clients of qualifying
intermediary banks. Twenty percent of loan funds would be reserved for
rediscounts from financial intermediaries other than BNA. Obligations to
the apex unit would be in US dollar-denominated australes at a variable



- 3 -
interest rate. Participating banks would finance 18Z of subloans made.
Sub-borrowers would contribute at least 152 toward investment cost
financing and are expected to contribute on average 28Z. Subloan principal
would be adjusted to maintain value in accordance with agreed indices, and
final sub-borrowers would pay interest rates sufficient to cover the cost
of funds, intermediation costs, the credit risk, and a spread for BNA's
cross-currency exchange risk. Specific terms and conditions, consistent
with agreed credit regulations, would be negotiated between participating
financial intermediaries and their clients. Sub-borrowers are expected to
pay about 142 p.a. real interest, which is considered to be a sustainable
rate based on estimated financial returns to representative investments.
The project would also include a monitoring and evaluation comnonent
(US$1.5 million) to review project progress with a view to assisting
further sectoral development and planning. The Secretariat of Agriculture
(SAGyP) would implement this component.
8.       The total cost of the project, net of taxes and duties, is
estimated at US$355.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$71.6 million (20?). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. A description of the proposed procurement is
presented in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status cf Bank Group operations in Argentina are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 7261-AR dated May .7, 1988, is also attached.
9.       Agreed Actions:  Agreement has been reached with BNA and the
Government on the following: (a) credit regulations; (b) functions of
BNA's apex unit; (c) indicators to be used by BNA apex to evaluate
prospective participating intermediaries; (d) a participation agreement for
financial intermediaries; (e) a draft subsidiary loan agreement between BNA
and SAGyP to implement the monitoring and evaluation component; and (f)
establishment of a currency risk fund by May 31, 1989 operated according to
a currency risk regulation to be finalized by February 28, 1989. The
Government as Guarantor has agreed to cover any deficiency between the
Borrower's loan repayment obligations, US dollar vis-a-vis the basket of
currencies, that cannot be met from the proceeds of the Currency Risk Fund.
The Government's obligation to compensate BNA for any such deficiency in
cross-currency risk provisions would also be set forth in an agreed
Currency Risk Agreement to be signed by Government and BNA, the Borrower,
by May 31, 1989. Conditions of loan effectiveness would be: confirmation
that BNA's apex unit has been established and the reciprocal effectiveness
of the IDB loan.
10.      Benefits:  The principal project benefits would include: (a)
increased cost effectiveness in production from machinery modernization and
technological changes; (b) greater product diversification; (c) higher
efficiency in product handling and storage; and (d) improved soil
conservation. These would result in higher incomes and export earnings.
Institution-building would take place through apex lending and through the
involvement of private and provincial banks in agricultural investment
financing.

11.      Risks:  (a) Demand Risk:  The demand for credit could be adversely
affected by the relatively expensive, non-subsidized credit offered through
the project, especially if existing difficult macroeconomic conditions do
not improve. However, the recently more stable world prices for key
exports, the advanced age of the sector's capital stock, the need to act on
soil conservation, and the limited availability of alternative sources of
investment credit increase opportunities for success. Project design has
attempted to mitigate this risk through flexible credit terms that provide
the sub-borrower with a choice of index for maintenance of principal value.
Demand surveys support the proposed project size and illustrative
investment models indicate that the credit would be financially attractive; and
(b) Participating Banks' Liquidity Risks: Participating retail banks are
expected to finance 182 of all subloans or about 132 of total project
costs.   In the past, legal reserve requirements and forced investments by
the Central Bank have undermined liquidity levels of participating banks.
However, the Central Bank has recently lowered reserve requirements on
incremental deposits to only 32. If recent policy changes succeed in
remonetizing the economy, there should be a corresponding reduction in
average reserve requirements and additional liquidity for the banking
system.
12.      Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proDosed loan.

PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS
Procurement: Goods, services, and civil works financed with project credit
would be diverse and procured by a large number of sub-borrowers. Most of
these are expected to be supplied locally. Sub-borrowers would purchase
items in the local market according to established cozmercial practices
acceptable to the Bank. For goods and services costing US$3.0 million or
more, ICB procurement would be -arried out in accordance with Bank
guidelines. BNA and participating banks would be responsible for ensuring
the competitiveness in price and quality of goods and services procured and
their suitability for purposes intended. Goods and materials for
monitoring and evaluation would be purchased under local procedures
acceptable to the Bank in view of their relatively small cost (US$83,000).
Consulting services for monitoring- and evaluation, estimated at 14
man-months over four years, would be procured according to Bank guidelines.
All ICB procurement and procurement of goods for the monitoring and
evaluation component would be subject to the Bank's prior review.
