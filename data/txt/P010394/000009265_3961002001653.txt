)ENORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TEE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOEPENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAXISTAN
FOR THE PUNJAB MIDDLE SCHOOLING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval, the following memorandwu and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to the Islamic ReApublic of Pakistan for
SDR 80.5 million, the equlvalent of US$115 million, on standard IDA terms with
a maturity of 35 years to help finance a middle schooling project in the
Province of the Punjab.
2.    Blackgrou.  Despite Pakistan's robust economic performance which has
resulted in a doubling of per capita income over the past 25 years, efforts to
translate economic p':ogteas into educational gains have achieved only limited
success. As a result of a population increase of over 3X per annum, only
about half of the children in the age-group 5-9 are enrolled in primary
education, and less than one-third have access to education beyond primary
schooling.   Therefore, improving the access to, and quality of, elementary
education, comprising primary (classes 1 - 5) and middle (classes 6 - 8)
schools with increased attention to female education in rural areas, remains
the highest priority. In the Province of Punjab, recent studies of the
education sector have identified the severe shortages of female teachers in
rural areas as one of the critical impediments to increased participation of
girls. Addressing this problem is a long term undertaking; it means
increasing the number of rural girls gaining a-^cess to both primary and middle
school education, as well as improving their access to higher levels of
education, which is a necessary condition for qualifying to become a teacher.
3.    Other major faclors which constrain the development of elementary
education in the Punjab are: (a) inadequate provision of sCbools. Lack of
resources and delays in implementing a building program to add middle
schooling (classes 6 - 8) classrooms to existing primary schools have
frequently led to the displacement of primary classes, causing them to be held
under school verandas or in the school yard. Also, most middle schools lack
minimum facilities and have no school maintenance budget; (b) poor
lnstructional quality and lov student achievement. The causes are multiple
and interdependent including: fragmented organization; poor management of
teacher training; inadequate assessment of learning achievement and lack of
teaching-learning materials and (c) poor management of resources.  This
problem results from near absence of valid baseline data to formulate
policies, set targets and develop and monitor programs, as well as poorly
coordinated provincial, divisional and district management.
4.    The Government of the Punjab has, with assistance from IDA, prepared an
Elementary Education Development Program (FY93-98). This program covers all
investment and recurrent expenditures in primary and middle schooling. For
prlmary schooling, the Government is already committed to implement two major
projects: the IDA-financed Third Primary Education Project (PEP3) (FY87-94)
and the Asian Development Bank's Girls Primary Education Project (FY91-96).
These projects aim at improving coverage, participation and delivery of
primary education in rural areas, particularly for girls, and strengthening
planuing and management of primary education. With the addition of about
700,000 places, about 581 of rural girls in the age-group 5-9 would be



2
enrolled in primary schooling by 1995-96. For middle schooling, the program
comprises investm..znt (civil works, furniture, equipment, materials, vehicles,
quality improvement inputs, and techntcal assistance) and recurrent
expenditures (salaries, maintenance, scholarships and operating expenditures).
Selected components of the middle schooling sub-program would be supported by
the proposed project as described below in paras. 8-12. Total enrollments in
primary and middle schooling are projected to reach 821 and 421 of the
relevant age-groups, respectively by FY98.
5.    Rationale for IDA xnvolvement.  With four credits in primary education
since 1979, IDA has assisted the government in addressing major policy,
institutional and investment constraints. The proposed project is a natural
extension of past IDA assistance in primary schooling. It would be the first
externally-financed operation to support development of middle schooling.
6.    Lessons Learned.  A number of lessons have been taken into account in
preparing the proposed project. These include: (a) decentralization of
project administration and single-province operations in order to streamline
project implementation; (b) expanding the functions of existing bodies or
institutions rather than establishment of new ones; (c) development of the
institutional framework and staff capacity before introducing complex changes;
(d) introduction of change incrementally and setting of realistic targets; (e)
seeking early agreement on technical assistance programs and terms of
reference of consultants; (f) strengthened monitoring of the construction
program at all st.ges; (g) establishment of financing and implementation
mechanisms to accelerate disbursements; (h) flexible programing to allow
adaptation during implementation; and (i) broadening the base of teacher
training to include the local government bodies and the private sector.
7.    Proiect Objectives.  The objectives of the project are to: (a) improve
access and participation in middle schooling in rural and urban slum areas,
especially for girls; (b) improve quality and increase student learning
achievement; and (c) strengthen policy-making, planning, management,
monitoring and evaluation capacity of DOE.
8.    Project Description.  The project would support:
(a) Improved access and participation (base cost, US$116.7 million)
by: (i) providing facilities for about 3,600 schools and increased
budgets for school maintenance; (ii) providing scholarships to
rural girls to complete secondary education and to qualified
female graduates to enter teacher training and rewarding
outstanding teachers and headmasters; (iii) enhancing the role of
local government in management and delivery of elementary
education; and (iv) promoting community and private sector
participation in elementary ed;zation through technical assistance
to the Punjab Education Foundation.
(b) Improved quality of education (base cost, US$17.2 million)
through: (i) improved delivery of: teacher education, science/math
and English teaching, and school supervision; (ii) improved
learning assessment capacity through the development of expertise
in testing and examinations; and (iii) publication of improved
textbooks, teachers' guides and supplementary reading materials.



3
(c)   Strengthened policy-making, planning, management and
monitoring/evalustion capacity (base cost, US$3.7 million)
through: (i) development of policy formulation and school planning
capabilities at the provincial and district levels; (ii)
reorganizing the department of education to create elementary
education management and administration at the provincial,
divisional and district levels and (iii) developing monitoring and
evaluation capacity.
9.    The total cost of the eight-year project is estimated at US$164.1
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$30.3 million
equivalent (182). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group owerations in Pakistan are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing the geographical
coverage of the project is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9900-PAK
is being distributed separately.
10.   Agreements Reached and Conditions.    During Negotiations, assurances
were obtained that GOPunjab would: (a) carry out and provide the necessary
financial resources for the agreed program of middle schooling; (b) maintain a
balanced construction program according to agreed criteria; (c) furnish to IDA
the evaluation of the pilot program to transfer respornsibility for DOE schools
to the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation by December 31, 1995; and (d) furnish
to IDA an evaluation of the activities of the Punjab Educatiou Foundation
activities by December 31, 1994; (e) establish and staff a Testing Development
Center by July 1, 1993; (f) reorganize the Directorate of Public Instruction
(Schools) into two separate Directorates of Public Instruction, one for
Secondary Education and the other for Elementary Education along with
divisional and district level bifurcation of educational managers by July 1,
1993; (g) establish the Directorate for Staff Development by July 1, 1993;
(h) in conjunction with IDA conduct annual reviews of the middle school
program and agree upon the work program for the next fiscal year and determine
the size of the budgetary provisions to be made in the next year's budget; (i)
recruit 50 qualified supervision staff in the Civil Engineering Cell of the
provincial Department of Education by October 31, 1992 on the understanding
that up to 40X of the construction management works would be contracted out to
the private sector.
11. Conditions of Credit Effectiveness would be: (a) the acquisition of the
first year construction sites for new middle schools, (b) furnishing to IDA
the evaluation of qualified firms for the provision of technical assistance
services, and (c) approval of the PC-1 by the Executive Committee of the
National Economic Council.
12. Environmental Aspect. The project is not expected to have any
significant adverse impact on the environment. It will improve the sanitary
environment of about 1,400 existing schools and provide basic sanitation for
all new ones.
13.   Benefits.  The project would increase middle level enrollment, improvt
the quality of inb_,ruction and the availability and standards of educational
materials, and improve efficiency through better management and



4
administration. Aggregate enrollments at the middle level are expected to
grow by 585,000 between Academic Year (AY) 1991-92 and AY1997-98, an increase
of 38%; rural female enrollment would grow 103%, from 233,000 to 474,000.
Combined with incentives to improve participation of rural girls in further
education, these increases would contribute to alleviating the shortage of
female teachers in rural areas. Py supporting improvements in quality, the
project would maximize the benefits to be gai.ned from elementary education
expenditures, and in particular expenditures on middle schooling, at a time of
severe resource constraints. All of these efforts are expected to improve the
coverage and quality of elementary education in the Punjab and thereby
substantially increase the country's long t--m development prospects.
14.   Risks.  The major risk faced by the project is that cutbacks in
government expenditures on middle school education would jeopardize the
achievement of project targets. In a context of very rapid population growth,
the project supports the minimum investment and recurrent expenditure needed
to allow an increase in the rural participation rate, improve efficiency, and
improve the quality of instruction to ensure that children acquire the
knowledge and skills needed to become productive workers or to further their
st:udies. The government is firmly committed to these objectives, and has
given assurances that it would provide the necessary budgetary resources to
meet the investment and recurrent costs of the agreed middle school program.
A subsidiary risk is that the government may have difficulties in carrying out
the physical and institutional objectives of such a large program. However,
the Punjab Government's physical implementation capacity has improved during
the implementation of the on-going IDA assisted project (PEP3), and would be
further strengthened in the proposed project. To minimize institutional
constraints, the organization and management of elementary education would be
strengthened through technical assistance. The project would also consolidate
and extend programs that previously proved successful, by strengthening
existing line agencies.
15. Reco_mmendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
