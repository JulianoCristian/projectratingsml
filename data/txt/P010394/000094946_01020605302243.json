Consultation with\n            stakeholders should be extensive during project design, for\n            had the Department of Education participated in the design\n            of training needs, its success would have been even greater.\n            The contents of a project should be fully integrated into\n            the government's strategic plan for the sector, to\n            avoid, as in this project, the lack of understanding by\n            stakeholders, particularly at the district level, on the\n            linkages between the project and the Social Action Program -\n            specifically, a program adopted as policy umbrella for\n            elementary education. Institutional capacities should be\n            assessed, and their responsibilities clearly defined at\n            preparation, to avoid inadequacies which will delay\n            implementation, such as the case of the Civil Engineering\n            Cell, who was ill prepared to meet the Bank's reporting\n            requirements. Likewise, the role and responsibilities of\n            both implementing agencies, and key staff should be clearly\n            defined prior to implementation, to avoid accountability misunderstandings."}, "docdt": "2001-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
