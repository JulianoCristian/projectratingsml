PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the National Rural
Development Program (NRDP) Proj^-t--Phase 1, in Malawi. The project was
appraised in December 1977, and for which an IDA Credit, No.857-MAI, for
US$22 million, was approved by the Board on November 18, 1978. The Credit
was closed on June 30, 1986, two years and nine months behind the original
schedule; an unused balance of US$2.89 million was cancelled.
This phase of NRDP was supported by IDA and four other donors,
including the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), for whom
IDA was the Administrator. Although joint donor supervisions had been
envisaged at appraisal, this did not prove to be practicable, and there had
not been much exchange of information between the donors during implesenta-
tion. Consequently the PCR relates mainly to the IDA/CIDA financed portion
of the project.
The PCR has been prepared by staff of the Southern Agriculture
Division in the Eastern and Southern Africa Projects Department. It has
been based on a review of basic documents (including Staff Appraisal Report
No.2075 dated November 13, 1978, President's Report No.2377 dated November
6, 1978, relevant a'greements, correspondence with the Borrower, and
supervision reportfi), data gathered during a specific PCR mission in
October-November 1985, information received from officials of the Ministry
of Agriculture in Malawi, and interviews with Bank staff associated with
the project.
A draft PCR was sent to the Borrower in March 1987, for comments;
none were received.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

NATIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - PHASE I
(CREDIT 857-MAI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
1.        Objectives.  The National Rural Development Program (NRDP) of
Malawi represented a refocussing of rural development through a national
strategy as distinct from the previous discrete area based operations.
NRDP continued with multi-component, cross-ministerial activities, but
while the earlier rural development projects had been intensive, NRDP was
to be extensive in terms of staffing and investment levels. By providing
inputs, credit and other services for smallholder prodaction, NRDP-Phase I
was designed to improve crop yields and to thereby maintain self-
sufficiency in staple foods, expand agricultural exports and increase
smallholder incomes.
2.        Implementation experience and results.  The project was
successful in:
(a) spearheading a desirable geographical reorganization based
largely on ecological considerations, dividing the country
into Agricultural Development Divisions (ADDs) and their
sub-divisions;
(b) reorienting the management of the extension service to
enable better coverage, supervision and staff training; and
Cc) increasing crop production in some areas.
The project also enabled the reorganization of the service departments of
the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) in line with the ADD coneept. It
contributed to the strengthening of institutional arrangements for
agricultural price determination, and introduction of appropriate pricing
policies.
3.        Despite its successes, the project suffered from organizational
and management shortcomings, continuous staff turn-over, and inadequate
allocation of funds for recurrent expenses. Project implementation was
delayed by over two years as compared to the original schedule, due to the
above reasons which particularly delayed project start-up; there were also
inordinate delays in procurement. For the IDA/CIDA part of NRDP-I the
appraisal estimates of project costs proved to be reasonably accurate.
4.        The predicted increases in crop yields were not achieved.  Due to
lack of data the economic rate of return from the project could not be
re-estimated, although this will be substantially lower than that expected
at appraisal.



- vi -
5.        IDA's performance in respect of this project has been generally
satisfactory, although coordination of supervision with the four other
donors could not be achieved.  IDA assisted satisfactorily in project
preparation; and supervision missions helped the Borrower/MOA in
identifying operational problems and defining possible solutions, even
though the supervision efforts were somewhat narrowly focussed due to the
complexity of the project.
6.        Sustainability.  NRDP I was intended to be the first phase of an
ambitious 20-year development program. Subsequently there have been four
follow-up projects (NRDP Phases II-V).
7.        Findings and lessons.
(a) A complex project like this one puts heavy and often
unreasonable demands on the management and organizational
capabilities of the implementing agencies (paras 5.06 and
6.02).
(b) It is difficult to effectively integtate non-agricultural
components into a rural development project. Such projects
should be comprised of core direct production-related
activities. Essential complementary infrastructure
investments should be carried out by the relevant specialist
agencies (para 6.01).
(c)  Project design should have taken into account realistic
assessments of: (i) management and statf availability, and
motivation within the career structures of relevant
agencies; (ii) current and potential funding constraints;
and (iii) the capabilities of important agencies providing
services and supplies to the project (para 6.02).
(d) Technical packages must be appraised in detail to ensure the
availability of proven on-farm improvements for major crops
to justify investments in extension service and infra-
structure (para 6.04).
(e) Long-term recurrent resource constraints should determine
current investment levels for projects which generate little
direct revenue (para 6.07).

Project Completion Report
I. BACKGROUND
1.01      In the early years of independence the Government of Malawi (GOM)
adopted an agricultural development strategy which focussed on improvements
to extension and farmer training services. However, by the late 1960's it
had been decided to pursue this objective through a comprehensive inte-
grated development approach, which led to the Lilongwe, Shire Valley,
Karonga and Lakeshore Rural Development Projects (RDPs). These projects
were all multi-component and included provision of infrastructure (roads,
markets and input stores, water and health facilities, offices and staff
houses, etc.), agricultural extension and land improvements, farmer and
staff training, credit for agricultural inputs, animal disease control and
livestock stallfeeder programs, forestry and research. Although the
projects were carried out by the Department of Agriculture in the (then)
Ministry of Economic Affairs (subsequently in the Ministry of Agriculture)
the projects also included financing of activities that would otherwise
have been the responsibility of other ministries. Rural roads were
constructed, sometimes by the Ministry of Works and Supplies and sometimes
by the Department of Agriculture; health centers were also built by
agricultural staff. Rural water supplies were installed and staff and
supporting infrastructure from other ministries, such as community develop-
ment, were financed under these ru..al development projects.
1.02      Arrangements varied somewhat for the operation and maintenance of
the infrastructure, but generally the department or ministry normally
responsible was expected to take over the buildings and civil works. These
RDPs were intensive in terms of the numbers of activities and services
financed, and the amounts of financing and the staffing levels. Investment
(in constant 1985 terms) per benefitting farm family ranged from US$900 for
the Shire Valley to US$3,180 for Karonga and Chitipa. The projects aimed
to bring about improved standards of living and increased income to farmers
through concentrating extension efforts. The Shire Valley first phase
project, for example, planned an extension worker to farm family ratio of
1:10 in the early years reducing to 1:30 in later years: the Karonga
project planned for ratios ranging from 1:30 to 1:100 over a five year
period. In comparison, ratios in non-project areas were 1:1,500-2,000.
1.03      Organizationally the four RDPs were all discrete entities within
Government.  Project management and staff formed distinct units in the
Department of Agriculture, sepArate from other operations; in the first ten
years of the projects higher levels of project management were staffed
mainly by eApatriates.  Only when a project was in its later phase and was
to be incorporated into the central revenue budget was consideration given
to absorbing project management Into the regular ministry structure.
1.04      Th'e characteristics of these RDPs - multi-component, intensive,
discrete and separate from Government - reflected both a philosophical
approach to rural development and a recognition of the practical problems.

At the time, emphasis on integrated projects was popular, where poverty
would be attacked and constraints to development removed on many fronts.
The benefits from one sector would spill over and provide benefits to
another; for example, providing rural water supplies would improve health
and reduce the time fetching water, thus releasing labor for agricultural
production. At the same time provision of extension advice and credit
would allow yield increases. Organizing all these investments under one
management unit was not only necessary to ensure proper coordination but
was also dictated by the inability of other ministries to plan and carry
out their own projects in rural areas.
1.05      The record of the RDPs' impact on production was mixed.  With a
few exceptions, appraisal targets were not realized.  In some cases yields
were not as high as projected, but more often it was the utritake rate of
input packages that fell short of expectations. However, the RDPs showed
that suitable technical packages were available for a number of cash crops
(cotton, tobacco, hybrid maize, rice) and that these packages were adopted
by farmers if: (a) they were able to assure themselves first of a food
supply; (b) the returns were sufficient to justify the investment; (c)
there was adequate and timely supply of inputs, and (d) there was access to
markets for the output.
1.06      The transition from discrete area based rural development
projects to the National Rural Development Program (NRDP) was a logical
evolution in the development process, and in 1978 NRDP was officially
launched as a national strategy to spread the benefits of rural development
more rapidly throughout the country. NRDP would continue with multi-
component, cross-ministerial activities but where the earlier RDP's had
been intensive, NRDP would be extensive in terms of staffing and investment
levels. NRDP was conceived ini the context of prevailing assumptions.
First, it was assumed that technical packages were available,although it
was recognized that research would need additional support in due course
(USAID was asked to consider a project). Second, it was recognized that
pricing was important in providing sufficient incentives to farmers and
that pricing policies would have to be clearly defined and regularly
examined for their impact on production incentives. Finally, NRDP's design
was based on the belief that the synergy from simultaneous investments in
many sectors was an important aspect of agricultural development.
Experience would show that the first assumption was overly optimistic, that
the second would greatly outweigh the impact of any other intervention and
that the last was hard to organize, manage and maintain on the ground.
1.07      It was recognized at the time that for the national rural
development effort to be effective in the long term, the management of the
program would eventually have to be integrated with the Government's
routine structure. To support this thrust Malawi was divided into 180
Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) by natural resource endowment. EPAs were
then aggregated into 40 development areas (DAs) and 8 agricultural develop-
ment divisions (ADDs). Development areas were ranked for selection on the
basis of: (a) potential; (b) food situation; (c) apparent farmer initia-
tive; (d) population; (e) accessibility; and (f) maintaining a balance
between regions as permitted by resources. NRDP also envisaged a
strengthening of MOA's headquarters management capability (to provide
policy direction and specialized services to NRDP field offices),
establishing management units in the ADDs, followed by gradual delegation

of powers to ADDs and then to DAs. This new structure applied only to
strictly "agricultural" activities, with research, veterinary and forestry
remaining as separate services.
11. FORMULATION AND APPRAISAL 1/
2.01      The Malawi Government proposals for a Phase I of NRDP were
developed with the assistance of staff from the Bank's Resident Mission in
Nairobi. These proposals envisaged support for each of the eight ADD
Management Units (i.e. the establishment of Management Units in every ADD)
and for ten selected Development Areas, while strengthening the Central
Services of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). DAs were selected on the
basis of spreading impact (high population density and geographical
coverage) and development need (conservation and technical problems, and
poor infrastructure).
2.02      A siX member !DA appraisal mission visited Malawi in November
1977. Although it was decided to retain the thrust of the Government
project proposal, the mission adjusted the Project's scope to match the
available funding and staff. Project support was identified for
strengthening of MOA's Central Services, establishment of Farm Management
Units and eight new Development Areas as well as completing the
consolidation phase of the Lilongwe Land Development Project. The
project's Development Areas covered 5,870 square miles with 184,000
families, while the LLDP consolidation phase affected 1,800 square miles
and 103,000 families. The main objectives of the Project were: (i) an
increase in the number of families applying improved practices - 82,000
were expected to participate; (ii) provision of advice and credit to
participating farmers so thac over 316,000 acres (33% of the cropped area)
would receive inputs: (iii) provision of increased health and
infra-structural services; and (iv) completion of land survey, registration
and extension development effort in Lilongwe to the benefit of 103,000
families. The Project was to provide specifically for:
(a) Strengthening of MOA's Central Services capacity to supervise
and implement the program, evaluate results and plan future
projects;
(b) Strengthening the technical, accounting, evaluation and
management capacities of the Management Units at Lilongwe,
Mzuzu, Zomba and Blantyre as well as construction of some
associated buildings and offices;
(c) Strengthening of services and provision of infrastructure in
eight new development areas, namely: Thiwi-Lifidzi, Ntcheu
(Lilongwe ADD), Mzimba, Henga Valley (Mzuzu ADD), Nehisi
(Kasungu ADD), Phalombi, Mwanza (Blantyre ADD) and Kawinga
(Zomba ADD); and
1/ Phase I of NRDP ("The Project") was a US$66.0 million investment with
85 percent of the costs provided by IDA and four other donors. This
PCR, however, focuses mainly on those components jointly financed by
IDA and CIDA as shown in Table 2 below.

(d) Provision of a consolidation phase of the Lilongwe Land
Development Project.
2.03      The total cost of the project was estimated at MK54.8 million
(US$66 million) of which about MK21.8 million (US$26.2 million or 40%)
would represent foreign exchange .'see Table 1).

IDA was to finance 33 percent of total costs split as follows: staff and
operating costs, 59 percent; buildings, 16 percent; vehicles and equipment,
10 percent; roads, 8 percent; and agricultural credit, 7 percent.
2.05      To ensure that the project's technical interventions would
operate in a supportive economic environment, GOM and IDA agreed on the
establishment of a Pricing Advisory Committee and on a process for defining
a marketing and pricing policy, with an annual review of producer prices.
The pricing committee comprised members from Treasury, MOA, ADMARC and the
Office of the President and Cabinet, and would submit its recommendations
to the Board of ADMARC for consideration by the Minister of Agriculture.
In addition, GOM and IDA agreed that an increasing share of Project
operating costs would be transferred to the revenue account according to an
agreed schedule.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01      Negotiations were held in Washington D.C. during the week of
September 9th 1978 and the Project was subseouently approved by the Board
of IDA on November 18, 1978. Due mainly to the time required to meet the
cross effectiveness clauses with the three co-financing agencies, the
project did not become effective until April 5, 1979.



- 7 -
3.02      The project started slowly as a result of organizational and
management shortcomings. The main problems were: (a) delays in creating
posts and filling them; (b) shortage of staff, particularly at the manage-
ment level; (c) an inappropriate organizational structure at the top (d)
shortage of counterpart funds; and (e) frequent transfers of management and
senior extension staff. The large number of donors involved and frequent
donor.visits also reduced staff time on early implementation activities.
Revisions
3.03      The difficulties with NRDP management required several changes to
the project organization structure during its life (para. 3.04). In
addition, funds for domestic water supplies in Lilongwe were transferred to
road maintenance (para. 3.21) and some project savings were used to fund
extra studies (para. 3.25).
3.04      Project Organization.  The organizational integration of NRDP's
management structure into the Ministry of Agriculture was not successful
and was a primary cause for implementation delays that required the project
closing date to be extended by three years. The original arrangement for
the Chief Agricultural Development Officer (CADO) to be responsible for
overall project implementation overloaded this officer and conflicted with
his technical responsibil'ties. During the project's life, responsibility
for NRDP coordination was transferred to a Deputy Permanent Secretary and
finally to the Controller of Agricultural Services. The initial management
hiatus in the Ministry of Agriculture meant that the newly established ADDs
received little or no early guidance, and project activities such as
procurement and staffing were delayed. In addition, the much needed
inter-ministry liaison on NRDP matters was lacking and the difficulties
already identified in the area based RDPs remained. However,the inerfia at
MOA's headquarters did necessitate a more aggressive approach in the ADDs'
Management Units and, despite some senior staff shortages, the development
of MUs was satisfactory.
Implementation Results
3.05      Institutional Development.  NRDP I aimed to improve MOA's Central
Services (planning, land husbandry, road construction, marketing, and
accounting) by providing incremental staff, technical assistance, training,
equipment and infrastructure. As a result, satisfactory progress was made
in the organization and operation of the accounting and control systems for
NRDP projects; procedures for the credit program were reviewed and
streamlined; land use planning and resources survey capability were
developed; and MOA's construction unit was expanded. The experience in
implementing the road, input supply, health and domestic water supply
components (see below) demonstrates the difficulties of effectively
integrating non-agricultural components into a rural development program,
either by establishing a specific unit within the implementing agency (as
in the case of roads) or coordinating the activities of implementing
agencies which are administratively independent of the core executing
agency.
3.06      Roads Construction and Improvement.  An NRDP construction unit
was established for the road program. Out of the proposed 445 miles of
improved, designed and estate type roads to be built in Thiwi-Lifidzi,



-8-
Ntcheu and Mzimba-Rukuru, 347 miles (78%) were constructed. About
40 percent of these roads are now being maintained by the Ministry of Works
and Supplies (MOW), while the remainder of the project roads are not
maintained by MOW due to insufficient recurrent funds. The cost of the
roads constructed under NRDP I, including bridges, was MK10,400 per mile,
as opposed to the appraisal estimate of MK3,800 per mile, an increase of
265 percent. Cost increases were due to rising fuel costs, changes in
original road plans and terrain difficulties. In addition, it now appears
that preparation of the roads component was inadequate, having been based
on only aerial photography and past experience. Adjustments had to be made
to the appraisal targets based on the subsequent mapping and route surveys
which guided the road construction.
3.07      Lilongwe Land Development Projects:  Land Registration.  The land
survey, demarcation and registration component for these project areas,
started earlier under IDA credits 113, 244 and 550-MAI, was not completed,
mainly due to lack of staff and transport. Although progress was slow, it
was only in April, 1984 that the program, including staff and transport,
was transferred from LADD Management to the Department of Lands and
Valuation. IDA could have been more persuasive in support of its earlier
transfer and in the provision of personnel and transport. The Evaluation
Section, with the assistance of the Agricultural Economics Section at the
Chitedze Agricultural Research Station, conducted a survey in August 1983
to assess the effectiveness of the land registration program. Preliminary
conclusions showed that land registration provided people with a feeling of
land ownership and better control of land use. The village headmen are an
effective means of informing farmers about land registration and their
assistance will be essential for the success of similar programs in the
future.
3.08      Extension Services.  NRDP I aimed at improving the effectiveness
of the extension services by placing Subject Matter Specialists (SMS) and
Supervisory Staff at the Project level, and by reducing the extension/
farmer ratio from 1 TA: 1,500 - 2,000 farm families (FF) to 1 TA: 750 FF.
The appraisal mission's staffing projection of one professional officer, 56
technical officers and 384 TA additional posts has been achieved.
3.09      Inadequate staffing of the senior level posts with experienced
personnel to carry out project activities was a constraint throughout
project implementation. This was mainly due to lengthy procedures required
for creating and establishing positions, and delays in placing the staff in
the project areas. Added to this, the frequent transfer of staff to other
projects or for training was a problem, for er.ample in the Mzuzu ADD there
were over the project period four changes of project officers, three new
program managers and five changes of crop specialists. Such situations
were not unusual in the project. The combined effect of these problems was
considerable disruptions of program implementation.
3.10      In the 1981/82 season, the new Block Extension System - BES (a
modified T & V system) was introduced in the Mzuzu ADD. This was followed
in 1982/83 by the introduction of the same methodology in the Thiwi-
Lifidzi, Ntcheu and Lilongwe project areas. Currently the schedule for
each extension worker includes eight "visit" days in each fortnight and one
training day a month. The introduction of the BES imposed a high degree of
discipline, coordination and planning on extension staff who had been
working previously on an unstructured, ad hoc basis, and has been well



-9-
received by these staff.  it is considered a  great improvement over the
old system of visits to only creditworthy farmers, who also tended to be
the larger scale farmers. About 80 percent of the blocks have constructed
a meeting house for extension meetings. One of the major weaknesses of the
system and the Project was the perceived absence of technical packages
other than the standard one for hybrid maize; this problem was compounded
by poor linkages between research and extension services. In fact, useful
research information on other crops is available but is not apparently
known to the managers of the extension service. This problem is now being
corrected through establishment of "Adaptive Research Teams" under the
National Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 1549-MAI).
3.11      During this PCR mission, several groups of farmers were
interviewed. Investigations indicate that farmers know their extension
assistants by name, and know what fertilizers to use and how much to
apply. However, the impact of the extension service and the scope of its
activities would be much greater if the smallholder could use a maize
hybrid that would be suitable for consumption as well as for sale. Such a
hybrid would increase production and release land for other crops.
3.12      Supply of Agricultural Inputs.  The supply and uptake of
agricultural inputs (fertilizers, improved seeds and agricultural
chemicals) was well below both appraisal estimates and demand in all years
until the middle 1980s when the Project was originally intended to have
been completed. Thus, for Lilongwe, which was expected to take almost 90
percent of the fertilizer financed under the project, total supplies over
the five years 1978/79 to 1982/83 were only 35 percent of appraisal
estimates (Annex 1, Table 3). Problems related both to the delayed
deliveries and to the suitability of fertilizers supplied. Similiarly,
only about a third of the maize seed and half the cotton seed projected
were supplied in Lilongwe. Comparable or worse shortfalls were experienced
by the other areas funded by the project. For maize, the shortfalls were
particularly damaging in 1981/82 when production in Lilongwe was half the
previous year's level. Financing and management problems in ADMARC were
responsible in the early years, compounded later by the deterioration and
eventual closure of the traditional import transport routes through
Mozambique. These problems were pursued in the context of project super-
vision, but real improvements had to wait until the issues were taken up by
the Bank in the context of structural adjustment discussions (ADMARC
management), the Smallholder Fertilizer Project (Credit 1352-MAI)
(fertilizer supplies and funding) and the Northern Corridor Project
(alternative transport routes).
3.13      As part of the Government contribution to the Project, ADMARC was
to undertake the construction of 6 permanent markets and 7 input stores in
Mzimba-Rukuru, Thiwi-Lifidzi and Ntcheu from its own resources. However,
because of financial constraints, ADMARC was unable to construct any of the
above markets and sheds during project execution. Delays continued even
after GOM made resources available to MOW. It would have been easier and
cheaper in the long run to have had these facilities constructed through
other means, possibly by private contractors, and turn them over to ADMARC
for its use.
3.14      Credit.  In general, the seasonal credit system and its operation
was satisfactory. Because all credit is now channelled through farmers'
clubs, credit administration is easier and repayments are excellent, over



- 10 -
98%, mainly due to collective liability and peer pressure. In 1979/80, in
the four DAs, there were 1,804 farmers' clubs with some 69,794 members; in
comparison in 1983/84 there were 2,200 farmer clubs with 62,565 members, an
increase of 22% in clubs but a decrease of 10% in me..ibership (Annex 1,
Table 10). This decline of membership is due to the more rigorous selec-
tion process in forming the clubs. During the same period, the amount of
seasonal loans increased from MK1.8 million to MK5.1 million (280 per-
cent). However, credit processing continues to be a time consuming task
for the extension staff. In order to make more efficient use of TA's time,
credit processing activity needs to be carried out during the slack agri-
cultural season. The development of the credit club approach greatly
increased the number of potential beneficiaries of the Project.
3.15      In contrast, use of medium-term credit remained well below
appraisal estimates and recorded repayments have been about half, partly
because of inadequate recording procedures. Low demand was mainly due to
the lack of dairy animals and the high price of implements. Credit issues
perhaps received less supervision attention than warranted and this is
being corrected in supervisior, of )ther NRDP projects.
3.16      Supply of seed or, credit was low in Lilongwe, but better in the
other three RDPs (except £or groundnuts and tobacco) because the demand was
less and ADMARC could easily fulfill requests. Nationally, fertilizer and
other input purchases by smallholders is equally divided between cash and
credit purchase, but Lilongwe farmers favor cash purchases.
3.17      Animal Health and Production Services.  The Project supported the
improvement of livestock production through disease control, stall feeding
and dairy programs. Out of the six dip tanks planned at project appraisal,
four were constructed in the Ntcheu and Thiwi-Lifidzi RDPs. Two of the
dips were considered unnecessary due to availability of dips nearby.
According to progress reports, about 75% of the zattle within a five mile
radius of the dip tanks are being dipped on a regular basis. The farmers
are paying MKO.50 as a dipping fe( per animal/year.
3.18      The stallfeeding and dairy component of the program fell short of
expectations. The appraisal report estimated an increase in the stallfeed-
ing program throughput from an average of 1,575 to 2,033 stallfeeders per
annum during the project period. Although the Lilongwe RDP reached about
100% of the appraisal target, the Thiwi-Lifidzi and Ntcheu RDPs reached
only 20% of appraisal estimates, mainly due to a lack of steers. At
appraisal it was estimated that about 400 dairy cattle would be introduced
in the Lilongwe and Thiwi-Lifidzi RDPs. In practice, insufficient heifers
were available and most of the animals introduced were steers.
3.19      The Project provided funds for the Dzalanyama Ranch to purchase
breeding stock and for agreed associated operating costs for the continued
development of the ranch. During implementation it was determined that the
carrying capacity of the ranch was only two thirds of the appraisal
estimate and this depressed financial prospects, The Government agreed
that disbursements related to these expenditures would be conditional on
the adjustment of producer meat prices such that the ranch would make a
profit. While producer meat prices were raised in 1980, they did not
produce the anticipated cash flow results and disbursements on this
component were suspended,



- 11 -
3.20      Health Facilities.  This component was implemented satisfac-
torily. The planned health facilities (3 health centres and 3 maternity
shelters) were completed on time and transferred to the Ministry of
Health. The centers are functioning reasonably well. It is reported that
basic drugs and medical materials are being supplied regularly.
3.21      Domestic Water Supply.  Out of the 40 boreholes planned for Mzuzu
and Ntcheu RDPs at appraisal, only 17 were constructed. Delays occurred
mainly due to lack of construction capacity in the Department of Land
Valuation and Water (DLVW), which was responsible for the implementation of
this component. (In 1984 the water supply program was transferred to
MOWS). In FY 1983/84, the Mzuzu ADD transferred to DLVW an amount of MK
65,000 for the construction of 14 boreholes. All the boreholes were
drilled but the fitting of four of them has yet to be completed. Because
of Government's priority to upgrade the roads program in Lilongwe RDP,
resources were transferred to the roads construction program and as a
result none of the aprons planned for 87 boreholes were constructed. GOM
will complete these borehole aprons with its own resources.
3.22      Although tree nurseries were established and seedlings
distributed, there is no data of area planted to trees to compare to
appraisal estimates. However, young trees growing around the villages are
reportedly the result of project activity.
3.23      Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) System.  The M and E system,
although strengthened, has yet to meet all of its objectives. The main
problem is lack of capability to interpret and evaluate the data, not a
lack of data itself. Under NRDP I, and subsequent NRDP projects, consider-
able investments have been made to build up a monitoring and evaluation
capacity in both MOA/HQ and ADDs to monitor and evaluate progress and
achievements of NRDP projects and to provide NRDP management at all levels
with topical information on problems as they arise. In response to
recommendations by supervision missions and at Government's request, the
Bank provided in mid 1985 one month of staff technical assistance and
coordinated a seminar for program managers and evaluation officers to
further strengthen M and E. Even so the system does not yet produce
adequate information on project status and impact for use by management.
For example, in some EPAs, yields of hybrid and composite maize have
dropped during the project period as compared to appraisal estimates, but
whether this represents a real decline or whether baseline estimates had
been over-estimated is not known. Similarly little is known about the
distinction between program induced production stimuli and external
influences. Also little has been done to distinguish between farmers
participating in Project activities and non-participants, in order to
isolate the direct impact of the Project on production and yields.
Studies and Performance of Consultants
3.24      Two studies were planned at appraisal: (a) organization of the
credit program, and (b) cost-minimization of the extension service. In
reality, the extension service study was a by-product of the credit study.
The recommendations on extension have been adopted; however, only a few of
the recommendations of these studies were implemented because the
Government did not agree with the study's central recommendation to
establish a new credit Institution separate from MOA.



- 12 -
3.25      In addition, the IDA Credit financed the following studies and
surveys for the preparation of national strategies, programs or new
projects: (a) aerial photography and orthophotography mapping to improve
land husbandry and resource protection activity; (b) a review of the
National Agricultural Research Program and the development of a master
plan; tc) planning and rehabilitation of irrigation schemes; (d) agro-
industrial development; and (e) a manpower and training needs analysis for
extension staff. All were successfully completed except the agro-industry
study (which was not of adequate quality and is being revised by the
consultants) and the aerial photography study which, due to weather
difficulties, was only 90% completed.
3.26      Consultants (financial analysts, economists, etc.) hired for
project implementation performed satisfactorily, particularly in the early
years of the project when there was a shortage of Malawians to man the
various posts.
Project Cost, Financing and Disbursement
3.27      Data on actual total project cost (estimated at US$66 million at
appraisal) is not available. The IDA/CIDA part of the project was
estimated to cost US$24.7 million (Annex 1, Table 1). Appraisal cost
estimates proved to be reasonably accurate with the exception of civil
works. Project expenditure was 82% of estimates, mainly because of the
non-construction of training facilities (Falls Estate) and savings from
staff vacancies at project start-up. The poor use of funds (40%) in land
husbandry was due to delay and non-completion of the component. The
sevenfold increase in funding for studies supported a deliberate move by
GOM to develop national stra'egies for its future investment programs. The
lower costs for the Lilongwe MU and the four RDPs was due to savings from
staff vacancies and non-replacement of vehicles.
3.28      Appraisal estimates of allocation of funds, revised estimates,
and actual withdrawals are given in Annex 1, Table 2. Out of the total
US$22.0 million and US$2.6 million (IDA and CIDA, respectively), US$19.1
million (86.6%) and all of the CIDA US$2.6 million were disbursed. This
left US$2.9M for cancellation.
3.29      Provision of operating funds at the desired level continues to be
a problem. The Credit Agreement stipulated transferring an increasing
share of the annual operating costs to the revenue account - up to 80% in
Lilongwe and 20% in the other DAs by Year 5 of the Project. Actual
takeover, however, has been less than planned due to shortage of domestic
funds. In the absence of increased allocations of operating funds, the
effectiveness of the services and infrastructure created under the Project
is likely to decline.
3.30      Disbursement has been delayed (see data sheet) due to slow
implementation and slow handling of procurement.
Procurement
3.31      Serious problems were experienced with procurement, especially
delays which resulted from the Ministry of Agriculture's inability to
prepare procurement documents and evaluate bids effectively. Further
training in procurement for MOA staff would be beneficial.



- 13 -
Reporting, Accounting, Auditing, and Compliance with Covenants
3.32      An elaborate progress reporting system was instituted which
proved to be very cumbersome and therefore ineffective as a management
tool. Supervision missions, however, suggested cutting back to
essentials. The accounting system in MOA needs further improvement,
focusing particularly on: (a) reconciling physical and recorded
inventories, (b) introducing internal auditing, and (c) more timely
completion of accounts.
3.33      The Credit Agreement stipulated submission of audited reports six
months after the end of the fiscal year. Audit reports have generally been
delayed; the project accounts by between one and two years and SOEs by up
to one year due to late submission to the Auditor General (AG) and further
delays in the overburdened office of the AG.
3.34      All other covenants have been complied with, except for Section
3.08, since maintenance of all project roads has not yet been assumed by
MOW.
IV. PROJECT IMPACT
Agricultural Impact
Maize
4.01      The cropping pattern throughout the project area was dominated by
maize. Production of maize increased considerably in Lilongwe RDP over the
project period, although incremental maize production was negative in most
years in the other three RDPs. In Lilongwe estimated incremental maize
production was more than three times the appraisal estimate, while for the
project as a whole it was more than twice the level expected at appraisal
(Annex I Tables 8 and 9). The good performance in Lilongwe was due to many
factors, including the high potential of the land in this area, the effect
of earlier investments, and the impact of higher producer prices. Thus,
much of the incremental production was not attributable to the project.
4.02      The failure to achieve incremental maize production targets in
Ntcheu, Thiwi-Lifidzi and Mzimba-Rukuru was explained partly by the poor
natural resources (soils, rainfall, etc) in these areas. For instance, in
Mzimba Rukuru about 170,000 ha have sandy soils which cannot produce
reasonable yields without adequate fertilizer. Consequently, appraisal
yield expectations in these three RDPs were unrealistically high.
4.03      The project was expected to bring about increased maize produc-
tion primarily through improving yields. This was to be achieved through
the adoption of improved husbandry and the use of more productive varieties
(hybrid and composite) and more fertilizer. The actual impact of the
project in improving productivity seems to have been limited. For each
category of maize (hybrid, composite and local) yields appear to have been
no higher at the end of the project than they were at the beginning (Annex
1, Table 6). However, there were significant increases in the areas
planted with both improved and local maize (Annex 1, Table 4). Although
part of this increase was almost certainly attr butable to more attractive



- 14 -
prices for maize, some of the increase in the area planted with improved
varieties was probably due to the impact of the project. Use of
fertilizers was well below expectations (Annex 1, Table 3).
4.04      There is evidence that most farmers did not follow recommended
practices fully and this reduced yields (Annex 1, Tables 3 and 4). For
instance, hybrid and composite maize were often not given adequate
fertilizer. Many farmers appear to have been unwilling to follow the
extension service's recommendations, due to a combination of factors, such
as shortages of seed, lack of cash, and aversion to risk.
4.05      Extensive interviews with farmers during the PCR mission
confirmed that there is a decided taste preference for local maize compared
with hybrids. Furthermore, interviews with women farmers confirmed that
present hybrid maize varieties suffer from poor storability, while they are
difficult to pound by hand and produce a lower proportion of flour than
local varieties. Hybrid maize is, however, grown as a cash crop for sale
to ADMARC. Currently, research has embarked on a program to develop more
suitable hybrid varieties, while an expansion in the use of village maize
mills will be required to alleviate processing problems. Two improved
hybrids (MH14 and MH16) are currently at the final testing stage in
Lilongwe. However, development of hybrids with specific taste characteris-
tics will be time consuming and adoption of hybrid maize will probably
continue to be slow until this has been done.
Groundnuts
4.06      The project achieved very little with groundnuts production, for
in four of the six years for which data were available incremental produc-
tion was negative (Annex 1, Table 8).  In part, this was dle to the
prevailing unattractive prices for groundnuts. During the course of the
project groundnut yields have not increased; in fact, they have shown some
tendency to decline (Annex 1, Table 6). For groundnuts the project had no
recommended improved input package and farmers were only advised to adopt
better cultural practices. In 1983/84 and 1984/85 producer prices for
groundnuts were increased by 49% and 27% respectively in order to stimulate
production.
Tobacco
4.07      The project was more successful with tobacco.  In Lilongwe, the
main tobacco growing area under the project, annual incremental production
at the end of the project period was estimated to have reached 3,600 tons,
the same as the appraisal estimate at full development. However, tobacco
production declined in the other two tobacco producing areas, Thiwi-Lifidzi
and Mzimba-Rukuru (Annex 1, Table 6). As with maize, tobacco production
was encouraged through significant increases in producer prices - 71% for
1983/84 and a further 42% in 1984/85.
Economic Impact
4.08      At appraisal it was expected that the IDA financed agricultural
components of the project would show an economic rate of return (ERR) of



- 15 -
43%. This high rate of return was attributable partly to the high sunk
costs from earlier interventions in the project area.
4.09      Due to serious data li4Atations it has not been possible to
reestimate a reliable ERR for NRDP, although it is clear that the economic
results have been nubstantially below expectations. In the case of
Thiwi-Lifidzi; Ntcheu, and Mzimba it seems likely that their economic rates
of return will be negative, for annual incremental production of the three
principal crops has been negative in each of these areas throughout the
project period (Annex 1, Table 8). However, due to its impact on maize and
tobacco production Lilongwe would show a positive ERR, probably in the
range of 5-10%.
4.10      Despite the disappointing quantifiable economic performance, the
project has had significant other benefits.   Farm to market roads have
been improved, trees have been planted for timber and fuelwood, health
services have been extended, and, most important, institutions for further
agricultural development have been established and strengthened.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
5.01      From proœect identification onwards in the early 1970s staffing
constraints in MOA were recognized as potentially limiting the pace of
rural development. Through technical assistance and training the Project
was to overcome these problems, particularly for MOA's Central services,
and NRDP 1 was seen as the main mechanism for improving planning, prepara-
tion, and monitoring of rural development projects.  Even so, the
effectiveness of the Central Service was reduced, especially early on, by
the inability of Government to fill, and keep filled, some important
posts. Rapid turnover of staff was in general a significant constraint.
Central services have continued to need support from external sources,
including under the current IDA assisted Extension and Planning Support
Project (Credit 1626-MAI).
5.02      The reorganization of some of MOA's service departments in line
with the ADD concept and the development of the ADDs' management units is a
significant contribution of NRDP I. NRDP strengthened four of the eight
Agricultural Development Divisions' Management Units and nine Development
Areas in these ADDs. The Agricultural Development Department restructured
its organization to match the ADD concept. This reorganization, with the
attendant decentralization, has facilitated project management.
5.03      The project has contributed to considerable strengthening of the
institutional arrangements for agricultural price determination and the
introduction of more appropriate pricing policies, especially since 1980.
A Pricing Advisory Committee has been established, prices have been review-
ed every year and they have been set at levels which refloct more closely
export or import parity. The Bank has also been consulted during the
annual price review. This process of strengthening pricing procedures has
been continued under the Structural Adjustment Lending Program.



- 16 -
5.04      The establishment of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) units in MOA
and in each ADD was intended to introduce M&E as a routine tool of project
management. Despite the heavy investment made, however, this has not yet
been effective. Much data has been collected by surveys, perhaps too much,
but this has not been routinely processed and evaluated to produce cogent
explanations and advice on implementation issues. For example, the reasons
behind differential rates of adoption of improved technology remain largely
unexplored. M and E operations concentrated almost entirely on the formal
surveys and little was done t address current urgent problems by ad hoc
iivuiries.  These deficiencies have been recognized and further analytical
work is to begin shortly (for all of NRDP) to bring data processing and
evaluation up to date.
5.05      It is apparent that the Project was designed as a large, multi-
faceted thrust to move the rural development process into a wider
geographical area, benefitting large numbers of people, and that the
substantial implementation delays and component shortfalls that resulted
can in part be attributed to the over-ambitious scale of the Project. This
feature, coupled with the large number of cofinanciers. could have been
expected to cause implementation difficulties, even assuming that adequate
program management skills were available; as it was, staffing constraints
were a main issue from the start of preparation. Another weak feature of
project design was the assumption that effective integration of NRDP into
the MOA structure was possible in a short time-frame. Tte previous rural
development projects had been managed by discrete entities which, although
nominally administered by the Department of Agriculture, had imposed a
minimal physical and fiscal burden on DOA management. In addition, most
senior technical and management posts in these projects were occupied by
expatriates in the early years at least, both because local staff were not
available and because employment in rural development projects was probably
not perceived by the Malawi Civil Service as a strong career development
path. Certainly during the identification and early preparation phase
several of the key Malawian participants reportedly embraced the new NRDP
concept less wholeheartedly than IDA staff. The Project demanded a nation-
wide reorientation of agricultural services which would eventually affect
everyone's career in the MOA and it appears in retrospect that the Civil
Service was not completely behind such a change. Even today, nine years
after appraisal, there exist departments in the MOA (Veterinary & Research)
which resist integration with the ADD structure, preferring to maintain
their distinct organizations. Finally, there is a question as to whether
the project design, and manner of presentation, encouraged an attitude to
development which emphasized rural infrastructure construction as an end in
itself rather than as the means and catalyst for raising farm production.
The file documents support this hypothesis as there appears to be little
concern for local level production objectives and technical package
issues, at least until the early 1980s.
Bank Performance
5.06      Bank performance with regard to NRDP I was satisfactory, although
the initial intention to coordinate supervision with the four other donors
was not followed beyond the early supervisions. IDA assisted GOX from
project preparation through supervision, investing a total of 70 field
staff-weeks throughout project execution. IDA assistance in project
preparation and appraisal was satisfactory, although throughout the project
cycle, the pace at which 2he Bank wanted to move was not matched by the



- 17 -
Malawi civil service's commitment to the new NRDP concept. In view of the
recognized weak management and coordination capacity of the MOA,
particularly at the start of the project, the appraisal implementation
schedule was overly optimistic. Insufficient account was also taken of the
extra demands placed on Government staff, while the large number of donors
involved in cthe Project also contributed to delays, Despite the trimming
of the initial proposal at appraisal, the project's size and complexity
made quick start-up and effective coordination difficult. To help
alleviate delays in project start-up, RMEA offered titiely assistance as
needed. Supervision missions have assisted GOM/MOA in identifying
operational problems and defining possible solutions in the field, but
inevitably the complexity of the project meant that supervision was problem
oriented and focussed somewhat by the skills and experience of the Bank
staff concerned. For example, closer expert supervision of the transfer of
the land survey, demarcation and registration component would have been
beneficial and could have resulted in timely completion of the component.
Predominant skills of supervision staff were agriculture and economics
(with a visit each by a financial analyst and a livestock specialist) and
it remains an open question as to whether supervision by other specialists
(roads, buildings, water supply, health) would not have discovered problems
and improved implementation.
5.07      With hindsight, the Bank should have taken up the two issues of
the lack of non-maize technical packages and the partial failure of the M
and E component more aggressively at an earlier date. This is, however, as
much a comment on the problems of implementing and supervising over-complex
projects with limited staff zesources, than a criticism of the supervision
effort itself. The problem of Government's failure to transfer operating
costs according to the agreed plan to the recurrent budget transcends the
project context and, in retrospect, the covenant on this point was
optimistic in expecting that the matter could be handled through the
project alone.
VI. LESSONS LEARNED
6.01      Rural development projects should be less complex in content and
cover less ambitious time slices of long-term programs. Direct production
related activities (e.g. inputs, credit, markets, extension, research)
should form the center of such projects, with judicious selection and
phasing of any essential complimentary investments. Such secondary
investments should be planned and implemented by the relevant specialist
agencies within an overall national stategy for these related sectors.
6.02      Project design for rural development should take intu account
realistic assessments of:
(a) management and staff availability, expertise and motivation
within the existing career structures of relevant agencies
(unless specific changes are to be made to the career
structures);
(b) current and potential recurrent funding constraints and



- 18 -
(c)  the capabilities and commitment of important agencies
delivering services or supplies to the prolect.
6.03      Preparation and start up of programs and projects which involve
major changes of direction in policy and management should not be rushed.
Changes sLauld be implemented by consensus, to avoid passive resistance,
and may take time to take hold. Pushing ahead before changes have been
fully understood, supported and implemented can, as with NRDP, lead to even
greater delays and inefficiencies later.
6.04      Technical packages must be appraised in detail to ensure that
proven viable farm level improvements are available for sufficient
important crops to justify investments in an extension service and
production-related infrastructure. If there is any doubt, a research and
trial phase should precede major investment.
6.65      Too many donors, each with different procedures, financing
closely connected parts of a program can so overload and complicate project
management that implementation suffers.
6.06      Any agency (in this case ADMARC) which is expected to provide an
essential part of the investment package, must be fully tied into the
project's structure and conditionality, and there must be either incentives
or penalties associated with the agency performing its role.
6.07      Projects which generate little direct revenue and therefore
require recurrent funding in perpetuity above the average funding available
for such activities within a country, are in danger of being short lived
once the pressure for ad hoc extra allocations is off after the highly
visible investment stage. Therefore, long-term recurrent resource
constraints should determine investment levels if ephemeral development is
to be avoided.
6.08      An agricultural pricing strategy must be consistent with the
overall development objectives of the agricultural sector. If this is not
done the price responsiveness of smallholder farmers will create unwanted
productive patterns and distortions in resource use (e.g. maize production
in the project areas).
