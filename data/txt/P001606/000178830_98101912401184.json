           Programme. Over a five-year period, it aims to increase\n            output of four major crops (maize, groundnuts, dark-fired\n            and oriental tobacco and rice) and expand production of milk\n            and meat. It would also complete the consolidation phase of\n            the Lilongwe Land Development Programme. About 90,000 farm\n            families would benefit directly from the project which would\n            enable them to increase their annual farm income by at least\n            40 percent. Major risks facing the project are: (i) adoption\n            of improved husbandry practices by farmers may be slower\n            than projected; (ii) fertilizer use may be reduced if the\n            prices of fertilizers rise faster than smallholder producer\n            prices; (iii) dark-fired tobacco may prove difficult to\n            market due to limited world demand."}, "docdt": "1978-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
