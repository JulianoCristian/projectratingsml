Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The second closing extension date of two months starting June 1st, , 2015 which was granted under a special waiver has permitted the completion of all
 remaining works including the major ones in the District of Siguiri (Préfecture de Siguiri). The two months extension is the maximum possible, given that
 the task team was advised that the Parent Trust Fund has to close by the end of November 2015 and the regular extension could not go beyond the end
 of May 2015. As a result of this extension, the grace period will be reduced accordingly and will thus last from August 1st to September 30th , 2015.
 Overall PDO achievement is likely, given that most indicators at this level have been reached or surpassed. In spite of the stabilization of the targeted
 irrigated area (3620 ha rehabilitated in addition to 1000 ha under the first phase of the project); the productivity increase of the covered crops (rice,
 maize and cassava) and the intense advisory services and capacity building to direct beneficiaries (farmers and managing committees of the
 infrastructures), the PDO rating remains moderately satisfactory because the M&E system is not mature enough to convince on the yields measurement
 methodology.
 Regarding the Implementation Progress, it is also rated MS for the following reasons: in spite of the use of inputs, particularly improved seeds of rice,
 maize and the cuttings of a variety of cassava which responds to producers' needs and in spite of the limited access to fertilizers (39% of the target )
 and herbicides (45% of the target) directly provided by the Project, the complementary quantities of fertilizers and herbicides distributed by the
 Government in 2014 and 2015 to the farmers including the project's beneficiaries, are not clearly recorded.

               For the time being only the Confederation des Organisations Paysannes de Guinée (COP-G) is collecting the non-subsidy portion of the
               crops-related inputs (fertilizers, herbicies ) to reconstitute the revolving funds. The amounts in US$ are estimated on the basis of a
               conversion rate of $ 1 = GNF 7250.
               For the seeds the quantities collected in kind are redistributed to new beneficiairies.
               The Confederation Nationale des Eleveurs de Guinée (CONEG) has not yet started the collection related to the poultry inputs.
