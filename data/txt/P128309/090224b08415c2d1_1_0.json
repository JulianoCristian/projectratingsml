were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the project introduced women\u2019s groups to\n            processing and transformation of farm produce through\n            provision of post-harvest processing equipment. Operation of\n            these facilities enabled faster processing times and\n            increased women\u2019s earning potential. But limited support was\n            provided for suitable packaging and repackaging of their\n            products, which affected the marketing and hence the\n            conservation of their processed products. Future projects\n            should endeavor to integrate support for packaging and\n            marketing of groups\u2019 products into the design. In\n            labor-intensive infrastructure work, it is preferable to use\n            local labor to ensure timely delivery of works. The\n            utilization of more local labor proved crucial to the\n            completion of the irrigation schemes in Northern Guinea\n            within the extended timeframe. The project significantly\n            increased local laborers to support the construction and\n            rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure in the Siguiri\n            Prefecture in Northern Guinea. The introduction of\n            technology packages coupled with the requisite training to\n            farmers was effective in increasing production and\n            productivity. PUAPA-2 increased beneficiary farmers\u2019 access\n            to new technologies and inputs, allowing them to increase\n            their production and yields."}, "docdt": "2016-01-28T00:32:03Z"}
