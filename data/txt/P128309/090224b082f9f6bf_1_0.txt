Implementation Status and Key Decisions

  A second closing date extension of two months from May 31 , 2015 was granted under a special waiver in order to allow the completion of remaining
 works. The two months is the maximum possible given that the task team was advised that the Parent Trust Funds has to close by end November 2015
 and the regular extension could not go beyond end of May 2015. Thus the two months extension will in consequence result in the reduction of the grace
 period by the equivalent time.
 The last mission carried out in April noted that the Ebola crisis had a certain limiting impact on some activities of the project, particularly in the Forest
 region of Guinea where catch-up efforts are underway to finish the storage facilities' construction.
 Given the good achievements in yields of the targeted crops as well that the recent progress in the remaining works for rehabilitation of irrigated
 perimeters and construction of storage / drying & treshing facilities, the PDO is likely to be attained.
 Because the implementation is still ongoing and some complementary data need to be collected and reflected in the Results Framework, this ISR will
 be updated around mid July in order to ensure that it reflects all the key achievements of the Project.

 The last mission carried out in April noted that the Ebola crisis had a certain limiting impact on some activities of the project, particularly in the Forest
 region of Guinea where catch-up efforts are underway to finish the storage facilities' construction.
 The areas deserving close attention are: (i) technical reception of the rehabilitated two main irrigation perimeters (1,100 ha ) in the prefecture of Siguiri;
 (ii) complementary measures for satisfactory functionning of 12 water points constructed in the ENAEs and the 8 regional offices of ANPROCA; (iii)
 consolidation of all other remaining activities related to component 1 and component 2, including some capacity building activities in favor of the
 managing committees of the rehabilitated irrigation schemes and of storage facilities as well as appropriate training still ongoing for water users
 associations; (iv) realization off all conditions for the audit covering 7 months' activities in 2015 and 2 months grace period (v) completion of the
 national ICR by end July, 2015.
 As some complementary data need to be collected and reflected in the Results Framework, this ISR will be updated around July 10, 2015 in order to

 Overall Comments
 Please note that for the above indicated percentage of women beneficairies there was an error in the previous ISR where it should be 11%
 instead of 42 %. The updated percentage is 28 % by mid-June 2015 but this number is likely to increase again once the poultry vaccination
 still ongoing and other inputs distribution will be completed.

               The 1100 hectares newly rehabilitated are not accounted in the number in the number of hectares of irrigated rice under improved
               technologies. Actually during, the 2014 rainy season and 2014/2015 irrigated season a total of 3520 ha including 1000 ha rehabilitated by
               the first emergency agriculture support project(PUAPA1) were exploited under improved technologies. With the additional 1100 ha the total
               will be 4620 ha under irrigation with improved technologies during the rainy season 2015 and onward. Nonetheless, the project has reached
               it's target of 3620 hectares rehabilitated.

 Overall Comments
 In reference to the above indicators:
 - For the construction of storage facilities, 23 were launched of which 20 already constructed and works are well advanced regarding the
 remaining three (2 related to the main irrigation schemes under rehabilitation and 1 at Kissidougou -in Forest Guinea where the Ebola crisis has
 imposed to suspend some activities).
 - Regarding the indicator of drying platforms, 40 was indicated in the previous ISR. It was an error and should be corrected and replaced by 0.
 Currently the number achieved is 41 and 6 are under completion, thus totaling 47 out of a target of 40 as revised during the MTR (the original
 was 50).
 - The poultry vaccination has started in March and is ongoing. Although the number of households benefitting of the vaccination is yet to be
 assessed around July 10, 2015 the number of 99773 (54 % of the target) reported so far by the ministry of livestock is a matter of concern.
 - Given the 2nd extension of the closing date for two months and because some activities are still continuing, the task team plans to make a very
 last update of the whole Results Framework around July 10, 2015 which will be subject to prior review of the front office of the AGR GP Director.
