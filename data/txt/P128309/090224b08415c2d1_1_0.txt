   1. Project Context, Development Objective and Design

   1.1 Context at appraisal

1.      Guinea is considered one of the poorest countries in Africa despite its rich natural
resources. In 2007, over 53 percent of Guinea’s population lived below the poverty line. The
poverty rate increased to 58 percent in 2010 due to political instability and as a result of the 2008
global food and fuel crisis. Essential food items such as rice, maize, oil, fish, meat, and vegetables
constituted about 68 percent and 77 percent of national and rural total household consumption
expenditures respectively. The political instability and the impact of the global economic
slowdown worsened Guinea’s macroeconomic performance compared to that of its neighbors.
Lack of fiscal discipline by the military government in 2009, led to a decline in the primary budget
balance from a 2.9 percent surplus in 2008 to 4 percent deficit in 2009; and slow economic growth
resulted in two percent fall in gross domestic product (GDP) over the 2008-2010 period.

2.      To address the food crises, the Government of Guinea (GoG) sought World Bank support.
The Bank responded with the First Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support Project (Projet
d’Urgence d’Appui à la Productivité Agricole, PUAPA-1), a US$5 million Global Food Crisis
Response Program (GFRP) project approved in 2008 and closed on June 30, 2012. PUAPA-1
aimed to increase smallholder productivity on 35,000 hectares of rainfed rice through the timely
provision of improved inputs (seed, fertilizer, and herbicide) and technical advisory services.
Specifically, the project supported (i) the production of 2,000 tons of certified seed by scaling up
the farmer seed multiplication network; (ii) the procurement of 2,000 tons of fertilizer; and (iii)
the distribution of input packages to 70,000 smallholder farmers. As a result of the project’s
support, Guinea recorded a good crop year in 2010. Aggregate cereal production was estimated at
2.85 million tons (including 1.39 million tons of rice and 0.55 million tons of maize), and cassava
production was about 1.06 million tons.

3.      Notwithstanding these impressive results, food insecurity remained a serious concern in
Guinea. The national food supply was not increasing at a sufficient pace, and rapid depreciation
of the Guinean franc pushed inflation from 7.9 percent in 2009 to 15 percent in 2010 and 18 percent
in July 2011. The resulting high food prices pushed Guinea onto the list of countries requiring food
assistance in June 2011. This situation was of particular concern as previous steep depreciation led
to severe food insecurity fueled by high prices. Between 2006 and 2007 the price of rice—the
staple food for Guineans—more than doubled as a result of the sharp depreciation of the Guinean
franc. Farmers’ response to domestic market demand was weak due to limited access to good
quality inputs, equipment, and infrastructure and an unfavorable investment climate.
        
4.      To address this situation and consolidate the achievement of PUAPA-1, the Second
Emergency Agricultural Productivity project (PUAPA-2) was developed. PUAPA-2 supported the
GoG’s medium-term objectives to make agriculture a key engine of growth, focusing on food
security and improved productivity of smallholder rice and other food crops by: targeting
rehabilitation and sustainable management of approximately 3,620 hectares of smallholder
irrigated rice to further enhance yields and increase the efficiency of input packages; scaling up

                                                  1
the distribution of inputs to include smallholder maize and cassava producers and irrigated rainfed
rice producers (to increase smallholders’ access to inputs) piloting vaccination of traditional
poultry to help generate income for rural women; and rehabilitating agricultural training facilities
and updating the skills of extension agents and producer organizations.

     1.2 Original Program and Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to increase smallholder productivity of
targeted commodities in the intervention areas. The targeted commodities were rice, maize,
cassava, and traditional poultry.

6.      To achieve this objective, the key performance indicators were stated as:

           Number of direct project beneficiaries (40 percent of whom are women);
           Increase in yields of targeted commodities in intervention areas.

     1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
         and reasons/justification
7.      The PDO and the indicators were not revised.

     1.4 Main Beneficiaries
8.     The project targeted an estimated 180,000 smallholder farmers most of whom belonged to
farmer organizations. The project was also expected to benefit eight institutions with targeted
capacity-building interventions, including infrastructure rehabilitation, upgrading, and provision
of equipment. Geographically, the project covered 17 prefectures 1 in the country’s four agro-
ecological zones.

     1.5 Original Components
9.      The project consisted of three components:

Component 1: Rehabilitation and improved management of irrigation and storage
infrastructure in selected rice-producing areas (US$6.4 million).

10.     The objective of this component was to increase the productivity of irrigated rice
production systems in targeted areas through the rehabilitation and management of irrigation and
drainage infrastructure. Specifically, the project was to (i) improve water control through the
rehabilitation of degraded works and provision of equipment to improve the use and productivity
of abandoned or low-yielding perimeters; (ii) strengthen the capacity of water users’ associations
to manage and maintain irrigation infrastructure; and (iii) improve storage and marketing capacity
through the rehabilitation and construction of storage facilities and threshing platforms by

                                                      2
strengthening farmer groups’ capacity to manage storage and marketing facilities. Key activities
envisaged under this component were: (a) financing of technical studies, civil works, and
supervision of the rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure on approximately 3,620
hectares; (b) technical studies, civil works, and supervision of rehabilitation and construction of
post-harvest infrastructure (storage and drying/threshing facilities) for the irrigation schemes; and 
(c) organizational support and capacity building for water management and maintenance of
rehabilitated infrastructure (perimeters, storage facilities, and so forth) to ensure sustainability

Component 2: Access to improved inputs, technical support services, and post-harvest
equipment (US$12.1 million).


11.    The objective of this component was to improve smallholders’ access to improved inputs,
advisory services, and small-scale processing equipment to increase the yields of targeted
commodities and enhance the productivity of value-added activities though implementation of two
complementary subcomponents:

12.      Subcomponent 2.1: Distribution of crop technology packages and poultry vaccines
(US$10.6 million). This subcomponent was to consolidate the farmer-based seed multiplication
system for rice established under PUAPA-1 by including maize and cassava and creating demand
for certified commercial seed for those crops. It would disseminate improved technology packages
and advisory services to about 107,200 smallholders operating on 4,620 hectares of irrigated rice
(of which 3,620 hectares are being rehabilitated under Component 1), 50,000 hectares of rainfed
rice, 25,000 hectares of maize, and 6,650 hectares of communal cassava multiplication fields.
Through the National Confederation of Farmer Organizations (Conféderation Nationale des
Organisations Paysannes de Guinée, CNOP-G), the component aimed to distribute input packages
(certified seed, fertilizer, and herbicide) and would recover input credits, piloted under PUAPA-
12. Key activities under this subcomponent included (a) acquisition of commercial certified seed,
fertilizer, and herbicide ; (b) distribution of input kits and recovery of funds costs; (c) provision of
supplementary technical extension services by the National Agency for Advisory Services and
Rural Promotion (ANPROCA); (d) training of CNOP-G and ANPROCA personnel involved in
project implementation; (e) rehabilitation of demonstration farms at the National Agriculture and
Animal Husbandry Schools (Ecole Nationale d’Agriculture et d’Elevage, ENAE) of Tolo, Koba,
Macenta, and Bordo, as well as training center of Bamban (Kindia) for continued training of
extension agents and farmers; and (f) a strategic study to guide the development of sustainable
market-based input distribution mechanisms in Guinea; and (g) acquisition of 8 million vaccines
for 180,000 beneficiary households to vaccinate local poultry.

13.    Subcomponent 2.2: Support to improve post-harvest processing in high production zones
(US$1.5 million). This subcomponent aimed to finance: (i) the acquisition of small-scale
processing equipment; (ii) training of members of beneficiary groups in management, processing,

  Inputs were sold to farmers on a “cropping-season” credit basis. Funds recovered (nonsubsidized portion of the
fertilizer and herbicide costs) at the end of the cropping season were put in a separate account managed by CNOP-G
and used to capitalize a revolving fund for purchasing inputs in future seasons.


                                                        3
and marketing techniques; and (iii) studies and assessments for the establishment of small-scale
agro-processing enterprises. It aimed to increase the capacity of women’s groups involved in
small-scale primary post-harvest processing by improving the quantity and quality of their locally
processed products; thereby, enhancing their economic opportunities.

Component 3: Capacity building, project coordination, and M&E (US$1.5 million).

14.    The objectives of this component were to (i) ensure effective management, coordination,
and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of project interventions; and (ii) management of capacity-
building activities implemented by CNOP-G, ANPROCA, National Directorate of Rural
Engineering ( DNGR), and Bureau de Stratégie et de Développement (BSD). Fiduciary functions
were be carried out through the use of fiduciary system of the Bank-funded Second Village
Communities Support Project [(Programme d’Appui aux Communautés Villageoises (PACV-2)].
The subcomponent also to finance (a) contractual personnel to reinforce technical coordination
and fiduciary oversight; (b) incremental operating costs; (c) vehicles and equipment for project
implementation; and (d) studies, training, and study tours.
      1.6 Revised Components
15.      The components were not revised.

      1.7 Other significant changes
16.     The project was restructured twice, in October 2014 and May 2015. The restructurings3
were essentially an extension of the project closing dates. The first restructuring extended the
closing date from December 31, 2014 to May 31, 2015. This extension was meant to: (a) complete
rehabilitation of two major irrigation schemes covering 1,100 ha of land and the construction of
four warehouses and 10 threshing/drying facilities in Siguiri Prefecture in Eastern Guinea; (b)
carry out capacity building of beneficiaries for sustainable management of the infrastructure; and
(c) carry out more advisory services to further improve the productivity of the targeted crops and
poultry. The second extension was granted in May 2015 to complete complementary activities
needed to make functional and operational the infrastructure of the five national agricultural
training schools (ENAEs), and to complete water points for them and ANPROCA’s eight regional
directorates. The closing date was extended from May 31, 2015, to July 31, 2015. 

      2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
      2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
17.     The project was prepared under OP/BP 8.00 Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies
to consolidate the achievements of PUAPA-1, which closed on June 30, 2012. As such, the project
built on the gains made under PUAPA-1 and was considered the second phase. PUAPA-1 started
in 2008 and focused on rainfed rice, building a delivery mechanism for inputs and technical

Board approval.


                                                       4
advisory services that reached about 40,000 households, each cultivating an average 0.4 hectares
of rice. PUAPA-2’s goal was to scale up those achievements and broaden the scope of
interventions to include additional crops important for national food security. Project preparation
followed a highly participatory process. A number of stakeholders were actively involved in
project preparation, including: (i) Ministry of Agriculture (MoA); (ii) Ministry of Livestock
(MoL); (iii) Ministry of Economy and Finance (MoEF); (iv) Ministry of Technical Education
(MoTE); (v) producers’ associations; and (vi) the Spanish Development Agency (SDA).

19.    The project design ensured complementarity with two other IDA-financed
agricultural projects, WAAPP and PACV-2 4 : To ensure synergy between PUAPA-2 and
WAAPP, a common steering committee was established to coordinate the two projects’ activities.
Financial management for all three projects was entrusted to CNC (Cellule National de la
Coordination) of PACV-2, proven to have strong fiduciary expertise and well-versed in the Bank’s
operational procedures. CNC’s accountant was to provide financial management oversight for two
accounting assistants at project level. At the operational level, WAAPP was expected to
complement PUAPA-2’s effort in the supply and distribution of rice seeds.

20.     PUAPA-2’s design was well informed by lessons learned. The direct lesson learned from
PUAPA-1 was well captured in project design. Some of the lessons that informed project design
included the need to: (i) distribute input packages through village associations to foster a sense of
ownership at the grassroots level ‒ following the experience of PUAPA-1 implementation, the
project relied on CNOP-G to use village associations to distribute input packages; (ii) recognize
farmers’ willingness to pay for improved inputs ; (iii) strengthen the capacity to manage the
program’s M&E system; and (iv) complement WAAPP’s efforts in strengthening the institutions
involved in the seed sector and build capacity among all of its stakeholders since the national
certification mechanism was still not operational.

21.    Government commitment. The GoG’s commitment was high, demonstrated by its
mobilization of key institutions that participated in and contributed to project preparation. GoG
commitment was also manifested through a contribution to the cost and distribution of inputs,
estimated at US$1.7 million (13.9 percent of total project cost).  
 
22.     Risks and mitigation measures. The project team identified a number of potential risks
and appropriate mitigation measures. Project risk at appraisal was rated substantial. The major risk
identified was the implementing agency’s fiduciary capacity, mainly mitigated by integrating
capacity-building activities into the design as well as by recruiting fiduciary staff to reinforce its
operation. Potential project risks identified included: (i) lack of timely availability of the required
quality and quantity of seed to respond to farmers’ demand; (ii) the absence of consistent
government strategies for input distribution and consequent contradictory approaches in donor-
funded projects that would undermine the recovery of input costs; (iii) procurement delays that
would threaten the rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure; and (iv) implementation delays given
the PACV-2 project team’s already heavy workload.

23.     Mitigation measures included: (i) building capacity for the Guinea Institute of Agronomy
Research (IRAG) and seed producers, as well as cooperation at the subregional level under
WAAPP, to increase seed availability; (ii) supporting the government to prepare a sustainable
input supply strategy; (iii) conducting analyses of opportunities, maintaining a policy dialogue
with the government and farmers’ organizations, and creating conditions to enable private sector
development; (iv) financing the preparation of preliminary studies and procurement packages
related to irrigation infrastructure under PUAPA-I before start-up of the proposed project to
improve implementation readiness; and (v) strengthening the PACV-2 team with the recruitment
of additional staff and capacity building.

24.     The project design built on the gains of PUAPA-1, which was anchored on the global
strategy for food price response and reflected both the GoG’s strategy and priorities and the Bank’s
sectoral and operational experiences.

25.     Implementation arrangements were updated to reflect the enhanced project activities
and coverage. Due to the scaling up of the project to cover irrigation agriculture (PUAPA-1
covered rainfed only) and poultry, the implementation arrangement included two additional
agencies: (i) Direction Nationale du Génie Rural (DNGR) for rehabilitation of irrigation
infrastructure and construction of post-harvest infrastructure; and (ii) Direction Nationale des
Services Vétérinaires (DNSV) for vaccination of poultry.

   2.2 Implementation
26.     PUAPA-2 was approved on August 22, 2012, and became effective on November 12, 2012.
The government met all effectiveness conditions and the project started as planned. However,
project implementation was affected by the following:

      Weak procurement capacity at project level and cumbersome approval processes within
       the government system. The procurement capacity at project level was weak, translating
       into low quality of procurement documents. This led to delays in obtaining non-objection
       from the Bank in some instances. Also, the lengthy approval process within the government
       system significantly affected the pace of project implementation. For example, the approval
       of tender documents for infrastructure in Siguiri Prefecture took 6-8 months to complete
       after the Bank’s non-objection. Given the urgent nature of the project and the limited time
       for its implementation, the Bank introduced innovative measures to improve procurement
       methods throughout project implementation. Among the measures taken was entrusting
       DNGR with responsibility for monitoring and supervision of works to enable works to start
       before the completion of the recruitment process for a firm. This measure proved to be very
       effective and significantly improved project implementation. DNGR was actively involved
       in the execution of this activity, supervising nine contracts on the basis of an agreement
       with the project. Also, during the second half of 2014, the Bank team instituted follow-up
       meetings every two or three weeks with the project coordination team, a practice
       maintained until the end of the project. Weaknesses in the procurement system also
       affected the recruitment of a safeguards expert. When one expert was finally offered the
       job, he declined. Toward the end of project, the GoG, in coordination with the Bank,
       arranged for the PACV-2 safeguards officer to carry out important safeguard activities
       needed for project completion.

                                                 6
         Challenges related to input distribution. Distributing inputs in certain remote areas was a
          challenge due to bad roads and practical lack of access.
         Effect of the Ebola outbreak. Farmers were reluctant to get their poultry vaccinated in areas
          affected by the Ebola epidemic on the grounds that vaccination of poultry contributes to
          the spread of Ebola. The disease affected 12 of the 17 prefectures covered by the project.
          This unfortunate situation resulted in a significant reduction in the cost recovery of inputs
          in areas affected by the epidemic. The epidemic affected the local economy which in turn
          affected the economic life of the people. The project team had to distribute the inputs free
          of charge before they could cover those areas (see Annex 2 for a detailed description of the
          Ebola effect).
         Turnover of key project staff. Three months before the closure of PUAPA-2, the project
          accountant left to join another Bank project, as did the procurement specialist. These
          developments did not significantly affect the project as the Bank team made arrangements
          for the PACV-2 accountant to take full responsibility for financial management functions.
          The Recipient, in collaboration with the Bank team, also made an arrangement with the
          other project that allowed the procurement officer to share his time between the two
          projects.

27.       Despite the above issues, project implementation was boosted by the following factors:

         Strong government commitment. The GoG showed a high level of commitment throughout
          implementation. In particular, the government maintained its contribution of
          complementary inputs, valued at US$1.7 million. The government mainstreamed input
          distribution into its operations and continues to import and distribute the required inputs to
          farmers.
         Existence of the project implementation structure. Given its experience in the
          implementation of PUAPA-1, the existing implementing agency (ANPROCA) was
          retained to carry out overall project coordination and implementation. The arrangement to
          allow fiduciary oversight and functions to be performed by the Bank–financed PACV-2
          fiduciary unit under the CNC was sound as the CNC has significant experience in fiduciary
          management and is now managing the Ebola fund in Guinea.
         Bank support in approving the two extensions, which allowed completion of the remaining
          construction works. Given the short project duration, coupled with the procurement issues
          noted above, the Bank approved two extensions that allowed completion of the urgently
          needed rehabilitation of irrigation systems.
         A strategy to double the local workforce. This action contributed significantly to the
          completion of urgently needed infrastructure at Frenkamaya and Kada in Siguiri
          Prefecture. To speed up implementation of activities within the timeframe of the extension
          of the closing date, project management doubled the local labor dedicated to the
          construction and rehabilitation works in these two intervention areas, enabling works to be
          completed as planned.

   2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


28.    M&E design. The design of the project’s M&E system built on PUAPA-1’s existing
system. By design, M&E activities were to be undertaken at two levels: (i) internal monitoring of
intermediate results carried out by ANPROCA in collaboration with its key implementing partners
[(DNGR, CNOP-G, IRAG, DNSV, and the National Directorate of Agriculture(DNA)]; and (ii)
external monitoring carried out by BSD. The internal monitoring consisted of ensuring routine
tracking of project outputs and outcomes by ANPROCA through its structures at regional and
prefecture levels. The external monitoring or impact evaluation was to be carried out by BSD and
its deconcentrated agriculture units at subnational level. The design envisaged that impact
evaluations would be conducted by an external service provider. Establishment of a management
information system (MIS) was not integrated in the design, however. Overall, the M&E system
designed was appropriate for this emergency project.

29.     M&E implementation. The project coordination unit (ANPROCA) conducted routine
monitoring and supervision of the execution of project activities, regularly reviewing
implementation progress. Data collection efforts were carried out at all levels by ANPROCA’s
decentralized units and reported to the national level for consolidation. While ANPROCA ensured
routine monitoring of activities, the BSD failed to carry out its activities due to weaknesses in its
operational capacity. As a result, it failed to conduct the three external impact evaluations (baseline,
mid-term, and end of project) with which it was entrusted under both PUAPA-1 and PUAPA-2.

30.    Although not planned for, the project benefited from the establishment of an MIS thanks
to Bank guidance to hire an international consultant for this purpose to enhance data collection and
analysis. The system now serves the entire MoA’s programs. Training workshops were organized
to improve the capacity of personnel involved in project implementation in the use of the MIS.

31.     M&E utilization. M&E data were used to inform decision making at all levels. Regular
supervision reports that focused on progress on implementing agreed actions and
recommendations were the main instruments for doing so. These reports were extensively
discussed at the end of each supervision mission. Workshops were also organized to train
implementing partners at various levels of project implementation. The M&E reports were also
discussed extensively during the monthly meetings held between the Bank’s task team and the
project implementing unit plus key stakeholders.

   2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
   2.4.1       Safeguard compliance

32.    The project was classified as Category B and triggered four safeguards policies:
Environmental (OP 4.01); Pest Management (OP 4.09); Projects on International Waterways
(OP/BP 7.50); and Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). To address any potential adverse effects
that might arise during project implementation, an Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF), a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and a Pesticide Management Plan
(PMP) were prepared and disclosed in the country as well as on the Bank’s InfoShop. As noted in
section 2.2, the project operated without an environmental management specialist due to a

                                                   8
recruitment delay. As a result, activities outlined in the ESMF and RPF were not carried out as
planned. To resolve the issue, the Bank made an arrangement to utilize PACV-2’s environmental
expert, who carried out an environmental assessment in February 2014. Findings from his
assessment showed no significant negative impacts resulting from the works on the ground.

   2.4.2       Fiduciary Compliance

33.     Financial management. The project complied fully with the Bank’s operational policies on
financial management (OP/BP 10.02), and at the time of the ICR (Implementation Completion and
Results Report), all Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) had been submitted on time, and previous
year’s audit reports had been received and issued with unqualified audit opinion.

34.    Procurement. The project team complied with the Bank’s procurement policies (OP/BP
11.00). Before the commencement of project activities, an 18-month procurement plan was
prepared and submitted to the Bank for approval. During the course of project implementation, the
plan was revised and updated four times to reflect implementation realities. Despite the
procurement-related issues noted in section 2.2, procurement activities were carried out
successfully. At the end of project, 98 percent of procurement activities had been executed in line
with the procurement plan and implementation manual.

35.     Disbursement. At the time of project closure, the project had disbursed 94.2 percent of
project funds (see Annex 2 for project cost and financing).

   2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase


36.      To ensure continued supply of inputs to beneficiary farmers, the GoG adopted the
importation of inputs and utilization of the good seeds mechanism introduced by the project and
continues to import and distribute inputs to farmers. The GoG facilitates producers’ access to
inputs by subsidizing 50 percent of the input price. During crop year 2013-2014, the government
provided 14,750 tons of fertilizer and 560,000 liters of herbicides, including processing equipment.
In the 2014-2015 crop season, 16,485 tons of fertilizer and 660,000 liters of herbicides were
supplied to producers. Estimates for the 2015-2016 crop season are 25,000 tons of fertilizer and
750,000 liters of herbicide. The GoG currently distributes fertilizer via the National Chamber of
Agriculture.

37.     At the operational level, various management committees were established and tasked with
the responsibility of ensuring routine maintenance of the infrastructure rehabilitated and
constructed. For example, the ENAEs that benefited from project interventions established
management committees composed of students, technicians, and professionals to manage the
infrastructure provided by the project. The centers plan to use a portion of the proceeds they get
from the sale of poultry and livestock product to maintain that infrastructure and equipment.
Overall, 55 infrastructural management committees for rehabilitated irrigation schemes were
established in all intervention zones. To support the effective execution of the committees’ tasks,
an infrastructural maintenance framework, including annual maintenance plans, was prepared and
is operational. Although this was an emergency project, it provided more than a response to
emergency by supporting infrastructure works, storage, and other relevant interventions that

                                                 9
address the root causes of low agricultural production, productivity, and thus food security in
Guinea.


    3. Assessment of Outcomes
    3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
38.     The relevance of the project development objective is rated high. The PDO reflected the
priorities of the GoG and responded to the circumstances prevailing during project preparation. At
project inception, Guinea faced rising food prices as a result of the global commodity price
increase, coupled with weak domestic production. By increasing agricultural production through
rehabilitation and construction of irrigation infrastructure, including increasing producers’ access
to farm inputs and equipment, PUAPA-2 underpinned the implementation of the GoG’s food
security policy. The project was also consistent with the then Interim Strategy Note for 2011–12
(approved March 24, 2011), which planned to support the government’s Priority Action Plan and
PNIASA (Plan National d’investissement Agricole et de Sécurité Alimentaire) to make agriculture
a key engine of growth, focusing initially on food security and improved productivity of
smallholder rice and other food crops.

39.     The project’s objectives reflect the GoG’s current priorities: the PDO remains relevant to
the government’s agricultural development priorities enshrined in PNIASA (2011-2017).
Specifically, subprograms 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 of the plan highlight the promotion of irrigation and
improved soil water management to increase smallholder agricultural productivity. The PDO is
consistent with the National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP3 2012–15).5 Pillar 4 of the
strategy emphasizes the need to improve food security by strengthening the fight against hunger
and malnutrition. Finally, the objective is consistent with the Bank’s FY14-17 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), which supports the GoG’s efforts to increase agricultural productivity through the
implementation of Pillar 4 of PRSP3.
40.     Enhancing agricultural production is obviously the direct response to food crisis. In
Guinea’s context, improving agricultural productivity is the first order of business to enhance
agricultural production, which is very low relative to that of other comparable countries.
Productivity is low mainly due to the dominance of rainfed agriculture, low irrigation farming
coverage, low capacity, and weak extension services, among others. The project directly addressed
these root causes, in line with best practices in improving agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan
Africa, testifying to the high relevance of the PDO.

41.    The PDO is also relevant to the Bank’s twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030
and boosting shared prosperity. According to the Guinea - Performance and Learning Review of
the CPS for the period FY14-FY17 (Report # No. 97162-GN), the development goals are to reduce
key constraints to growth, diversification, and employment creation and strengthen the fight for
food security. This document stated that the World Bank Group’s support aims to play a catalytic

role in agriculture for higher agricultural productivity. This same report stated that PUAPA-2 has:
“contributed to strengthening the MoA and to raising productivity, especially in rice cultivation.
A follow-up local project will focus on further strengthening the capacity of selected Institutions,
including the Ministry of Agriculture.”
42.     The relevance of project design and implementation is rated substantial. The project’s
design focused on achieving the project objective of increasing the productivity of Guinea’s main
cereal crops -- rice and maize, including cassava. The logical framework clearly articulated the
causal linkage of access by smallholder farmers to improved inputs, advisory services, and
provision of small-scale processing equipment to increase the yields of the target commodities,
including increasing value addition of target crops. Project implementation correctly identified the
importance of involving decentralized structures in the distribution of agricultural inputs. Although
in some remote areas it was difficult to reach local organizations, in areas where the project was
able to involve the local communities, it left an improved capacity in terms of managing
agricultural input distribution by local entities. This will remain highly relevant in countries like
Guinea, where government capacity is limited (mainly concentrated in urban centers) and where
transparency is lacking. Involvement of local communities introduced transparency in the whole
distribution system. An additional important factor in project implementation was the arrangement
to work closely with the regional IDA project (WAAPP) in the supply and distribution of rice seeds
and to position PUAPA-2 to take advantage of WAAPP support in strengthening institutions
involved in the seed sector. Not only did this avoid redundancy but it also contributed to the
improvement in productivity made by PUAPA-2.

43.     Given that the project was a short duration operation (less than three years), quick
adjustments were very critical for its successful implementation. Using extra laborers, providing
extension agents with transportation, and strengthening institutional capacity were appropriate
choices. When it became difficult to access remote areas, the project quickly adjusted and provided
agricultural inputs and services directly through government agencies to ensure that the crop
season was efficiently utilized.

44.     A significant feature was the use of existing institutions adapted from PUAPA-1, with
project management conferred on the relevant government department (ANPROCA), which has
operational units at all levels of the MoA. The Bank’s emergency financing instrument under
OP/BP 8.00 was appropriate to address the country’s urgent food security needs. However, the
government’s cumbersome approval of procurement documents proved to be a critical constraint
to project implementation, particularly for the irrigation schemes, which required two extensions
to complete.

   3.2 Achievements of Project Development Objectives
45.     The PDO was to increase smallholder productivity of targeted commodities in the
intervention areas. The project improved Guinea’s short- and medium-term priorities by improving
its food security situation and contributing to poverty reduction interventions, directly benefitting
an estimated 218,660 farmers living in rural areas. The complementarity of the input distribution
system, coupled with the provision of farm and post-harvest infrastructure, enhanced the
production, productivity, and hence livelihood security of beneficiary farmers. The capacity-
building interventions meant to strengthen local farmers’ skills in the use and application of new

                                                 11
technologies, including access to the use of agricultural inputs, contributed significantly to their
increased productivity. This project was an emergency food crisis response implemented under
four years but it performed and delivered like a regular Bank operation. Evaluation of this project
should take this context into account.

46.     PDO indicator 1: Number of direct beneficiaries (of which 40 percent female). This
indicator was fully achieved and the target exceeded. At the end of the project 218,660
beneficiaries compared with 180,000 target were reached (an increase of 21.5 percentage points).
The project more significantly exceeded its female target by 12.4 percent. At the end of project
80,904 women [37 percent of actual beneficiaries (218,660)] compared to 72,000 target were
reached. In particular, the supply of post-harvest processing equipment in support of activities of
the women’s groups and in promoting income generating activities (IGAs) significantly
contributed to the increased participation of women. A rapid assessment report6 conducted as part
of project evaluation highlighted the project’s impacts on beneficiary women’s groups. Women’s
groups with production potentials received 8 units of rice processing equipment, and 17 units for
maize, and cassava processing.

47.      PDO indicator 2: Increase in yields of targeted commodities in intervention areas. Rice:
At irrigated farms, by the end of project 3.5 tons /ha was achieved compared with 3.6 tons/ha
targeted—a 97 percent achievement of the target. This represents a 40 percent increase over the
baseline value of 2.5 tons/ha. At rainfed rice farms, the increased yield surpassed the target -- at
the end of project, rice yield reached 2.1 tons/ha compared with the 1.6 tons/ha target, an
achievement of 131 percent of the target, or a net increase of 110 percent over the baseline value
of 1.0 tons/ha. The increased rice yield could also be attributed to WAAPP interventions, through
which PUAPA-2 obtained some improved rice seeds. The seeds were produced by a seed
multiplier group that received WAAPP support in terms of training and input supply (basic seeds,
fertilizer, and pesticides). Maize: Productivity of maize reached 3.5 tons/ha by the end of the
project, an achievement of 167 percent of target (2.1 tons/ha). This represents a 219 percent
increase over the baseline value of 1.6 tons/ha. Cassava: Productivity of cassava reached 23
tons/ha compared to the target of 20 ton/ha, representing a 115 increase over the target value.

48.     These results were driven by the construction and rehabilitation of critical agriculture
infrastructure such as: irrigation schemes, storage and post-harvest infrastructure as well the
provision of farm inputs buttressed by training beneficiary farmers and upgrading their skills. The
project financed the construction/rehabilitation of 3,620 ha of irrigation schemes, 23 post-harvest
storage facilities and 47 post-harvest drying platforms in project intervention areas. To fully utilize
the rehabilitated and constructed infrastructure, significant amount of farm inputs were distributed
to farmers. Over 3,600 tons of rainfed rice seeds, 853 tons of maize seed, and 2.5 million cassava
seedlings were procured and distributed to farmers. To increase productivity of farmers, the

project financed technology transfer by supplying farmers with agricultural inputs such us
fertilizers, herbicides, and poultry vaccines. The project procured and distributed 1,512.5 tons of
fertilizers, 23,200 litters of herbicides, 8 million poultry vaccines to the beneficiary farmers. Due
to the Ebola epidemic, which made it difficult for the project staff to go to Ebola affected areas,
the targets were not met as shown in section F above. But the GoG pursued input distribution
during the last two agricultural campaigns after the project terminated input distribution. The
increased yield could be attributed to the government’s action at the tail end of the project. The
distribution of inputs was supported by training in the use of the technology packages by
ANPROCA’s agricultural extension workers, located close to beneficiaries. This led to increased
area under improved technology: 3,620 ha of irrigated rice (of which 1,100 ha were rehabilitated
and exploited in the last rainy season during which the project closed); 59,166 ha of rainfed rice;
34,120 ha of maize; and 104,165 ha of cassava multiplication fields (see Annex 2 for detailed
output by component). The achievement of the project efficacy is rated substantial.

50.     Given the context within which this project was designed, the number of years it was under
implementation, the major Ebola outbreak (which shifted donors’ and the GoG’s focus to
combating the outbreak), the project’s achievements are clearly remarkable. It exceeded all PDO
indicator targets except the minor shortfalls observed under irrigated rice yield (still a significant
97 percent achievement of the target). This is mainly due to delays in rehabilitation and related
works, which suffered from a long procurement process that in turn delayed the full realization of
the benefits of productivity enhancement. As the system consolidates, productivity gains are
expected to surpass the achievement observed at the closing date. In comparison, under rainfed
rice production, which did not suffer from procurement delays, productivity increased by 110

                                                        13
percent, suggesting the impact of the procurement delays. Even so, productivity under irrigated
rice increased by 40 percent compared to the baseline level, a remarkable achievement. As noted,
this was due to a combination of factors, including WAAPP intervention.  

    3.3 Efficiency

51.     Analysis of project costs and benefits. Although it is not a requirement under OP/BP 8.00
guidelines for emergency operations, an ex-ante cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was conducted at
appraisal. For that reason, the ICR team performed a similar analysis to determine the project’s
financial and economic viability and compared these estimates with the appraisal estimates. The
ex-post analysis found a net present value (NPV) of US$3.7 million and an economic rate of return
(ERR) of 47 percent versus the appraisal estimates of an NPV of US$2.1 million and an ERR of
17.2 percent

52.     Analysis of crop or farm budget. To ascertain the financial benefits accrued to project
beneficiaries over the course of project implementation, an analysis of the crop/farm budget of
selected farmers’ groups from six regions was conducted. The results of the analysis show that
significant benefits (profitability of GNF42.8 million in net revenues over variable and fixed costs)
accrued to project beneficiaries when average production data and operational costs data were
compared. The main drivers of the increased profitability were: (i) an increase in the technology
packages from 92.000 to 104,165supplied by the project; (ii) an increase in beneficiaries’ access
to inputs; and (iii) the rehabilitation and construction of irrigation and post-harvest facilities, which
enabled year-round production.

53.     Administrative and operational efficiency. The project encountered delays in
implementation of certain key activities due mainly to operational inefficiencies related to heavy
government approval processes for procurement activities. Within the government system,
procurement documents requiring approvals and clearances at institutional level took time to
complete. This caused considerable delays in the issuance of contracts and, hence, construction
and rehabilitation of some critical infrastructure. Delays in government approvals led to extension
of the project’s closing date on two occasions before two construction works were fully completed
at Frenkamaya and Kada in the Siguiri Prefecture in Kakan Region. Although the project generated
significant benefits that accrued to beneficiaries, administrative and operational inefficiencies
impacted project implementation. Given these, efficiency is rated modest (Annex 3 provides details
of the analysis).
         

    3.4 Justification of Overall outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
54.     The overall project outcome is rated moderately satisfactory given its high relevance of
objective, substantial efficacy and a modest efficiency.

    3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and impacts
    (a)Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development


                                                   14
55.      The major development impacts of the project are:

            Impact on income. A rapid assessment7 of project outcomes conducted by the ICR team
             as part of project closure showed a significant impact on beneficiaries’ incomes. On
             average, beneficiaries indicated that they earned GNF14 million in the last cropping
             season. The increased income enabled them to, for example, construct a building,
             support their children’s schools, and purchase motorbikes. Testimonies from selected
             beneficiaries are presented in Annex 5.
              
            Gender impact. The project supported women’s groups with post-harvest processing
             equipment, allowing them to engage in IGAs. Women’s groups with production
             potential received rice processing equipment (8 lots), maize (17 batches), and cassava
             (17 units) to process and transform their produce into finished products. To enhance
             their processing capacity, the project provided various trainings in processing
             technologies. Operation of these facilities alleviated the daily tasks of women,
             improved labor productivity, enabled faster processing times, and increased women’s
             incomes and revenues (see Annex 5 for testimony from some of the beneficiaries from
             women’s groups).

            Impact on local employment. The use of local labor by firms for some work
             (excavation, dredging of canals, digging, building, etc.) created employment in some
             localities. The most illustrative case is that of the EGEC Company and SOGOGIMEX,
             which built a dam, two stores, and five threshing floors and rehabilitated the irrigation
             network at Kada in Siguiri Prefecture. The total income from wages paid to skilled and
             unskilled local labor amounted to about GNF1.6 billion. Table 2 compares employment
             created in two localities in Siguiri Prefecture in Northern Guinea.




7
  No end-of-project impact survey was conducted. In view of that, the ICR team conducted a rapid assessment of the
impacts on beneficiaries through discussions with them (see Annex 5).

    (b) Institutional change/Strengthening
56.    The project’s institutional development impact was substantial. Key institutions benefitting
from project interventions include:

        ANPROCA: The project strengthened ANPROCA’s capacity to enable it to perform its
         functions more effectively. Before the project, ANPROCA faced a significant lack of
         operational materials and equipment. Also lacking were: means of transport for regional
         directors and agricultural extension officers; adequate office spaces; communication
         information technology and information (ICT) equipment; and operating budget (fuel,
         lubricant, maintenance, training, synergy between various technical units). Project
         interventions significantly improved ANPROCA’s work environment. The project: (i)
         constructed and equipped its regional offices, including water points; (ii) provided logistics
         -- 96 motorbikes, one 4x4 wheel drive, computer and communication equipment (4 desktop
         computers, 9 laptops, 8 video projectors, 8 cameras, 8 photo equipment, 8 photocopiers, 8
         generator sets; one tractor, 8 scanners, 8 projection screens, and 6 sets of agricultural
         processing equipment for rice, maize, and cassava); (iii) strengthened the technical capacity
         of the staff at all levels; and (iv) improved working relations with the BSD and other
         technical institutions involved in project implementation.
        ENAEs. The project strengthened the capacity of the ENAEs, most of which had not been
         renovated or upgraded since 1956, by rehabilitating their infrastructure and facilities and
         providing them with equipment and tools that would enable them to effectively carry out
         teaching and learning (see Annex 5 for details). With project support, the schools trained
         678 learners, and students are now involved in monitoring, surveillance, and raising of
         poultry and other breeds. The project also: strengthened the agricultural production
         capacity of the ENAE of Tolo in Mamou Region through the rehabilitation of a dam that
         serves the cultivation fields; helped harmonize a prophylactic plan for the five ENAEs;
         improved the ENAEs’ business climate as they can now generate income from the sale and
         marketing of poultry and livestock products; improved documentation and recordkeeping


                                                      16
         through information technology (IT) support; and improved ENAEs’ presentational
         capacity through the provision of video equipment. 


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
57.      There were no unintended outcomes and impacts.


      3.6 Summary of Findings of the Beneficiary Assessment Survey


58.      A beneficiary assessment/survey was not conducted at the end of project. However the ICR
team conducted a rapid assessment of project impact on beneficiaries. The assessment revealed
that, the operational capacity and overall working environment of the beneficiary institutions (e.g.
DNSV, SNVP, the ENAEs and, ANPROCA) improved significantly. The operational capacity of
DNSV through training of community animal health agents-agents communautaires de santé
animale (ACSA) in skills in poultry vaccination, and with SNVP through the training in
phytosanitary treatment for agency de defense de cultures (ADC) auxiliary services. Teaching and
learning also improved significantly in the four ENAES. This was done through rehabilitation of
livestock infrastructure and spaces for nucleuses, which allowed students to have access to hand-
on practical training. In addition, production capacity of the ENAEs also improved through the
rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and the provision of variety of livestock.

59.    The project also strengthened operational capacity of ANPROCA. Before the project
ANPROCA lacked material and equipment that would enable it to deliver its core functions. There
was also lack of means of transport for regional directors and agricultural extension officers; lack
of offices; lack of IT and communication equipment, operating budget (fuel, lubricant,
maintenance inadequate training, lack of synergy among the technical units). With the project
support, there has been significant improvement in ANPROCA’s work environment through
construction and equipment of its regional offices, including provision of water points. ANPROCA
also benefited from logistical support as shown in table 3 below.

60.    In addition, the project improved women’s groups’ capacity in post-harvest processing:
The project supported women’s groups with post-harvest processing equipment as described in
paragraph 55. The methodology and results of the assessment are shown in Annex 5.

      4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes
61.       Major risks to the development outcome are as follows.

62.     Political risk to the development outcome is significant. A major risk to the development
outcome is the prevailing political atmosphere in the country. Elections were held recently with a
declaration of results, but the situation is still volatile and some opposition is contesting the validity
of the results.

63.     Economic and financial risk to the development outcome is significant. The input
distribution supported increased food production and productivity, which will help Guinea to
increase its food availability. Sustaining this achievement depends on the government’s ability to
continue distribution of inputs despite its current fiscal constraints. The government is continuing
to implement the input distribution system through its regional institutions, but no strategy is in
place to phase out the input distribution mechanism. According to the GoG, a study on rural
financing is planned, to be conducted under Projet d'Appui au Secteur Agricole en Guinee
(PASAG) and its recommendations will provide the GoG with the requisite strategy and plan for
the way forward.
64.     Other risks to the development outcome include: (i) lack of marketing of produce by
producers as some areas are inaccessible and far from market centers; and (ii) lack of suitable
packaging for the conservation of products processed by women’s groups. Some women’s groups
have acquired the requisite skills and have operated well, but they claim that packaging of their
final products is still a big problem.

    5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
    5.1 Bank Performance
    (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
        Rating: Satisfactory

65.     Bank performance at project preparation is rated satisfactory. With support from the local
office in Conakry, the Bank facilitated the preparation process, bringing all relevant institutions
on board, including SDA. Given the emergency nature of the project, the Bank quickly put together
an experienced team that worked closely with the project team to ensure smooth preparation and
quality of design. The design was aligned with the government’s sector priorities as well as the
Bank’s CPS for Guinea. The team integrated valuable lessons from PUAPA-1 in the design and
maintained the implementation arrangements established under that project with a few
modifications, especially the appointment of an operations officer to strengthen ANPROCA’s
capacity. This arrangement proved essential during project implementation.


    (b) Quality of Supervision
        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.     Bank performance at supervision is moderately satisfactory. The Bank supervision team,
which included technical specialists from both the country office and outside Guinea, worked
closely with the project team to address implementation issues during supervision missions,
including transferring knowledge to government counterparts. Over the course of project
implementation, the Bank maintained a cordial relationship with the authorities and other key
stakeholders. During discussions with the project team, MoA authorities expressed appreciation
for the manner in which the Bank team worked with them. In particular, they emphasized the
proactive action of the Bank when they needed time to complete the urgently needed irrigation
infrastructure in Northern  Guinea. According to the GoG, the project significantly alleviated the
suffering of local people who depend entirely on farming activities. As indicated in section 2.2,
the Bank should be commended for instituting and implementing innovative and adaptable
procurement measures. However, the Bank could have done more in guiding the BSD to
implement the impact evaluations integrated in the M&E design. These evaluations would have
identified and quantified the project’s development impacts, critical in a project targeting a
significant number of beneficiaries (and one that included the number of beneficiaries as a key
PDO indicator). While the emergency nature of the project might have been a factor, the Bank
project team could have put in place mitigation measures to address this issue.  
 
    (c) Justification for Rating Overall Bank Performance
        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.    Based on the project’s quality at entry and supervision, the overall Bank performance is
rated moderately satisfactory.




                                                19
      5.2 Borrower Performance
      (a) Government Performance
          Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.     The GoG was very committed to the success of the project. It followed through on its
counterpart contribution by financing and facilitating the distribution of inputs in all intervention
areas. During project supervision and other operational meetings, a MoEF sector representative
was always present. Despite this positive factor, and given that this was an emergency project, the
government could have sped up its approval processes to allow contracts and tendering documents
to move more rapidly. As noted above, the heavy procurement approval procedures within the
government significantly affected implementation of key project activities.

      (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
          Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
69.     The implementation agency’s performance is rated moderately satisfactory. At project
preparation and design stage, ANPROCA worked collaboratively with the Bank team to ensure
smooth preparation of the project. In particular, it coordinated all preparatory activities, ensuring
that key stakeholders and partners were actively involved and implemented their respective
activities. During the course of project implementation, ANPROCA effectively carried out its day-
to-day internal monitoring and supervision functions by working through its regional institutions
as well as extension officers placed close to beneficiaries. This arrangement allowed extension
officers to continually transfer skills and knowledge about new technology packages to farmers.
During the ICR team’s visit to beneficiary farmers’ groups, most of them gave credit to the
extension officers, and stated that even during the difficult Ebola crisis, ANPROCA’s operational
staff adopted a strategy to redistribute inputs free of charge to farmers in Ebola-affected areas.
While ANPROCA’s functions were evident in the reports they produced, including the meetings
and workshops they organized, the ICR team could not find concrete evidence of the external
monitoring function conferred on BSD. BSD failed to execute its core function of conducting
impact evaluations/surveys that could have provided more evidence of project results.


      (d) Justification for Rating Overall Borrower Performance
          Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
70.   The overall borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The government was
committed to the project, but its cumbersome procurement approval processes caused delays in
implementation of key project activities.

      6. Lessons Learned
71.       The following are key lessons learned from PUAPA-2 implementation:

         Introducing and implementing innovative fiduciary measures, tying a government -
          institution to performance, is essential for emergency projects of such nature. Given the
          project’s short duration, its fiduciary team entered into an agreement with DNGR and

                                                 20
       committed it to deliver quality control activities on a regular basis. This measure proved to
       be key to the rehabilitation and construction of irrigation infrastructure within the limited
       timeframe of the project.
      The introduction of technology packages coupled with the requisite training to farmers was
       effective in increasing production and productivity. PUAPA-2 increased beneficiary
       farmers’ access to new technologies and inputs, allowing them to increase their production
       and yields.
      Involving producer organizations and strengthening their capacity to distribute inputs and
       technology packages in project implementation was a key factor in the project’s success.
       The distribution of inputs led by CNOP-G through its farmer federations and producers’
       associations at all levels increased beneficiaries’ access to inputs.
      Involving women in the transformation and processing of their produce was a value
       addition intervention. The project introduced women’s groups to processing and
       transformation of farm produce through provision of post-harvest processing equipment.
       Operation of these facilities enabled faster processing times and increased women’s
       earning potential. But limited support was provided for suitable packaging and repackaging
       of their products, which affected the marketing and hence the conservation of their
       processed products. Future projects should endeavor to integrate support for packaging and
       marketing of groups’ products into the design.
      In labor-intensive infrastructure work, it is preferable to use local labor to ensure timely
       delivery of works. The utilization of more local labor proved crucial to the completion of
       the irrigation schemes in Northern Guinea within the extended timeframe. The project
       significantly increased local laborers to support the construction and rehabilitation of
       irrigation infrastructure in the Siguiri Prefecture in Northern Guinea. 
      Capacity building is essential for public entities to fully meet their responsibilities in
       project implementation. ANPROCA has some experience managing Bank-funded projects,
       but its capacity for implementing large-scale operations is still weak, mainly with respect
       to its internal planning capacity and the weak M&E mechanism for updating results
       indicators in a timely way. PUAPA-2 was able to address ANPROCA’s capacity-building
       needs, but not those of BSD. The operational capacity of the latter was inadequate and as
       a result, the institution failed to conduct the external impact evaluation with which it was
       entrusted under both PUAPA-1 and PUAPA-2.


   7. Comments and Issues by Borrower/Implementation/Partners
72.    We have no objection to the content and conclusions to the ICR. However, our concern is
the overall moderately satisfactory rating vis-à-vis the project’s physical and financial
achievements.

Annex 2. Outputs by Components


Component 1: Rehabilitation and improved management of irrigation and storage
infrastructure in selected rice-producing areas (US$6.4 million).

1.      This component financed activities aimed at increasing the productivity of irrigated rice
production systems in project intervention areas. Specific activities financed under the component
include: (a) rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure; and (b) rehabilitation and
construction of post-harvest infrastructure. To track achievement of these activities, three main
indicators were measured. The first indicator was number of irrigation schemes rehabilitated
(baseline-1,000; target 4,260; actual-4,620). At the end of project, 4,620 (100 percent) irrigation
schemes were rehabilitated compared to none at baseline. The second indicator was number of
post-harvest storage facilities constructed or rehabilitated (baseline-0, target- 20; actual-23). At
completion, 23 post-harvest storage facilities had been rehabilitated or constructed compared to
the target of 20 facilities. The third indicator, number of post-harvest drying platforms constructed
or rehabilitated (baseline-0, target- 50, and actual-47), was 97 percent achieved. At the end of
project, 47 post-harvest drying platforms were rehabilitated and constructed compared to 50 drying
platforms targeted.

Component 2: Access to improved inputs, technical support services, and postharvest
equipment (US$12.1 million).


2.       This component financed activities aimed at increasing smallholder farmers’ access to
improved inputs, advisory services, and small-small processing equipment. Two specific
subcomponents were undertaken under the component: (a) distribution of crop technology
packages and poultry vaccines; and (b) support to improved post-harvest processing in high
production zones. The achievement of subcomponent 1 was measured by six indicators. The first
indicator was tons of irrigated rice seeds procured and distributed (baseline-0, target-185, actual-
335). At the end of project, 335 tons of irrigated rice seeds were procured and distributed to
beneficiary farmers compared with the target of 185 tons. The second indicator, tons of rainfed
rice seeds procured and distributed (baseline-0, target-3,000, actual-3,600), was achieved. At
completion, 3,600 tons of rainfed rice seeds were procured and distributed to beneficiary farmers
compared with the target of 3,000 tons. The third indicator, tons of maize seed procured and
distributed (baseline-0, target-750, and actual-853), was achieved. At the end of project, 853 tons
of maize seeds were procured and distributed to beneficiary farmers, compared with the 750 tons
target. The fourth indicator was number of cassava seedlings procured from research stations and
distributed to farmer groups for multiplication (baseline-0, target-1,500,000, and actual-
2,450,000). At project completion about 2.5 million cassava seedlings were procured and
distributed to farmers, compared to the 1.5 million seedlings target. The fifth indicator was tons of
fertilizer procured and distributed (baseline-0, target 3,810, actual-1,512.5). At the end of project,
1,512.5 tons of fertilizer were procured and distributed to beneficiary farmers compared to the
target of 3,810 tons. The last indicator, liters of herbicides procured and distributed (baseline-0,
target 51,200, and actual-23,200), was 45 percent achieved. At the end of project, 23,200 tons of



                                                 23
herbicides were procured and distributed to beneficiary farmers compared with the target of 51,200
tons.

3.      By design, the CNOP-G and the National Confederation of Guinea Producers (CONEG)
were in charge of distribution and cost recovery of inputs. A revolving fund was opened into which
funds recovered were deposited. Table A2.1 provides a summary of inputs distributed and amounts
recovered. CONEG delivered 4 million doses of vaccines and dewormers during its first
vaccination campaign at a cost of GNF800,000,000, but only GNF173,000,000 (21.6 percent) was

4.      The underachievement of the distribution and cost recovery of inputs was mainly due to
the Ebola outbreak. The beneficiaries in Ebola-affected areas did not have money to pay for the
subsidized inputs, which led to free distribution of the inputs to beneficiaries in those areas. Some
livestock keepers were reluctant to vaccinate their animals. Most of these beneficiaries thought
that project staff worked for the Red Cross and would not allow them to come to their abodes.
 
Component 3: Capacity building, project coordination, and M&E (US$1.5 million).

5.      This component financed management, coordination, and M&E of project interventions,
and capacity-building activities, including studies, training, and study tours. The component also
financed contractual personnel to reinforce technical coordination and fiduciary oversight,
operating costs, and vehicles and equipment. To track the achievements under this component,
three key intermediate outcome indicators were measured. The first indicator, an M&E system is
established and operational for data collection, was achieved. At the end of project, a management
information system (MIS) was established and operational. The second indicator, percentage of
reports presented within 45 days of the end of the relevant period, measured M&E performance
with respect to internal monitoring undertaken by ANPROCA. At the end of project, 100 percent
of all reports were presented within the stipulated timeframe. The last indicator, percentage of
procurement activities executed in conformity with the procurement plan and implementation
manual, was achieved. At the end of project, all procurement activities were carried out in
accordance with the procurement plan and the project implementation manual.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
 

1.     This annex includes: (i) a cost-benefit analysis (CBA); (ii) an analysis of crop/farm
budgets; and (iii) a qualitative analysis of administrative and operational efficiency

Cost-benefit analysis

2.     Although it is not a requirement under OP/BP 8.00 guidelines for emergency operations,
an ex-ante CBA was conducted at appraisal. For that reason, the ICR team performed a similar
analysis to determine the project’s financial and economic viability, and compared these with the
appraisal estimates. Under a set of assumptions described in the PAD, the appraisal team undertook
an economic analysis of the project. The estimated ERR was 17.2 percent and the estimated NPV
was about US$2.2 million, assuming an opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent.

3.     The underlying assumptions that formed the basis of the end-of-project analysis are as
follows:

4.      Methodology and underlying assumptions. (a) Costs and coverage: To ascertain the cost
streams for interventions included in the analysis, project cost data were reviewed, including
procurement reports, financial management reports, M&E reports, and physical progress reports
produced by the project team. The analysis covered key activities and costs associated with the
implementation of the project’s three components. Component 1 costs were those associated with:
construction and rehabilitation of irrigation schemes; construction of post-harvest storage facilities
and post-harvest drying platforms and renovation of agricultural training centers; and formation of
water users’ associations, all of which had significant impacts on production and yield. Component
2 costs included the procurement of seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, and poultry vaccines and costs
associated with the distribution of improved technologies and inputs to project beneficiaries.
Component 3 costs were mainly costs of knowledge transfers and day-to-day management and
supervision of project activities. These were costs associated with training in agro-processing,
training of agriculture extension agents and producers’/farmers’ groups; direct costs per household
in different regions and complementary investments per household; and administrative and
transport costs associated with the delivery of inputs. (b) Benefits: The analysis assumed that
benefit streams were cash inflows (gross revenues) accrued to project beneficiaries taking into
consideration their operational costs. The gross revenues (the sum total of average producer prices
multiplied by quantity of production per crop) were estimated from crop/farm budgets of
producers’ groups in the intervention areas. The components of the gross revenues included: (i)
the part of production kept for domestic consumption; (ii) gifts; (iii) remuneration; (iv) stock of
unsold production; and (v) sales. Using an Excel spreadsheet, a cash flow to project beneficiaries
was derived using a 12 percent discount rate. The discount rate was considered as a proxy for the
average opportunity cost of capital based on the average bank lending rate in Guinea. The
discounted cash flow was summed to ascertain the project’s NPV and ERR. The analysis assumed
a five-year period for rice, maize, and cassava production. In addition to NPV and ERR, the
project’s benefit-cost ratio (BCR) was derived. A maximum capital risk (MCR - the present value
of investment at the point where the investor is exposed) approach to calculating the BCR was



                                                 26
used for the analysis, using the formula BCR=NPV/MCR+1; and an exchange rate of GNF7,
296.14=US$1 was used for the analysis.

5.      Results. Given the above assumptions, project interventions generated a NPV of US$3.2
million and an ERR of 47 percent compared to the appraisal estimates of US$2.1 million NPV and
17.2 percent ERR. The project intervention generated a BCR of 1.53. Table A3.1 compares the
appraisal and end-of-project estimates for the project’s NPV and ERR.

6.      Differences exist between the end-of-project and appraisal estimates because the project
met and exceeded its targets for beneficiaries and production. The appraisal analysis assumed
100,200 beneficiaries, 79.6 percent lower than the overall project target of 180,000 beneficiaries.
At the end of project, 218,660 beneficiaries were reached, an increase of 121.5 percent compared
with 118 percent for the appraisal target (100,200). The project also exceeded the appraisal
analysis’s production estimates for: irrigated rice (3.5 tons/ha versus 3.5 tons/ha); rainfed rice (1.8
tons/ha versus 2.1 tons/ha); cassava (11.5 tons/ha versus 23.0 tons/ha); and maize (2.4 tons/ha
versus 3.5 tons/ha). Finally, the end-of-project analysis included a wider set of components than
those covered in the appraisal analysis.

Analysis of crop/farm budgets

7.       To ascertain the financial strength of direct project beneficiaries, a crop/farm budget
analysis was conducted. At appraisal, crop models for upland rice, irrigated rice, plain and lowland
rice, maize, and cassava assumed that improved seed and technology packages would result in a
significant increase in production and yields. The appraisal analysis showed that the impact on the
crop models’ financial profitability was large and that all crop models were financially viable.
Furthermore, the analysis assumed an 86-100 percent increase in yields when farmers used
fertilizers and when improved seed and crop husbandry practices were used but with no fertilizer
application.

8.      To ascertain the financial benefits accrued to project beneficiaries over the course of the
project, the ICR team conducted a similar analysis with actual farm budget (comptes
d’exploitation) data from over 30 sampled farmers’ groups across all project interventions areas.
The team reviewed all production data for each farmer’s group and compared these with the costs

                                                              27
of production. Costs were categorized under three main items: variable costs (cost of seed,
fertilizer, herbicides, etc.); labor costs (cost of clearing, leveling costs, ploughing costs, transport
costs, etc.); and fixed costs (sowing with fertilizer, fertilizer application harvesting, seedlings, etc.).
The results of the analysis show significant revenues accrued to project beneficiaries as a result of:
an increase in technology packages supported by advisory services; an increase in access to inputs;
and rehabilitation and construction of irrigation and post-harvest facilities that enabled year-round
production. Table A3.2 summarizes the results of the analysis.

Note: Quantity of production, prices and costs are the sum totals of averages compiled by beneficiary farmers’ groups.

9.      The increased revenues and profitability of the farmers’ groups enabled many of them to
improve their living standards. As stated in Annex 5, individual members of farmers’ groups
expressed the social benefits they obtained from engaging in project activities. For example,
Doussouba Sory Samoura, who resides in the village of Laya-Solima in Faranah Prefecture in
Center – Eastern Guinea, said: “Last season, I sold 200 sacks of cassava and earned GNF14
million. I’m able to pay for my children’s school fees, purchase a motorbike, and built a house

                                                          29
from the money I earned from sale of cassava sacks. Thanks to the support we got from the project,
we no longer need to go to rural creditors for support.”


Assessment of administrative and operational efficiency

10.     The project encountered delays in implementation of certain key activities due mainly to
operational inefficiencies related to heavy government approval processes for procurement
activities. Within the government system, a multiplicity of procurement processes and procedures
require approvals and clearances at each institutional level. This caused considerable delays in the
issuance of contracts, and hence, the construction and rehabilitation of some critical infrastructure.
The delays in government approvals led to extension of the closing date of the project on two
occasions before two construction works were fully completed at Frenkamaya and Kada in the
Siguiri Prefecture in Kakan region. Although the project generated significant benefits that accrued
to beneficiaries, administrative and operational inefficiencies impacted project implementation.

       Annex 5. Beneficiary/Impact Assessment Survey


1.     A key aspect of the project’s M&E design was the conduct of an impact assessment survey
to measure project impacts on the country’s food security situation as well as to track key
performance indicators. A beneficiary assessment was not conducted at the end of project, but in
lieu of this, the ICR team carried out a rapid assessment of project outcomes. This annex
summarizes that assessment.
Summary of project impacts on beneficiaries
2.      Methodology and sampling. As part of the ICR preparation process, a two-day workshop
to ascertain project impacts was organized in Kindia in the middle of Guinea. The workshop’s
objective was to bring together all stakeholders involved in project implementation to discuss
project achievements, impacts, and implementation issues. A key aspect of the workshop was to
document testimonies from direct project beneficiaries (rural farmers). This activity was deemed
important given the lack of a beneficiary assessment survey. Therefore, the ICR team had the
opportunity to listen to direct beneficiaries of the project.

3.     Approximately 50 representatives of all beneficiary institutions attended the workshop,
including the producers’ groups involved in project implementation. They included: (i) the
technical units of the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) at national and regional levels; (ii) the
technical units of the Ministry of Livestock (MoL); (iii) the Ministry of Technical and Vocational
Training; (iv) the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MoEF); (v) the National Confederation of
Peasant Organizations; (vi) producers’ groups; (vii) the National Confederation of Guinea
Breeders; and (viii) the ENAEs (Ecole Nationale de l’Agriculture et de l’Elevage).

4.       Key questions asked were as follows. (a) Beneficiary institutions: Before the project what
was the situation of your institution? In your opinion, how has the project helped improve your
institution? If yes, what are the specific benefits your institution got from the project? What
activities did you institution implement and what were the challenges you faced? And how did you
resolve them? (b) Producers’ groups: Which producers’ group do you belong to? Where is the
group located? How many members are in the group, and how many are women? Did your group
exist before the project? How has the project helped improve your operations? What was your
volume of production in last season? How much did you earn from selling your produce? Has the
income you earn helped improved your living standards? Tell us about how you use the income to
improve your living conditions?

5.       Impact on beneficiary institutions. Major impacts of the project on beneficiary
institutions are as follows:
     Improved operational capacity through acquisition of logistics such as vehicles and
         motorbikes.
     Improved work environment through renovation and equipment of offices as well as the
         construction of water points, which increased beneficiary offices’ access to potable water.


                                                33
        Improved access to information technology through the acquisition of computer equipment
         and projectors.
        Improvement in DNSV intervention capacity through the training of community animal
         health agents (agents communautaires de santé animale/ACSA) in poultry vaccination and
         in SNVP through the training in phytosanitary treatment for agence de defense de cultures
         (ADC) auxiliary services.
        Improved storage g through the acquisition of solar fridges, iceboxes, etc.
        Improved capacity to teach and learn through rehabilitation of livestock infrastructure and
         spaces for breeding of nuclei in the ENAEs.
        Improved production capacity through the rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and the
         provision of a variety of livestock for the ENAEs.
        Improved capacity of various areas and staff management and leaders of all institutions
         involved in project implementation.

6.       Specific institutions that benefitted from project interventions include:

7.      ANPROCA (Agence Nationale de la Promotion Rurale et du Conseil Agricole): Before
the project, ANPROCA lacked material and equipment. Also lacking were: means of transport for
regional directors and agricultural extension officers; adequate office space; IT and
communications equipment; operating budget (fuel, lubricant, maintenance, adequate training,
synergy between technical units). Project interventions improved ANPROCA’s work environment
as follows:
     Construction and equipment of regional offices, including provision of water points;
     Logistics (96 motorbikes, 1 4x4 wheel drive, computer and communication equipment (14
        desktop computers, 9 laptops, 8 video projects, 8 cameras, 8 numeric photo equipment, 8
        photocopies, 8 generating set, 1 tractor and accessories, 8 scanners, 8 projection screens, 6
        set of agricultural processing kits for rice, maize and cassava.
     Strengthening of technical capacity of the staff of the complementary units, and
        collaboration with partners and technical institutions involved in project implementation.

8.       Ecole Nationale d’Agriculture et de L’Evage (ENAE) de Guinee. The ENAEs provide:
(i) initial three-year training for young graduates to become Contrôleurs des Travaux Agricoles
(CTA) and Contrôleurs Techniques d’Elevage (CTE); and (ii) initial training for graduates who
have obtained a type A three-year degree to become Assistants Techniques d’Agriculture (ATA)
and Assistants Techniques d’Elevage (ATE). These institutions’ infrastructure had not been
renovated or upgraded since 1956. Their obsolete infrastructure and equipment rendered them
incapable of providing practical training for students. According to ENAE representatives, the
project: (i) rehabilitated the schools’ livestock infrastructure; (iii) supplied them with a variety of
breeding species, equipment, agricultural tools, and livestock machinery; (iv) provided them with
agricultural inputs, crop protection products and veterinary; and (v) provided them with water
points. The provision of computer equipment required for training, supply of a motorbike and
crushers, rehabilitation of dams and irrigation systems enabled them to irrigate 56 ha of land, and
the construct threshing and dry facilities in ENAE of Tolo. Project support provided 678 learners
with practical training. The students’ involvement in poultry monitoring and surveillance has
motivated them; strengthened the capacity of teaching and learning. The agricultural dams
rehabilitated enabled crop production in all season. The working relations of the ENAEs have

                                                  34
improved as their prophylactic plan has been harmonized. The ENAEs have future business
climate as they could easily market their products. Their IT environment have also improved

9.     National Directorate of Veterinary Services (DNSV). The DNSV benefited from the
following:
     Vehicle (Nissan pickup double cabin );
     A laptop for the development of various project documents;
     A video projector with screen for realization of the different programs (Community Animal
       Health Agents/ACSA), veterinarians, officials, CONEG, etc.);
     A digital camera for production of activity reports;
     A photocopier for the production of CASA training materials;
     Various meetings organized in the form of workshops (programming of technical meetings,
       Steering Committee, progress reports, etc.) The project contributed to the methodological
       training for managers in the DNSV and CONEG in terms of annual budget program
       preparation, elaboration of action plans, and cost recovery.

10.     Impact of post-harvest processing in support of women: The project supported
women’s groups with post-harvest processing equipment, allowing them to engage in income-
generating activities (IGAs). Women’s groups with production potential received rice processing
equipment (8 lots), maize (17 batches), and cassava (17 units) to process and transform their
produce into finished products. To enhance their processing capacity, the project provided various
trainings in processing technologies. Operation of these facilities alleviated the daily tasks of
women, improved their labor productivity, enabled faster processing times, and increased
women’s incomes and revenues.

 Last season, I sold 200 sacks of cassava and earned GNF14 million compared with 5million I earned before the 
 project. I’m able to pay for my children’s school fees, purchase a motorbike, and built a house from the money I 
 earned from sale of cassava sacks Thanks to the support we got from the project, we no longer need to go to 
 rural creditors for support.

 On behalf of the group we thank the project for the support. Before the project we had difficulty in controlling 
 weeds for the growth of our crops. Through the use and application of herbicides our farms remain clean until 
 harvest. We also benefited from the use of fertilizers which cost us GNF320, 000 before the project. Now we 
 only buy it for GNF135, 000. Before the project, we were practicing a sprinkling sowing with no standard 
 pattern. With the help of the extension officers we learned new planting method for the rice seed we received 
 from the project. The new method boosted our production and we harvested nearly 2.5 tons/ha.

 We received seeds, fertilizers and herbicides from the project. With the support of the extension officers, we 
 mastered new techniques of farming and our yields have increased, and on an area of one ha, we received 3 
 tons of rice as against less than 2 tons we usually received. With the increased production my income increased

 Reduction in the influence of usurers (rural creditors): thanks to the project, we no longer have to relay funds 
 from rural credit for cultivation of our crops. Before the projects, the rural creditors lent us money at a high 
 interest usually in the form of taking the larger share of our harvest. This situation no exist as the project 
 increased our access to farm inputs at cheaper prices: GNF135, 000 compared to 320,000 before the project. 
                                                                                    
  



11.     Impact of rehabilitation of cultivation facilities. Construction and rehabilitation of
structures, raising of the water level, and regulation of dams and dikes yielded the following
impacts:


                                                        36
         Increased cultivated fields/areas. The project intervention led to an increase in areas
          under cultivation as well as the irrigation of previously untapped areas. This extension of
          irrigation and drainage facilities increased the size of individual fields as well as access to
          land. Beneficiary areas include: Koba in Lower Guinea- 900 ha; Malipan Moukidjigué in
          Middle Guinea - 275 ha; and Tougué in Middle Guinea -150 ha. Before the project,
          production activities could only be performed for five months of the year, but with project
          support, cultivation is now year-round.
         Increased production potential with the practice of two crop cycles (winter crops and
          lean season) by region. This crop rotation also contributes to the restoration and
          management of soil fertility.
         Cultivation of a wide range of food and vegetable crops by producers and availability
          and rational management of water has allowed beneficiaries to develop various crops in
          the lean season in October, when there are no rains, until the beginning of the following
          rainy season in May. This diversification has enabled them to feed their families throughout
          the year.

12.    The follow through of cropping year improved farmers’ skills by introducing them to new
production techniques. 
 
13.   The functioning and operation of the principal and the secondary canals of the irrigation
schemes led to:
     Labor savings associated with the periodic work of clearing and cleaning of canals;
     Reduced loss of water from seepage or leakage of main canals;
     Time savings associated with watering plots because of the ease of flow of water in the
      main cemented channels;
     Reduced fuel use for the operation of pumps that serve the same area. For example, in the
      village of Soumbalako in Mamou Prefecture benefited from an irrigation pumping system
      that has significantly improved its operations.

14.    The construction of bridges in some areas facilitated farmers’ movement, enabling them to
use other means for transporting goods (such as tillers) and allowing them to more easily transport
goods.

15.     The construction of a road embankment in Frenkamaya area opened up the village of Tando
(population 4,500), located on the other side of a river. Access to this road has reduced the distance
travelled by villagers to reach the main road leading to Siguiri Prefecture from 2 hours to 30
minutes. It facilitates the transport of rice to the threshing floor built on the edge of the plain and
allows trucks to easily carry sand quarry from the dikes along the river.

16.      Impact on employment. The use of local labor by firms for some work (excavation,
dredging of canals, digging, building, etc.) created employment in some localities. The most
illustrative case is that of the EGEC company, which built a dam, two stores, and five threshing
floors and rehabilitated the irrigation network at Kada in Siguiri Prefecture. The earnings of
unskilled local labor is equivalent to the amount of GNF1, 092, 350,000 and that of skilled labor,
GNF208, 560,000.

Summary of Achievements

1.      The project development objective (PDO) was to increase smallholder productivity for
targeted commodities in the intervention areas. The indicators for measuring the project objectives
were achieved. The number of direct beneficiaries reached was estimated at 218,660 against a
target value of 180,000 (87,464 women), which represents 121.5 percent of the target value. The
achievements of indicator 2 were as follows: Irrigated rice: 3.6 tons/ha, representing 97.2 percent
of the target of 3.5 tons/ha. Compared to the baseline, yield increased from 2.5 tons/ha to 3.5
tons/ha, and an increase of 40 percent. Upland rice: 2.1 tons/ha was achieved compared with the
target of 1.6 tons/ha (131.25 percent). This was a 60 percent increase over the baseline of 1.0
tons/ha. Maize: The target was 166.7 percent achieved, going from 2.1 tons/ha to 3.5 tons/ha.
Compared to the baseline, the yield increased from 1.6 tons/ha to 3.5 tons/ha, and an increase of
118.7 percent. Cassava: The target was 20 tons/ha; the actual 23.6 tons/ha represented a 118
percent achievement. Poultry mortality rate: The aim was to achieve a 40 percent reduction in the
mortality rate of traditional poultry vaccinated. An evaluation of the health status of poultry was
carried out in the project area before the start of the vaccination campaign. The evaluation of the
mortality rate was performed by the technical services of the Ministry of Livestock at the end of
the next year’s vaccination campaign.

Achievements by Component
Component 1: Rehabilitation and improved management of irrigation and storage
infrastructure in selected rice-producing areas
2.      This component aimed to increase the productivity of irrigated rice production systems in
targeted areas through rehabilitation and better management of infrastructure. Three main
subcomponents were implemented under this component: (i) rehabilitation of irrigation and
drainage infrastructure; (ii) rehabilitation and construction of post-harvest infrastructure (such as
warehouses and drying areas); and (iii) organizational support and capacity building, including
training, for the operation and maintenance of these rehabilitated infrastructures.


3.      Rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure: The objective of this
subcomponent was to improve the control of water through the rehabilitation of degraded dams
and equipment, for the recovery of a total area of 3,620 abandoned hectares. The National
Directorate of Rural Engineering supervised the execution of 2,520 ha in 2014. In 2015, the project
rehabilitated 1,100 hectares through a private office firm called GUIDE SA. The subcomponent
helped restore the productive capacities of 3,620 ha of irrigation schemes. That area is used by
producers for rice cultivation followed by vegetable crops, thereby doubling the production
potential.

4.      Rehabilitation construction of post-harvest infrastructure: This activity intended to
improve storage and marketing capacities by building 20 stores and 50 threshing floors, and
strengthening producers’ groups’ capacity to manage the facilities, including the irrigation and


                                                 38
drainage systems. The project built 23 stores (115 percent over the 20 stores targeted), and 47 (94
percent) threshing floors/drying out of 50 targeted.

5.      Management and maintenance of infrastructure (irrigation / drainage, / drying and
storage). To effectively manage the infrastructure constructed and rehabilitated, 50 management
committees were established compared to the target of 37. These management committees
received support to establish a framework for management of rehabilitated infrastructure,
including annual maintenance (perimeters, shops, and other facilities) and to establish a fee system
to cover maintenance perimeters. In total, 404 members, including 73 women, were trained
compared to the target of 417 members (97 percent). To strengthen the operation of management
committees, the project provided small equipment (wheelbarrows, pickaxes, shovels, machetes,
hoes, etc.) for infrastructure maintenance.

Component 2: Access to improved inputs, technical support services, and post-harvest
equipment
6.       This component aimed to improve smallholder farmers’ access to improved inputs,
advisory and support services, and post-harvest processing equipment to improve the productivity
of targeted products. It was implemented through two subcomponents: (i) improving smallholder
farmers’ access to agriculture and veterinary inputs; and (ii) improving post-harvest products’
transformation process. Key activities implemented included: Improving smallholder access to
agricultural and veterinary inputs: 185 tons of irrigated rice, 3,000 tons of upland rice (600 tons
of rice lowland, 2,400 tons of rice hill), 750 tons of maize, 1,500,000 cassava seedlings/cuttings,
and 8,000,000 doses of vaccines and deworming against Newcastle disease in traditional poultry
were procured and distributed. The use of these inputs resulted in the following: 3,185 tons of rice
seed (irrigated and rainfed) and 3,935 tons were purchased and distributed. In addition to the
quantities procured and distributed, CNOP-G recovered 1,910 tons of quantities supplied in 2013
and 2014. About 750 tons of maize seed were purchased and distributed. In addition to the
quantities procured and distributed, CNOP-G recovered 384 tons in 2013 and 2014. Of the 1.5
million cassava cuttings targeted, 2.45 million were procured and distributed, representing 163
percent of the target value. The surplus quantities of rice seed and cassava cuttings were due to the
fact that an additional 750 tons of rice and 850,000 cassava cuttings were procured for Ebola-
affected areas, including five prefectures not previously covered under the 17 intervention areas:
Dubréka and Coyah in Lower Guinea, Dalaba in Middle Guinea, Kérouané in Upper Guinea, and
located in Guéckédou village. Lastly, CNOP-G purchased and distributed 1,512.5 tons of chemical
fertilizer out of 3,810 tons targeted.


7.     Out of 3,810 tons of chemical fertilizer targeted, 1,512.5 tons were purchased by the project
and the resources available to CNOP-G. The BND bought 471 tons, for a total of 1,983.5 tons (52
percent). In total, of 51,200 liters of herbicide planned, 23,200 liters were purchased from project
resources and made available to CNOP-G and 6,142 liters to the BND, totaling 29,342 liters (57.3
percent). Eight million doses of vaccines and deworming were provided for the immunization of
poultry against traditional Newcastle disease.

8.     The project supported information and awareness-raising activities for all stakeholders in
the sector by producing and broadcasting programs on good practices to improve livestock

                                                 39
productivity traditional poultry, field veterinary officers (300), and training 600 village
vaccinators, including updating and producing technical manuals for use by Community Animal
Health Agents (CASA) and veterinary field workers. The project funded the reproduction of 3,000
copies of textbooks and the acquisition of rolling stock and computer monitoring and supervision
missions of the National Directorate of Veterinary Services (DNSV) and the National
Confederation of Guinea Producers (CONEG).

9.      Despite the above achievements, the beginning of the vaccination campaign slowed due to
fear among local people that vaccination can transmit the Ebola virus. Intensive sensitization
efforts allowed the exercise to resume. Over 100,800 households received vaccines and
deworming drugs. The vaccination and deworming campaign continues under the supervision of
Department of Livestock’s decentralized units, including in the prefectures affected by Ebola.

10.     Of the target of 92,200 technology packages, 104,165 were distributed: (i) irrigated rice
technology packages consist of seeds, fertilizers, and herbicides with an average standard of 0.5
hectares per household; (ii) for upland rice, improved seeds were provided by the project on the
basis of 1 ha per household; (ii) for maize, 50 kg/ha of fertilizer was provided by the project. To
enable farmers to benefit from full technological packages, additional quantities of fertilizer
(17,285 tons of NPK and 186 tons of urea) were provided for rainfed rice and maize, respectively,
with GoG support.
        

11.      Improved post-harvest products targeted for transformation. (i) Eight rice processing units
(multi-thresher, huller) for eight groups with a total membership of 382; (ii) 17 small batches of
maize processing equipment (mill, husker) for 17 groups with 751 members; and (iii) 17 equipment
units for cassava (mill, crusher, pulp press) were purchased for 17 groups of 609 female members.
In total, 42 women's groups with 1,742 members directly benefited from rice, maize, and cassava
processing equipment. Over 400 group members and 17 ANPROCA and CNOP-G staff received
training in different techniques of processing and preservation to further provide training in their
respective groups. Thus, implementation of this subcomponent increased the capacity of women’s
groups involved in small-scale, primary post-harvest processing. It also contributed to the
alleviation of women's activities in processing post-harvest products, reducing losses, and
improving the quality of processed products.
        

12.     Institutional support to ENAE, technical departments, and agricultural organizations. The
project supported ENAEs with: rehabilitation of the hydro-agricultural dam at Tolo, infrastructure
for animal farming (chicken coops, barns, pigsties, hutches, etc.); sets of agricultural equipment
and small tools; and breeding nuclei of 60 cattle, 60 sheep, 60 goats, 30 pigs, 40 rabbits, 40 ducks,
and 20,000 chicks.

13.     ANPROCA’s technical directorates benefited from rehabilitation and equipment of its
national and eight regional offices. They were provided with logistics such as vehicles,
motorcycles, office furniture, and computer equipment. Staff received significant training. The
project supported the provision of advisory services through technical training for an estimated
3,900 producers and technicians, the conduct of technology demonstrations, and dissemination of
technical packages. Various trainings were organized in 109 rural communities, focused on the

                                                 40
following themes: (i) improved cultural practices; (ii) safe use of agro-chemicals in agricultural
production and conservation; (iii) environmental and social safeguard instruments; and (iv) farm
management (calculation of production costs and profits) to operate facilities, equipment,
irrigation water, etc. Overall, 4,716 producers, managers, and technicians were trained, exceeding
the target of 3,900 by approximately 121 percent.

Component 3: Capacity building, project coordination, and M&E
14.    The achievements under this component include: Procurement of goods and works: 65
contracts (US$8,876,308) were awarded out of 69 contracts planned (US$11,393,820);
Construction: 21 contracts were awarded and executed at a cost of US$5,028,864; Consultancy:
32 contracts were awarded for a total amount of US$3,309,946. A total of 118 contracts out of 126
planned were awarded. Disbursement: US$18.84 out of US$20 million were disbursed,
representing a 94.2 percent disbursement rate. The disbursement rate increased with the
withdrawal of applications for payment of various commitments before the end of the grace period
of September30, 2015.

15.    Monitoring and Evaluation. ANPROCA and BSD ensured internal and external
monitoring, respectively. To make data tracking operational, the project received initial support
from an international consultant for the analysis of the project components to gather all the
necessary M&E information, including the indicators. The project received a second support to
develop monitoring tools for implementing partners and obtained support to establish a
management information system (MIS) that helped improve data collection and analysis. Various
workshops and trainings were organized to disseminate M&E data and reports.

16.      Environmental and Social Safeguard Monitoring: This activity suffered from delays in
the recruitment of a safeguards specialist. The project therefore arranged for the use of the PACV-
2 (Village Communities Support Program) safeguards specialist who helped implement key
activities toward the end of the project. In line with the Bank’s safeguards policies, the project
financed the development of materials for an Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF), a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and a Pesticides Management Plan (PMP). The
safeguards specialist conducted an environmental screening and found no major issues associated
with project implementation.

Conclusion
17.    PUAPA-2 was implemented successfully and it is important to consolidate the gains for
new programs. PUAPA-2 achievements should open new areas of initiatives that will further
support and improve agricultural productivity in Guinea. To this end, the following are
recommended:
     Support provision of fertilizer, seed, and small processing equipment;
     Strengthen management committees to enable them to manage their respective areas;
     Implement actions that would promote value addition through processing and marketing
       of products, and promote a better transformation and conservation of products;
     Continue with training activities for producers to improve their technical capacity; and
     Strengthen agricultural advisers’ capacity to enable them to provide the necessary technical
       support to producers.
