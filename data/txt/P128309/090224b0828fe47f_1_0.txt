Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Following the initial arrangement made since January 2014 to make the works supervised by the National Directorate of Rural Infrastructures (DNGR) 9
 small size irrigated perimeters have been rehabilitated and the associated storage and drying facilities have been also constructed, all satisfactorily.
 These progress were also due to intensive follow up from the Bank in collaboration with FAO-CP.
 However the huge delay observed to get the enterprises on board for the remaining works related to the 2 largest perimeters in the Prefecture of
 Siguiri associated with a disbursement rate of 52 % almost at the initial closing date have become a matter of critical concern. As this situation is
 likely to impact the PDO attainment, it 's rating has been downgraded from S to MS until further assessment on the progress of the remaining works.
 The progress is likely if all conditions agreed upon for the extension of the closing date to May 31, 2015 are met. These include: the conclusion of
 procurement process and the starting of works under the control of a competent firm to be quickly hired by the PIU and under the technical supervision
 of the DNGR. In the meantime all process of capacity reinforcement farmers organizations have to be completed.

         So far the previous indicator data has to be considered. The assessment is ongoing to update the yields information. The new data will be
         available by end December 2014. This is also the case for all other crops: rainfed rice, maize and cassava.
