                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         It was agreed that both the Government and the Bank will continue to ensure intensive follow up of project implementation to make sure the project is catching up on the starting
                         delay is progressing towards its development objectives. Given the good implementation trend but with likely delay in completion of civil works of the component1 by the current date
                         of closure, a possibility of six months extension of such closing date was explored by the Client.
                         The task team is favorable to such an extension and will initiate the process by early July 2014 at the last if a formal request is received from the Client.
                         The disbursement rate is still low, by far lagging below the target. The Client should make sure the contract with DNGR is extended so that civil works being implemented by
                         contractors could be appropriately monitored.
                         In the meantime , the Client should make sure TORs of the control firm are adjusted to cover just the largest irrigation sheme to be rehabilitated in districts of Siguiri and Kissidougou.
