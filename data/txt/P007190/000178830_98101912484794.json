the\n            equipment, technical assistance and training services to\n            implement the Government's highway maintenance program\n            for the period mid-1981 to mid-1985. Project activities\n            would be initiated in 1980 and 1981 with the preparation of\n            a detailed program and the purchase of the initial supply of\n            equipment. The risks associated with highway maintenance\n            projects are greater than those of construction projects\n            because the former require more and broader institutional\n            involvement. To reduce the risks involved in the proposed\n            project, a comprehensive multi-year program has been\n            proposed to establish the foundation for improved road\n            maintenance. The implementation schedule is phased to meet\n            policy objectives gradually. It takes into account the time\n            required for equipment purchases and mobilization of human,\n            physical and financial resources. Also (i) DGC staff\n            participated directly in project preparation and (ii)\n            substantial technical assistance is being provided."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
