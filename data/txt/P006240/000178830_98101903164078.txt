INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

PROPOSED LOAN

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMM0ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
BANCO DO NORDESTE DO BRASIL, S.A.
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$25 million to
the Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the first one to a development
finance company in Brazil. While Bank lending to industry in Brazil
began only last year, with the $22 million loan for the Alcominas
aluminum project, we have long felt that the Bank could make an important
contribution to Brazil's industrial development by strengthening local
financial institutions which are major sources of long-term capital for
private industrial firms.  BNB is an official entity which serves as the
regional development bank for Northeast Brazil; it plays a leading role
in the Government's industrialization program for a large and populous
region whose development is far behind that of the rest of the country.
It is hoped that the proposed loan will be the first of a series of loans
for industrial financing in Brazil over the coming years.
3.        The proposal was appraised by a mission which visited Brazil
during April/May 1969 and the mission's report was supplemented by the
findings of the industrial policy group attached to this year's Bank
economic mission, which made a special study of industrialization in the
Northeast. Negotiations were held in Washington during September 22-30
and November 4-7. BNB was represented by its President,
Mr. Rubens vaz da Costa,and the Government by Mr. Jayme Alipio de Barros,
the General Counsel of the Ministry of Finance.
4.        The proposed loan would be the 27th Bank loan to Brazil.
It would increase the total of Bank loans to $658 million (net of
cancellations). The following is a summary statement of Bank loans to
Brazil as of November 30, 1969:

5.        The undisbursed figure includes the full amount of the $40
million livestock project loan which was signed in September 1967 and
became effective in December 1967. The establishment of regional offices
for this project proved to be time-consuming, and ranchers initially
displayed less interest in participating in the project than had been
expected. More recently, however, there has been an encouraging increase
in the amount of loans applied for, and the processing of loans in the
project offices has been accelerated.  At the end of Noveniber, 49 applica-
tions for loans totalling USi6.3 million had been approved; 28 loan
contracts for a total of US$4.25 million had been signed. A disbursement
request has recently been received. A mission to determine the principal
causes of the slow progress and to recommend means of speeding it returned
from Brazil in mid-December and is preparing its report.



-3-
6.        The above table also reflects initial delays in disbursements
on saoe of the power loans made in 1965-66; work on these projects is
now progressing well and present completion schedules appear realistic.
The fcur generating units financed under the first Bank loan for the
Estreito Project (403-BR) were scheduled to be in service by the end of
1969 and the entire project, including the two generating units and
the transmission line subsequently added (474-BR), should be completed
in 1973. You were informed of the status of the Xavantes Project
(404-BR) in connection with my proposal last month (R69-235) that an
additional transmission line be included in the project and the Closing
Date postponed to December 31, 1971. It is now estimated that the
Jaguara Project (442-BR) will be completed in the first half of 1972,
about a year later than originally scheduled. Disbursements under the
four power distribution loans (475/478-BR) are expected to rise rapidly
in the coming months since by October 31 1969 some $54 million of the
total of $61.6 in the four loans had either already been c ammitted or
would be caTmitted under contracts being tendered for. Loan 576-BR
for $26 million made in October 1968 became effective in May 1969 and
the first disbursement request has recently been received.
7.        IFC has made investments in 10 ccmpanies in Brazil for a total
of $41.1 million (net of cancellations).  The following is a summary of
IFC investments in Brazil as of November 30, 1969:

8.        The Bank is actively cooperating with the Government and
private agencies in Brazil in preparing projects in transportation,
agriculture, power, industry, mining, education and water supply and
sewerage which appear to be suitable for Bank loans. In the coming
months I intend to present to you for approval substantial loans for
a second highway construction project and for the Marimbondo hydro-
electric project.

PART III - THE PROJECT
10.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Banco do Nordeste do Brasil
S.A." (DB-52a) is attached.
11.       The Northeast of Brazil contains 27 million people (about 30
percent of the nation's population) whose per capita product at $200 is
about two-thirds of the average for the whole country. It has lagged
behind the rest of the country in economic development and has long been
considered a potential source of social and political unrest. Since
the late fifties, the Government has carried out a coordinated program
for industrial and agricultural development there, and the rate of growth
in the region in the last ten years has been in excess of that of the
rest of the country.  An important instrument in the Government's program
is the so-called 34/18 system under which firms choosing to invest in
the region may obtain a full tax credit of up to 50 percent of their



income tax liability by placing funds in special non-interest-bearizig
accounts with BNB pending their investment in industrial, agricultural
and telecommunications projects approved by the regional planning
organization. These 34/18 tax credits may by law be used in certain
cases to provide up to 75 percent of the non-loan financing of suitable
projects; in practice such funds have financed about 45 percent of
the total cost of projects approved in recent years while the owners'
contribution frcm non-34/18 funds has averaged scme 22 percent. By
the end of 1968, approval had been granted for more than 600 projects
with a total investment of about $900 million.
12.       The Bank mission which studied the Northeast industrialization
program found that it had been highly successful in mobilizing resources
and stimulating investment in industry, and that the individual proJects
financed were almost all economically sound and capable of yielding
high financial returns.  However, the mission also came to the conclu-
sion that the very success of the program cast doubt on the continued
need for the very generous incentives it provided and recommended
measures that would reduce the portion of 34/18 funds and increase the
amount of the ownerst equity. During negotiations, assurances were
received frcm BNB that its policy was to seek to assure that the
maximum feasible amount of non-34/18 funds was invested in the projects
it financed, and that projects in which non-34/18 funds accounted for
less than 25 percent of the total cost would not be submitted for
financing under the proposed loan except in special circumstances.
13.       BNB was established in 1954 to further the economic devel-
opment of the Northeast by financing productive investments in industry
and agriculture. The Government owns 72.9 percent of BNB's share
capital, state and local gcvernments 1.5 percent and some 40O,000 private
shareholders, two-thirds of them in the Northeast, the remaining 25.6
percent. BiB's Board consists of a president, appointed by the
President of the Republic for an indefinite term, and four directors
elected by the Government at a time when its holding was over 80 per-
cent of the share capital. Since private shareholders ncwJ own over
25 percent of the share capital, they will be able to elect one of
the four directors when the term of the present Board expires in 1973.
lVhile BNB must naturally be responsive to the Government on policy
matters, the Government does not intervene in day-to-day management
or in lending decisions.  BIB is a well organized institution with
energetic management and a well-paid and highly competent professional
staff.
14.       BNB is both a development bank and a commercial bank lending
to industry, agriculture and public utilities. During 1966-68 its
lending expanded in real terms by nearly 150 percent; investment loans
to private industry accounted for 21 percent of total loans at the end



- 6 -
of June 1969, while agricultural loans made up 31 percent of the total.
The temporary deposits deriving from the 34/18 system have provided
the bulk of BNB's local currency resources; foreign currency resources
have been provided mainly by the Inter-American Development Bank
through six loans totalling $53.3 million. BNB's capital structure is
conservative. The ratio of total debt to equity at the end of June
1969 was 4.4:1 and it has been agreed during negotiations that BNB
could prudently increase total debt up to ten times equity and long-
term debt up to four times equity in order to afford BNB's management
the flexibility it needs in conducting its diverse operations. Agree-
ment was also reached during negotiations on the application of a
liquidity formula which would limit BNB's maximum exposure in long,
medium and short-term lending in accordance with the availability of
suitable resources.
15.       BNB's rate of return on equity, in real terms, has been high
owing to the leverage provided by the availability of low-cost funds,
principally 341/18 deposits, even though in conformity with Government
policy it was until recently charging interest rates on its loans
which were in effect negative after taking into account the rate of
inflation. There has, however, been a fall in profitability in the
past few years and, in order to assure that BNB's capital would not
in the future be subject to erosion by inflation and that BNB's indus-
trial lending wculd be on a sound basis, the Government has agreed
that positive interest rates should be charged on its long-term
industrial loans. A recent decision of the National Monetary Council
permits the major national development banks from January 1 1970
onwards to apply a full monetary correction, and to charge interest
rates of 4 to 12 percent, on loans for over five years made from
cruzeiro resources. The bulk of BN\B's industrial lending has been in
this category and its management intends to charge a 10 percent "real"
interest rate on such loans. With respect to loans of less than five
years, the Monetary Council's decision permits BNB to charge an
interest rate of 22 percent. BNB has undertaken to the Bank that it
will earn an annual return on its equity capital exceeding by not less
than five percentage points the annual rate of inflation in Brazil.
16.       BNB is the only local source of long-term financing for
the average industrialist in the Northeast. During 1965-68 BNB made
more than 225 new industrial loans, with a total value exceeding
NCr$260 million ($75 million); nearly half of these loans being to
new enterprises. Over the years BNB has acquired a considerable
expertise in industrial lending. Project appraisals are based on
sound eccnomic criteria and carefully carried out and project super-
vision is thorough. This is done at reasonable cost and industrial
lending has been making a satisfactory contribution to BIB's net
earnings. It was agreed during negotiations that BNB would seek to
earn on its future industrial lending a "real", net rate of return
at least equal to the interest rate at which the Bank proposed to
lend to BNB.



- 7 -
17.       An increasing backlog of loan applications indicates that,
despite the steady expansion of its ind-ustrial lending, BEN has not
been able to keep pace with the demand.   The proposed Bank loan would
provide BNB with the foreign currency it will need over the next two
years. The funds provided by the Bank will be lent to or otherwise
invested in private industrial firms in the Northeast. Loans wall be
for periods up to 15 years at an interest rate of not less than
9-1/2 percent, with the exchange risk being assumed by the borrower.
Loans or iinvestments of more than " 250,000 will require the prior
approval of the Bank. As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan, BNB will make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank to ensure
the availability of the additional long-term cruzeiro funds required
by BNB for its industrial lending program. These arrangements are now
under discussion with the Government.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUIENTS AND AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Banco d.o
lIordeste do Brasil, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Federative
Republic of Brazil and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distri-
buted to the Executive Directors separately.
19.       The draft Loan Agreement follows the usual pattern of agree-
ments for Bank loans to development finance companies. The following
provisions are of special interest:
(a)  Section 5.07 sets forth BIB's undertaking to earn
the annual return on equity capital mentioned in
paragraph 14 above.
(b)  Section 5.03 (e) requires BNB, upon request by the
Bank, to assign and transfer sub-loans and invest-
ments made out of the proceeds of the Loan to the
Bank. Certain of the loans to BNB from the Inter-
American Development Bank mentioned in paragraph 13
above include similar arrangements for assignment
of sub-loans, and this provision seeks equivalent
treatment for the Bank's loan.
(c)  Section 7.01 (c) specifies as a condition of
effectiveness that BNB's 1969 financial statements
be audited by an independent accountant or accoun-
ting firm and that BNB's financial condition as
disclosed by such audited financial statements be
satisfactory to the Bank.



- 8 -
20.       The draft Guarantee Agreement is in the usual form.   Section
3.06 sets forth the undertaking of the Guarantor to take such measures
as may be necessary to assure the realization of positive interest
rates for industrial lending by the major national development banks.
The Guarantor has taken the necessary measures to ensure positive
interest rates for industrial lending by such banks at present rates
of inflation, as indicated in paragraph 15 above.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
21.       A Bank economic mission visited Brazil in 1l"arch-April 1969.
Its report (WII-195a) is being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. It concludes that the Government is generally continuing
to follow reasonable stabilization and development policies and that
Brazil remains creditworthy for substantial amounts of external
borrowing.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
23.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
