i.        ]3anco do Nordeste do Brasil S.A. (BNB) was established in 195ht
by the Federal Government of Brazil to contribute to the economic develop-
ment of the Northeast of the country.
ii.       The Brazilian Northeast, which contains over 27 million inhabi-
tants or 219% of the noontry's nonulation- has lgedr1 fa-r behinr the rest
of the counatry in its economic development. Nortleastern agriculture is

ment in agriculture as well as in private industry and in certain public
utiI ties.   Moreover, it is a fuLi-fiedged commerciai bank, making
short-term loans and discounting commercial paper. A, large part of its
resources consists of special deposits generated under the tax credit
scheme, at average maturities of 12 to 18 months.   Other resources are
provided by loans from the inter-American Development Bank, demand and
term deposits from the public, and rediscount facilities with the central
banik.
iv.       BNBis total loan and discount portfolio increased from NCr$ 35i.2
million (at 1968 prices) in 1965 to NCr$ 869 million in 1968. As of
June 30, 1969, 35% of its portfolio was at short-term, 11% at medium-term
(six months to two years) and 54% at long-term (over two years).   Invest-
ment loans to private industry accounted for 21% of total loans, while
agricultural finance was 31% of the total.
v.        Total assets increased from NCr$ 653.6 million in 1965 (at 1968
prices) toc NCr$ 1,237.6 million in 1968, in spite of the fact that BNB's
local currency loans have not been subject to monetary correction and are
therefore exposed to erosion by inflation.   Equity grew from NCr$ 34.8
million (a.t 1968 prices) to NCr$ 199.2 million during the same period.
Seventy-eight per cent of the increase in equity was derived from retained
earnings.

vi.       J3NB has a staff of more than 3,500 distributed among its head
office and 67 branches covering the Northeast region. It is well-
organized cmd capably managed. and has a generally satisfactorv record
of performnce.
vii.      BNB is presently facing a shortage of long-term resources.   It
has requested a Bank loan of USA 25 mtiion tP rovide it T-.Tth foreirgn
currency resources to cover the import component of industrial investmernt
finanrcing.  On the local currency side, most of BOB's resources are at
short- and medium-term and liquidity considerations make it impossible t;o
employ more thann a sm.all part of them in longer-term ler.d1g.  ' ad--
tional resources which BNB hopes to attract during the coming years
shoul.d be sudfficient to satisfy the '4USt ied needs for long-termv  nunds
of its clientele. However, to assure the availability of sufficient long--
term cruze'iro resources to com5plementr the foreign. currency resou-rces whichi
would be nmade available by the Bank, it was agreed during negotiations
that BNB should make arrangements to udraw on supplemernt,ary resources ,o
the extent necessary to enable it to carry out an industrial investment
ler.dAin  p r o gra  of at least NCr$ 100 Milion each during 1970 and 1971
in the event the institution's ordinary resources fall short of expecta--
viii.     BNs3 cont'inues to lend at negative interest rates and below its
own cost in its agricultural lending program and consequently depends on
leverage wnth non-indexed, low cost funds and on other lending programs to op-
erate n)rofitably.  To avoid a possible eriosion of its equity, it was a.recd
during negotiations that BNB would take appropriate action whenever BNB's
return on equity (in real terms) drops below a rate of 5%. BNB also gave
a similar undertaking concerning the return on capital employed in its
industrial lending, which should not drop below a rate equal to the
Bank's lending rate on the proposed loan, which will be 7%.
ix.       f3lUB is a suitable and creditwiorthy borrofer. The proposed loan
of US$ 25 rnillion would cover its foreign exchange requirements for
financing of the import component of private industrial projects during a
period of around 18 months.  Its terms should be similar to those normaLly
applied to loans to development finance companies, including the standard
commitment charge. Additionally, the following specific points were
agreed upoIn during negotiations:
a. BNB will at all times apply to its operations a formula,
acceptable to the Bank, defining its minimum liquiditv
requirements;
b. BNB's total indebtedness will be limited to ten times
the amount of its unimnaired equitv. however', total
outstanding term debt (with initial maturities of more
than one year) tll not exceed four t-imes its uLn.mpaired
equity;



- iii -
c. the proceeds of a Bank loan will be relent at a rate
of at least 2.5% above the rate chargecl by the Bank;
d. the Bank's prior appiroval will be required for all
projects using more than us$ 250,000 from the loan;
however, the aggregate free limit for sub-loans not
reauiring the Bank's nrior anproval wTill be US: 5
million;
e. BNB will have its accounts audited annually by a
qualified independent auditor annephtable to the  xlcnk-
and submission of a report on the first audit made,
disclosing   a satisfactory financial position of the
institution, will be a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed loan.

II. THE ENVIRONMENT
General
2.        The Northeast of Brazil includes the states of Piaui, Ceara,
Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia, and
part of the state of Maranho. IThe limits established as the area of
operations of Banco do Nordeste do Brasil include not only the area tradi-
tionally known as the Northeast, but also the entire state of Maranhao,
as well as the northern part of Minas Gerais. Over 27 million inhabitants
live in thi.s area of 1.5 million square kilometers; that is, 29% of the
country's population lives in 17.6% of the area. The number of persons
per square kilometer varies from 5 in Piaui to 42 in Pernambuco. Annual
per capita income in the Northeast in 196g was around US$ 200 and in
Brazil as a whole, US$305. The Northeast is an area in which topography
and climate! have combined to produce three distinct climatic zones:
(a) the coastal "zona de mata"l, which is hot and tropical and contains
the region's major cities; (b) the "agreste" or intermediate zone, which
has a milder climate, and in which food crops are grown on a large scale;
and (c) thc i!sertaoTt which makes up the vast pnrtion c.f the regirn ard uhich
is a semi-arid land populated by farmers and ranchers.
3.        The "sertao" suffers the greatest extremes of climate.    An
amount of rain averaging about 27 inches falls over a period of several
months.  If the rainy season begins too late. if it is shortter than uisu1a
or if the rains are meager, then water resources may be insufficient to
provide for the rest of the year. and drought may result.    Tn addition,
the equatorial location of this area gives rise to a high evaporation
rate and water must be strintlv consernree to provide for the months of the
dry season, In the catastrophic drought of 1877-79, 50% of the population
of the Nort.heast died of a combination of thirs+, starvt4ion, or disease,



- 2 -
anu puiconenpushed. theL        Uve.nentv t4o create an T,L  1trIt
for the Northeast to deal with the problem of drought. This was the ini-
IJ.Lal step -Lrn a palDtiern of- institutoULon-bui-±duJng wIich followed z'moL  ev
subsequent severe drought. The focus until the middle of this century was
an engineering one; that is, a solution to th   r          du
one every ten years) was seenin the building of dams and reservoirs to con-
tain water, and of roads to enable the unfortunate inhabitants tuo escape
the area. The severity of the drought of 1950 clearly revealed the failure
of this approach to solve the problem, and a more integrated approach wEas
sought: one that would promote the economic development of the region in
general rather than concentrate narrowly on the fight against the effects
of the droughts.   The creation of Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB) was
seen as an answer to this need. Another drought in 1958 was the impetus
behind the creation of the Superintendency for the Development of the
Northeast (SUDENE).
4.        'Industrialization of the Northeast has lagged far behind the
national average. Between 1949 and 1958, the Northeast1s share in manu-
facturing output fell from 10.1% to 6.9%, and its share in manufacturingr
employment, from 16.7% to 11.0%. In 1960, industry (including mining,
construction and utilities as well as manufacturing) accounted for only
11% of regional income, as compared to 26% for Brazil as a whole.
5.        The wide gap between economic development in the region and in
the rest of the country, combined with a growing social and political
unrest and the phenomenon of the periodical droughts, underlie recent
Government policy for the Northeast.
SUDENE and the 34/18 Tax Credit Scheme
6.        Starting after the severe drought of 1958, the Federal Govern-
ment created SUDENE as its nrincinal instrument in the development of the
region. The new agency was granted broad authority to supplement and
control the activities of existing regional agencies. Besides infrastruc-
ture investments in the public sector, which are carried out directly by
SUDENE from funds stemming from the Federal budget, the agency also ad-
ministers important incentives to private investment in the field of
income tax and customs duty exemptions for incnstries.    Since 1961, these
incentives comprise a particularly powerful scheme known as the 't3h/18
schere".
7.        The    "AW18 scheme, which derives its namre frnm. two articles of
the Federal Laws approving SUDENEts Master Plans for 1961 and for 1963-
1 9-,6    ,4.- ,spectire 4I,y4 is a +xA- credit systet under wT.Thicb co.p rations tbroug-
out Brazil may discount up to 505 of their corporate income tax liability
for inves4trment in new or existing agricultural, industrial and tel.coLJMu
nications projects in the Northeast approved by SUDENE. Pending SUDENETs
approval these tax credit funds are deposited in non-interest bearing



- 3-
accounts * th BN.B. Until   cently, there was a period of three years
during which the depositor had to choose a project for investment and
notify SUD3E17NE of his intention; in March 1969, this period was reduced
to one year. Normally, the tax credit has to be invested in equity,
but under ce rtain circum-,Xsances    inves-,ment ia loarns to No-rheastern corm--
panies is also possible.  Similar schemes exist for the Amazon region
and for pr:Lority sectors such as fishing, reforestation and tourism.
8.        SUDENE uses a point system in determining the degree of priorJty
of projects submitted for approval. Points are awarded according to plant
location, essentiality, use of regional inputs, import substitution, broad-
based ownership, labor absorption and labor participation in profits.  I)e-
pending on priority as indicated by the points attributed to a project by
SUDENE, 34/18 tax credits may be used up to 75%, 60%, 50%, 40%, or 30%
of the project's total non-loan financing.
9.        Mhe aggregate total of deposits made for investments in the
Northeast under the 34/18 scheme from its inception in 1962 through 19683
was NCr$ l.t234.5 million at current prices (NCr$ 1,831.2 million at 1968
prices). D)uring the early years of the scheme, SUDENEIs project approvals
lagged behind the inflow of deposits but since 1967 the volume of approvals
has grown at a quicker rate than the volume of inflcwing deposits, so that
aggregate approvals exceeded deposits at the end of 1968. Actual disburse-
ments under approved investment projects were NCr$ 556.1 million at current
prices (NCr$ 646.2 million at 1968 prices) at the end of 1968.  The Supple-
mentary Report contains detailed information on the industrial sectors,
geographic location, number of jobs created and marketing patterns of the
SUDENE-approved projects. Industrial projects approved by SUDENE through
1968 are expected to result in an annual average growth in gross value
added by mmnufacturing industries in the Northeast of 9.3% from 1965 to
1973, compared to a rate of 7.8% for the period 1955-1965.  Employment
created by the projects approved by SUDEIE until the end of 1968 is anti-
cipated to be around 112,000 with an average investment per worker of
around US$7,500.  The anticinated average ratio of urofits of these pro--
jects is 215.4% on sales and 32.3% on total capital invested.
Financing of Industrial Investment
10.      :34/18 funds account for approximately 45% of total investment
in projects approve-d by  UDMENE du-rnr 1966-1968  Free resources of +he
sponsors contribute some 22%, while external financing makes un 15% and
local currency loans from offici al banks (BINB and BNDE 1A 18% of total
investment cost, It should be noted that this pattern of financing has
been determined from the financing plans in  SUDEETMTs appraisals, i.e.,
at a stage prior to finalizing the financing arrangements for the projects.
Considering thaat BNB and BNDE are f-ee to reject loan applications, the
1/  BNDE stands for Banco Nacional do Desenvolvimento Economico, which
is Brazil!s nationwide official development bank.



- 4 -
actual share of free resources of the sponsors is likely to be somewhat
higher, andc the loan financing from official banks somewhat lower than
indicated above.
11.       Term loan financine is provided exclusively by Government finan-
cial instiltutions, mainly BNB and BNDE. While BNB addresses itself mairly
to medium-si-zed industry andi, through State development banks, to small
industry, ]3NDE only lends to big projects requiring loans of NCr$ 10 million
avd more. Thurs. while BETE' sha're in total bank financing is not negl--
gible in volume (approximately 25-30%), it has made relatively few
loans and, for the average investor, MNB is the only loca! soLrce of loan
financing.
Evaluation of the Industrialization Program
12.       The industrial incentives program for the Nfortheast has been and
continues to be highly successf-ul in mobilizing and t;ransferring resources
to the region and in committing these resources to investment in manufac-
turinlg industry.  It has helped regional industry to becorne aore divers:ified
and contributed to reduce the traditional disparity of income between the
Northeast and the rest of Brazil.  Anticipated profitiability of new iriusi-
trial projects appears to be very satisfactory.
13.       The incentives system appears to be very generous, so that the
question arose whether, after the relatively good start of the industri-
alization prcgram, it might not be appropriate to introduce some modifica-
tions that would result in a reduction and refinement of some of the
incentives. The Supplementary Report suggests several steps in this con-
nection (see page 16, paragraph 55 of the attached report). These were
discussed with the Brazilian Government during negot:Lations. The Govern-
ment, however, did not want at present to modify the SUDENE scheme as a
whole because this would involve parallel modifications of the rest of
Brazil's regional and sectoral incentive schemes which were held to be
inopportune for the time being. rhe appropriateness and effectiveness of
the industrial incentives system needs the continuing attention of the
Government. leanwhile, BNB has affirmed that it will seek to assure the
highest possible proportion of non-34/18 equity funds in the financing of
the projects to which it makes loans and that it will not submit for Bank
financing, except in special circumstances, projects in which non-34/18
funds account for less than 25% of total estimated investment cost. And
the Government has accepted the principle that interest rates should be
positive; the National Monetary Council. in its meeting of September 15S,
1969, adopted a new interest rate structure applicable to lending operations
of the financial institutions controlled by the Federal Government.  The
new rules, which will come into force on January 1, 1970, provide for ]oans
of up to 60 months to carry interest at 129 n.a.. nlus a fixed monetaryr
correction of 10% p.a.   Loans of more than 60 months will be made at rates
of betweern 4% and 12% plus a fiu ll indexing of the  neinal.  (BNB intends
to charge 10% on the indexed principal.)  While this is not wholly satis-
factorvy ift iisa step nn the right direction.



Inflation and Its Fffects on Industrial Lending
14.       The inflation of the Brazilian currency has created special
problers for the .industrial sector in Brazil.  I-'lation was general -y Jk
within annual rates of around i5-30% during the 1950s; but during the early
1960s, the uGeneral r2ce Inudex soar-eu to rates of 5 17a ( 196"   7.7C (1963)
and 90.8% (1964).  Since then, the rate came down again to 28.6% during 1967
and 24.2% diuring 1968, and may be expected to further decrease In the fluture.
i5.       .,ince 1964, the price level of manufactured goods normally- has
risen faster than the level of raw material prices and wages, so that
industrial enterprises on the whole benefited from the inflation. However,
access to borrowings, both at short term for working capital financing and
at longer term for investment finance, is difficult because of the very
limited supply of capital on suitable terms; the shortage is aggravated by
the fact that, in many instances, the cost of capital has been fixed by
regulation at rates that do not reflect the prevailing situation of the
market.  Shortage of finance for working capital requirements is accentuated
by an artificial increase in demand created by the tendency of industrial
enterprises to protect themselves against erosion of their assets and to
profit from price increases by maintaining inventories which under normazl
circumstances would be considered excessive. The market for long-term :loan
capital has dried out completely for lack of supply.   One consequence is
that, at pr-esent, industrial investment loans can only be obtained from
official financial institutions with access to budgetary or other Govern-
mental fun(ds.
16.       The inflation has also had an impact on financial institutions.
Normally, a financial institution does not invest more than a small frac-
tion of its equity in fixed assets (office buildings and equipment) which
are protec-ted againist the erosion of the currency. In an inflationary
environment, the desire of the banks to escape deterioration of capital by
investinp in real estate may lead them to set up extensive networks of
branch offices, as has actually been the case in Brazil. To a certain ex-
tent, ade(I;uate protection- can behi fou-nd bv investing in the share capital of
business enterprises.  Those parts of the institution's equity which are
used to finanee their lending activities have to be protected against
erosion either by an indexation ol the principal or by interest and commis-
sion rates exceeding the inflation rate or by a sufficient leverage with
non-indexed deposits or borrowed funds. Also, the operating costs of
f_na_nCil j nQtitAins are laly accoun.ted for by lers      nel ex ens
which normally follow closely the inflation rate. Unless the institution's
total assets arnd liabilities keep pace with the inflation rate, which does
not happen automatically, except in cases where they are indexed, the
evolution of expernses will result in a squeeze on the profit margin and
possibly a deterioration of the equity.

III. BANCO DO NORDESTE DO BRASIL S.A.
Objects and Functions
17.       BNB's objective is to contribute to the economic development of
the Northeast by providing financial assistance to productive enterprises
in agriculture and industry, financing certain infrastructure projects
undertaken by states and municipa].ities. and in general by conducting all
commercial and investment banking activities, including underwriting and
leasing operations! within its area of operations as defined by Law
No. 3,995 of 1961 (see above paragraph 2).
Ownership (see Annex 1)
18.       The legislation creating BNB stipulated that at least 70% of
BNB' s initial Ishare r' qni+;4  Told be subhp  srilibet d by th e + Fed Pe ralG rnent,-I
while the remaining 30% would be open to public subscription, and that the
flvernmoent wo._d .hve the same                ghei  rigs> as all the - oh  Al
holders in case of future capital increases, but that all the shares
offered to the public and not subscribed would also be taken up by the
Government.  Initially, theGovernment owned 70%, state governments and

to 87.8%.  It was reduced again to 72.9% at the occasion of a capital in-
crease from NCr$ 15.2 milLion to NCr$ 140 million whicn was completed in
June 1969. Following this increase, some 40,000 private shareholders,
two th-irds of them residing in the Northeast of the country, own around
25.6% of B'NB's capital.
19.       Originally, the Minister of Finance was responsible for exer-
cising the Governmentis rights as BNB's principal shareholder.   Since 1967,
the exercise of these rights has been entrusted to the Minister of Interior,
who also supervises SUDENE.
Legai Status
20.       The legal basis of BNB's establishment in 1954 was law No. 1,1549
of July 19, 1952 supplemented by Presidential Decree No. 33,643 of
August 24, 1953. The company is constituted as a lirmited company (Socisdade
por acoes) and as such is governed by Brazilian company law and its statutes;
however, all modifications of its statutes have to be approved by Presi-
dential Decree. BNB is furthermore subject to the Brazilian banking legis-
lation to the extent that it is not in contradiction with the legislation
creating it. Like the other financial institutions operating in the coaun-
try, BNB is subject to the control of the Banco Central do Brasil.



- 7-
Organization (see Chart, Annex 2)
21.       The President.  BNB's President is appointed for an indefinite
term by the President of the Republic. He is the company's chief executive.
BNB's President from 1956 until 1961 and again from 1962 to 1967, was Mr.
Raul Barbosa who is now Executive Director for Brazil of the Inter-American
Development Bank in Wlshington, D.C. He was succeeded bv AMr. ubbens Va2m
da Costa. H4r. Vaz da Costa, who is an economist by education, had been a
staff member and. later on. the Head of BNB's Economic Department from
1954 to 1959. He then joined the Pan American Union in 11ashington and,
from 1961 to 1966, wa ns a staff member and later a Depu+y Director of the
Inter-American Development Bank. After a short time as Superintendent cf
SUDNEE during 1966/67, he was appo4n+ed to his present pos tion.  He has
been President of the Association of Latin American Development Banks; he
is also a inermber of several professional associat--4ons an' au-"-or of a nu`ir,b
of economic publications, mainly dealing with problems of development in.
Brazil and the Braz'iani Nort heast.  He provides B1L -with competent and
energetic leadership.
22.       I'he Board of Directors.  BNB's Board consists of the President
and four Directors.  (See Annex3.)   wnhile the President is appointed by
the President of the Republic, the Directors are elected by the General
Assembly of Shareholders for a term of four years.  Since the Federal
Government holds a large majority in the General Assembly, BNB's Directors
are in fact the candidates of the Ministry of interior.'V  However,
according to BNB's Articles of Association, the remaining shareholders may
elect a candidate in a ballot in which the Government does not participate,
each time their total participation in BNB's share capital is 20% or more.
Since the 1968/69 share capital increase resulted in a reduction of the
Government participation to less than 80%, the non-Government shareholders
will be entitled to elect a Director for the first time in 1973 when the
present term of BNB's Board expires.
23.       A11 of BNB's Directors are full-time officers.  Functionally,
each one is responsible for one of BNB's major departments, presenting re-
ports and applications of those departments during Board meetings.  However,
the Directors have no individual executive functions (with one small excep-
tion in the short-term lending program where certain lending decisions can
be taken individually by the Director). During its meetings which take
place at least once a week, BNB's Board decides on all policy matters and
on major credit applications. The Board makes its decisions by a majority
of votes, writh the President having a casting vote in case of a tie.  It
appears that decisions are taken in a businesslike manner, and that the
Ministry of Interior, while directing BNB's general orientation, does not
interfere in day-to-day management and individual lending decisions.
1/ Apparently in connection with the transfer of the resDonsibility for
BNB from the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Interior, all of
BNB's Directors were replaced in 1967/68. although their terms of
office were to expire in 1969.

2h.       Conselho Fiscal - Audit of Accounts.   In accordance with Brazilian
company law, the General Assembly elects a Control Council (Conselho Fiscal)
of fLive mpembers and five  terntes to make a m-onthlv audit of BNB's
accounts. Such audit is, however, largely a formality and the tasks carried
out by the ConseLho Fiscal cann.ot be considered as a professionalen
dent audit. The Bank has therefore requested BNB to have its accounts
audited by an inrdependent f'J.m of auditors acceptable +o them B1r and BNB
has procured the services of the well-known company, Arthur Young, Clarkson,

the effectiveness of the proposed loan.
25.       I)epartments.  BNB's Head Office has the following ten departments,
all oI them under tne direct supervision oI the Fresident (in parentheses
are numbers of staff at the end of 1968):
IL. Service Departments
1. Department for Internal Audit and Inspections (36)
2. "Assessoria Geral", in charge of BNB's internal
organization and planning (68)
3. Legal Department (13)
4. Department fcr Economic Studies on the Northeast
(ETENE) (69)
13. Supervisory Departments
1. Industrial Credit Department (CARIN) (67)
2. Agricultural Credit Department (DERUR) (143)
3. General Credit Department (DERGE) (118)
4. Administrative Services Department (240)
5. Financial Department (DEFIN) (86)
6. Department for Staff Training (no staff of its
own; functions carried out by other departments).
26.       The functions of those departments are by and large explained by
their names. In should, however, be noted that ETENE, the only department
explicitly mentioned in BNB's statutes and in the basic legislation creating
the institution, not onlv assists BNB's operational departments by its re-
search work but also fulfills a public service through studying general
problems of' the economic situtaticin of the Northeast and making the results
available to the public.
27.      'Branch Offices.  Under its basic legislation and statutes, BNB
has to maintain one2 branch office for eaGh 400in0 inhabitants living in
the dry areas, but at least two branches in each of the states in which it
operates.  Tn fulfillment of this cornfdition , BNB has opened 67 brnn.ches
during its 15 years of existence, and is continuing this policy.   However,
the operation of branches, especially in the rem.ote and less densely



- 9 -
populated areas of the interior, creates problems of transport and communi-
cation and involves heavy operating expenses. Therefore, after a rela-
tively quick expansion of its network in 1968 and 1969, during which period
eleven new branch offices were opened, BNB is considering a slowdown of its
expansion orogram. The feasibility of closing down some of its deficitary
branches haLs also been considered but not pursued for the time being.
28.        all operations are carried out by the branch offices, which
although resnonsible directly to the President. are supervised on a day--to-
day basis by the Head Office departments.   Each branch has divisions for
agricultural credit. general credit and services (treasury, accounts. per-
sonnel, files, etc.).   larger branches also have a division for industrial
GrPeit-  O!! average, each of RNT\s branches has 33 nrofessional and five
non-professional staff members, and even the smallest branches maintain a
personn.el of 16 to 20.
29Q        Staoff  . At+he  end  of  19 ,  BNB lU  had  3, 6  stal +.fbf  mahore   rf' ,Th; r.h
approximate;ly 2,980 were professionals. This was an increase of 58.6% over

stant prices) and an increase in number of credit operations of 48.4%.
However, while operations grew more quickly in 1965 and 1966, the im-portat
increases in staff occurred only in 1967 and 1968.   'ince the end of 1968,

will be necessary during the coming four or five years.
30.       'lThile bank employees in Brazil normally work 30 hours a week, BNB
introduced a L40-ho-ur week Lu 1967 an siri  therL UL d been paying     ±uj_
employees 10 hours overtime a week. However, early in 1969 it was felt that
the workload did no longer justify keeping the entire staff on a 40-hour week
and the 30-hour week was reintroduced as from September 1969. The diminish-
ing return on Bi'ri:s equity during i9067 and i906 (see beloi paragraph 73)
wias a factor in this decision.
31.       Reportedly, BNB is looked at as a reservoir of well-trained
financial experts and institutions like STUDEN-E, the development banks of
the Northeastern States and industrial consultant companies of the region
are recruiting former BB staff members.    Nevertheless, staff turnover nas
been very low and even decreasing during the past few years. lhile during
1964, 104 staff members (5% of total) left the institution, the number of
resignations during 1968 was only 99, or 3.3% of total staff.
32.       The Department Heads of BNB's Head Office at Fortaleza appear to
be of outstanding quality. Each of them has a long record of satisfactory
performance within the institution, and some of them combine their work at
BNB with a professorship at the University of Fortaleza.   It should be men-
tioned that the changes in BNB's Board during 1967/68 did not result in
changes of the senior staff.
33.       BNB's management gives much emphasis to training of staff at all
levels.  th.ring 1968, 95 staff members attended professional courses in
various institutions, and 363, i.e. more than 10% of total staff,



- 10 -
participated in BNB's internal training programs.  In addition, BNB
offered training facilities to 39 university students, and has taken in a
considerable number of foreign trainees.
Resources
34.       After distribution of the 1968 profits, BNB had the followTing
resources (in million of NCr$, utilized portions only, percentagewise
breakdown Jor 1967 and 1966 for comparison):

The various lines of resources are discussed in the following paragraphs.
35.       Equity. As at the end of 1968, BNB's equity of NCr$ 199.2 miLLion
wvs   ,ade u7 of i ts share capital (r  I X.2 gllon),    eves (r $ v a  '1 I. 4  I.

sLar-es of a ci noimUiLl va-l-ue of NCUr$` 1.OU eacU . IC.1 s-  are equal excptJ
that no dividend may be paid on the Federal Goverrmeent's holdings unless
BIlB:s other shareholders are paid a dividend of at least 10io of the nomifiLnal
value of their shares. No dividend may be declared in excess of 20% of
share capital. The Federal Government may not withdraw the dividends paid
by BNB on its shareholdings; those dividends must be kept in a special
account wfith the institution and may onlybe used in payment of the w-ve.n-
ment's subscriptions of new shares on the .-casion of increases of BNB's
share capital.
36.       Annex 4 shows the evolution of the company's equity accounts.
According to its statutes, BNB has to set aside from its net profits (a) 5%
for the legal reserve, (b) 10% for a reserve for drought risks and (c) 10%6
for a general credit reserve. These allocations as well as payments of
staff bonuses, Directors' profit participations and dividends are made by
BNB's Board; the remainder of net profits are annually allocated by the
General Assembly of Shareholders. During the past years, share capital was
only a small part of BNB's total equity and consequently the dividend pay-
ments (12% annually until 1965 and the maximum rate of 20% for 1966 and
1967) represented a very minor part of BNB's total profits, the majority



- 11 -
of which was allocated to several reserve accounts and contributed, together
with cash subscriptions, to the rapid growth of BNB's equity. In fact,
between l964 and 1968 total equity increased from NCr$ 6.5 million
(equivalent of NCr$ 22.6 million at 1968 prices) to NCr$ 199.2 million. Of
this increase of NCr$ 192.7 million, only NCr$ 36.5 million were cash
contributions, while NCr$ 156.2 million were generated from BNB's own
profits.
37.       IAllocations from Federal Budget. BNB was originallv conceived
as a channE'l for part of the Federal Government's tax revenues that were
earmarked ior aqiJqt-nrce to the rrv areas of t.he Mnortheast.  These funn.
which, by law, amounted to 0.8% of the total annual tax revenue of the
Federal (Iovprnmentf we-rer epnosi;t+edr in n spcianl accouiint wri+.h BRN\TR . UhilI.
30% of these annual deposits could be reclaimed by the Government at short
notice -in case oavvirg       r T+h    +the re-io-, a  c
only be employed at short-term, the remaining 70% was not repayable and
could be u,sed by the GovernIMent only for subscription of new shares on the
occasion of increases of BNB's share capital. These funds, which did not
bear intereSt, were. tAhu.s a sor t of        ty a-l4thou  t    were not n
any way subordinated in the event of liquidation.
38.       The earmarking of Federal Tax revenues for the Northeast was
el,nat ed by Ulthe nIw DBa±ZiaLiI UUf;l,LbuioLW1 adopteu in 1957. For BNBDUD
this meant the loss of its most stable source of finance. When the new
Constitutionl went into force, the Federai Government was in arrears to
BNB by approximately NCr$ 90 million from previous tax revenue. During the
second hIalf of 1i969, the Government made a first payment of approximately
NCr$ 2 million on account of this arrear, and BNB expects to receive at
least NCr$ 30 million during 1970. mTe amount shown in BNBis balance sheet
for 1968 was a residue of payments made prior to the new Constitution, plus
the Governmentis share in BNI-'s dividends, which may not be withdrawn; it
was entirely used for subscriptions of new BNB shares during the first half
of 1969.
39.       Foreign Loans.  As at the end of 1968, BNB had received from the
Inter-AmeriLcan Development Bank six loans totalling US$ 53.29 million.-/
Of these si.x loans, three totalling US$ 22 million were for private industry
and three totalling US$ 31.29 million for water supply, sewerage and housing
projects.
40.       IWhile commitment of the first loan for private industry took six
years, all the following loans were committed relatively quickly, and in
November 1969, only about US$ 2 million remained uncommitted under Loan
128/SF/BR rmade in June 1967. Under the terms of IDB's two latest loans for
private inclustry, sub-loans above US$ 500,000 required IDB's previous
approval. No sub-loans of more than US$ 1 million could be made except for
projects of special merit.  The cost of these two loans (interest and ser-
vice charge, but excluding commitment charge) to BNB is 4% on IDB's Special
Funds and 6.916% on IDB's Ordinary Capital Funds.   Interest charged to the
sub-borrowers is 7% and 9%. res-oectivelv. so that B1NB earns a spread of 3'

- 12 -
and 2.084%, respectively, on these two loans. Use of both loans is
restricted to foreign exchange expenditures. The exchange risk is borne
by the final borrowers.
41.      3M/18 Deposits.   Presently, BNB's most important resources are
the deposits made by Brazilian tax-payers under the 34/18 incentive scheme
(see above paragraph 7). Annex 6 showss the status of these deposits from
the beginning of the scheme in 1962 until the end of 1968 and BNB's fore-
casts over the ccming five years. Recent movements of the 34/18 deposits
seem to incdicate that the position at the end of 1969 may be some NCr$ 75
to NCr$ 100 million higher than oroiected by BNB,. and that also BNB's fore-
casts for the near future may be on the conservative side. Nevertheless,
there is a considerable degree of tuncertaintv in the evolution of this
important resource (which at the end of 1968 financed 54.5% of BNB's total
assets.) for the foil-Ag reansons:
a.~ vTlU  - olv, e of infl-wV-g depo-its depends .n the attrac-
tiveness of the Northeast as against alternative uses

23% of all tax credits, as against the Northeast's 65%,
Lnd such priority- sectors as fishery, tor ism and ra=
forestation.
b.  The pace of disbursement of the deposits is partially
set by SUDENE; to the extent SiDENE speeds up its
approval procedure, the average period of the deposits
with BNB (which at present is between 12 and 18 months)
and consequently their total volume decreases.
c.  An investor may submit his project to SUDEME and receive
SImENE's approval even prior to the due date of his tax
liability and thus the period of the deposit with BNB
may be reduced to a few days.
42.       WJhile BNB tries to attract funds to the Northeast by advertising
campaigns and in direct approaches to large taxpayers in the Center-South
of the country, the factors mentioned under b. and c. are practically out
of BNB's control. Consequently, 34/18 deposits have to be considered as a
relatively uncertain resource in the future. However, since they do not
bear interest and are not subject to monetary correction, BNB can earn sub-
stantial interest margins on them.
43.       It should be noted that the table in paragraph 34 shows only
those 34/18 deposits which SUDENE has not yet authorized for investment..
As soon as BNB receives such authorization, the deposits are transferred to
demand deposit accounts, which are then included with ordinary deposits.



- 13 -
44.       Crdinay_Deposits.    BNB may accept deposits from public and
private sources. During the past few years, those deposits have accounted
for approximately 8-12% of BNB's total assets. Virtually all of them have
been demand. deposits.
45.       Deposits are relatively difficult to obtain since in the absence
of monetary correction or adequate remuneration, depositors would not nor-
mally keep more money in bank accounts than strictly necessary for minimmum
working capital requirements. (Central bank regulations forbid payment of
interest on demand deposits; BNB pays interest of 3-8% p.a. on term depcsits
of one month and mnore.) Nevrtheless; the total volume of ordinarv deposits
has developed very satisfactorily over the past five years, with annual
rates of ine-reas  of 10-n0% in real terms.  BNB's ePect2tionn of a flirther
growth of deposits seem justified considering the increase of economic
activity of theregron, pticUarJy if inflation         +.     +e to ,trol nff so
that the losses (in real terms) to depositors are reduced.

So far, BNB3 has used only the agricultural rediscount, and only to a minor
amount.
Operations
47.       Factual information on BNB's operations is contained in Annex 7
which describes in detail the institution's operational policies, the in-
terest rates charged and the evolution of BNB's short-term credits and
agricultural and industrial loans. The figures presented in that annex
show substantial though uneven growth rates in operations over the past
years.  BetwTeen the end of 1965 and the end of 1968, BNB's total outstanding
loans increased by 147% from NCr$ 351.2 million (at 1968 prices) to NCr$ 869
million.  Wdithin this overall figure, the biggest increase was in agricul-
tural lending (340%), while industrial lending increased by 185% and short-
term credit by 68%.  At the same time, however, it appears that BNB was not
able to satisfy the growing demand for financing, especially in the fie:Ld of
industrial lending. This situation is clearly reflected in the increasing
number and volume of projects in the pipeline as sho%m in the table "Flow

of Applicationsrt (Appen.din   7 °f' Annex 7), w%Thich also show4ins tht nBM has
approved virtually no new industrial loans since the end of 1968.     In
fact, early in 1969, BrB's Board decided Io   toT cIs         portfoli
of long-teri: loans to industry and agriculture because of the limited
avao  b  i t;+rJr  of'  -  -  - - - -  -  4l4       1, A   VMJ..J..J.T'D   __.; I  _ .IIL
long-term lending after the end of 1969.
48.       Evaluation of Policies and Procedures.   BNB's policies appear
to be well conceived. The branch managers have a considerable degree of
freedom in their lending decisions in the agricultural lending program
where loan amounts average only around NCr$ 6,000 and a greater concen-
tration of authority could be impracticable.    Short-term lending, where
higher limits per client are involved (though the individual discount
operations are small), is more closely controlled by the Head Office.
In the industrial lending program, which involves the highest individual
amounts, decision-making is entirely concentrated at Board level. Opera-
tions manuals and other instructions to the operational staff present
clear and detailed guidelines.
h9.       As far as industrial lending in particular is concerned, the
staff in charge of the program at BNB's Head Office demonstrates a
satisfactory degr o  f e-nmp+etence  comparable to several of the better
development finance companies now assisted by the TWorld Bank. Project
suffer from the scanty statistical information available for the North-
east region; in secaSesdeficienies       in twhis reespec'ut discovered bUy
the appraisal staff lead to studies undertaken by BNB's economic
department (ETNTE), and the industr al cr-edt department nonrally has a
voice in determining ETENIE's annual study program.
50.       Follow-up on industrial loans is of outstanding quality.
Visits to customers are thorough, and reports give a good analysis of
the borrowTerst situation and performance. A continuous supervision of
the situation of BNB's industrial borrowers is greatly facilitated by
BNB's commercial banking activities.
51.       Administrative Costs.   Administrative expenses incurred by
BNB during 1968 in connection with its industrial lending department,
including overheads, were approxinrltelv 2.hAG of the programns propor-
tional part of BNB's total assets.    If the underlying assets were
evaluated at 1968 nries; the ratio wounld be only 1.8_.    Tvrn +th
latter figure is on the high side if compared with old-established
developm.ent finnnce companies in o-ther contries, but this appears to
be, at least in part, a result of the prevailing high salary level in
Br2ilr .  The cost of the progrr. is, ho-.eer, much lower than the cos+
of BNB's short-term and agricultural lending programs (see paragraph

later paid, and BNB:s actual losses were far below 1% of the outstanding
portfolio during each of the past few years.
53.       Quality of agricultural portfolio.   It can be expected that,
in such a vast lending program serving some 60,000 farmers in an area of
more than 1.5 million square kilometers, collection of maturities is
not easy.  in such a situation the excellent repayment record of JBBs
farmer-borrowers (loans to cooperatives, not included, have so far not
produced any losses) as shown in the following table (in NCr$ 1,000)
is noteworthy:
Outstanding at          ,

It should be mentioned that many of the loans written off are later paid
back. B,dEIIs total losses on agricultural loans, since beginning operations
in 1954, t-ere NCr$ 4.4 million or 0.9% of all loans made.
54.       Postponements of maturities are granted by branch managers, with-
in the linit of their authority for granting new loans, for periods not
exceeding one year. No information is available on the frequency of
postponements.
55.       It is difficult to determine the effect of droughts on BNB's
agricultural portfolio.  About 4rb of the agricultural loans are made in
the "sertao"' area, which is hardest hit by the periodical droughts.
Annual maturities of investment loans to borrowers in this area would
amount to some NCr:3 13.6 million.  BNB would re-schedule those loans by
one year and try to resume collections during the following year, but it
may be safe to assume that about one-third of the maturities falling due
in a drought year, i.e., some NCr$ 4.5 million, may have to be written off.
In addition. BNB miaht lose NCrA 5 - 6 million of current interest income
on those loans.  Concerning working capital loans, of which less than
half are carriAd beyond the harvest season; diffircuties in renayvmnt
are not likely to arise in more than 15-20% of the total outstanding
amoiint  ir most ces, rescheduling br onc yer woniilrd solr  the provbh1Prems

56.       IBM's experience during tlhe relatively severe drought of 1958
was much more favorable than the previous paragraph would suggest. Re-
portedly, losses on portfolio during that yrear were not higher than in
normal years. This might be due to the °act that BNB's agricultural lend-
ing prograrm is directed towards financing cattle-raising and cash crops,
while the (doughts mainly hit the subsistence crops, such as beans and
millet.
57.       Quality of Industrial Portfolio.  Any judgment on BNB's indus--
trial portfolio will have to take into consideration the effects of the
inflationary environment on Brazilian industries.  Especiallv during the!
years 1961 to 1964, when annual inflation rates reached 50-90%, BNB's
industrial loans were practically gifts to the borrowers, and could normally
be reimbursed from cash generation without difficulty.  If, nevertheless,
delays in repaym.entn occurred, these were likelv t.o be due to a horrower's
speculation on further depreciation of the principal amount rather than to
his di$-ficu1lt situation..  14oreover, Brazi-ian Jnaduit2ries had and sti1l have
a tendency to keep their working capital at a minimum level in order to
inim ze inflation losses, wlth the result that liquiditvy     '"n  are
frequent. Although BNB pays attention in its apprailsal and follow-up work
to a suuFficient level of working capital, such woridxg capital is norma:Lly
kept in stocks of raw materials rather than in cash balances. This par--
tiLc,,'Lar si-tuaation is atu luhle buasis of' miost- o-P thue rathelr frequCnt- arrea.rl
in the repayment of BNB's industrial loans. BNB has, however, a very
efficient 14 ay of recoverir.g overV-Ues tUl-iougl1 its short-UterrL Ill  act= 
vities. Since virtually all industrial clients whose} investment loans have
reached the repayment stage are also using- -B' s discouLit facilities, il;
is easy for BNB to retain part of the proceeds of discount operations for
cover of overdue on industrial loans.
58.      HAt the end of 1968, the repayment record of BNlDs private indus-
trial borrowers was as follaws (in millions of indicated currency units):

The instal:Lments actually overdue for three months or more at the end of
1968 on these loans were NCr$ 1.26 million plus US$ 0.41 million in principal
and NCr$ 1.06 million plus US$ 0.6 million in interest.
59.       Nearly half of the cruzeiro loans in arrears were represented by
one big loan to a textile mill in Recife (outstanding amount NCr$ 6,071,400,
overdue installment NCr$ 251,400). This company is operating normally,
its financial structure is quite solid, and previous installments have been
paid on the due date. The reason for the default is not clear but it is
not likely to be serious.
60.       The arrears position of the dollar loans is comparable to that
of the cruzeiro loans in number of operations, but more serious in amount.
Two important loans aggregating US$ 0.9 million, i.e. about half of the
foreign cmrrencv loans in arrears. were made to two comDanies wlhich are
facing serious problems (a caustic soda plant, which encounitered technical
difficulties; and a sisal manufacturer who has lost part of his market
following a change in import regulations); however, both loans are fully
secured by guarantees and BPB expects to recover the o utstanding   otS .
61.       Postponements of m.aturities have been granted in verv fewT cases
and for periods not exceeding 12 months.
62.       At present, no losses appear likely to arise on BNB's industrial
portfolio apart fra,n the above-m_-entioned 11 bad loans totalling  NCr$ 30r,000
plus US$ 60,000, which were fully written off.
63.       Loans to public borrowiers for basic services, which are secured
by a pledge on tax revenues allott;ed by the Federal GOvernment to the bor=
rowter, are virtually riskless.  Also, the credit rislc on BNB's loans to
State Development Banks for relending to small enterp?rises seems negligible.
Financial Situation
64.       Financial Structure. Aumnex 9 shows BNB;s balance sheets for 1964
through June 1969. A significant feature in BNB's structure is the decline
of the debt/equity ratio from a peak of 17.08:i at the end oI i906 (whicrl
was comparable to internationally observed practices in purely commercial
banking) to 10.1:1 in 1966, 7:1 in 1967, 5.2:1 in 1968 and 4.4:1 at the end
of June 1969, as a result of high profit accumulations and of the 1968/69
capital increase against cash subscription.   (For the purpose of determining
this ratio, all liabilities including deposits have been considered as
debt.)
65.       It is normal practice to limit the maximum indebtedness of
developmerLt finance companies to which the Bank makes loans, to a prudent
multiple of the borrowers' unimpaired equity.   Such a limitation restricts
the borrowers' ability to incur risks connected with lending to (and
investing in securities of) business enterprises. BNB asked for a lim1.t of
ten times its unimpaired equity.  It was felt, however, that, in B1B's case,



- 18 -
a more refined approach to the problem of debt limitation was required.-
in fact, th- risk connected with BNBRis sho-rt-rm oneratrions is suibstan-
tially less than the risk of its medium- and long-term loans, especially
since BM's short-term Ilend4rt 4 i8 . nly done byr way of discolunt of trade-
bills which are self-liquidating and where more than one party is liable
for the pay-ent of the debt. In these circumstances, and considering the
competence of BNB's management, the expertise of its appraisal staff and
the quaI    o    s presentou portfolio, an overall debt limit of 10.1
(inclusive of all short-term debt, deposits and accounts payable) seemed
prudent if, withiln that overall limit, BND's power to incur term, uebt (i.e.
debt with initial maturities of more than one year) was restricted to four
tiLmeS itS unimpaired equity. During negotiations, BIT3 accepted this two-
tier debt limitation.
66.    The twofold limitation has to be considered in connection with
BNqB3s liquidity formula which determlines the applicat:Lon of BNBos various
resources in its long-, medium- an(d short-term lending operations and the
minimum level of its liquid assets (see paragraphs 67 and 68 below). Taking
account of requirements for liquid funds, the effect of the debt limitations
will be to allow BNB's total loans and discount portfolio to go up to approx-
imately nine times its unimpaired equity. Within this portfolio, term    loans
(in the Brazilian definition, for more than six months) may reach the
approximate equivalent of seven times the equity. Both of the debt limitations
leave BNB a very large margin for additional borrowings.
67.    Liquidity. The nature of BNB's resources makes it imperative to
pay partIcular attention to the liquidity of the institution, especially
in view of the importance of the 314/18 scheme (see paragraph 41 above).
Movements of 3L/18 and ordinary deposits are watched continuouslv by BNB's
organization and planning department, and the experience gained by this
supervision is used in the llabcratinn o   B's annual programs of oIera-
tions, which contain formulas to determine BNB's maximum exposure in lend--
ing onerations and its mninimum liqnu-id-ity holdings.  These formulas are
carefully dlevised and BNB's liquidity holdings have so far been sufficient
to meet a1l. its needs.
68.    Annex 8 shows the formula adopted by BIER's Board for its fiscal
year 1970. This formula is adequate in present circumstances. BNB intends
to revise it at least anrnually and especially to reduce the percentage of
the 34h/18 deposits to be used in lending operations if and when a decline
in the vo lmais of t-hese deposits appears likely. BNB has agreed that it
would at all times apply to its operations a liquidity formula satisfactory
ts t1lle Banrih:e
69.    I ofitability.  Annees 10 and 11 show B`1 's profit and loss
statements and the allocation of its net income for 1964 through June 1S'69.
For a revviEw of BIs past profitability, it is necessary to recall that the
institution operated at negative interest rates on its borrowings and deposits
as well as on its loans, the only exception being its foreign currency busi-
ness. This means that BNB's equity, insofar as it was employed in lending
operations, was always producing a loss in real terms, and an erosion of the
equity was only avoided by considerable leverage with free or low-cost 'iinds.

70.       The gross annual income from BNB's portfolio of loans and dis*-
counts has been relatively stable at between 15.9% and 17.1% of the average
portfolio over the past few years. Gross income on average total assets
(including monetary correction which was applicable mainly to BNBts holdings
of Treasury Bonds) during the same period rose from 10.6% during 1965 to
14.2% during 1968, but fell back to 12.4% during the first half of 1969.
The higher fluctuation in the latter ratio is due to variations in the
volume of Liquid funds and in their yield. In fact, during recent years
BNB obtained a higher return on the investments it made with temporarily
liquid funds, for which it purchased interest-bearing Treasury Bonds with
full monetary correction. than on its loans and discounts, where rates were
negative o:r at best equal to the inflation rate.
71.      'Total expenses (of which between 81% and 91% were administrative
expenses, ,nndrq th-  *. rest  renmminss1ons annd dpnreiAtion of fixed
assets) were 5.6% of average total assets during 1965, went down to 3.9%

1967. Provisional results for the first half of 1969 sho-w a relati-ve decreas e
of total expenses to 6.2% of average total assets. 'If staff bonuses (which
are now again being paid out of net pr3:its) are added to expenses, the
ratio is 7.2% p.a. which is still a fraction below the 1968 expenses.
72.       BNB's operating profit (including monetary correction on Treasury
Bonds)developed as follows during recent years(as a percentage of average
total assets):

As may be seen from this table, portfolio losses had an effect on profit-
ability orly since 1967. The relatively heavy write-offs in 1968 and 1.969
were due to the adoption of a very cautious write-off policy and thus are
likely to contain some hidden reserves.

Earnings have declined more sharply if measured against equity (c.) than
if measured against total assets (a.).   This is due to the fact that, during
the period under consideration, BNB's equity has grown faster than its
assets.  BlN has practically no possibility of paying out its profits, since
dividend distributions are limited by its statutes to 20% and the dividends
accruing to the Federal Govern-ment are kept on deposit and eventually re-
invested in BNB's equity.



74.       3IUB's shares are quoted on the Rio de Janeiro and Salvador Stock
Exchanges.   Quotations in Rio were in the range of i90-2_0% of par dUr-ng
October 1969, with a total turnover of some 280,000 shares during that
month.   On the basis of these prices and the 1968 dividend rate of 12%, the
yield of BISB's shares was 4.8-6.3%.   The net asset value of BNB's shares at
the end of June 1969 was 184% of par.
75.       Allocation of Income, Expenses and Profits.    The contribution oI
the three Lending programs (short-term, agricultural and industrial lending)
to BNB's overall profitability varies, not only because of the difference
in lending rates but also because of the workload involved. BNB's internal
cost accounting makes it possible to determine BIBts income, expenses and
net profits for 1968 in relation to each of the three programs.     The fol-
low-ing tab:Le shows the breakdown:

industrial loanis d-Uing 19u68 was iuwer tnan thne interest ori agriculturaL
loans.L/  Aeasured against total capital employed, the internal return on
BNB1 s industrial lending program (after administrative and other expenses,
but before interest charges) was around 8.2% during 1968.
77.      lWlhile there is a subsidy element in each of BNB's lending pro-
grams, the subsidy appears particularly high in agricultural lending, wilere
the prevai:Ling interest rates are presently not sufficient to cover ful:Ly
BNB's costs.  It should be added that BNB also renders scome non-financial
services to the Northeast region for which it does not receive any compen-
sation. As mentioned above in paragraph 26, the department of economic
studies performs research work on a larger scale than required to support
BNB's operations; and it may be assumed that 50% of the department's ex--
penses are in fact a contribution to the economic development of the region.
Total direct cost of ETENE during 1968 was NCr$ 1.6 nillion, and indirect
cost may be estimated at approximately NCr$ 500,000, resulting in a total
expense of NCr$ 2.1 million or roughly 2.5% of BNB's total expenses, so
that the cost of BNB's uncompensated economic research work is about
NCr$ 1.05 million.   W4hile this figure is substantial in absolute terms,
it is small if compared with BNB's total expenditures. BNB's contribut-ion
to the improvement of professional education within the region is not
negligible but it has always been a by-product of the institution's inter-
nal training programs and cannot easily be expressed in figures.
Economic Impact of BNB's Industrial Lending Program
78.       The attached Supplementary Report discusses in detail the eco--
nomics of the Northeast Lndustrialization Programo S-ince the enterprises
financed by BNB are part of this program, the conclusions of the Supple-
mentarv Report apnly by and large to BNB's industrial lending program aE
well. A comparison of the sectoral and regional distribution of the two
progrnams reveals that these are largelyr r   Jidencl; BNIB has, however, con-
tributed more than proportionally to the financing of textile projects
which accolunt for nearl'y 28% of its total loan approvals, as against 17,
in volume of SUDENE-approved projects, and has a relatively small share in
the chemicll sector a(15%     ag-ain.+st 27%A) -rM s   big projct s
account for a large part of the total investment figure. BNB's loans are
concen.trated in, the th-ree st-at'es of Pelrn,-11.-1Ijuco, B&hiatd e and re   -o approxi-
mately the same extent (69% in number of total loans approved) as the SUDENE-

in volume, are higher (86% of total approvals) than the corresponding per-
centage of the SUDENE-projects (81%), thlis seeras to point to the fact that
under the S'UDENE point system, projects in these three states obtain less
34/18 fu-nd3 and have, therefore, higher loan finanrcinig requirements.
79.       ])-uring the years 1965-68, BNB disbursed, or started disbursements
on, loans lto 101 private industrial enterprises totalling US$ 45 million
equivalent.  Total investment in the projects financed by these loans i.s

estimated a-t US$ 93.2 million equivalent. These fi.gures correspond to
anproximately 14% and 30%, respectively, of total industrial investment in
the area during the period.  Estimated new employment created by these pro-
jects is 12 .6Xt1 iobs.  This would result in an average i:nvestment cost per
job created of approximately US$ 7,400, which comes very close to the
fignre Of ITS= 7,500 qnioted in the Supplementary RPnort. Annual gross value
added by thlese projects after completion is estimated at Us$ 49.3 millicn
or U3$ 3,9(00 per nob created.    For co.marison, gross value added by mni-
facturing industry in the Northeast during 1966 was US$ 414.7 million, the

econ,4,-34 s'udes  review -the act-al1 perforr,ance of the indA4 -rla-) ente--
prises it has financed, from the viewpoint of economic impact.
The Outlook
80.       Need for Additional Resources.(a) Present Resources. BNB's re--
sources shown in its balance sheet as at June 30, 1969, would, in accordl-
ance with the liquidity formula dPescribed in Annex 8, permit BNB to increase
its outstanding long-term loans_t by an amount of NCr$ 24.9 miixfon (in
local currency).  In addition, BNB may utilize its long-term agricultural
rediscount facility with the central bank for NCr$ 10 million, which would
bring its total available long-term local currency resoUrces to approximately
NCr$ 35 mi:Llion. Furthermore, BNB has uncommit-ted foreign exchange resources
of US$ 2 mrillion under one of the two IDB loans for private industry which
BNB received in 1967. Proceeds of this loan are restricted to procurement
from membier countries of IDB.
81.       (b) Prospective Demand for Finance. Appendix 7 of Annex 7 shows
the inflowi of applications for BNB's industrial loans.  There was quite a
steady flow until and including the first quarter of 1969; after the end
of Mhrch 1969, new applications decreased sharply when it became knowm -that
BNB had teinporarily discountinued its long-term lending (see paragraph 47
above).  However, it may be assumed that the flow will resume at a pace at
least equal (in constant prices) to that of 1968 and early 1969, as soon- as
BNB starts lending to industry again (which it intends to do early in 1970),
the more so since disbursements of 34/18 deposits, which are an indicator
of the investment activity in the region, are increasing as projected.
Thus, the assumption seems justified that BNB will receive requests for new
loans to private industry during 1970 and each of the next following years
of at least NCr$ 235-265 million (at 1968 prices) of which NCr$ 140-150
million would be for local currency expenditures and NCr$ 95-115 million
(equivalent of US$ 25-30 million) for financing of imported goods and ser-
vices. These estimates of applications could be expected to result in net
comnitments as follows:
1/  Only long-term loans are made under BNB's industrial lending program.

In addition, the backlog of unprocessed projects as of September 30, 1969
might result in net commitments as follows:

(at 1968 prices)

mil on.  These calculations have been made on the ass-uiption tha  ITBN wo-'d
have the necessary resources both in local and foreign currency; they dis-
regard the impact of the proposed increase of BNBIs lending rates.
82.       B3NB intends to increase its lending rate on industrial loans to
10% (with full indexing of the principal) for local currency loans of more
than five years (from presently 22% net without indexing) and to 10% (from
presently 9%) on foreign exchange loans, with the exchange risk carried by
the final borrower.  The impact of this increase in lending rates on B1i3's
future induistrial lending is difficult to evaluate. IWhen the rate for
local currency loans wras increased from 14% to 22% at the end of 1968, all
applicants were notified and very few of them decided to withdraw their
applications, but even 22% was a negative rate if compared with the rate of
inflation of 24.2% during 1968. However, equity for industrial projects in
the Northeast is rather easily available under the 34/18 scheme, and in the
past only around one third of the projects approved by SUDENE has come to
BNB for loan financing, so it cannot be ruled out that, if the cost of loan
financing substantially exceeds past levels, many of BNB's potential clients
1/  Percentages of applications rejected/returned and withdrawals after

will prefer to finance their whole projects from equity.   It seems impozsible
to give moie tnan an order of magnitude of the impact of an increased cost
of money on the volume of BNB's lending; however, the change from near cr
below zero kin real terms) to a true cost of 10% p.a. could cause a decrease
of future applications of up to 50%. This would mean that net commitments
of local currency loans to private industry might, in the worst case, be
only NCr$ 5O million annually (at .1968 prices) instead of NCr$ l00 million
as estimate!dc above.
83.       As far as foreign exchange loans are concerned, it is not expe!cted
that an increase of BNB's lending rate from the current 9% (on loans made
with the Inter-American Development Bank's ordinary capital funds) to 10%
would have arn significant impact on BNB's volume of foreign exchange loans
which, moreover, has been estimated conservatively.
84.       Since, in. the past, BNB's foreign currency loans have generally
been made simultaneously with local currency loans, the foreign exchange
component cf projects sometimes being relatively small, it must be expected
that some requests for foreign currency loans will be withdrawn if BNB is
not able tc) accommodate its customers with local currency loans because of
a shortage of cruzeiro resources. A check of the unProcessed applications
for loans to private industry as at March 31, 1969, showed that around two
thirds of the requests for foreign exchange were in conijunrtion with re-
quests for cruzeiro funds.   Theoretically, this would mean that if half of
the local currency loans BNR Twofuld otheprie.R have annrorvP  we.-re rpfiiqep
because of a shortage of local currency resources, and if all the appli-
cants that were thus turned dowTan were to withdraw t-heir requ-sts for foreign
currency assistance, the volume of foreign currency lending wJould decrease
by one thirrd  in other words- the estn+Jjtes of anr.u31 net c     ,    of
NCr$ 100 million plus US$ 20 million would have to be reduced to hTCr$ 50
mi1loin    plus TSh 13  I rlioi   .  Hwe    4it- appears  4pi    co assunLe
that refusal of local currency funds would automatically lead to a cancel-
lation of , simulteous application for a foreign currency financing, 5o
that in such circumstances an estimate of US$ 15 million annually would
probably be more realistic.
85.         c) R.esources RequiremeLnts  To suppor-t these estimates and pro-
jections, additional resources in foreign and local currency are necessary.
For foreign cLurency to finlanlce the impOrt component of projects, BNB nas
asked for a loan of US$ 25 million which should cover foreign exchange
reUir,zments for len.ding to private industry for a period of around i8
months.
86.      iAnnex 14 shows the projected limits of BINB's exposure in long--,
m.ediumL- andl shrLUt-term lending operations.  Those limits result from the
application of BNB's liquidity formula (described in Annex 8) to its re--
sou-rce forecasts as shown in the balance sheet projections (Annex 12).
Based on these projections, the following table gives an estimate of BIH3's
local currency resources available for disbursements of long-term loans
during 1970 and 1971 (in NCr$ million, at current prices):



1970   1971

Estimated total available for disburse-
ments of local currency loans             253    329
In principle, there should be no difficulty for BNB -to allocate, out of
these totals, to its industrial lending program a sufficient portion to
cover the expected net commitments of local currency loans to private
industry which are, as stated above (see paragraph 81) in the order of
NCr$ 100 million annually at 1968 prices (i.e. approximately NCr$ 138 mil-
lion for 1970 and NCr$ 152 million for 1971 at current prices). This would
leave BNB with enough free funds to continue its agricultural investment
lending. Nevertheless, to make sure that BNB will actually be able to pro-
vide long-term local currency funds to the industrial sector in sufficient
amounts even in thp face of a shortfall of the resources EB nroiects to
have available or an extraordinary increase in demand for agricultural

safeguard against possible portfolio losses exceeding the normal level of
bad debts. However, Bi- continues to operate in an uncertain Urnv±vune1-nt;
moreover, ]3NB continues to lend at negative interest rates and below its
own cost in its agricultural lending program and consequently depends on
leverage w:Lth non-indexed, low-cost funds and on other lending programs to
operate profitably. In order to protect the interests of the Bank as cre-
ditor, the Bank asked BNB for, and BNB agreed to give, an undertaking that
it will ta]ce all action necessary to ensure that its annual return (in real
terms) wil:L not drop below 5% of its equity. This undertaking is backe(d by
the commitment of the Government as guarantor to enable the borrower to
perform its obligationsvis-a-vis the Bank. The rate of 5% is deemed
sufficient to keep BNB's equity intact at its present level (in real terms),
even if it has to absorb more than normal portfolio losses.
89.       WThile this undertaking was requested in order to assure an ade-
quate equity underpinning of the proposed Bank loan, we were concerned also
about a satisfactory return of the capital employed by BNB as an indicator
of the effective use of such capital. However, since BNB combines a variety
of functions, including some which are purely public services (like its
research and training program) and some which contain important elements of
subsidy (like the agricultural program), it wras not meaningful to apply the
test of an adequate return on capital to the institution as a whole. It
therefore seemed approDriate to isolate for this purpose BNB's industrial
lending program, especially since use of the proposed Bank loan will be
restricted to financing of industry. BNB undertook that the return (in
real terms) on capital employed by it for industrial lending and investing
wolld not be less than thp. BRnk's lnrHnng rate ann1icab1e to the nronosed
loan, i.e. not less than 7%.  This appears to be satisfactory.  Since BNB
intends to chrge 10% interest on both its local and foreign mirrPnev loans
for investment in industry, and since its administrative expenses during
1968 were 1.%  of the (revalued) capital employed in the program. (see above
paragraph 51), BNB should have no difficulties in meeting this test which,
annrc ordm-ng +to t+he agree.m0n-t reac,heda durA,.ngc negotiations,twil be aple to
all industrial loans (and investments, if any) made by BNB after the end of

investment finance to be applied by the banking institutions of the official

91.       BNB is a well-managed and well-organized development bank with
a long and generally satisfactory record of experience. It is the most
important soirce of finance for investment in industry of the region, and
has contributed to the economic development of the Northeast not only
financia My but also by economic research activities and the technical
assistance rendered to numerous borrowers through its important branch net-
work.
92.       BNB's business expectations are good, in terms of both operations
and profitability.  It can meet these expectations, however, only if it can
acquire additional long-term resources in local currency and in foreign
exchange.
93.       In viet-m of its good performance, its satisfactory operational
standards and its contribution to the economic development of the Northeast,
BNB may be considered a suitable recipient for Bank 'Loans. A loan of US$ 25
Million is recommended to cover BIB's requirements of foreign currency for
financing the import component of the cost of private industrial projects
over a period of around _Bmonths. This loan should contain provisions
normal in Bank lending to develonment finance compnnLes. including provisions
for commitment charge.  Furthermore, the following conditions have been
agreed tn by BNB during negotiations:
a=  BMB will at all timecs apply to its operations a formlln.

will not drop belowi 5% of its equity and (b) that the
return on capital invested in BNB's industrlal lendinlg
program will not drop below a rate equal to the Bank's
lending rate on the proposed loan, which wiil be 7%.

d.  BNB will make arrangements to enable it to draw on sup-
plementary resources in the case its ordinary resources
are imufficient to carry out, within the limits set by
its liquidity formula, a program of long-term industrial
lending involving net commitments of at least NCr$ 100
million a year during 1970 and 1971.
e. Trhe proceeds of a Bank loan will be relent at a rate at
least 2.5% above the rate charged by the Bank, which
would leave BNB a modest margin after covering its
administrative expenses in connection with its indus-
trial lending activities. The exchange risk would be
assumed by the final borrower.
f. The Bank's prior approval will be required for all pro-
jects using more thal US$ 250,000 from the loan; judging
from BNB's past foreign exchange loans (from IDB re-
sources), approximately 40% in number and 84% in value
of the sub-loans would be above this limit. The aggre-
gate amount of sub-loans not requiring the Bank's prior
approval will be US$ 5 million.
g. BNB will have its accounts audited annually bv a quali-
fied independent auditor acceptable to the Bank; receipt
of a report on the first audit made. disclosing a satis-
factory financial position of the institution, will be a
condition of effectiveness of the nroposed loa-n.

BAICO DO NORDESTE DO BRASIL S.A.
I. Operational Policies and Procedures
1.     Wlithin broad guidelines contained in Chapter VII of the
Articles of Alssociation, BIMs Board decides on the institution's
operational policies.  The following note gi-res a brief descripo-ion of
present policies and procedur-es as contained in DBB's Articles of
Association, Board Resolutions and Operational Hanuals.
General Plolicies
2.     B]\1B shall not lend more than 60c of the value of the security
of its loans; in exceptional cases and for operations against ,ledge of
agricultural products, this limit may be increased to 80)3. Terms of
loans shall no-t normally exceed 10 years except for loans frornl specia:L
long-tern resources. Lending decisions shall be made on the basis of
the economic merits of the projects, taking into consideration the
profitability of the investment, its direct or indirect impact on the
national production, its gestation poeriod, and its benefits to the
poDulation as a wAhole. No regard shall be paid to proportional
distribution of B11Bts lending activities among the States of its area
of operation, except if the projects presented for financing are strictly
equal as to their economic merits.  BIN shall cooperate, whenever
necessary, with other financing institutions and preferably with
Government-owned or cooperative credit institutions.
Short-term Lending and Discounts
3.     Although BUB has been conceived as a development finance
institution with a special vocation in agricultural and industrial
investment finance, the character of its resources make it impossible
for BNB to use them exclusively at nedium- and long-term.  Furthermore,
BNiBts commercial banking business is a service to its agricultural and
industrial custoners especially in the interior of the region where
the network of cornTiercial bank agencies is insufficient.
4.     BNB's short-term credit is only available for productive purposes.
Priority is given to financing of sales of merchandise by way of discount
of comnercial paper (accepted trade bills and invoices). Inventories of
merchandise are normally financed only at the stage of the producer and
to the e!xtent the volume of the inventories does not exceed norrially
admitted limits. BID also finances nurchases of agricultural products



ANNEX 7
Page 2
during the period of the harvest by traders specializing in such
cormerce;  other short-term finzmcing of agricultural products at
the stage of the trader is avoided as far as possible since BNB
prefers to assist the nroducers through its specialized agricultural
lending program.
5.     BNB also makes short-term advances to the Governments of the
Northeastern States, These advances serve to close the gap between
budget expenditures, which are distributed fairly evenly throughout the
fiscal year, and revenules which are generated mainly dnuring thpe second
half of the year.
6.     Eletailed operational manuals edited and periodically revised by
the Head Office regul"ate the operating procedures.  The authority of the
branch managers in determining individual lending and discount limits for
customers igs ve.- limi;ted; -corng to the size o. the branch, the
managers may authorize limits of NCr$ 4,000 to 20,00C. Higher limits
hlave tLo lbe auth-o Lzeud bL-y the Hlead ofL 'the Genr.eal Credit Departmen  of
the Head Office (up to NCr$ 20,000), the Board member in charge of
General Credit (up to NCr$ Ln,o0('), the President 4-  to NTCr$ Inc),OOO)
or BNB's Board (above NCr$ 100,000).
Agricult.u'al Lending
7.     The purpose of BNB's agricultural loans is to enable the farmer
to put his property to a more efficient use or to assist himin in
introducing newi farming techniques. BD\B requires the farmer to submit
plans oi the operation to be financed, and to share in its cost. Loanis
are made! for f-inancing of investments or working capital.  The following
types of agricultural investments are eligible for ai1b I inancing:
permanent crops (cotton, bananas, etc.); dams, wells, irrigation works;
pastureS; livestock imDroverment; improvement or ex-pansion of milk
production; acquisition and expansion of livestock; acquisition of
agricultural machinery; seed production; formation of small agricultural
industry; acquisition of beasts for farm work; forestation and
reforestation; barn and silos; rural housing; fences; other farming
improvements; and apiculture.
8.    IWorking capital loans are made mainly for cattle raising and
expenses in connection with cotton growing.
9.     Loans are made either directly to farmers or through agricultural
cooperatives. In accordance with a general rule contained in BiB's
Articlea of Association, loans to cooperatives are made at lower
interest rates than direct loans to farrmers for the same ourpose (see
para. 24).
10.    B1EB's branch managers are authorized to decide on loans w-ithin
limits of NCr$ 12,000 to NCr4 30,000 according to the size of the branch.

12.     BNB's industrial lending program inav be subdivided as follows:

companies and State and municipal agencies):
c. lending to State development banks for relending to small

e.   BNB will only consider applications received from
regularly   corporated private enterprises, accopanied
by a full project study. Such project study should
have been prepared either by the enterprise itseLf
or by an industrial consultant ("escritorio tecnico&1)
registered with BiB.
14.    The idea that no loan should be given -unless for a well deterOm-ined
project and on the basis of a well prepared study was a novelty for the
Brazilian Northeast when first proclaimed by BNB during its ear-ly days 15
years ago. In spite of initial resistance from traditional enterprises of
the region, BNB has alw¢ays defended this idea witn almost missionar-y Zeal,
making ilt known through courses and conferences, with the result that BNB's
standard appraisal format is now widely used in thg Northeast by SUD-rE,
thO State Development Banks and the "escritorios tecnicos". One spec:ial
aspect of the format is that the financial justification of an industrial
project is demonstrated by way of determining the return on total assets
(in cons-tant prices), after deduction of an opportunity cost of total
capital employed of 12% p.a.     The return on total assets determined
by this method is one of the yardsticks used by BNB in its lending decisions.
This means that
a.   only projects whose return on capital employed exceeds
the opportunity cost of 12% by an appreciable margin
(6% and more, accorcling to the type of industry) are
financed by BNB,
b.   little or no attention is paid to the return on equity
which is inflated in oractically all cases by negative
interest rates on borrowings from BNB and other sources
and by the inflationarv environment in general.
15.    EINIB has no policy regulations or lower or upper limits of its
assistance to industry. However, small enterprises are referred to the
State DeveloDment Banks for financing under  NBts small industry
program, and operations of more -than NCr$ 10 million and/or US; 2 million
are offered to Banco Nacional do Desonvolvimento Economico (BNDE) under
the "Prctocol of Recife" defining the methods of cooperation between BIdB
and BNDE.  This agreement, which was concluded on August 9, 1967, and
signed by the Presidents of BNDE and BNB as well as by the Plinisters of
Interior and of Planning - defines the cooperation of the two main
government-owned development banks of the country and the coordination
of their operations in the Northeast. Besides the criterion of loan
amounts mentioned above, the Protocol stipulates that BNDE shall assist
1/ This figure was chosen by BNB to serve as a yardstick in its
pro;itabilit-y calclatio"s and does not pretend to reflect the
actual opportunity cost of money at any given time.

industrial projects which, althoughi located in the Northeast, pro'uce
for the national market or are important consumers of raw materials
coming from other parts of the countrvy Thus, BNB's activities are
limited rather narrowly to assisting medium-size industrial projects
of regional importance.   BNB?s President is however, of the oninion
that the seemingly strict wording of the Protocol reflects BNB's
limited resource nosition in 1967 and its desira to see BNDE channel more
of its resources into the Northeast, and that BNDE would in no way
object if BNB; after haning received new resources, stepped up its
activities even beyond the line drawn by the Protocol.
16.       Basides financial assistance to private industry, BNB?s industrial
lending nrogram includes financing of basic servi ces and small industres.
"Basic services" are public utilities and infrastructure projects under-
taken by State and N.uniipal agencies and mixed companies.    These loans
are secured by a pledge, in favor of BNB, on the taxes allotted by the
Federal GovMern.mnt to the State or Municipality sponsoring the project.

BNBMs Board PResolution NoT  1,528 of September 2f, 17, WLUwhc  ±±s the
conditions of the program, stipulates that the aggregate volume of funds
employed in it' may not exceed  0%, cof BNBTis total loans to industry.
Within this limit, not more than one-fifth may be lent to one single
Uovelopm,en[, bank. Any industrial enterprise (except bakeries and
manufacturers of alcoholic beverages and tobacco) whose total fixed
assets do not exceed NCr',5605,00Vis eligible for assistance under
the program. The entrepreneur has to contribute at least 10% of the
cost of his investment project proposed for financing; the State
Development Banle has to finance at least another 10', of the cost from
its own resources; the remaining 80%9 may be financed from BNB?s loans.
However, no sub-loans made out of BNB1s loans to the State Development
Banks may exceed NCr$ 470,000.1/   I'he credit risk of the sub-loans
is borne entirely by the State Development Banks. BNB has worked out
the necessary forms and procedures to be used by the State Development
Banks, especially the very detailed forms for project appraisals; they
follow closely the pattern used by BNB in its own direct industrial
lending operations. Furthermore, BNB has trained, and continues to train,
the staff of the State Development Banks in charge of the program, which
involves a considerable volume of technical assistance in helping the
applicants to prepare the projects and in follow-up. The State
Development Banks are free to use BNBIs loans within the terms and
conditions of the loan agreements, and BNB does not have to approve
individual 3ub-loans. However, BNB controls the institutions quite

closely by way of periodical follow-up visits, and their operational
performance is taken into account by BNB when new loans are considered.
18.    All lending decisions uri1er the industrial lending program have
to be taken by BNTB's Board irrespective of the amount involved.
19.    Follow-up visits are made by specialized groups from the Head
Office staff, five of them located in Fortaleza and one in Recife. A
group consisting of one engineer and an accountant normally s;ends one
week on one visit (including travel time, which may be long if the
project is located in a remote part of tlle area), pl]1us two or three
days on report writing.  The groups follow a strict and very complete
checklist. Recommendations are implemented through BNB's branches.
BNB's target is to m1ake a visit every three months to comoanies under
construction and once a year to companies in operation. The capacity
of the follow-up division is still insufficient to neet this target,
in sp0ite of a considerable increase in the follow-up staff towards the
end of 1968. Nevertheless, the present capacity of 200 visits a year
may be considered quite good if comrpared with the number of outstanding
loans which at present is approximately 180.
20.    In addition, BNB receives copies of the fol:Low-up reports made
by SUDEIFE's follow-uo staff, but those are normally less detailed than
BNB's own reports.  Furthermore, BNIB's Industrial Credit Department
benefits from the infor-iation available in the General Credit Department,
because virtually all industrial clients are using BNB's short-term
credit and disnoiint facilities  The hranch offines cover those

II.  Terms and Conditions of Lendine Oerations
o2.     Short-term lending and discounts
Since May 1969, BNB charges interest of 1.6% per month for loans
and discoLuts of up to two months and of 1.8% per month for operations
of two to six months (prior to May 196', BNB charged interest plus com-
mission of 2261 p.a.). These are the rates generallv charged by commer-
cial banks in Brazil. However, while commercial banks usually retain
compensating balances of up to 30% of the loan amount, BNR reouires
compensatin- balances of only 10O.
23.     BNB's discount operations are made for periods of 45 to 180 days.
Short-term credits in cirrent. acconunts, which are' alr^as qcnired by com-
mercial paper, pledge on inventories etc., are made for periods up to 180
days or at daily notice.

to the type of investment financed, including grace
periods o± up uo two years;
(ii) for work'ng capital:   from 6 months to 2 years,
normally repayable in one single installment.
b.   Loans through cooperatives
(i)  for investment:   from 3 to 3 years according to
type of investment financed, including grace
periods of up to one year;
(ii) for wiorking caoital: frorii 6 to 18 months,
repayable in accordance with re:aynments of the
sub-loans or sales of small equipment distributed
by the cooperatives.
26.    A study of a sample of approximately 1,000 loans shows that 032,-/
(in value) of the loans for working capital have maturities of one year
or less.  Of the investrment loans, 10% have maturities of 1 to 3 years,
52% between 3 and 5 years, 35iJ between 5 and 3 years and 3%o between
8 and 10 years.
27.    Industrial Lending.   Until the end of 1968, Bub charged interest
of 12% plus a commission of 2%6 p.a. on its loans to private industry
and for basic services. On operations a-pproved since January 2, 1969,
B-iB charges 12$ interest plus 10%o p.a. "monetary correction".  This
monetary correction is in fact an additional interest rather than a true
compensation for the erosion of the Brazilian currency.
28.    The interest rate charged by BNB to the State Develooment Banks
is 7% p.a. The maxinum cost to the final borrower is 14%, leaving a
spread of 7% p.a. to the S-tate Development Banks.   In BIM's opinion the
subsidy element in the cost to the final borrower is justified mainly by
the fact that the small industries of the MNortheast have no access to
the 3h/18 scheme which is -the main incentive for indus-tries of the region.

29.     Recent for'eign exchange loans to private industry (from IDB
credit lines)carry interest at 7 and 9% v.a.. with the foreign exchanee
risk carried by the final borrower.
30.     BIB's loans to private industry are nornmlly for periods of 2

than two years) shall not exceed the aggregate of:
a. 100 percent of BNBTs capital and reserves, less
the portion invested in fixed assets.
b. 100 percent of the Federal Tax Revenues deposited
with BNB by the Government (see paragraph 37 of
the Report).

holdings of BNBts shares (see paragraph 35 of the
Report).
d. 100 percent of BNBIs long-term borrowings.
e. 23 percent of the 34/18 deposits (see paragraph 41
of the Report).
f. 20 percent of ordinary demand and term deposits.
g. 30 percent of other liabilities.
B. Medium-term loans (with an initial maturity of more than
six months up to two years) shall not exceed the
aggregate of:
a. any balance of the resources listed under A and
not used for long-term loans.
b. 17 percent of the 34/18 deposits.
c. 10 percent of ordinary demand and term deposits.
d. 20 percent of other liabilities.

Assumptions:          1. Forecasts of 34//18 devjosits ar  the
same as in Annex 6. They are Lased
on pro.iected income ',ax revenues and
a gradually decreasing share of the
Northeast as against other investment
incentive schemes.
2.  Other deposits, accounts payable and
sundrv creditors (inclucinR non-
repayable deposits of the Federal
Government) have been assumed to
increase only moderately (by 14%, in
nnminal terms) during 1969. Expected
growth rates for 1970 and 1971 are
suhstantial (681 and L)Z respective:ly);
BNB hopes to achieve these increases

3. TDomestl c cnry-n r loans have been
tailored to available resources, on
t.h.e assumption that there would be
sufficient demand for BNB loans.
4.. Outstanding foreign currency loans are
for industurv anrd basic services during
1969 and 1970; beginning 1971, BNB

ANNEX 13
Page 2
Assumptions:        1.    Income from loans (interest and com-
mission) has been assumed to remain at
the present level of 15.9% to 16.8%.
This position includes earnings on
accoun,t of monetary correction of the
principal of indexed local currency
loans. Considering the proposed in-
creases in BNBIs lending rates for in-
dustrial loans. the assumption seems
conservative even if inflation is
levelling off to rates of 10% p.a.
2.  EPnenses for interest and commitment
charges on borrowings will average
only 3.7 to L.lV of average outstanding
long-term borrowings during the projection
npriod. Although BNB has had access to
low-cost borrowings in the past for its
basic services nrogram. actual average
cost of borrowings will probably be
higher than estimatted by BNB, and
additional expenses which may reach up
to NCrr. 10 to 12 million by 1973 are
likely to arise in this position.
3.   Administrative expenses, including per-
sonnel expenses have been assumed to
increase by 22% during 1969, by 26%
during i 17  19% durrinng 1971 and 16%
during 1972 and 1973. Considering that
the cut in staff hours which was made
in September 1969 will result in a
sizeable decrease (in real terms) of
administrative expenses, these assump-
tionsn aqnppea~rcnsrqrvqtjvP.
P. Proisions for r1nutfiil loans and invest-
ments have been assumed at a rate of'
0.6%p        +..a. o-r --f the yr-end nortfolio for
1970 and later years. They are not
comparable to the higcer IQ68 and 1969
figures which reflect a change in
.   Di4vidend distributioons hava hben assumed
at the rate of 12% p.a.

THE NORTHEAST INDUSTRIALIZATIONT PROGRhA
I. Historical and Economic Background
1.        The Northeast, comprising 9 out of Brazilis 21 states, about
1.5 million out of Brazil's 8.6 million sq.Km., and about 27 million out
of Brazil's total of approximately 90 million population, has been a
national problem since the long and punishing drought of 1877-79. The
First National Cormission of Enquiry into the problems of the Northeast
was established at that time. Subsequent droughts, at an average interval
of 10 years or so, and lasting one to three years, resulted in new commis-
sions and agencies for dam building, public works and relief. In 1934,
constitutional provision was made for allocating to the Northeast a minimum
of 4% annual_ly of Federal revenues. The San Francisco Valley Conmission"
was established in 1948, and the Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB) in 19514.
Finally, the Superintendency for the Development of the Northeast (SUDENE)
was created in 1959.
2.        All through this period the Northeast was characterized by
levels of output and employment far lower than those prevailing in the
rest of Br,azil. Income per capita was roughly one-half the national
average...  Large scale out-migration from the region was persistent.    In
consequence, the rate of population growth has been about one-third less
than the national aveyage.
3.        As recently as 1960- agri culture, forestry and fisheries accounted
for 46.O6 of the region's income, as compared to 28% for Brazil as a whole.
TndustrV (including mining, construction and utilitles, as well as manu-
facturing) contrib;ed only 11% to regional income, as compared to 26% for
Brazl; as 2a Awh ole  ^. of 1950, some 71% rof the -rorrin's lahbor fnrnp W2S
engaged in agriculture, as compared to 52% in the res-t of Brazil.-
4.        Ihe structure of manufac-buring in the region also lagged that
of the rst. of the country.   As recantly as 1958j nearly thre-fourths of
gross value added in manufacturing industries in the Northeast was accounted
for by so-called traditiona! inAM stries produacing aLm.ost entireJ-v for t-he-
consumer market. Nearly 70% of the total was concentrated in foods and
beverages an.d te+tile an.d clothing pr             + i  O+ 'hM."
only chemicals contributed significantly to the total. Output in the growth-
oIetdcp      ML1 goods and% ine.,eitegos       rdstries (ovhr tan      h  -
cals) was negligible.  In contrast, on a national scale, traditional indus-
tries accounted for less than- )45C of total value added. IAhl e less

diversification in a region's industrial structure is clearly compatibles
writh the advantages off onth specialization and industrial develnomennt, in
the case of the Northeast it was also associated with far lower relative
lev.els of ourtput and income per capi+a, and it was hAnce rDgarded as

5.       'The development and output of the regio ml economy and of its
marnufacturing industries had thus lagged behind that of the nation. In
addition, as late as the 1950's it was falling even further behind in its
shares in manufacturing output, value-added and employment, as shown in
Table 2. The Northeast share in manufacturing outnut fell from 10.1 per-
cent in 1949 to 6.9 percent in 1958. Its share in gross value-added fell
from 10.6 perfent to 6.5 nAprcnt at. thp sn-mye timp.  And its 9hArA in marnu-
facturing employment fell from 16.7 percent to 11.0 percent. Even more
sig2nificantly, --m-plrnmien-t in Northac8t m.nifac+u 'ng declined -in abso1nt;e

gains which rose faster than did the value-added in production. Indeed,

addition tc, substantial financial resources made available to it for public
investment, it was empowered to administer important new incentives to
private investment -- notably income tax and customs duty exemptions for
industries, and preferential treatment with respect to foreign exchange
allocations and rates. In 1961, a very powerful new incentive was added!
to these -- the 50 percent corporate income tax credit (34/18) for
industrial investment in the Northeast.

emphasesl/ were on increased irrigation, organized colonization and better
land use in the coastAal sugar strip  It mlay be that the political dif-
ficulties encountered by these objectives were largely responsible for
the increasing emphasis placed On undustrialization in Tne 1960;s.
9.       WWriting on Brazils goais for the Northeast in 1963, Robock
stated that "to Brazil, the challenge of the Northeast is to accelerate
economic and social development in the nationis most backward region, and
thereby to reduce actual and potential social and political disorder."
now much acceleration in growth, or what degree of reduction in regional
per capita output and income disparities, or the specific contributions
to be made towards the general goal by the several economic sectors, were
not clear at that time, and remain unclear today. What is clear, however,
is that SUDKO]E places major reliance on industrialization as an engine of
modernization and growth. SUDENE's program from 1969-1973 states that
"the industrial sector must represent in the long run a dynamic center
which will pelrmit regional growth with greater autonomy. "2/ Industry, it
states, shouLd be mainly responsible for modernizing the regional economy,
and for providing major support to continuing self-sustained growth.
10.       The SUDENE program, it should be clear, embraces most public
sector activities in the Northeast - agriculture, natural resources,
electric powar, transport and communications. basic sanitation, education
and training, housing, health and so on, as well as manufacturing industry.
SUDENE plans for public investment include those activities and investments
which are to be executed by Federal agencies, with which it coordinates,
as well as those for which other regional agencies are resnonsible, under
its supervision and (presumably) control.
11.       The broad objectives of SUDENEts industrialization policy,
while not clearly formulated, may perhaps be stated as the continued
accelerated expansion of manufacturing (and related) investment, output
and employment in the Northeast. and increasing diversifinationn of the
structure of this expanding output to achieve greater participation and
balance in the intermediate and capitAl goosri fi elds, umntil the pattern
and economic contribution of manufacturing activity more closely approximate

12.       Other and more specific objectives are visible , tile criteria
or point system SUDENE has established to help determine .ie extent to
which tax credits (34/18)funds may contribute towards the iron-loan
financing of individual projects approved by it. The poillt9 accorded to
these criteria may be considered to comprise a system of pr..orities for
further industrial development. Within SUDENE's current sy, tem, higher
priorities are accorded to industrial projects to be locatea in the poor-
est and least industrialized Northeast states. Projects wihich Promise to
absorb a large number of workers, and others which are cons4dered Ilessential"
to regional develooment,. may also be accorded relatively high point counts.
Essentiality here appears to be considered synonymous with stiucturallY
balanced industrial erowth.   (The highest point coutmts for the essentiality
category are awarded to projects in the capital goods and basic intermediate
goods, other intermediate goods and the consuamer dirables and textile fields,
in that order.)  Somewhat below these in point value are projects which
will use a laree proportion of regional i nPlvts, and others which contribute
towards national import substitution, while the lowest point counts are
accorded to modernaization and expansion programs involving nproductivtv
increases, to projects registered as "open capital" firms whose ownership
is therefore somewhat dispersed, and to projects in which labor will be
accorded some participation in profits. Details of the point system are
shown in Chart A.
13..      SUtDINRts role in the indust al development of the Northeast
is a major and dominant one. The availability of 34/18 tax credit and
other incenti-eS to industrial invest-ment in t1hMe Nort-}heast, all adin-istered
through SUDENE, appear to have virtually eliminated new industrial invest-
ment outside the SUJDENE system. Fir.s w-ith arn 4ncome tax liability ;.n

since the cost to them is zero.  Industrial investment proposals thus flow
to -SJDNAME for its considierationl and approval.  STUTNT-Ts r-ole as arlbiter as
to which projects wirl qualify for the various incentives offered, and in
w"atU degree, has placed it in a pivotal and controlling position.  Projects
to which it denies approval are almost automatically eliminated.   Investors

supplement their own resources.  Taxpayers who have 34/18 credits will not
.Invest their o-wn reso-arces in projects wnich lack SUDE1NE s appro-val for
use of their tax credits.
14.       The SUDENE role in industrial development thus embraces the
re-view of investment intentions, the approval or disapproval of proposed
industrial projects and the determination of relative priorities in
accordaice -with which various kinds and amounts of incentives may be
extended. While investment proposals originate with the private sector,
the SuDENTE role is more than that of the arbiter wfho determines whether
these intentions are realized. Through this power it also stimulates,
influences, and helps shape the investment intentions themselves.
i5.       The major incentive within the SUDRETE arsenal resides in its
power to permit the use of tax credits (34h8 funds) in either new or mod-
ernization and expansion of industrial projects in the Northeast. It may



permit the use of such funds in the case of individual pro4ects i) al.  ts
up to a maximum of 75% of their non-loan financing. Iri cases where no
loan financing is involved, therefore, this STUDEWIE power may result in a
grant to an individual project of as much as 75% of the total capital
required. In such a case, the minimum "own resources" financing requirement
for a project wouild be 2q%. Since the Bank of the Northeast may make a
maximum loan of 50% of the total capital required to a SUDENE approved
Droient. a 75% SUDENE approval for the use of 3h/18 funds would, in such
a case mearn a subsidy of only 37.5% of the total capital required (.50 x
.75). This woulld also reduce the "own rpsnirist" m!inimim enuitv requirement
to 12.5% of the total  (This subsidy element, it should be noted, is a

law grants partial or full income tax exemptions for at least ten years
to ail ne-w manmalfactcuring firms except thosae whLich SuvEE rmay consider
"undesirable." Even firms which were in operation prior to 1963 are
eligible fOr 5-% exemptions up t o 1978. Fi--s estiablished between July
1963 and end of 1971 get the same 50g exemptions as do previously establish-
ed firms in the same lines, for a period of 10 years.  if, however, ths-ie
new firm pioneers a product new to the regional industry, the tax exemption
is increased to 100%. Through 1968, the 100% exemption had been accorded
to 38 projects. In both cases, SUDENE may extend the exemption to 15 years,
especially for firms locating in relatively backward areas. Approved
projects are also eligible for loans from the Bank of the Northeast on
terms whic-h are concessiomary, both as to maturity and interest rate.
Till recently, BNB term loans were extended at 12% plus 2% commission
a sizeably negative interest rate. Even now, at 12% plus a monetary
correction of 10%, the rate is still very low in real terms.  Northeast
industrial projects may also be accorded reductions or exemptions from
import duties for capital equipment required (although this privilege is
not restricted to Northeast investment). Finally,individual state govern-
ments offer additional incentives. Although the SUDENE incentives are
well-known,, relatively little is known about state government participation
in the induLstrialization incentive program.
17.       T'he Northeast states have added further incentives to those
provided by the Federal Government and its agencies. The most important
of these is partial exemption from the state value-added tax, the I.C.M.
(imposto de circulacao de mercadorias). Firms can deposit up to 60 per-
cent of the value of their I.C.M. liability in a State Development Bank
in a special account in their own name. With the approval of state
development councils, these funds can be used as "own capital" in invest-
ment projects introducing new industries or products which are considered
of importance in improving the productivity and expanding the productive

capacity of the state's industrial sector. These deposits cannot be used
during the first year of deposit, but during this first year the state
banks will lend each depositor an amount up to 70 percent of his deposit,
at an interest rate which is not to exceed 6 percent per year. On the
other hand, the deposits must be used within two years after the first
year; otherwise the funds revert to the state.
18.       In most of the northeastern states investors may borrow varying
percentages up to 80 percent of approved project cost from state banks,
for new projects and for modernization or expansion of existing projects.
State develonment companies or state investment companies may participate
in the equity financing of a project by buying shares for later resale in
c-apital markets.  SLiuch narticipation is in relation to the "own resources"
component of 34/18 projects. This has enabled some investors to contribute
as little as 6' perent of their own fuds in 'Uh/18 proiects.   some state
companies also offer to subscribe part of the 3)4/18 component in a project
for later re-sale to 3I/18 depositors, thus accelerating the funding of a
project under construction.  While the total value of such incentives is
nknown   it is probaly yit-            because of the weak financing of
the state banks and development companies.
III. The 34/18 Operation through 1968
19.       The tax credit and resource transfer mechanism, beginning 1962,
resulted in deposits Of NCr 1,655 millio  (in current prices) by the end
of 1968. Deposits have risen greatly since 1963. In constant values they
mi-ore Wan. do-ubled fo.o.LU 96   to194  and 19764              _ 1965.  T.  a  yearly
increase has been about 25 percent since that time. While at the outset
of this program SUENi'ME wias tne only beneficiary, its share in total tax
credit deposits has declined markedly, from over 90 percent in 1964-1965
to approximately two-thirds in 1968. The SUDAM (Amazon region) share ir
fiscal incentives has been growing rapidly, and amounted to 23 percent
of the total in 1968. Tne remaining 13 percert was acco-wnted for in 1SA68
by three new priority sectors -- tourism, fishing and reforestation.
Because of these new demands, SUDENE's annual 34/1'8 deposits, irn constant
values,increased only 39 percent from 1965 to 1968, and only 5 percent from
1967 to 31968. These data are shown in Table 3.
20.       The proportion of tax paying fixms whicn have become depositors
under the fiscal incentives system has grown rapidly over the years. From
negligible proportions in 1962, 1963, and 1964, this ratio grew rapidly,
according to SUDEI1E, to 6.5 percent in 1965, 8.2 percent in 1966, 13$5 per-
cent in 1967, and 23.1 percent as of IMarch 1968. These accounted for a
very large proportion of total corporate income tax liabilities. Nearly
80 percent of all 34/18 deposits in 1965 were made by Sao Paulo and
Guanabara firms.l/ Two-thirds of such deposits during 1965 were
accounted for by depositors of NCr 50,000, or over, and 29 percent

the years 1966-1968, 34/18 deposits comprised more than 50 percent of

will be created by them, and analyze their financing, tneir prospective
raw materials sources, markets and profits. Finally it will project the
increased value-added in manufacturing, and the modified industry structure,
in which they may be expected to result. Unfortunately the SUDENE data
on some of these points are not as clear or integrated as might be desired.
Different tables covering the same periods of time do not coincide in terms
of the number of projects approved; neither is it clear in all cases whether
the projects embrace manafacturing or industrial projects only, or whether
they apply to some agricultural projects as well. Despite these inconsis-
tencies and ambiguities, there is sufficient correspondence among the data
to permit a fairly reliable portrait to be d.rawn.
23.       By the end of 1968 over 600 projects with a total investment value
of some 3.4 billion (1968) new cruzeiros had been approved. About three-
fourths of these projects which had individually a total investment value of
less than 5 million new cruzeiros accounted for less than one-fifth of the
total inveatment. Projects with individual values of 10 million new cruzei-
ros and over, accounted for something less than 14 percent of the number
of projects, and nearly 70 percent of the projected investment total. These
data are shown in Table 6.
24.      iData showing the distribution of approved proj ects by industrial
branches arid by geographic location are presented in Table 7. Some 17 per-
cent of the projects are in the textile field, 16 percent in the food pro-
ducts and chemicals fields, 11 percent in the non-metallic minerals field
and 9 percent in the metallurgical field. W4hile these five fields account
fox some 70 percent of the total, the remaining projects are distributed.
relatively thinly over the 1h remaininp industrial branches.   In tenms of
geographic distribution, some 70 percent of the projects are concentrated
in three states:  Pernmuco, 33 percent; Bahia     21 percent; and Geara, 16
percent.

26.       Data on the nuinber of jobs which are anticipated to be c-eatea
by some 569 projects approved through 1968 are shown in Table 9. These
data based, as are all the others, on the project proposals presented to
the SUDENE, anticipate employment of some 112,000 workers. Of these, the
heaviest concentrations are shown in the textile, food products, chemical,
non-ferrous metal and metallurgical industries. The data show also the
anticipated investment per man employed in the respective industry branches,
and an average investment for all projects of some 30,000 new cruzeiros per
employee. The average investment per worker is thus indicated to be some
7,500 dollars./_
27.       Investment of capital per worker may actually be somewhat higher.
It was explained to the mission that SUDENE's employment creation figures,
especially in the earlier years, included the then current employment in
plants seeking SUDENE approval for modernization and expansion programs,
on the theoryr that in the absence of such SUDENE assis-tance, they would be
forced to shut down and release their workers. This suiggests that newly
created emplovment by these Droiects mav be scmewhat less than the 112,000
figure shown, and the average investment per man figure would be correspond-
inglv higher. Even qsn the STITMNE nrvnert_ ans1mvning the.v had eontributed
only minimally to employment by 1966, would increase manufacturing employment
in the Northeast by up to 50 percen-t.
28.       Anyr at+empt to measunre the influence of the ,4/18 operation on

Data covering some 645 projects show them to be distributed between 422 new

firms' own resources in important degree, accounting most recently for about
one-fifth and one-sixth of the total finlancilg projected, respectively.
As the program progressed, 34/18 funds have played an increasingly important
role in total project financing, exceeding 45 percent in 1966 and thereafter.
li        Current comparable figures for Singapore, Halaysia and Thailand
would be between $6,Coo-8,oco  and for Colombia, $7,000.

Perhaps one-quarter of this own resources equity irnput originated abroad.
This foreign financing input was in addition to the foreign loan financing
shown in the table.
30.       Considerable criticism and even more questions have been voiced
concerning the ecornmic soinidness of the Northeast industrialization po:Licy
and the 34/18 scheme. Much of this has been based on the assumption that
vnew6. indutr"ial. r ic pro,ects in the No-rtheoast woulrld rilyr mT i n v on materials
transporte(d back to the rest of Brazil to market. The conclusion frequently
dranm has been th + the proj c+  +he se lr-s were us     rl iad   +'n the .zabnn
of subsidy, not economically viable. It should be clear that a heavy reli-
ance on marnkets outside the No;theast wouLd not in themselves deMonstrate
the unsound3ness of Northeast industrial projects. The ability to sell
col,.Ve4iil inJ othe tha  the1 rgonal m,ar'-el -would normaLly der,,nst+rate
the contrary. The allegations rest, however, not on these facts; their
logic rests rather on the assumption that the NorthsLleast market is inadeq uate
even for suibsidized industries, and that these can exist only by selling
their subs.Ldized pIrOdLctS in the rest of Brazl. The mission has therefore
devoted sornie time to an analysis of the detailed data provided by SUDENE
on a large number of projects. These do not support or conlfirm these widely
prevalent suspicions.
31.       Examination of the data provided by 486 project proposals dis-
closes that 46 percent of the total material inputs costs anticipated will
be met from the Northeast itself, while some 41 percent of material inputs,
it is anticipated, will be accounted for by the rest of Brazil, and the
remaining 13 percent from abroad. These data are shown in Table 12.
32.       The data with respect to anticipated markets clearly refute the
charges macde. Of a total of 621 project applications analyzed 544 indicated
their probable marketing patterns. Of these, 349 showed dominant marketing
patterns either in the Northeast, in the rest of Brazil or in export, while
the remaining firms showed no dominant marketing pattern.  (Dominant market-
ing pattern here was taken at 60 percent of more of total sales in one of
these market categories.) Surprisingly, 297 firms anticipated that their
sales would be entirely in the Northeast region, and an additional 10 firms
anticipated that 60-99 percent of their sales would be concentrated there.
Only 16 firms indicated a dominant sales pattern in the rest of Brazil,
while 26 ar,ticipated that the bulk of their sales would be in export. Of
the 195 firms which indicated no dominant marketing pattern, some 154
indicated that their sales would be distributed in both Mortheast and the
rest of Brazil. Since in all these cases at least a substantial portion
of sales were obviously expected to go to the Northeast, it seems a fair
presumption that, combined with those firms which clearly indicated that
their anticipated sales would be concentrated in the Northeast region, the
great bulk of the output of the new firms approved by SUDENE would be

show anticipated rates under 30 percent. Of these, the lowest anticipated
rate on ±ivestmentr is that ofU the chU 1'caL industries branch, with an
average anticipated rate of 25.7 percent. These profits, it will be re-
called, are subject at most to only half of tne established 30 percen.t
corporate income tax rate, for at least 10 years. Because most of these
investments are being made by firms already estaDiished and experienced
in their :Lines, and consequently competent to estimate costs arid sales,
these pro:Fit projections may be regarded as fairly realistic. It is
likely, however, that difficulties in providing skilled manpower from the
Center-South, and training local manpower in the Northeast, will prolong
the periodl required for the new plants to achieve the efficiency levels
implicit in their profit projections to a three to flve year pexiod, rather
than to a more normal one to two years. Further, there exists as yet no
adequate experience base by which these profit projections can be tested.
They should therefore be regarded with some caution. This analysis is shown
in Table 1L4.
34.       The mission has adjusted projections made informally within
SUDENE, which estimate the increases in gross value--added in manufacturing
the projects approved through 1968 may be expected to produce. On the
basis of rather conservative assumptions, they suggest an average annual
growth of 9.1 percent from 1965 to 1973, compared to a rate of 7.8 percent
for the period 1955-65. On the basis of somewhat more optimistic assump-
tions, the average annual growth rate to 1973 is indicated to be some Ll1.7
percent. These projections are presented in Table 15.
3g.       The same projections show also some interesting developments
with resp,-ct to the altered structure of industrial output which may be
anticipated to result from the projects approved by SUDENE thus far. These
are shown, in contrast with the contributions of the various industrial
branches to total value-added in 1955, 1962, 1965, in Table 16. The
relative shares of the so-called traditional and the more dynamic industries
(t.he grouingn i STJMDNE 's) hid q1rPndv hson nhnngpinp over the vears shown
in favor of the latter. The projections indicate that this process will
be accelerated by the SUJMRENE scheome, and that the. qtmintmrp of i ndilstr7 in
the Northeast in consequence will be a much more diversified one than that
IV. Outlook and Economic Evaluation
36.       Most of the material presented in the preceding section bears
Ui.recutl oy  n th  near-ter. outlook



37.       Disbursements of 34/18 funds in i96o, and thie indicated ratios
of 34/18 funds to total investment, suggest that manufacturing investment
in the Northeast amounted to some NCr 600 or more million in that year.
Committed and undisbursed deposits of 34/18 funds suggest that 1969-71
will experience additional manufacturing investment at a significantly
higher le7el. As of the end of 1968, more than NCr 700 million of un-
disbursed 34/18 deposits remained in the financing pipeline. Allowing both
for new resource flows additional to the present pipeline and for price
erosion, we may conservatively anticipate 34/18 disbursements at about NCr
500 million yearly through 1971. The near-term outlook therefore is for
manufacturing investment of about NCr 1 billion yearly, even if SUDENE's
share in 34/18 deposits should level off or decline, as seems quite possible.
Such outcomes could however result in an investment decline after 1971.
38.       The avaiLability of 34/18 funds,the credits prospectively
available from official banks and other credit sources, and other govern-
ment incentives are not the only factors which will affect significantly
future investments in Northeast manufacturing industries.  Other supporting
factors are natural advantages in certain raw materials; somewhat lower
labor cost.s Der unit of value-added in manufacturing; disparate freight
rates which afford protection against goods from outside the region and
cheaper relative rates on goods exported from the reeion; and an improving
infrastructure as regards roads, electric power, education, housing, and
so ona Moreover the current indastria1ization wave has put the Northeast
on the investment map. Industria:Lists are far more aware of its existence
and potentials than theyy w,,ere before. Mn-n  of the new pronects  nIll offer
obvious expansion possibilities at lower investment to prospective income
ratios than prevailed for their ori,nal iAvest   ..   4nd Axim-a! economies
are rapidly being created, as industrialization grows and spreads. Finally,
the combn4ed effects of the industrialization and other ma,Jor programs, and
the general impetus which these impart to regional growth, employment and
ncom.e, wilL themselves provide further im.petus to Jndstrial development.
Data recently available reveal that a dranaticpncrease in the region's
total output has taken place in recernt years.ls   Output and liVing mt-nnnrni
have obviously improved, and unemployment has apparently declined.27
39.       On the other side of the coin, it may be that the Northeast is
rapidly approaching completion of the first mulaJor wave of its accelerated
industrialization process. Projects already approved may have gone a long
1/        Unpublished data of the Fundacao Getulio Vargas indicate that
total output in the Northeast grew at average annual rates of
1.2 percent from 1949 to 1953, 5.1 percent from 1953 to 1958,
and 7.5 percent from 1958 to 1965.
2/        New household surveys suggest that Northeast unemployment rates
are currently far lower than had previously been thought.

wLy bouwards ex-loitUing near-termJin vesU-,nei[tM oppo.-bunLCliWes andl aU b zi3 AVIs
capacities of the market. SUDENE recently reported a sharp increase to a
rejection rate of some 30-40 percenti on Letters of Consulta-tion (-ntia:L
infonmal project proposals for use of 34/18 funds). This reflects the
Agency's concern tihat near-term investment opport,unities may have been pre-
empted in a number of fields and areas by projects already approved. A
slowdown from current and near future investment growth rates may therefore
not be far off. Such a slowdown, if it occurs, would not necessarily be
undesirable, nor would it necessarily be inconsistent with the continued
healthy expansion of industrialization in the Northeast.
40.       'The outlook for manufacturing industries will also be influenced
importantly by the priorities accorded to Northeast development by the
Federal Government, and by the relative emphasis given to manufacturing
industries within the broader regional development priority. As regards
the first of these, there is every indication that accelerated development
of the Northeast region will continue for some time to be a major objective
of gove   ,m3nt policy in Brazil. As regards the second, there are some
indications of growfing doubt as to whether the industrialization emphasiLs
has not ps:rhaps been overstressed, as to whether the investments realized
could not have been achieved with somewhat less generous incentives, and
as to whether some of the resulting investment has represented an optilmm
use of sca:rce resources. A'though the great majority of industrial pro--
.iects deve:Loped under the incentive scheme give strong evidence of future
profitability, these doubts have some validity. Thus, progress in agri.-
culture does not appear to have been accorded comparable or even adequate
attention. Similarly, even if the tax credits and other incentives contained
no element of redundancy in the earlier years of the program in relation to
the investment volumes achieved, they appear to do so now.
41.       Nor is it- altogether clear that SUDENE's scheme of priorities
for channelling resources within the industry sector is designed to allocate
these resources most effectively.  This system, revised as of March 1969,
divides projects into five prioritv nlasses.  These are permitted to use
34/18 funds up to 75 percent, 6o percent, 50 percent, 40 percent, and 3(
peroe.nt of a nronintts total non-loan fin-nancing, respectively; dependinig on
the number of points awarded them by SUDENE on the basis of stated criteria.
A point count of' 50 or more preseably entitles a proct to a 75 pereent
use of 34/:L8 funds, while the lesser categories are awarded for point counts
Of Lo-4s, :30-39, 25-29, and less than 25 points, respectively.  r. citter
employed are plant location, essentiality, use of regional inputs, impo:rt
sbstitution, dispersed onrmership, labor absorptioJn and labor participat;ion
in profits.
42.       The points awarded for location range from a maximum of 25 down

this criterion is designed to spread the beniefis of industalzation to

is dubicus whether SUDrEi'T should give high rewards for such a distribut:on.

industries which produce goods considered essential to regional development
Witninl the followirng categoriLe5:
- capital goods and basic intermediate goods, 20 poiunts;
- other intermediate goods, 15 points;
- consumer durables and textiles, 10 points.
Which industries within these categories will be considered essentiai
is obviously left to SUDENE's judgment, but the criterion obviously aim.s
at developing a more modern, balanced and relatively autonomous regionai
industry structure. Here again the rationale appears to be rather dubious,
in that it runs counter to specialization and comparative advantage.
Capital and intermediate goods might or might not contribute more in any
given case to the region's economic development than might consumer
durables, textiles or any other consumer goods industry, and it is doubtful
whether relative essentiality should be measured on this basis.
44.       The third criterion awards 15 points to a project if 80 percent
or more of its material inputs originate in the Northeast, and 10 points
if 50-79 percent of its materials so originate. This criterion appears
to be a reasonable one.
45.       The award, however, of 10 points to projects which are import
substituting from the point of view of the national economy does not appear
to be justifiable. Import substi-tution in Brazil manufacturing has been
vigorously promoted for at least 15 years and industry nationally is in.
general highly protected.  There would seem to be little justification for
further inducements to national import substitution, and even less justi-
fication for such priorities within a regional development effort. On the
other hand, the award of 10 points to projects which will export at least
hO percent of their sales outside the country is certainly justified.
Indeed, it might make sense to increase the point maximum for projects
which would exDort even lareer DroDortions of their product.
h6.       The labor absorption criterion has two components.   One awards
five points to projects in which labor costs and social charges connected
with them renresent over 25 percent of gross value added (the average for
all approved projects). In view of the need to create jobs in the Northeast,
and to influennce the relative use of' th} nroductive fantors So as to maxi-
mize the use of plentiful labor and conserve the use of scarce capital (in
this case, to counteract partially the free nantl aspect of the 3)i/ifl
system), the points awarded in such cases, it would appear, should be



47.       The second component of the labor absorption criterion is a
formula, the effect of which is to award points proportional to the amount
of employment created, up to a maximum of 25 points for projects which
employ 1,000 or more workers. There would seem to be a prima facie case
for this.
48.       The remaining criteria, each of which bears a rating of five
points, do not require comment here.
49.       In evaluating the point values built into the overall priority
scheme, it should be kept in mind that SUDENE retains a certain degree of
flexibility so that it is not rigidly bound to adhere to this scheme.
At the same time it is difficult not to conclude both that the values
built into the system are somewhat distorted, and that certain elements
which should be incorporated into a prioritv scheme are lacking. Among
these, it is suggested, should be criteria which would accord priorities
to projiests outstanding with respect to their technical and nnonnmic
feasibility; projects which promised to be viable, within a few years, at
only moderate levrels of customsnt      n pn;roPects i-n whinh a

mean that the system is not working at least reasonably well. Since very
few of even the small proportion of pLoJects already com,1pleted ha-ve had a
full run-in period,there does not as yet exist an adequate empirical basis
for such a Judgnent. * what does seem lik-ely is that the priority system
can be strengthened and improved, and that a careful consideration of these
possibilities would prove to be rewarding.
50.      'It may be of interest to recapitulate Drieily the findings oI
this study, insofar as they suggest the balance of payments implications
of the industrialization program.  It has been indicated that near-term
investment in manufacturing industries should approximate NCr 1 billion
yearly for the period 1969-71. Of this, experience thus far indicates
that the external financing component will amount to some 20 percent --
15 percent loan filancing, and 5 percent equity financing. The foreign
import component of this investment may be expected to correspond rough:Ly
to this financial contribution. Since previous analysis of the program has
also indicated a sales/investment ratio of approximately 5:4, a raw materials
to sales ratio of 4:10, and a materials import component of 13 percent from
abroad, it may crudely be estimated that the three year increment in annual
materials imports by 1971 may be some NCr 190-200 million (1968 prices).
It is more difficult to approximate exports, since the geographic market
analysis is based on the number of projects, rather than on their projected
sales values, and since many firms did not indicate a dominant market
pattern. 1A crude estimate, thus qualified, is that near-term exports may
amount to some 5-6 percent of projected sales, or a three-year increment
of some NC:r 190-225 million (1968 prices) by 1971.

to investment in manufacturing industry, there is no doubt that this
progra- hl-as been highly successful. If one applies the further major
test of the prospective profitability of the projects thus induced, the
anaiysis presented in paragraph 33 suggests that by this test too the
program will, in all likelihood, prove to be successfhl.    It appears al;o
that a reasonable proportion of raw materiaa inputs required by these
projects will originate in the Northeast, and that by far the greater part
of the goods produced will be marketed within the region. Fears that the
program win, generate a great deal of unnecessary transportation to and
from the Ncrtheast would appear therefore to be unwarranted. The structure
of the Northeast's manufacturing industries is becoming more diversifiedc,
and external economies are undoubtedly developing. While direct employmlent
gains will be modest relative to needs, the indirect employment effects
should be more substantial.   Investment per worker does not appear to be
excessive relative to that which prevails in the rest of Brazil.
52.       Cn the other hand, as already stated, it appears that the incen-
tives which have been made available to investors in the Northeast are
excessive in relation to the volume of investment evoked. The 50 percent
tax credit is very sizeable, both in the individual benefits it confers
and in relation to the Federal budget deficit. The maximum grant of 75 per-
cent of total project investment which is possible within the present system
appears to be larger than is necessary, eauitable or desirable. The vexy
nature of the incentive system opens it to certain abuses. The priority
criteria employed by SUDENE are not as well adanted to prevailing circui-
stances and needs as they ought to be, and the combination of system and
circumstance is resulting in an increasingly dominant role in Northeast
manufacturing by Center/South investors. M4any Northeast fixns with legiti-
mate claims to modernization and expansion of their enterprises are finding
it difficult to obtain 34/18 financing for their projects. They are un-
wllhina to pay the high coiunissions anA/or eq ity - participating brokers are
reportedly charging for assistance in arranging for them.lJ   Investment in
the Northeast. to be sre, is desirable on ma<,nny counts, no matter where it
originates. However, 100 percent ownership and control of Northeast enter-
prises bv f'irtns outside the Northeast does mear. that a sizeable portion of
the proceeds from these enterprises will flow outside the region, which in
the case of regional ownership wou:Ld (itend to lbe re-invevesd or spent -wn-M
the region. Taking the regional development emphasis as given, the impli-
catior.s of this for T`rther development of the Northeast are not as bene-
ficial as would be the case, other things being equal, under Northeast
, ;re=&hip .
1/        Many however are too small to be able to prepare the elaborate
and costly project proposals required 'Dy SUDENE. These must
rely on the separate small and medium-size industry program in
which BNB moneys are re-.lent through state development banks,
and on state technical assistance programs.



- 16 -
53.       Another point merits consideration in an economic eva".uation
of this program. The growth of manufacturing in Brazil in receLt years,
it has already been suggested, was stimulated and supported chiefly by
protectionism and its companion policy of import substitution. For the
Brazilian economy as a whole, import substitution has pretty well xun
its course. Since these policies have resulted in a relatively hig'1
cost industry, export potentials for the near-texm are not areat in ab-
solute tenas, and continued vigorous growth for some time to come must
depend on a combination of greater nroductive effitiencv and expansiorn
of the internal market. In this sense, the incentive program to
industrialilze the Northng+. reAre, t.hmiih probably only in mnnor degn!e.

54.      MThere has been little public discussion thus far of what the
industirialization incenti-ve progra.m's specific goals should be, how long,
the prograa should last, or what the criteria for transitional arrangements
and ultimalte terxi=lation shouJld be. In the prevaiiing climaLe, these
questions are delicate. People in the Federal Governniot, and Center/
South industrialists, seem hesitant to offend Northeast sensibilities.
In the Northeast, officials and industrialists hesitate to discuss
infirmities in the system, even thougn they may view these objectively,
for fear any opening up of the issues will result in substantial curtail-
ments in existing incentives. Further, no one seems to have taken ade-
quately into account the near-term implications of the huge volume of
approved projects already in the pipeline, in relation to what investment
volur,ies and incentives are still necessary and desirable, and the possible
timing of orderly change.
55.       In conclusion, the industrialization program for the Northeaslt
may be considered to constitute an imaginative and, on balance, construc-
tive approach to one of Brazil's major problems. In channelling sizeab:Le
amounts of public resources into productive private investments in the
region, it contributes to reducing the traditional disparity in incomes
between the Northeast and the rest of Brazil. Despite the substantial
contributions it has already made, and its further contributions which
will derive from approved projects not yet completed, continuation of the
program is clearly in order for some time to come. However, its very sluC-
cesses redukce the degree of incentives required for its successful conti-
nuation.  ThIis, together with other considsrations already presented,
suggests that the program could bes rnztened and    improved if the following
steps were taken:
a) the 50 percent tax credit were reduced to 35-40 percent, with
the difference of 'LO-L5 percent going to SUDENE-BNB for grants and loans

Appendix I
S UWDIE s 3-4 8 Regulations
A description of SUDELNE's 34/18 regulations is presented in
this appendix.
1.        The term 34/18 originates from Article 34 of Law 3995 (Dec. 114,
1961) and Article 18 of Law 4239 (June 27, 1963). These govern the
creation of the tax credit investment funds. Law 4869, of December 1,
1965 (supplemented by still others and referred to here as the "old sys-
tem"), and Law 5508 of October 11, 1968 (supplemented by Decree 64.214
of March 18. 1969, referred to here as the "new system"), regulate the
use of these fumds. The older system, in effect until March, 1969, is
summarized below. Recent changes (the new svstem) are explicitly indicated.

in which the tax was due. For deposits made in 1,66 and 1967, however, the

(including the states of Maranhao, the Island of Fernando de Noronha,
and that part of Minas Gerais state which lies within the droight polygon)
which have been approved by S-UDEIT. Article 5 of the 1969 decree includes
under "industrial or agzicultural enterprises":
i.    Agriculture, cattle raising and other related activities;
ii.   Forestry and fisheries;
iii.  Mineral extraction;
iv.   Manufacturing industries, classified in twenty branches;
v.    Other activities, if SUDENE recognizes them as industrial

The new system also allows investment in electric power generation, trans-
m.s1.oio  and distribution projects.
6.        Application for approval - Entrepreneurs interested in launctling
a project in the Northeast will initially address to SUDENE a "consultation
letter,", on which SuDENE should take final action within 150 days of re-
ceipt.  Acceptance of the project outlire contained in the "consultatlcn
letterti by SU DU\E should precede submittal of a formal project application.
7.        The form of 34/18 participation - Of the total of 34/18 funds
incorporated into a project as shares, at least 50 percent of the shares
must be pieferential and with no voting rights (the 50 percent may be
set relative to all 34/18 shares, or relative to the holdings of each
depositor). This is designed to protect the entrepreneurs who organize
and provide the "own resource" equity financing from 34/18 depositors-
investors Aho would otherwise control the company.
8.        In the new system, all 34/18 depositor shares must be nominal
and cannot be transferred up to five years after the pro.ject has started
to "function normally" as determined by SUDENE (the old decree is not
specific on the issue of share transferability).
9.        If 34/18 funds are committed as loans to a project, these loans
may not be called within five years of the completion of the project.
In the new svstem. the loans-
a! are not transfernhle within five vpprq after the nprojiet.

b) will receive interest of not over 12 percent p.a.;
c) will receive no monetzry correction;
d) will be amortized, after five years, in installments of
20 percent p.a;.
10.        '      'articipation of 3),/18 deposit  n total inves+ment = The 34/18

project on the basis of stated criteria, SUDENE has retained flexibility
in this respect. Until March, i969, SuDEE reserved the right to add up
to 10 points or subtract up to 15 points from a project's point count "upon
consideration of other aspects of essentiality in the project and the
availability of 34/18 funds."   Since a total of 50 oI' more points are
required to qualify for the maximum 34/18 participation of 75 percent, this
10-15 percent flexibility range was quite significant. In the new system,
this flexibility is maintained.   Furthermore, SUDENE ma         ass the
point system altogether in deciding on the amount of 34/18 participation
"whenever it considers a project to be of high priority for the region's
development within the directions of the 'Plano Diretor."'
13.       Other issues - The following are mentioned only in the new
decree, which is more detailed (and twice the length) of the old law.
a) Foreign remittances - profits derived from the investment
of 34/18 funds may under no circumstances be remitted outside the country,
under severe penalties. This does not affect the remittance of profits
which correspond to direct foreign investment, duly registered and under
the conditions set forth by present legislation. This also does not
prohibit the utilization of profits derived from 34/18 funds to purchase
foreign equipment which do not have a domestic "similar."
b) feinvestments - SUDENE area firms may, for reinvestment
purposes, deposit in the BNB 50 percent of their corporate income tax
liability, with the addition of half of this amount in own resources.
These funds can be freed for reinvestment only by SUDENE.   SUDENE's
verification and approval procedures will however be less demanding in
sueh eases.
c) BNR financing OT mgyurnntee - nrniocts requlri-n- BRNB finaneing,
or guarantee will be submitted simul-taneously to SUDENE and BNIB. BNB may
not approve any such project-s p"-reious- toe qMVTR.IE's favonrablel -rrecoTmPend3iJon,

SUDENE-approved projects once they are in operation. It assumes: a) only a negligable contribution to 1965 value-
added from SUDENE projects approved through that year; b) no contribution from existing or new industrial projects
outside the SUDENE system; c) no output in 1973 from SUDENE projects approved after 1968; and d) output at 60%
of capacity.
