Major components were not\n            completed and the sustainability of project results is\n            uncertain, notwithstanding the successful rehabilitation of\n            generation facilities, including costs and outages\n            reduction. The Bank's performance for project\n            identification/preparation is rated\n            \"satisfactory\"; however, for appraisal/supervision\n            it is rated \"unsatisfactory\". Even though the Bank\n            responded expeditiously to an emergency, it did not\n            incorporate safeguards into project design in the form of a\n            commitment by the Borrower to implement the tariff related\n            recommendations. Equally, the Borrower is rated positively\n            for preparation/implementation, but negatively on the issue\n            of tariff related and environmental components, as well as\n            compliance with reporting requirements. The key lessons\n            learned are: 1) at project preparation: project objectives\n            should reflect a clear priority ranking and Borrower\n            commitment should be ensured prior to loan approval.\n            Further, project design should support project objectives,\n            with special care towards enforceable components and\n            covenants; 2) During project implementation: regular\n            supervision and mid-term reviews are essential; under\n            non-compliance situations with loan/project covenants, the\n            Bank should exercise remedies, including suspension/cancellation."}, "docdt": "1998-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
