         1994 which destroyed the Unit 4 boiler and damaged Unit 3.\n            The restoration of the power station to its original\n            capacity will occur at the same time that a new 72 MW medium\n            speed diesel barge facility is to be installed at the Old\n            Harbour Plant.  The environmental assessment (EA) of the\n            existing steam plant, was previously completed for JPS by\n            Fichtner.  This EA report updates the Fichter report to\n            include the rehabilitation of Unit 4 and information\n            provided for the barge facility to consider impacts of both\n            power plants.  The areas of environmental impact addressed\n            by this study are: 1) air quality; 2) wastewater discharges;\n            3) noise emissions; 4) land use impacts; 5) ecological\n            impacts; and 6) occupational health and safety."}, "docdt": "1994-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
