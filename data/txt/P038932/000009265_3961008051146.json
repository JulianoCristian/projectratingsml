electricity service to normal conditions as early as\n            possible, thus eliminating costly power cuts; 2) to reduce\n            generation costs through lower running cost plants, save on\n            capital costs by upgrading existing facilities and safeguard\n            the system against the breakdown of existing units due to\n            extended use; 3) to improve generation security, enhance\n            system reliability and control systems to reduce the\n            likelihood of future recurrence of generating plant\n            incidents by improving the telecommunications and energy\n            control systems and by reinforcing the transmission network;\n            4) to improve resource allocation through the reform of\n            electricity tariffs and ensure that loss of base load\n            generation capacity does not adversely affect the\n            environment for increasing private sector participation in\n            the power sector; and 4) to reduce and control the\n            environmental impact associated with power system\n            facilities. To achieve these objectives the project\n            comprises several components. The first is a restoration of\n            Old Habor (OH) unit 3 and OH unit 4 boiler. Second, the\n            project calls for life extension of OH unit 4 generation\n            turbine and upgrades for gas turbine units 3, 4 and 5.\n            Transmission system reinforcements and ugrading of the\n            energy control center and associated telecommunications\n            facilities are also major concerns. Additionally, consulting\n            services will be required for technical supervision and\n            project management for the generating system components of\n            the project; engineering and management for the\n            environmental mitigation component of the project; and cost\n            of service and tariff reform studies."}, "docdt": "1995-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
