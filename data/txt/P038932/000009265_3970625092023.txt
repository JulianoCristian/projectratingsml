EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Jamaica Public service Company (JPS) had an explosion at the Old Harbour Power Station
on June 3, 1994 which destroyed the Unit 4 boiler and damaged Unit 3. The restoration of
the power station to its original capacity will occur at the same time that a new 72 MW
rmedium speed diesel barge facility is to be installed at the Old Harbour Plant. The barge
facility is being developed by Jamaica Energy Partners who have an agreement to provide
power to JPS for 20 years commencing September 1995. It will be independent of the
existing plant but will discharge cooling water into the existing cooling water canal.
The environmental assessment (EA) of the existing steam plant, was previously completed for
JPS by Fichtner. This EA report updates the Fichtner report to include the rehabilitation of
Unit 4 and information provided for the barge facility to consider impacts of both power
plants. A separate EA is being prepared by Dynalytics Corporation (a US consultant) for the
developer of the barge facility, preliminary information available on the barge facility has been
used in this environmental assessment (EA).
The barge will require dredging of an estimated 200,000 cubic meters of material to provide
a basin of sufficient depth adjacent to the plant. The dredged materials will be transported to
a designated dump site at sea. No dredging will be done in the area of the coral reefs. Fuel
will be delivered via an undersea pipeline from an offshore tanker mooring; to prevent impacts
from spills a contingency plan will be required.
The area around Old Harbour Power is a part of Jamaica which is in intensive use for
agriculture, cattle raising, fishing and housing.
The existing steam plant at Old Harbour exceeds the World Bank and NRCA guidelines for
ambient levels of sulphur dioxide due to the low stack heights. The addition of control
measures, such as increased stack height, to the new Unit 4 boiler will not materially improve
this due to the contribution of the other three units. The point of maximum impact is
approximately 500 m west of the station, in an unpopulated area. The incremental increase
in sulphur dioxide from the barge facility is marginal. The retirement of units 1 and 2 in
199819 will greatly improve conditions, but the guidelines will still be exceeded on occasion.
With the pending retirement of 2 units in the next 5 years and the area of maximum impact
being non populated no further mitigation measures are suggested.
Preliminary information provided on the barge shows that it will increase NO. levels above
World Bank guidelines. The combined emissions from the barge and existing plant meet
ambient levels for particulate matter.
Wastewater discharges from the steam plant also exceed World Bank and NRCA guidelines
due to the lack of a treatment plant to handle the air preheater and boiler wash waters. These
contain high levels of heavy metals which are currently discharged untreated to the Caribbean
Sea via the cooling water effluent .

The air preheater wash and boiler wash waters need to be treated by a wastewater treatment
plant. A process design is included in Appendix 6. Approximate cost of this is $0.5 - 0.8
million U.S.
Prior activities at Old Harbour have contaminated the site with fuel oil, in the tank farm and
along the piping route. These areas of the site need to be remediated. Approximate costs are
$0.75 - 0.4 million U.S.
To prevent future contamination the tank farm should be contained in an impermeable dyke
and the oil transfer piping installed in an impermeable trench. Approximate costs are $0.5 -
0.75 million U.S.
A secure storage area is required for chemicals and hazardous wastes. This should include
a curbed concrete pad, a rain canopy and fencing.
An asbestos survey is urgently required, followed by a management plan prior to the start of
construction activities on Unit 4. JPS staff can complete this, as approximately 30 of them
have had asbestos training.
A PCB survey and management plan is also required; JPS are consolidating waste PCB's and
negotiating shipment to a destruction facility in France.
The envirunnental performance of the plant needs to be monitored. This will include
wastewater effluents, spills, contingency response, and waste chemical management. In
addition JPS should continue to do annual inspections of the under sea oil transfer pipeline
from Esquivel.
JPS are reconstructing the laboratory which was lost in the explosion.
An overview of the environmental effects is given in the following Table 1:

1.0  PROJECT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
1.1   PROJECT BACKGROUND
The Jamaica Public service Company (JPS) had an explosion at the Old Harbour Power Station
on June 3, 1994 which destroyed the Unit 4 boiler and damaged Unit 3. The restoration of
the power station to its original capacity will be partially financed by the World Bank.
The restoration of Unit 4 will occur at the same time that a new 72 MW medium speed diesel
barge facility is to be installed at the Old Harbour Plant. The barge facility is being developed
by Jamaica Energy Partners who have an agreement to provide power to JPS for 20 years
commencing September 1995. It will be independent of the existing plant but will discharge
cooling water into the existing cooling water canal. The EA of the existing steam plant, was
previously completed for JPS by Fichtner. This EA report updates the Fichtner report to
include the rehabilitation of Unit 4 and information provided for the barge facility to consider
impacts of both power plants. A separate EA is being prepared by Dynalytics Corporation
(a US consultant) for the developer of the barge facility, preliminary information available on
the barge facility has been used in this environmental assessment (EA).
1.2  PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The objective of the project is to restore the generating capacity of Unit 4 by replacement of
the boiler and ancillaries lost in the explosion of June, 3 1994, as quickly as possible to meet
system demands for power.
The objective of the power barge is to provide an additional 72 MW of power to meet
projected future demands.
1.3   DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT AND STUDY AREA
The Old Harbour Power Station operated by JPS is located on the south coast of Jamaica in
the Parish of St. Catherine, some 2.5 km to the south of Old Harbour, which is a small town
with a population of 16,000. The nearest settlement to the power station is Old Harbour Bay
to the northwest. There, and in Lhe immediate vicinity, more than 6,500 people live.
Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, is at a distance of 38 km to the northeast.
The power plant is located directly on the Caribbean Sea coast and virtually forms the western
boundary of a small bay, called "Old Harbour Bay" within the larger bay "Portland Bight".
Offshore are a few small islands, the largest of which is called Great Goat Island. Map 5.1
(Appendix 5) gives an impression of "Old Harbour Bay", showing a view of part of the power
plant as seen from the sea.
Prior to the explosion, the Old Harbour Power Station consisted of four units with a total
design capacity of 230 MW (design parameters are listed in Appendix 1). The fuel fired is
Bunker C oil from Venezuela. Due to problems with the control of the firing system, the
maximum power plant output had been down rated from 230 to 213.5 MW

Old Harbour Power Station                                               Page (2)
Each unit consists of a drum type boiler system with regenerative Ljungstrom air heater and
steam air preheater. Combustion air is supplied by way of a forced draft fan. After the
Ljungstr6m air heater, flue gases are discharged directly via the stacks. The stack heights ere
46 m (150 ft).

Total operating hours      h        132,663    145,740    112,906    114,536
A few years ago, the four units were thoroughly overhauled with funds provided by the World
Bank. At that time Swedish consultants prepared a"least-cost expansion study". This least
cost expansion study was updated by JPS in 1993. The planned retirement dates for Old
Harbour Power Station are:
Unit 1 - 1998
Unit 2 - 1999
Unit 3 - 2001
Unit 4 - 2002
To augment the station capacity a 72 MW barge facility is proposed which will consist of
eight Wartsila 1 2V46 medium speed diesels. This will be provided by a private developer
Wartsila Diesel Development Corp. Inc. (WDD) in partnership with JPS to form a new
company Jamaica Energy Partners (JEP).
1.3 ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND POLICIES
The restoration project will be covered under World Bank environmental guidelines. The key
regulatory agency responsible for environment in Jamaica is the National Resource

Conservation Authority (NRCA). The barge faci!ity will also be required to meet national and
local development legislation and policies described below.
World Bank guidelines and NRCA guidelines are contained in Appendix 4.
1.3.1 National Resource Conservation Authority
In June of 1991, following the passage of enabling legislation, the Government of Jamaica
(GOJ) established the National Resource Conservation Authority {NRCA) as the principle
agency responsible for the effective management of the environment. Its functions cover
management and policy aspects relating to wildlife, watersheds, coastal zone protection,
national parks, including survey and investigative work. Of particular relevance to the energy
sector, NRCA has the responsibility to:
a)    develop, implement, and monitor environmental protection programs;
bl   formulate standards and codes of practice including those relating to emissions and
effluents;
c)   investigate the effect on the environment of polluting activities and take appropriate
action;
d)    commission studies and promote relevant research;
e)   introduce training programs; and,
f)    do anything which in the opinion of NRCA is necessary to perform its functions.
NRCA has the authority to: ask for environmental impact assessments (EIA)'s; order the
cessation of pollution; require industries to monitor and report pollutant discharges; and
restore pol luted a reas to there original condition. The NRCA will be developing these a ctivities
in conjunction with the various sector agencies;.and an energy / environmental steering
committee has been formed to look at the broad range of environmental issues facing the
energy sector. The energy sector plans are to include:
a)    a mandatory EIA for new energy projects;
b)    cleaning up existing pollution sources, priorities being JPS and the Petrojam refinery;
c)    pollution abatement by energy conservation and efficiency improvement;
d)    strengthening NRCA to fulfil its mandate:
e)    establishing baseline data for air quality and forestry resources; and,
f)   identifying standards for zones such as Kingston. tourist areas etc.
Application is being made to the NRCA by the barge developer for project approval.
1.3.2 Beach Control Authority
The Beach Control Authority (BCA) was established by the Beach Control Act of 1956. It is
empowered to declare public recreational beaches, to issue or revoke or cancel licences for
certain foreshore areas in the interest of better development, as well as and also to acquire
beachlands in the public interest.



Jamaica Public Service Company                                 December 12, 1994
Old Harbour Power Station                                                Page (4)
The government's Recreation and Conservation Division is the agency responsible for
enforcing the provisions of the Beach Control Act and for ensuring compliance with the
policies of the BCA.
The barge facility will require a licence from the BCA for the proposed dredging and
reclamation, and a permit to encroach on the foreshore.
1.3.3 Port Authority
The Marine Division of the Port Authority, under the Port Authority Act of 1972, is
responsible for regulating the construction of all structures on or over water. Hence, the
approval of the Port Authority will have to be obtained for the barge facility.
1.3.4 The Town and Country Planning Authority
The Town Planning Department is the functional arm that carries out policies established by
the Town and Country Planning Authority (TCPA). They will be involved in the approval
process for the barge facility.
The Local Improvements Act requires that whenever lands are to be subdivided for building,
lease, sale, or other purposes, plans must be submitted to the Town Planning Department for
approval.
The TCPA has responsibility for ratifying Development Orders containing land use plans and
regulations, and for controlling the development of land by:
*     ensuring that the subdivision of land is carried out in accordance with national land use
policies;
e     co-ordinating the building of roads and public services; and,
*     protecting and extending amenities and conserving and developing resources.
1.3.5 Ministry of Health
The Jamaica Public Health Act of 1 974 is the enabling legislation under which the Public
Health Regulations (1976). in relation to air, soil, and water pollution were enacted.
The Environmental Control Division of the Ministry of Health is the chief government agency
responsible for ensuring that development projects include provisions for proper sanitary
conditions and conveniences. The national quality guidelines apply to the discharge of sewage
effluents to any receiving body. The new barge facility will need to meet these guidelines.
1.3.6 The St. Catherine Parish Council
Under the local government laws, the St. Catherine Parish Council has legal right to examine
all development plans proposed for the parish, and the Council works in conjunction with the

2.0   PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
The restoration of Unit 4 is limited in the types of alternative projects which can be considered
as the extent of the work is essentially the replacement of the boiler. The existing steam
turbine will continue to be used for the remaining life of the power plant.
Two options were considered for implementation during this rehabilitation: increasing the
stack height of Unit 4 to 60 m from 46 m; and lowering the sulphur content of the fuel from
3% specification to 2.2%. The impacts of both of these changes are discussed in detail in
Section 4.1.
The increase in stackheight for Unit 4would significantly complicate construction by requiring
a replacement stack and footings. Dispersion modelling showed that this would not
appreciably change the ground level concentrations of air emissions due to the impacts from
the other units. This alternative was not considered feasible for this project.
Reducing the sulphur content of the fuel would reduce ground level concentrations of SO2;
but this would increase the operating costs to the consumer. As the dispersion models
showed that the maximum concentrations occurred to the west of the station, over the water,
this alternative was also discounted as having no major benefit.
The planned retirement of units 1 and 2 in the years 1998-99 will more significantly reduce
the ground level concentration of emissions than either of the alternatives described above.
Project alternatives for the barge were not available. A separate EA being completed by its'
develcper.

3.0   DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING ENVIRONMENT
3.1   AIR RESOURCES
The chief sources of air pollution in Jamaica are major industrial facilities, and in particular
those of the bauxitelaluminum industry, the cement industry, petrochemical complexes. the
sugar industry as well as thermal power plants. Added to this are emissions from the heavy
and expanding automobile traffic, centred mainly in Jamaica's capital, Kingston.
Under the aspect of air quality, the tropical, maritime climate of Jamaica may be considered
as favourable. The prevailing southeasterly winds blowing from the Caribbean. Sea onto the
land along the sough coast, which are very strong at times, ensure as a rule that there will
be a frequent replacement of air, and provide favourable conditions for the dispersion of fumes
and flue gas emissions from industrial facilities and power plants located near the coast,
provided these have high enough stacks.
The air quality in the investigation area is influenced essentially by one major emitter, the Old
Harbour Power Station.
In Jamaica, there have as yet been a no comprehensive measurements of ground-level
pollutant concentrations in order to assess air quality, and in this specific case for the
investigation area around the Old Harbour Power Station.
In 1993, as part of a research project, the Nuclear Centre of the University of the West Indies
in Kingston took samples of particulates at thirty locations in Jamaica and analyzed these for
selected elements, in particular metals and heavy metals. This sampling was undertaken to
characterize ambient air conditions prevailing in defined areas, that is in industrial zones,
residential areas, agricultural area or clean air areas. The sampling location nearest to the
investigation was at Bodies Agriculture Research Station, on the roof of one of its buildings.
It is located within the region affected by the Power Plant, in the direction of the prevailing
winds.
The time for taking each sample was 24 hours. Table 3-1 shows an excerpt from the analysis
results for manganese, vanadium and barium or particulate samples from the collection point
at Bodles Agriculture Research Station. For comparison purposes, in Table 3-2 are the results
for the analysis of a sample taken at a background site in a clean air region of Jamaica,
although at a different period of the year.

The meteorological data of the period of particulate sampling were not available at the
meteorological office at Norman Manley International Airport. This meteorological office is
the nearest to the investigation area for which comprehensive weather data are recorded
continuously. Owing to its geographical location on the south coast of Jamaica and its
relatively short distance from Old Harbour Power Station of about 35 km, the meteorological
data which it records may also be regarded as representative of that for the investigation area.

3.2 NOISE
The site is remote from the nearest community and noise emissions are not a concern with
the existing thermal power plant. No other significant noise sources are situated in the area.
3.3 WATER RESOURCES
Groundwater
The quality and quantity of ground water resources depend primarily on the geological
conditions in a particular region. As described in the preceding section, the geological and
thus also the hydro-geological situation of Jamaica is overwhelmingly determined by its
limestone bedrock.
The groundwater in the investigation area is, in the vicinity of the coast that is in the
wetlands, characterized chiefly by a high salt content for which the ingress of sea water is
responsible, resulting in salination of coastal aquifers.
There are no wells from which ground water is extracted for irrigation, industrial use or
drinking water preparation in the coastal region of the investigation area, that are in the direct
vicinity of Old Harbour Power Station.



Jamaica Public Service Company                                 December 12, 1994
Old Harbour Power Scation                                              Page 110)
The well nearest to the power plant site is operated by the Alcan Jamaica Company to supply
their alumina storage and shipment wharf as Port Esquivel. This deep well pumping station
is located to the northwest at a distance of some 1.8 km from Old Harbour Power Station.
In order to supply Old Harbour Power Station with process water, JPS operates its own two
pumping stations. The one nearest to the power plant, comprising the two wells Bodies 1
and 2, is about 1 km to the northeast of Freetown, whilst the second pumping station
Vazwell, is located in the western part of the town Old Harbour.
Other wells for supplying water to the fish rearing ponds, which occupy large areas in this
region, are located in the vicinity of the western boundary of Freetown as well as near the
Bodies Agriculture Research Station. and to the east of this. According to information
obtained by Fichtner from the Underground Water Authority, the water quality of these wells
is good and is monitored by the office in St. Dorothy. The geographical locations of all the
wells named are marked in Map 5.2 (Appendix 5).
Surface Waters
For a systematic representation of the current situation in the investigation area, it is
appropriate to describe the protected resource "surface waters" under the aspects:
*     flowing waters;
*    artificial water basins; and,
*    the Caribbean Sea (coastal zone).
Flowing Waters
In regions with a very hot, or tropical climate, a basic differentiation is made between
permanent flowing waters, i.e., water courses in which water flows throughout the year, as
a rule bearing the designations "River" or "Rio" (e.g., Black River, Rio Minho), and sporadic
flowing waters which can be recognized in Jamaica by the designation "gully" (e.g., Stony
Gully).
There are no major rivers - in which water permanently flows - in the investigation area near
Old Harbour Power Station. However, there are some channels in which water flows
sporadically, these being:
*     Bowers Gully:
*     Frasers Gully;
*     Stony Gully; and,
*     Church Pen Gully.
During very dry years, it may happen that water flows through these water courses only on
one or two days in the year. This particularly probable at times when rainfall is most frequent,
usually around the months May/June and September/October. Then due to increased run-off
from the "Blue Mountains', water often appears quite suddenly in these gullies.



Jamaica Public Service Company                                  December 12, 1994
Old Harbour Power Station                                               Page 111)
Due to soil erosion by the severe rain showers, this flowing water is usually very turbid and
brown in colour. Additionally, due to the pollutants and waste materials which are washed
away, it is a very poor quality.
Artificial Ponds for Fish Farming
Freshwater fish farming is one of the most important sectors of food production for Jamaica's
inhabitants. A major proportion of the freshwater fish farms in Jamaica are located near the
coast of the southern parishes of St. Catherine, Clarendon and St. Elizabeth.
The total of 92 fish farms at the coast around Old Harbour Bay represent, with 891 acres, the
most extensive and significant area for this sector.
Consequently the investigation area around Old Harbour Power Station lies in the middle of
this most important agricultural region of Jamaica.
Most of the fish species farmed in these ponds serve for domestic supply within Jamaica and
are sold mainly in local markets directly to consumers. Exports of freshwater fish play only
a minor part in the economy.
The chief species of fish farm in the coastal region of St- Catherine are:
-     tilapia:
D     perch; and,
*     carp.
The fresh water required for fish farming is extracted directly from wells in the vicinity, with
no further treatment of the water. The quality of water is subject to monitoring by the
authorities (St. Dorothy Office).
The location of the groundwater pumping stations in the investigation area are marked in
Map 5.2. as are also those fish farms nearest to Old Harbour Power Station. These are
situated on both sides of the road from Old Harbour Bay to Lloyas Pen (Bushy Park) as well
as along the western side of the access road to Port Esquivel (alumina storage and shipment
wharf).
Caribbean Sea (Coastal Zone)
Old Harbour Power Station is located directly on the south Caribbean coast of Jamaica on a
peninsula which forms the western boundary of a small bay named Old Harbour Bay. This
small bay is located centrally within another bay which is very large in comparison, the
Portland Bight.
As a consequence, the inshore area of the coastal water zone in the Portland Bight forms part
of the investigation area.



Jamaica Public Service Company                                December 12, 1994
Old Harbour Power Station                                              Page (12)
The Caribbean Sea along the south coast of Jamaica represents, with its deep water zones,
fishing grounds of great significance as well as maritime ecological systems which are the
most species-rich of the island. Inshore fishing is intensive, in particular around the coast of
Old Harbour Bay.
It is not known whether any investigations have been made into the water quality of this
inshore area in Old Harbour Bay. At the instigation of the Natural Resources Conservation
Authority (NRCA, formerly NRCA) in Kingston, investigations have already been undertaken
for other coastal regions in which pollution occurs due to the existence of harbours and heavy
marine traffic or industry, under a water quality monitoring programme. As early as in 1976
a project was commissioned for the harbour area of Kingston in which the principal sources
of water pollution were aetermined and characterized (NRCA, Kingston Harbour Pollution
Monitoring).
Further investigations into the waters have also been carried out at these coastal strips in
Jamaica of most significance for the tourist trade in the north (e.g., Ocho Rios Bay) and in the
west (Negril).
Around Old Harbour Bay, it is the harbour of Port Esquivel and in particular the facilities of the
Alcan Jamaica Company - its alumina storage and shipment wharf - and Old Harbour Power
Station which represent the chief potential sources of sea water pollution along this section
of the coast.
Benthic studies are underway in the immediate vicinity of the power plant as part of the EA
for the new power barge. Preliminary information indicates that the area adjacent to the
power station contain benthic communities which are comprised of sparse seagrass and
colonizing species of algae on top of a soft mud seabed. High levels of turbidity in the water
column reduces the available light and limits growth.
3.4 LAND RESOURCES
Soils and Geology
The geology of Jamaica is chiefly characterized by the presence of limestone bedrock. About
two-thirds of Jamaica, and in particular the western and central parts of the island, consists
of white limestone from the Middle EocenelLower Miocene periods.
In the coastal region around Portland Bight and thus also in the investigation area representing
the basis for this study, the geological formation of the bedrock consists of alluvial material,
both from the Quaternary period and of recent formation (source: Geological Survey Division).
The soils in the investigation area may be classified into various soil types, although they are
all determined by the prevailing geological substratum, and belong to the class of alluvial soils.
These are characterized chiefly by their clay, sand and gravel constituents and therefore offer
very favourable conditions for agricultural utilization as practiced on a large scale in this
region, as illustrated by large plantations of sugar cane or bananas.



Jamaica Public Service Company                                   December 12, 1994
Old Harbour Power Station                                                Page (131
The wetlands occurring in the investigation area, in particular in the vicinity of he coast,
likewise offer with their clay or loamy substratum ideal soil-ecological conditions for the
indigenous animal and plant life, such as mangrove trees
Agriculture
In the investigation area,there are some bigger farms, such as Kellys Pen Ltd., Jamaica Hope
Dairy Cattle or Brampton Farm, on which animal husbandry and crop cultivation are practiced
professionally and on a large scale. A further economic factor is the export of bull semen.
Many of the inhabitants keep various domesticated animals or cultivate fruit and vegetables
for their own needs or to earn a small income.
The investigation area is one of the most important regions for dairy farming and meat
production. Cattle farming on a large scale is widespread. Also, in particular around Bushy
Park, there are some farms on which horses are kept. In smaller farming units, pigs, goats
and poultry are kept, to give this region the general appearance characteristic of country and
town throughout Jamaica.
For crop cultivation, the following products are of significance in the investigation area:
Fruits:                  mangoes, bananas, ackee, cashew nuts
Particularly for export:  papayas and otaheite apples
Vegetables:              corn, cabbage, tomatoes, onions, potatoes, beans, peas, soya
beans- avocadoes, cassava, yams
Particularly for export:  peppers, callaloo and sugar cane
A high proportion of the agricultural products produced in this region are sold directly in local
markets.
A further economic factor in food production of great significance for this region is
represented by fish raising in inland fish farms.
3.5   ECOLOGY
Fauna and flora
The investigation area around Old Harbour Bay belongs topographically to the largest expanse
of plains in Jamaica (Plains of St. Catherine, Clarendon Plains). It covers a coastal zone
consisting primarily of wetlands, in particular mangrove swamps, or gravelly seashore areas.
Only a minor proportion of the animals and plants living in the investigation area are wild
species, and typical of the natural habitats prevailing here, as these huge plains belong to the
regions of Jamaica used for intensive agriculture.



Jamaica Public Service Company                                 December 12. 1994
Old Harbour Power Station                                               Page (114)
Characteristic for the fragility and the value of a landscape is, among other things, its
classification and official designation as a special protection zone.
Thus, for the extended area "Portland Bight and Ridge National Park" its classification as at
national park has been proposed.
Future implementation of this recommendation to classify this region as a national park is
expected, in particular due to its valuable wetlands along the coast - the mangrove swamps -
and the great diversity of the associated animal life.
Furthermore, the Nature Conservation Reserve/Wildlife Sanctuary hasselected specific coastal
water zones of Jamaica and classified these as particularly valuable. These coastal waters
are consequently awarded the status of "fish nurseries", and included in these is Old Harbour
Bay.
Wild Animals and Plants (Typical Species of the Country)
As already noted, the investigation area is part of an extensive connected region with a very
flat topography in the south of Jamaica. The landscape zones represented in the coastal area
consist to a large part of wetlands of high ecological value, the mangrove swamps.
In the region of Portland Bight, the following three types of natural environment are principally
represented:
*     mangrove woodland;
*     cultivated pasture and secondary growth scrub; and,
*    dry limestone scrub forest.
No complete surveys are currently available of the animals and plants indigenous to these
natural environments. However, the Conservation Data Centre of the University of the West
Indies in Kingston is currently undertaking a very detailed survey of all animal and plant
species occurring in Jamaica and is cataloguing these in a database with the help of computer
software they have developed themselves. So, in the future, it should be possible to obtain
precise information on animal and plant species for any desired region in Jamaica. On the
basis of this data, also then information will be available to permit pronouncements on the
rarity of animal and plant species and the degree to which they are at risk, as well as other
parameters of ecological concern.
Table 3.3 lists some of the dominant plant species in the wetlands of the parishes of
St. Catherine and Clarendon.

When considered overall, the animals and plants indigenous to Jamaica - like in other regions
in the Caribbean - are extremely rich and valuable. They also represent an important aspect
for promoting tourism.
Regarding wild animal species, the wide variety of birds in the wetlands in the coastal area
is worthy of particular mention. But also the mangrove swamps and forests offer excellent
habitats to other animal species, some of which are rare. During a trip through these
wetlands of very high ecological value, the visitor is particularly aware, among other things,
of the many types of small insects, dragonflies and large butter flies. Also a small number of
crocodiles are said to live here.
Many of the wild animal and plant species are endangered by human influences or
environmental pollution, and their numbers have been greatly reduced, or they are threatened
with extinction. This applies to all of Jamaica's natural ecological systems, but in particular
the natural ranges in the coastal area, the wetlands.
The chief threats to natural animal and plant life are extensive and intensive agriculture, the
increasing development of land for settlement, hunting of certain species, and also industry,
as well as environmental pollution originating in urban zones. All of these likewise apply to
the ecological systems in the investigation area around the location of Old Harbour Power
Station.

3.6 THE HUMAN ENVIRONMENT
Land Use and Population
The investigation area around the power plant features very mixed anthropogenic uses. Most
of the land area is used for agriculture. The second very significant utilization is in the form
of settlements which on the one hand are distributed as many small dwelling units - particular
along the coast - throughout the entire area, and, on the other hand, the towns:
Old Harbour and Old Harbour Bay (Parish of St. Catherine), as well as,
Freetown (Parish of Clarendon).
Table 3.4 shows a summary of the development of the populations in defined regions of the
investigation area.

There are no current official figures for the actual population in the investigation area as a
whole. In particular along the coastal strip around Old Harbour Bay, many people live illegally
as squatters, which means that they have themselves erected simple dwellings and their
domiciles are not registered with the local authorities.
The Town Planning Department in Kingston has no intention to allow further settlement along
the coast in this region, as it lies within a flood zone and has already often been flooded.
Consequently the authorities have set the objective in future planning of permitting no new
settlements in areas below an elevation of ten feet, referred to sea level. Nevertheless, it is
to be expected that also in the future the population will continue to grow due to people
moving into the area, even in zones whose elevation is below ten feet.

For the above reason, new construction projects which are officially planned and whose
construction is pending are located in the northern part of the investigation area, which border
this. According to the Town Planning Department, to the northwest of the town of Old
Harbour, the new Clairmont Housing Development, comprising some five hundred houses is
to be erected, and further projects are planned to the east of Old Harbour in Marille Mount,
and Church Pen, with an area sufficient for 600 - 800 new inhabitants, as well as further to
the southeast around Bushy Park with about one hundred new houses averaging 4.2
inhabitants per unit.
Currently the population density in this region is some 30 inhabitants per acre in 'normal
density housing". On the basis of current town development plans in future in the region of
Old Harbour, the population density will tend more to "high density housing" with 40 - 50
inhabitants per acre.
Overall, the investigation area with its projected increase in inhabitants, which is appreciably
over the natural net population growth (births minus deaths) of 21.7 per thousand inhabitants,
has to be reclassified as a region with above average population growth ( data from 1982 of
the Planning Institute - Economic and Social Survey).
According to the Statistical Yearbook of Jamaica of 1980, in 1970 the average population
density of the parishes St. Catherine and Clarendon was in the region of 135 to 175 per km2.
In comparison, the average population density of Jamaica in 1982 was 205 per km2, that of
the Caribbean region 130, Central America 40, and North America 12, inhabitants per km2.
From all of this data it is clear that the investigation area is tending towards being heavily
populated, with an upward trend. According to a rough estimate, it may be assumed that
currently some 70,000 - 75,000 people live in the entire investigation area.
When considering the health of the people living in the investigation area, it is not possible to
make any definitive statements, as appropriately differentiated data - referred to region or
domicile - are not available, and are also not collected by the responsible Health Department.
In this connection, health statistics might be of interest which permit comparison on a regional
basis between a heavily industrialized area in Jamaica with areas in which the air is clean.
In particular data on the frequency of illnesses of the respiratory tract would be of
significance.  However, sL-th figures are not available.  It has also to be noted that
interpretation of such data permit only very unsure conclusions to be drawn, as it is only
possible to establish with certainty the connection of cause and effect rare cases.
Table 3.5 contains an excerpt of available data of the illnesses registered with the Medical
Health Centre in Spanish Town (parish of St. Catherine).

Cultural Assets and Property
Impacts of relevance to the environment of a thermal, oil-fired plant as represented by Old
Harbour Power Station may arise primarily due to sulphur dioxide contained in the flue gas.
In combination with humidity this forms sulphuric acid which is particularly aggressive to the
masonry of older building and over prolonged periods can lead to permanent surface changes,
up to he point of structural damage.
Such environmental influences are especially significant for historic buildings and cultural
monuments. Consequently, within the investigation area, it is particularly important to
consider cultural monuments and old buildings, as their preservation under the aspect of the
conservation of historical monuments has a high priority.
The Bushy Park Aqueduct is included in the list of National Monuments of the Jamaica
National Heritage Trust, and thus represents a historic structure counting as a Jamaica
Cultural Asset which should be preserved. This is included in the map of the region and
marked with a star, see Map 5.2 of the investigation area. According to the Jamaica National
Heritage Trust, this is a structure of only limited extent, totalling less than half a mile (less
than 800 m). This aqueduct was erected between 1760 and 1780 for supplying water.
3.7   NATURAL HAZARDS
Two references on the vulnerability of the Old Harbour site to earthquakes are:
*     Seismic Risk Analysis, 1979, by Faccioli & Taylor; and,
*     Earthquake Hazard Map, 1984, by The Geological Survey Division, Government of
Jamaica.



Jamaica Public Service Company                                 December 12, 1994
Old Harbour Power Station                                               Page (19)
The Seismic Risk Analysis performed by Faccioli & Taylor was commissioned by JPS for the
purpose of informing the company's management concerning the probability of serious
damage to the Old Harbour & Hunts' day facilities, due to liquefaction, in the event of a major
earthquake.
The conclusions reached by Faccioli & Taylor are quoted below as follows:
a)    because of the predominant grain-size composition of the in-situ soils, the occurrence
of large-scale liquefaction is unlikely both at Hunts Bay and at Old Harbour. Most of
the sandy materials for which grain-size curves are available appear in fact either
reasonably well graded or possessing a high content of fines; and,
b)    At Old Harbour, the situation appears more favourable since scattered evidence of
relatively uniform medium-fine sands is found only in two cases out of a total of 21
grain-size curves.
Hurricanes are a constant threat to Jamaica, which cause damage to structures in coastal
areas due to high wind speeds, high waves, and flooding.
The Geological Survey Division's 1984 Tropical Cyclone Hazard Assessment indicates that
coastal areas on the south and north coasts are considered to have "Destructive Storm Surge
Potential".
Ground floor levels inside the existing powerhouses at Old Harbour are about 3 m above mean
sea level and ground levels on the driveways and pave areas around the building only around
+ 2.5 m. Jamaica has seen two major hurricanes in recent years (Allen in 1 9890 and Gilbert
in 1988); yet there has been no serious flooding of the power station facilities since the plant
was built.

4.0 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
4.1   AIR QUALITY
4.1.1 Emissions from Old Harbour Power Station
In connection with the survey of baseline data, Fichtner conducted in Jamaica a program of
emissions measurements lasting for one week during November 1993. in order to collect data
on environmentally relevant emissions parameters with respect to sulphur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides and carbon monoxide. At the time of the measurements, Unit 1 had been taken out
of operation for an overhaul of its generator. Measurements therefore could only be
conducted at Units 2, 3 and 4. Flue gases are discharged separately from each generating
unit from 150 ft. (approximately 46 m} high stacks.
Measurements were carried out when each unit was operated close to the full load point. Due
to the power demand from the electricity grid, it was not possible to vary the load. In order
to obtain information, despite this fact, on the behaviour of the firing systems, excess air
ratios were varied for a given firing rate.
In order to be able to assess the condition of the regenerative air preheater, flue gas
measurements were conducted on both the hot and the cold gas sides. Where several sample
extraction tappings were available on the cold gas side, several measurements were
conducted.
For measurement of flue gas, the Testotherm measuring system Testo 331339 with computer
adapter was used. This system consists essentially of:
heated sampling hose with filter insert;
*     measuring gas cooler and condensate trap;
*     nmeasuring unit with gas sensors; and,
*     evaluation unit.
The results from the evaluation unit were transmitted at intervals of 5 seconds via an interface
to a computer, in order to perform calculations and graphic evaluations.
The gas sensors operate according to the principle of the electro-chemical cell. An electrical
signal is generated proportional to gas concentration. This technique does not require
calibration on the basis of test gases. The zeropoint is set using ambient air and the
sensitivity of the device is defined by the laws of electro-chemistry. In comparison to
conventional gas measurements on the basis of infrared and ultraviolet techniques, the
accuracy is not quite as good, but the measuring systems can be built more compactly. For
determination of baseline data, as for this case, the accuracy of electro-chemical measuring
systems may certainly be considered as adequate.

The Testotherm measuring system covers parameters as follows:
*      flue gas temperature;
*      oxygen (02);
*     carbon monoxide (CO);
*     sulphur dioxide (SO2);
nitrogen monoxide (NO); and,
*      nitrogen dioxide (NO2).
In order to measure flue gas opacity, a Brilon smoke spot number tester was employed.
Measurement of smoke spot number was in accordance with the standard DIN 51402 Part 1.
In this method a defined amount of flue gas was drawn through filter paper and the resulting
spot of soot is compared visually with a comparison scale. The comparison scale ranges
from 0 (free of dust and soot with light reflection of 100%) up to 9 (very high soot content,
black) via graded shades of grey.
Table 4.1 below shows the averages of all measured pollutants.

The flue gas flows given in table 4.1 are based on combustion calculations. Together with
the ash content of the fuel oil (see table 4.2) it is possible to estimate the dust content of the
flue gases. Based on an average ash content in the fuel oil of 0.1 55% and 1 1.54 m3 flue gas
pcr kg fuel oil the dust content is approximately 134 mg/m3 (STP, dry. 3% 02).
Fuel Oil and Ash
To provide a reference for the flue gas measurements, two fuel oil samples were taken and
analyzed. Table 4.2 shows the results of the analyses.

The most important values are the ash content and the content of vanadium and nickel. Both
values are relatively high for fuel oils of this type. The vanadium content aids in the formation
of sulphur trioxide (SO,) in significant amounts which can cause corrosion problems in the flue
gas path of the plant and give rise to sulphuric acid droplets (H2SOJ in the flue gas.
The dust content of the flue gases is caused mainly by the ash of the fuel oil. More than 95%
of the fuel oil ash is carried out with the flue gas. Table 4.3 compares the composition of fuel
oil ash and boiler deposits. Most of the components are in the same proportions.
To gain some idea of the composition of the deposits in the air heater it is possible to make
an estimate on the basis of the original oil ash composition. This shows vanadium as main
component, together with nickel, aluminum, iron and calc.um.

The emissions of dust are distributed in the vicinity of the power station. The resulting
ground-level concentrations depend on wind speed and direction. The closest point where
airborne particulates were measured was at Bodies agriculture station, in 1992.

An excerpt from these measurements is compared with the fuel ash data in Table 4.4. Based
on the degree of "dilution' of the fuel ash, an attempt is made to determine the most
important impact species.

This comparison shows that vanadium and nickel have the greatest impact on particulate
composition. Other components arise from other sources. The variation of the vanadium
content needs verification against wind data to determine the impact of Old Harbour Power
Station on air quality at Bodies.
Unfortunately there was no possibility to obtain data to cover this time period, because a fire
in the meteorological office had destroyed many of the records.

Maintenance and repairs
Systematic preventive maintenance is made more difficult by the non-availability of spare
parts for older plant components and the high power plant utilization factor. Moreover,
investments are preferred in components which bring about operational savings.
The general technical condition of the plant components was considered satisfactory by
Fichtner, although improvements were desirable in the following:
*     soot blowers;
*     air preheaters;
*     boiler pressure-part system;
*     instrumentation and control; and.
*     measures for industrial health and safety.
4.1.2 Air Emissions from Barge
Preliminary information provided on the barge emissions was as follows:

Specific fuel consumption (glkWh)           181.6
Exhaust gas quantity (kg(s)                 18.2
Stack exhaust diameter (mm)                 1,100

Stack height                                36.58
* Net engine-generator output = 8,655 kW
The fuel is expected to be No. 6 fuel oil with 2.2% sulphur content. The total SO, emissions
from the JEP barge are estimated to be 17.1 tons per day.

4.1.3 Air Dispersion Modelling
The air dispersion modelling was completed for JPS by KBN Engineering Ltd. the model used
was the simple terrain EPA type I SCST2, Version 93109.
Stack input data was provided by JPS and emission data for the barge facility was taken from
the preliminary EA report.
Meteorological information was based on one year of data (19901 obtained from the Norman
Manley International Airport in Kingston. This was pre-processed and included surface
observations, as well as twice daily upper air soundings.
The model assumed units operating at 100% load under a number of scenarios. The fuel for
the main power plant was assumed to be 3% sulphur content and additional runs were
completed for a lower 2.2% sulphur fuel to determine reduction in impacts. Also used in the
model runs was a variation of stack height for Unit 4 which is undergoing restoration. Some
computer runs used the current stack height of 46 m and others assumed a new stack of
60 m height to determine if increasing the stack height would improve ambient conditions.
4.1.4 Results of Air Dispersion Modelling
The maximum ground level concentrations for the different computer model runs are shown
in Tables 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8; the isopleths for SO2 and NOx are shown on Figures 4.1 to 4.4.
Sulphur Dioxide
For S02 levels it can be seen from Table 4.6 that the 4 units of Old Harbour Power Station
exceed World Bank and NRCA ambient air quality standards (2nd line) using 3%S fuel. It can
also be seen that the barge facility does not appreciably increase the maximum S0,
concentrations (3rd line).
Major improvements in ground leverl concentrations occur once Units 1 and 2 are retired
(compare 8th line to 5th line where each use 2.2%S fuel).
Figure 4.1 provides the isopleths of ground level 24 hour maximum SO, concentrations based
on all 4 units of the plant operating on 3% sulphur fuel with the new barge facility on line.
This is the worst case scenario. The major impacts exist to the west of the plant in an
unpopulated area along the coastline, south of Kellys Pen. Agricultural production includes
sugar cane which is grown to the north, in areas where NRCA standards for S02 are
essentially met.
The town of Old Harbour Bay will see S02 levels which will meet NRCA standards for the 24
hour averages. The old World Bank standards of 500 pglmJ will also be met but the new,
more stringent standard of 125 uglm3 will be exceeded.



Jamaica Public Service Company                                December 12, 1994
Old Harbour Power Station                                              Page (27)
Figure 4.2 shows the predicted maximum 24 hour SO2 levels for Units 1 and 2 retired
assuming a lower 2.2%S fuel. Under that scenario, NRCA and the old World Bank standards
will essentially be met. The new World Bank standards will be exceeded.
On the basis of the analysis, given the pending retirement of 2 units within the next five
years, and the area of maximum impact being non-populated, no change in stack height for
Unit 4 or a change to a lower sulphur fuel is recommended.
Nitrogen Oxide
In the computer model prediction (Table 4.7), NOx is not a problem with the existing plant
(2nd line). NOx is a concern with the barge facility (3rd line) as it exceeds both NRCA and
World Bank objectives. The isopleths showing the area of impact are shown on Figures 4.3
plus the barge operating for all 4 units, and 4.4 for Units 3 and 4 operating with the barge
(after retiring Units 1 and 2). The barge developer has indicated that only 10-25% of the total
NOx produced in NO., which is of the most concern. This will be further addressed in the EA
for the barge facility.
Particulates
Modelling of particulate emissions (Table 4.8) shows that they meet NRCA and World Bank
objectives for the existing plant with the barge.
4.2 WASTEWATER DISCHARGES
The major wastewater emissions of Old Harbour Power Station are:
*     Condenser cooling water
-     Regeneration effluent from the demineralization plant
?     Reverse osmosis concentrate
*     Boiler blowndown
*     Effluent form the boiler/air heater washing
*     Site runoff
The proposed barge will a have cooling water discharge as well as treated sump drainage.
These will be discharged to the existing plant's discharge canal.

4.2.1 Sampling of Plant Effluent
With the power plant in operation, Fichtner took water samples as follows:
*     cooling water (coarsely-screened seawater);
*     well water;
z   *  filtered well water;
*     concentrate form reverse osmosis;
*     permeate from reverse osmosis (partly demineralized water);
*     regeneration effluent from the demineralization plant; and,
*     boiler water.Because insufficient notice was given, it was not possible to take samples
of the air preheater wash. Nevertheless, at the end of the investigation period it was
possible to take an ash sample from Unit 4, which did give indications on the possible
composition of a wastewater stream.
In order to achieve a representative sample, water samples must be extracted from a flowing
process stream. If this is not homogenous, several sub-samples have to be added together
to form a composite sample. The size of these sub-samples must correspond to the flow
proportions of the process stream. Such sampling ensures that the composite will correspond
to the average of the process stream. This procedure has to be applied, for example, when
sampling regeneration effluent flows from the demineralizatien plant.
If the sample is analyzed straight away, no measures for its preservation are required. If
lengthy storage or transportation times are necessary, the following procedures, among
others. may be adopted:
*     cooling/freezing (analysis of "organic parameters", e.g., BOD, COD); and,
*    acidification with nitric acid (analysis for heavy metals).
Preservation can change the composition of the samples, which means careful selection of
the parameters to be determined is necessary in order to eliminate incorrect values for
constituents.
The principal analyses which were undertaken are described briefly below.
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)
A defined quantity of the water sample is evaporated and the residue dried at 105°C. This
quantity depends on the content of dissolved salts in the water. At least 40 mg of residues
is required for accurate weight determination.
Conductivity
In order to determine conductivity, an AC voltage is applied to the water sample in an
electrolytic cell. The higher the content of electrolytes, the greater is the resulting current.
This parameter can be measured using an immersed electrodes or with through-flow

electrodes. For low conductivities as encountered in the boiler waterlsteam circuit in power
plants, only through flow electrodes can be used, as air contact will immediately strongly
influence the measuring result.  When measuring wellwater or surface as well as
wastewaters, measurement employing immersed electrodes is common. Conductivity is a
parameter which can be determined rapidly, and permits conclusions to be drawn on the
content of total dissolved solids. However, only for low concentrations is this relationship
nearly linear.
pH
pH is determined using special electrodes which convert the activity of hydronium ions (H301
to an electrical signal. The electrode-measuring amplifier combination has to be calibrated
with buffer solutions before undertaking actual measurements. Electrodes are designed both
as immersed and through-flow types.
For these measurements, a WVTW LF 96 pocket pH meter with immersed electrodes was
employed.
Analyses for heavy metals were undertaken employing the following methods:
Photometric
Determinations of heavy metal contents photometrically was carried out using analysis kits
supplied by E. Merck, Darrnstadt/Germany. For this purpose, chemical reagents were mixed
with the sample which combined with a certain heavy metal to form a coloured compound
whose quantity could be determined using a photometer.
Each analysis kit is specific for one heavy rmetal, depending on the nature of the reagents and
how the analysis is undertaken.
Spectrometric
Spectrometric investigations are carried out by means of atom absorption spectrometers
(AAS) and  inductive coupled  plasmaspectrometers (ICP).   Following  preparation
(decomposition, filtration), for both methods the specimen is sprayed as a jet and thermally
excited in a flame.
For the AAS method this is a gas flame at about 1 ,200°C and for ICP a plasma generated by
electromagnetic radiation at 8,000°C is used.
In the case of the AAS, the flame is through-illuminated by a lamp which contains a certain
element and emits a certain wavelength in a defined direction. This is absorbed by atoms
contained in the flame and re-transmitted in random directions. This means that the intensity
of the light beam emitted by the lamp is attenuated. The greater the number of atoms of the
element to be determined there are in the flame, that is in the sample, the greater is the

attenuation of the light signal. Light intensity is registered in a receiver and the signal
conditioned for analysis purposes.
In the case of ICP, the specimen is heated to the point at which the atoms lose their valence
electrons and "internal" electrons are excited to emit electromagnetic radiation. The
wavelength of this radiation is specific for each element. The light emitted by the plasma is
separated into individual wavelengths by a monochromator. This technique permits the entire
spectral range to be scanned using a sequential ICP, or up to 25 elements may be registered
simultaneously, using a simultaneous ICP
Water Treatment Plant Effluents
The water treatment plant treats raw water to boiler specifications, but there are a number
of blowdown stages which produce wastewater.
The water treatment plant operates using well water as raw water. An explanation of the
treatment process is provided. This plant consists of the following process stages:
-     activated carbon filtration:
-     reverse osmosis; and,
demineralization.
The carbon filtration equipment consists of three lines each with an activated carbon filter.
It serves as a pre-filtration stage for removal of organics prior to reverse osmosis-
The subsequent reverse osmosis installation consists of 2 lines which have been operating for
7 years. In one of these lines, after some 6 years, the membrane modules were replaced.
This installation was added after the original construction of the power plant, because due to
its high feedwater requirement, capacity problems arose in the demineralization plant. The
salt content of the raw water is reduced by some 80%. thus extending the service run of the
subsequent demineralization plant. Operation of the reverse osmosis equipment brings about
a substantial reduction in the consumption of chemicals of the subsequent demineralization
plant, although there is no change in the chemicals use per regeneration run. The reverse
osmosis equipment operates continuously and generates a wastewater stream which is
discharged directly into the power plant cooling water outflow. This wastewater stream
contains a concentration of salt which is some 3 to 4 times that of the raw water and has a
neutral pH. Because in comparison the salinity seawater is around ten times as much, there
is no objection to the discharge of this wastewater.
The partially demineralized water from the RO equipment is then treated in the
demineralization plant in order to attain the required purity for power plant operation.
The demineralization plant consists of three lines each containing:
*     cation exchangers;
*     anion exchangers; and,
*     mixed-bed filters.



Jamaica Public Service Company                                  December 12. 1994

Cation and anion exchangers operate according to the co-current regeneration, flow through
the equipment is in the same direction. The cations and anions dissolved in the water are
retained in the exchanger resins. The water coming from the cation exchangers is directed
through a tray-type deaerator for stripping of carbon dioxide. This relieves the load on the
following anion exchanger. Once the 'anchor groups ' required for this process are occupied,
the capacity of the ion exchanger is exhausted. The installation is so designed that first the
cation filter becomes exhausted. This brings about an increase in conductivity downstream
of the anion filter, which is used as a signal for shutdown of the exchanger line.
The final mixed-bed filter serves as polishing filter and ensures the quality of the
demineralization water.  Monitoring of this installation is by means of conductivity
measurements.
For resin regeneration, during normal operation only the cation and anion filters are
regenerated. The mixed bed filter is seldom regenerated. as it experiences hardly any loading.
The demineralization lines achieve operating periods of three to four days between
regeneration runs. At present, wastewater from regeneration is discharged directly into the
power plant cooling water outfall. During the regeneration run, first the pH is in a strongly
acidic range, and then in a strongly alkaline range.The wastes are collected in a neutralization
tank prior to discharge.
Storage tanks for raw water and for demineralized water are available in the power plant.
There are no buffer tanks between treatment stages. If demineralized water is required the
carbon filtration equipment, both reverse osmosis lines as well as a demineralization line are
put into operation.
The water treatment plant as a whole is in good repair. Some connections under high
pressure exhibit minor leakages, but nowhere are there any major leaks. The main problem
oS this part of the plant is the foundations, which in some locations are in a very bad state of
repair. This is particularly the case in the vicinity of the chemicals storage. At these locations
spillages of chemicals - caustic soda or sulphuric acid - are unavoidable. The new storage
tanks for these chemicals are set up in basins surrounded by bunds which means that spills
in this area can be contained. The old storage tanks are not set up in bunded basins to cover
the complete tank area.
Wastewater Sample Results
The quality of the main wastewaters from the water treatment plant depend on the raw water
treated in the plant. Tat:e 4.9 shows the results of the raw water analyses.

The final treatment stage is ion exchange.
Regeneration of the ion exchanger resins produces an effluent as shown in table 4.1 1. The
regeneration exceeds NRCA limits (see Appendix 4) for pH and salt content (total dissolved
solids). The limits for heavy metals were met. The salt content is in this case not critical,
because the salt content is lower than the sea water salt content.

The quality of boiler blowdown is shown in Table 4.12. Because of its very low salt content
only trace metals and phosphate are of interest.

There is no significant content of trace metals in the boiler blowdown. The boiler blowdown
has a very low salt content and exceeds the limits for phosphate and pH. The content of
phosphorous arises from boiler water conditioning using sodium phosphate.
All effluents from the power station are discharged to the sea. Table 4.13 shows the
analyses of the sea water. The samples were taken from a cooling water line after screening.

4.2.2 Other Wastewater Discharges
Based on the results of the wastewater analyses and experience with similar power stations
the regeneration effluent and the effluent from boiler/air heater washing are the most
important wastewaters.
During the measuring period it was not possible to get a sample of boiler/air heater washing
effluent. Based on information of JPS staff and experience with similar power stations, this
effluent will contain large amounts of suspended solids and heavy metals from the fuel oil.
The effluent is normally treated in power stations fired with heavy oil.
Wastewater from Washing the Air Preheater
This wastewater is produced from cleaning the air preheaters during outages of each unit.
It occurs intermittently about 4 times per year per unit, or a total of 16 times. Of
environmental relevance in this case are the heavy metals, and in particular the high level of
vanadium, as well as the turbid contamination by soot and dust particles together with their
associated substances. Also characteristic of this water, due to the formation of sulphuric
acid is its low pH. which changes form strongly acidic (pH < 1) at the start of cleaning to
slightly acidic up to neutral (pH about 6.51 at the conclusion of cleaning.
Wastewater from Boiler Cleaning (Boiler Wash Water)
Supplementary to coarse mechanical cleaning of the boilers carried out about once per year
per unit, fine cleaning of the boiler system is undertaken with water, whose characteristics
at discharge may be compared with the washing effluents of the air preheater.
Further Wastewaters from Cleaning
During routine power plant operation, further diverse wastewaters occur intermittently from
cleaning the various power plant components. Like the washing water from the air preheater
and the boiler, these are discharged untreated into the Caribbean. No results of investigations
into the composition of these water flows are available , but it may be assumed that in the
majority of cases they will contain mineral oil hydrocarbons.
Condensate Wastewater from Heated Oil Pipelines
During the site visits to Jamaica, when inspecting the power plant property, members of
Fichtner's staff noticed leaks of the steam-heated oil pipelines at various locations. The
condensate so formed seeps through in part heavily contaminated subsoil or flows by way of
drains with their content of oil residues as polluted water into Old Harbour Bay.

Surface Run-off from Power Plant Site
Surface rainwater run-off in some cases form torrential downpours presents the same
problems as for condensate wastewaters. Rain water collects within a short time on the hard
surfaced areas of the power plant property, which due to contact with oil-polluted materials
and residues of chemical - stored mainly in the open results in a wastewater whose
composition and quantity can be assessed only with difficulty. An oil water separator is
present which removes gross oil quantities from runoff.
4.2.3 Barge Effluents
Barge effluents consist of cooling water from the engines and drainage from sumps. The
cooling water discharge will be piped to the existing cooling water channel to mix with the
thermal plant effluent. The oily water will be treated by oil-water separators and dissolved air
flotation prior to discharge.
4.2.4 Cooling Waters
Condenser cooling water is discharged via a man-made channel to the Caribbean Sea. The
new barge facility will also discharge to this channel.
The discharge of the cooling water was modelled to provide a prediction of the area of the
mixing zone. Two scenarios were run to predict the dispersion of the heated effluent from
the Old Harbour Power plant. The assumptions and ambient and effluent conditions that were
used for the model runs are outlined below. These assumptions are based an information
provided by JPS, on preliminary information provided by Wartsila, and on estimations taken
during the site visit. The data includes all four thermal units operating plus the Wartsila power
barge.

The model used for the predictions was CORMIX v3.0 obtained from Cornell University and
recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency.
In the two runs the only variations were the wind speed and the heat coefficient. In model
run JPS1 the wind speed was 2 rn/s and the heat exchange coefficient was 20 w/m2. In
model run JPS2 the wind speed was 10 m/s and the heat exchange coefficient was 54 wIm2.
In both model runs the water quality object for temperature was taken to be an increase of
3C. In both the model runs the objective of a 3°C rise in temperature was met within 30 m
from shore. This is a relatively limited area of impact.
It is proposed by JPS to install an on-line recirculating ball condenser cleaning system to
improve thermal efficiencies. This will not have a detrimental environmental effect on the
discharge but will lower air emissions by reducing fuel consumption.
4.2.5 Summary of Effects the Water Path on the Environment
The operation of Old Harbour Power Station involves many wastewater o,schargas as well as
extraction of sea water and discharge of cooling water, to influence the Caribbean Sea and
its ecology. Table 4.14 lists these wastewater sources and the resulting anr:ual loadings
together with their environmentally relevant parameters. This provides the basis for assessing
how critical these flows are to the environment. Treatment of the air preheater and boiler
wash waters will significantly improve effluent discharges. The cost of this will be in the
order of $0.5 - 0.8 million U.S. A suitable treatment process is provided in Appendix 6.

4.3 NOISE EMISSIONS
Operation of any power plant will give rise to noise emissions, chiefly from running machinery
and equipment such as fans (ventilators, ID fans), pumps, the feedwater treatment plant and
from air-operated valves as well as noise due to turbines and generators.
Some of the noise-emitting plant components are in the open, but also sources within power
plant buildings make a substantial contribution to noise emissions from Old Harbour Power
Station due to their high noise level. There is no information or figures on the relevant noise
levels in the power plant nor on prevailing noise levels in its vicinity.
Power barges similar to that proposed have been field measured and meet the World Bank
requirements for noise.
The remoteness of the site from the nearest community will act as a buffer to mitigate noise.
4.4 LAND USE IMPACTS
Chemical Storage Area
The chemicals and consumables required in the power plant, such as:
- fuel oil additives
- sodium phosphate
- hydrochloric acid
- ion exchanger resins
- lubricants
are, in part, stored in the open, as there is not enough space in the present storage area.
During the plant inspections, it was not noted that the oil additives were secured in 2001
drums, large numbers (more than twenty) of which are stored at various locations on the
property. Moreover, a large quantity of hydrochloric acid is likewise stored in drums in the
open air. Although subsequently labelled "HCI", there are no notices which are clearly visible
from a distance warning of potential hazards. However, the construction of a new building
is included in the plans for the power plant. The environmental impacts resulting from the
above operation conditions are primarily contamination which enters the ecology by way of
water path.
In general it may be stated that current practices of storing water-hazardous substances on
the power plant site could be substantially improved for a relatively low capital cost and

expenditure of effort. At the same time this would greatly benefit the environment, and in
particular long-term protection of land and coastal waters.
A new chemical storage building should be erected. It should be designed for secure
containment so that any spills will be retained. The storage should be segregated into zones
to separate incompatible or reactive chemicals from each other. A system of inventory
management of chemicals which are brought in and taken out should be instigated. The
building should also accommodate waste chemicals prior to shipment. The building should
be securely locked with access limited to authorized personnel.
Fuel Handling and Storage
From the oil unloading wharf in the port, there are two oil pipelines running aloog the sea floor
to the power plant storage tanks. One of these has been taken out of service. If a Texaco
ship is already occupying the unloading wharf, JPS has to have their own ship unloaded at
another location and transport the oil to the storage tank in the port by road tanker. This
complicated handling procedure will inevitably involve an enhanced danger of contaminating
the environment with oil. Also there is a greater danger of overfilling the day tank at the
power plant when using road transport, as then the filling level check is not very exact JPS
points out that the storage tanks at the power plant have not been cleaned since their
erection, with the oldest tank dating from 1968. The reason for this is that the oil pipelines
are not redundant and consequently taking individual oil tanks out of service is virtually
impossible. JPS has already prepared drawings for extending the oil transportation pipelines.
see Appendix 3. This would then enable maintenance to be performed on individual isolating
valves and pipeline sections. With the exception of lubrication of valve stems, up to now no
maintenance has been undertaken at the valves in the oil pipelines. According to JPS some
valves are welded into the pipelines, which renders their repair difficult.
For the oil pumping station of Unit 2 boiler, spare parts for the seals are no longer available
on the market. For this reason, JPS has already invited bids for complete replacement of the
pumps. Some gaskets have already been replaced by tube fittings. If gaskets fail they release
large quantities of oil into the surroundings, whereas the failure of tube fitting seals would
result only in oil drips.
Site Contamination
Furthermore, it has to be assumed that over the approximately 25 years of its use, persistent
subsoil contamination of the power plant property - or at least parts of this - has occurred.
This is evident in the area of the tank farm and along the oil transfer pipeline route.
Investigations should be made into the necessity to undertake suitable remediation measures,
for example replacement of soils in those parts of the power plant property which are heavily
contaminated with mineral oil hydrocarbons.

An estimate of cost for removal of contaminated soil, incineration at the local cement plant.
and backfilling with clean fill is $0.25 - 0.4 million U.S.
Spill Containment
In the oil storage area, the bunded spillage-retention basins of the storage tank should be
rendered impermeable to prevent oil penetrating through to the soil. The impermeable
retention basins should be isolated by shut-off valves during normal operation. If they become
full of rainwater, this will have to be pumped out and directed through an oil trap. During
rainstorms, which can be heavy in this area, the capacity of the retention basin may be used
as a buffer. For this purpose a pipeline should be installed from the storage area to the
existing oil trap. This should be corrosion-resistant glass fibre-reinforced resin. The pump has
to be of slow-speed design, so that the oil will not emulsify as static oil traps cannot separate
an emulsified oil/water mixture.
Pipeline trenches, which already protect parts of the oil lines, should be extended un to the
storage area so that the entire range is covered. These should slope down to the existing oil
trap to permit drainage oily water (rainwater and heating condensate). If this is not possible,
pump sumps shall be provided and the water will have to be pumped out. In order to avoid
flooding and contamination, it is advisable to cover the line routes. To prevent build-up of
condensed water which could promote corrosion of piping from the outside, adequate
ventilation has to be ensured.
The approximate cost for spill containment measures is estimated at $0.5 - 0.75 million U.S.
4.5 ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS
4.5.1 Aquatic Impacts
Impacts via the Water Path on Environment
During power plant operation, wastewatersare produced both continuously and intermittently.
These are discharged through a channel into Old Harbour Bay, which means directly into the
Caribbean Sea.
The four power plant (Units 1 - 4) are cooled with sea water, as will be the barge. No further
conditioning chemicals are admixed with the sea water. After flowing through the cooling
circuit, the cooling water is returned at a maximum temperature of 40'C directly to the
Caribbean Sea via the discharge channel.
The assessment makes clear that in particular wastewaters from air preheaters and boilers
possess a high environmental relevance for emissions of vanadium and nickel as well as



Jamaica Public Service Company                                 December 12. 1994
Old Harbour Power Station                                              Page (51)
mineral oil hydrocarbon compounds. The heavy metals vanadium and nickel tend to
accumulate in the environment, and become concentrated in plants and animals. Due to
intensive fishing in Old Harbour Bay it may be assumed that there will be a transfer of heavy
metals at levels which over the long term can lead to a build-up in human tissues, and for
which it is no longer possible to exclude adverse effects on health.
Fuel Oil Transport and Storage
A further point of significance for the maritime environment of the investigation area is the
route of a twin pipeline, 1.3 km long, in the coastal waters between Port Esquivel and Old
Harbour Power Station. The pipeline comes ashore in the vicinity of Old Harbour Power
Station. This serves for supplying the power plant with fuel oil. It is constructed as a double
pipeline. One pipeline was installed at the time the power plant commenced operation and
in 1987 this was taken out operation. A second pipeline was installed in 1986 and since then
this has supplied the power plant. Oil pumping into the power plant tankfarm takes place
intermittently, which means that as soon as the oil in the tankfarm drops below a specified
reserve, the storage tank is refilled through the pipeline. Even when no oil is being pumped,
the line is filled and together with the pipeline which has been taken out of service it
represents a potential hazard to the maritime environment, in particular the coastal stretch of
Portland Bay.
Fichtner was informed by JPS that the pipeline is checked by service personnel (divers) every
two to three years. This includes a check by divers of the wrappings of the two lines. Details
and written documents on the checking procedures, their precise intervals and pipeline
maintenance was not available to Fichtner, neither was the manner of installation nor the
depths of water along the pipeline route. Operation of an oil pipeline presupposes that
connection locations (flanges. coupling) as well as the pipeline itself be carefully checked on
a routine basis for leaks and corrosion.
Should damage occur, then in the worst case the complete capacity of one line -that is a
maximum of 100,000 1 oil - could pollute Portland Bay.
For the power barge, the fuel will be delivered via an undersea pipeline from a multi-buoy
mooring facility situated approximately one nautical mile (1,800 m) southwest of the barge.
The unloading mooring facility will consist of a multi-buoy tanker mooring, tanker hose
connection, and quick spill response material. The unloading facility will be built in
accordance with requirements from any local authorities. This will be described in detail in
the subsequent EA to be provided by the developer.
Potentially there is a permanent risk of oil contamination of this coastal water in the vicinity
of Old Harbour Bay. In the past, already several incidents have resulted in extensive pollution



Jamaica Public Service Company                                 December 12, 1994
Old Harbour Power Station                                              Page (52)
of waters within Portland Bight due to spillages of oil (but also of other substances) and have
consequently lead to severe damage to the sensitive coastal biotopes.
In the seventies and eighties, Portland Bight suffered several contamination of incidents
involving oil. This pollution has been caused by tankers cleaning their tanks near to the
coast - in particular in 1974 - and as a result of a leak from the Texaco Oil storage pipeline,
during which some 500 barrels of oil flowed into the Caribbean in January 1984. Due to this
oil contamination, the mangroves and seaweed which are particularly prevalent along this
section of the coast together with their ecologically very valuable fauna suffered severe
damage.
Dredging for Barge Installation
The barge will require dredging of an estimated 200,000 cubic meters of material to provide
a basin of sufficient depth adjacent to the plant. The dredged materials will be transported to
a designated dump site at sea. No dredging will be done in the area of the coral reefs.
The details of the dredging impacts are being evaluated by the developer of the barge and will
be documented with a mitigation plan in the EA, which is to be submitted in support of that
proposal.
Other impacts
A further contribution to pollution of this section of the coast is caused by the uncontrolled
disposal of sewage and wastes. As already noted, there are some squatters living in the
marginal areas around Old Harbour Bay. Within the makeshift housing, there exist neither
facilities for sewage disposal nor are wastes collected and disposed of in a proper manner.
The latter problem in particular is actually not just specific to squatters, but is general in the
poorer regions of Jamaica.
To the east of the peninsula on which the Old Harbour Power Station is located, a road form
the town of Old Harbour Bay leads to he sea and terminates at a wharf structure. Fichtner
observed an open truck which had reversed to the edge of the wharf; a mixture of
wastewater and solid wastes, whose exact constituents could not be identified, was dumped
from a large steel drum into the sea.
4.6   OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
Fichtner found that general maintenance indicates some slight deficiencies, such as oil
leakages at the burners. As the oil runs down, it wets, among other parts, the combustion
air ducts. These oil-wet areas are relatively minor and there are no cables or no other
components which could promote the propagation of a fire in the vicinity. An acute fire

Old Harbour Power Station                                              Page (53)
hazard can be excluded. At Unit 3 boiler some distorted open grid floor plates mean there is
a danger of tripping, and missing toe plates were observed. Particularly at the upper parts of
its south side, Unit 1 boiler has corroded handrails. However at some plant components,
painting work has already started.
An asbestos survey is required at the plant site prior to reconstruction to identify areas of
concern. This can be done by JPS staff.
The plant has a full time safety officer who is also responsible for training. Asbestos training
has been given to approximately 30 JPS personnel.
4.7   GENERAL EVALUATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF OLD HARBOUR
POWER STATION
The environmental impacts are summarized in Table 4.15 and subjected to a general
evaluation by Fichtner. One of the critical assessment criteria for this evaluation was to
determine the sensitivity of each of the protected resources in the investigation area. Linking
of the sensitivity of protected resources with environmental impacts as determined for the
power plant forms the basis of the concluding overall evaluation.
It is clear from the table showing the overall evaluation of the environmental impacts that the
main effects of Old Harbour Power Station on the protected resources are caused by
emissions of air pollutants as well as discharges of cooling water and wastewaters into the
Caribbean Sea.

5.0 MITIGATION MEASURES
Air emissions: The restoration of Unit 4 will not increase air emissions above those which
existed prior to the loss of the boiler. Improvements in modern controls will have a positive
effect on the emissions from Unit 4. The proposed condenser cleaning system will reduce fuel
consumption thereby reducing overall emissions. The high ambient SO2 levels will be reduced
with the planned retirement of Unit 1 in 1998 and Unit 2 in 1999. The barge developer is
researching the ratio of NO2 to NO. in the exhaust gas.
Barge facility: As part of the EIA requirement for the barge. the developer of the will prepare
a plan to reduce the impacts from dredging; complete a study of the effects of the heated
water discharge from the combined plant; and prepare a spill contingency plan.
Wastewater effluents: The air preheater wash and boiler wash waters need to be treated by
a wastewater treatment plant. Terms of reference have been prepared to retain a consultant
for the design and specification of this facility. A process design is included in Appendix 6.
Approximate cost of this is $0.5 - 0.8 million U.S.
Site contamination: The contaminated areas of the Old Harbour site need to be remediated.
Terms of reference have been prepared to retain a consultant for the site investigation and
specification of the cleanup, by the World Bank to be financed under the proposed project.
Approximate costs are $0.25 - 0.4 million U.S.
Spill containment: Spill containment needs upgrading including :tank bunds; installation of a
secure chemical storage area and; extension of the oil transfer piping trenches. Terms of
reference have been prepared by the World Bank to retain a consulta.it to investigate, conduct
the survey and prepare specifications for construction as part of this project. Approximate
costs are $0.5 - 0.75 million U.S.
Asbestos: JPS will conduct an asbestos survey and prepare a management plan using trained
staff.
PCBs: JPS will conduct a PCB survey and prepare a management plan using trained staff.
Environmental monitoring: JPS will monitor the environmental performance of the plant. This
will include wastewater effluents, spills, contingency response, and waste chemical
management. In addition JPS will continue to do annual inspections of the under sea oil
transfer pipeline from Esquivel.
Laboratory: JPS are reconstructing the laboratory which was lost in the explosion.

WASTEWATER TREATMENT



FICHTNER
Waste Water Treatment System
- Air preheater washing and boiler cleaning wastes
(see diagram No. MQ80SOO1)
Approx. 200 m' waste water from each air preheater washing operation and
approx. 50 m' wastes from each boiler cleaning opera.ion shall be buffered
within the buffer tank.
The buffer tank shall have a capacity of approx. 280 mi'. The buffered wastes
shall be mixed by a circulating pump. The pump shall have a capacity of 100
m3/h. The circulating system shall be equipped by mixing nozzles within the
buffer tank.
The expected content of the waste water is:
- pH about 2, acidic
- suspended solids (dust, organics)
- sO,
-  heavy metals,.especially vanadium and nickel.
The treatment process as a whole is divided into steps within the buffer tank
and circulation system:
First treatment step
Mixing of different wastes by switch ON of circulating pump. Approx. 1 hour
later a sample shall be taken for laboratory testing of the mixture and
contents of chemicals to ensure the required quality.is met..
Second treatment step (removal of vanadium)
- Neutralisation to a pH up to 7
-  Flocculation
- Coagulation
- Sedimentation
- Sludge dewatering



FICHTNER
The amount which is dosed via dosing pumps is proportional to the waste water
volume within the buffer tank.
In the second treatment step, the sulphate content of the waste water is also
precipitated in the form of calcium sulphate.
After sludge dewatering from the second step, the circulating pump shall be
switched ON for the third treatment step, which is intended mainly for removal
of heavy metals and residual suspended solids.
Within the buffer tank or circulating pipe, milk of lime from the milk of lime
dosing pump is added. The amount dosed depends on the measured pH. Residual
heavy metals can best be precipitated at a pH of 9.5 and by adding flocculant
and coagulation aids.
One additional dosing station for chemicals which may be needed in the third
treatment step to remove any pollutants is not foreseen at the moment (e.g.
dosing of mercaptans or special polymers).
After final treatment in the third step the circulating pump shall be switched
OFF for sedimentation of the sludge.
After sedimentation the clarified water shall be pumped to the cooling water
outfall.



FICHTNER
Third treatment step (removal of nickel and other heavy metals)
- Alkalinization to a pH of up to 9g5
- Flocculation
-  Coagulation
- Sludge sedimentation
- Sludge dewatering
Milk of lime is dosed depending on ph into the neutralisation and
alkalinization stage.
Precipitation of heavy metals is brought about relatively rapidly by the
addition of milk of lime together with a coagulant aid and flocculant (ferric
chloride). However, it must be borne in mind that optimum precipitation ranges
for different metals lie within different pH ranges.
Some metals can be precipitated most readily in the alkaline range, whereas
for others this optimum precipitation range lies more in a neutral solution,
and an increase in pH could give rise to the metals going back into solution
to some extent.
Based on the composition of the waste water, there are two optimum precipita-
tion ranges. At the required pH value, vanadium originating from the air
preheater wash water, is precipitated.
Once the waste water is neutralised, the circulating pump shall be switched
OFF for sedimentation of the precipitated heavy metals etc.
After sedimentation the sludge shall be pumped to the sludge dewatering device.
The clear water behaving from the dewatering device of the second step shall
be recirculated to the buffer tank.
To neutralise the solution, milk of lime is added to the buffer tank or into
the circulating pipeline for the second treatment stage. Dosing is controlled
by measurement of the pH. Precise adjustment of the pH in order to precipitate
vanadium is by means of the injection of milk of lime for the third stage.
The substances precipitated, which are of a finely-dispersed to colloidal
nature, form a sediment after the addition of flocculant and coagulation aids.
