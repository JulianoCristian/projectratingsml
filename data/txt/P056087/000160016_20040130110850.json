This Amendment is being made to reflect\n            significant factors that affected the course of project\n            implementation and will have an impact on the overall\n            project outcome. These factors include (i) a substantial\n            level of systemic instability, culminating in the\n            generalized banking crisis in late 2000; (ii) a change of\n            administration in Nicaragua in January 2002, bringing about\n            a restructuring and related personnel changes at the\n            project's counterpart agency; and (iii) higher actual\n            costs for selected activities versus the original budget,\n            with specific project activities under the first two\n            components being much more costly than anticipated. Amending\n            the Credit Agreement will bring the development objectives\n            more in line with the current realities of the project, and\n            extend the project closing date to December 3 1,2004."}, "docdt": "2003-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
