ratings: the outcome was unsatisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned from the project: When\n            political risks are high, project design should be much less\n            ambitious with respect to policy reform commitments. Short\n            and medium-run costs of reforms may be unacceptable despite\n            potential long-term benefits. Lack of Borrower ownership\n            will delay project implementation and undermine outcomes.\n            Project design should not be too ambitious but based on\n            capacity on the ground. Project appraisal should include an\n            in depth analysis of financial and political risks. Public\n            information campaigns should follow, not precede, the\n            implementation of a reform and should focus on the reasons\n            for the reforms, and present realistic expectations of their\n            benefits. Having the right project coordination agency will\n            result in a better implementation experience."}, "docdt": "2005-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
