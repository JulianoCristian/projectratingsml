      support the Government's plan to create an equitable,\n            and sustainable system of old-age income security. The\n            components will: 1) implement the parametric reform of the\n            Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system, through verification of the\n            Instituto Nicaraguense de Seguro Social (INSS) database, the\n            establishment of consensus on projections, and through\n            costs' stimulation of reform options. The method for\n            recognizing acquired rights will be determined, and the\n            capacity of the INSS will be strengthened to develop\n            pension-related information systems, and administration. The\n            component will also include the design of legal, regulatory,\n            and institutional framework for a defined contribution of\n            the pension system, and that of targeted public pillars to\n            determine alternative financing, for the conversion of the\n            PAYG to a Defined Contribution (DC) system. A Public\n            awareness campaign will be developed; 2) design, and develop\n            the organizational structure, institutional by-laws, and\n            operating manuals, and procedures towards a personnel\n            training plan; and, 3) identify, and introduce new\n            insurance, and capital markets instruments for a pension\n            fund investment, by implementing a revision framework for\n            private sector participation in new pension aspects. Banking\n            and financial institutions will be strengthened within a\n            legal framework."}, "docdt": "2000-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
