adjustment program,\n            and will assist in : (i) reducing the role of the state in\n            the financial sector, (ii) strengthening the banking sector\n            and its supervisory framework, and (iii) providing resources\n            for Argentina's debt and debt service reduction\n            arrangements. The major benefits of the financial sector\n            reform include: (1) a more competitive private banking\n            system which is expected to improve resource mobilization\n            and to increase the efficiency of resource allocation, and\n            (2) fiscal and quasi-fiscal savings as a result of the\n            reduced role of public banks, including the Central Bank."}, "docdt": "1993-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
