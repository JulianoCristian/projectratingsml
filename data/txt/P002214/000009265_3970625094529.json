"The proposed Credit would finance a set\n            of activities designed to support Government's\n            agricultural sector strategy with the twin objectives of\n            stimulating agricultural production, employment and income,\n            and improving management of the sector.  It comprises two\n            distinct components which include the Gitarama Agricultural\n            Production and the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and\n            Forestry (MINAGRI) Institutional Development components. The\n            first component would be the pilot phase of a national\n            agricultural extension and agriculture service organization,\n            and of a national program for promoting private and\n            cooperative investment in agriculture, agro-processing and\n            marketing. The service systems developed on a pilot basis\n            under this component are intended as a model which would be\n            replicable at the national level if institutionally and\n            financially sustainable. The MINAGRI institutional\n            development component would strengthen the\n            institution-building process to improve agricultural sector\n            planning and management."}, "docdt": "1986-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
