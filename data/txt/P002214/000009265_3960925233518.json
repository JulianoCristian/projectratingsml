If successful, the\n            project was to establish the basis for a unified national\n            agricultural extension system. The project included four\n            components: the reorganization and strengthening of\n            extension services in Gitarama prefecture; assistance to\n            nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs) active in the\n            agricultural sector in that area; strengthening the Ministry\n            of Agriculture( MINAGRI); and a study on the development of\n            marshlands in the Nyabarongo and Akanyaru valleys. All of\n            these components were fully or substantially completed,\n            utilizing most of the credit agreement, with the exception\n            of the MINAGRI strengthening component. All of the\n            components, with the exception of the MINAGRI strengthening\n            component, were fully or substantially completed. The\n            agricultural extension system was significantly modified\n            during implementation. On-farm research was carried out but\n            by project staff only as it suffered from insufficient\n            participation from the National Agricultural Research\n            Institute (ISAR). The Nyabarongo Valley Study was completed\n            after a long delay."}, "docdt": "1992-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
