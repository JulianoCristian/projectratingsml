outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the hiring of specialized technical\n            assistance during the project design and execution stages\n            was critical to address potential challenges faced by the\n            project in terms of technical expertise. The selected\n            partner organizations had a proven track record and abundant\n            field experience regarding their respective domains of\n            expertise in conservation of archeological monuments and\n            parks and income generation activities. In sharp contrast\n            with other models of tourism development, cultural tourism\n            opened opportunities for income generation activities for\n            the poor, particularly in 'culturally reach'\n            communities. Cultural tourism enabled indigenous communities\n            to unbundle their knowledge and traditions as income\n            generation assets, demonstrating its potential as a\n            legitimate business area for the Bank and client governments\n            to move forward their poverty reduction agendas."}, "docdt": "2010-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
