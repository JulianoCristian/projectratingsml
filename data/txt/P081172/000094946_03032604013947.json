The project\n            design will take into consideration appropriate\n            environmental protection, to include as well appropriate\n            site selection for the construction works, roads, and access\n            roads rehabilitation, installation of power lines, and\n            facilities at large. The criteria for site selection should\n            take into account the national, state, and municipal\n            regulations to prevent adversity on rural lands, road\n            alignments, and land potentially prone to flooding,\n            earthquakes, or soil erosion, while existing flora and fauna\n            should be protected within its natural habitats. In\n            addition, land tenure issues that may potentially hamper\n            land acquisition due to legal problems, should be considered\n            early on, including any social issue that may arise.\n            Construction works will comply with specifications contained\n            in the bidding documents, which stipulate the following\n            activities within the project area, will be banned:\n            deforestation; fires; hunting, and/or fishing activities;\n            degradation of natural vegetation; and, damage on\n            architectural, or cultural heritage sites. Solid waste\n            disposal shall follow strict environmental regulations, to\n            be disposed of at selected landfills (located at a minimum\n            of 300 meters from rivers or wetlands), or, if lubricants,\n            oil, or metals, appropriately separated, and recycled or\n            stored in appropriate bins, respectively. Protective\n            barriers should be installed to contain soil erosion,\n            particularly along roadsides, slopes, and land excavation\n            perimeters, while continual spraying of construction\n            surfaces should control air pollution. Further mitigation\n            addresses traffic safety measures, noise abatement, public\n            awareness campaigns, and environmental monitoring, and\n            supervision activities."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
