F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The original PDO contained in the PAD was to ''achieve sustainable tourism development
based on the cultural and natural patrimony of the Copá n Valley and surrounding areas
which will, as a result, create inv estment opportunities for the p rivate secto r, foster
employment, and reduce poverty in one of the poorest regions of Honduras. This Project
will ach ieve its ob jective by supporting: (a) the creation of an ar cheological tourism
circuit integ rating three arch eological parks (Copán, El Pu ente, and Los Naranjos) and
two archeological sites (Cerro Palenque and Plan Grande); (b) ecologically sustainable
management in the three parks and two sites and surrounding areas to address negative
impacts provoked by poverty,          deforestation, erosion, a nd natural disasters; (c)
environmental education that is appropriate       to the biodiversity and the historical
characteristics of the region; (d ) capacity building for employm ent associated with
park/site development, eco/cultural guiding, an d the tourism service sector; (e) strategic
planning for tourism development am ong key community, private, and public
stakeholders; (f) acces s to training and techni cal ass istance for high-quality alternativ e
products and services provided to indigenous and locally-owned enterprises, tourism
operators, and m unicipal staff to provide bett er serv ices, generate in come and foster
longer stays, encouraging a loca l investment climate; and (g ) institutional strengthening
for cultural management and planning capacity'' (cf. PAD section A1).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 At the time of appraisal, H onduras ranked as the third poores t country in La tin America.
Approximately 65 percent of its 7.1 m illion in habitants liv ed in poverty, 45 percent lived in
extreme poverty, and it was ranked as 115 th out of 184 countries in the Hum an Developm ent
Index. Honduras was still a predom inantly rural country with about 60 percent of the population
living in ru ral areas, the vast m ajority of them in areas clas sified as h illside areas w ith limited
agricultural potential. Broad-based growth was heavily constrained by unequal asset distribution,
particularly affecting its rural population--a group with high incidence of extreme poverty.12

1.1.2 The Governm ent of Honduras (GoH) had rec ognized the need for new strategies to
promote sustainable poverty-reducing econom ic growth. There was a growing consensus am ong
experts that the agricultural sector alone--as the main economic activity--could not lift the rural
population out of poverty, and that a balanced an d integrated spatial and multi-sectoral approach
was needed. 13 In addition, GoH and experts also rec ognized the need to a ddress the loss of the
country's unique natural resources and cult       ural endow ments--two im portant sources of
economic growth to Honduras--due to deforest ation, inappropriate land use, environm ental
degradation of soil and water sources, and poor management of sites and sensitive areas.

1.1.3 In order to address the ch    allenges of a sustainable   economic growth and poverty
reduction, the GoH through the Ministry of Tourism (Instituto Hondureño de Turismo ­ IHT),
prepared a robust `Pro-poor' T ourism Developm ent Strategy that capitalized on the country's
many exceptional natural resources and unique Maya cultural legacy. It also emphasized the role
of tourism--the world' s fastest growing econo mic activity--as a m eans to generate local
employment opportunities, and tax revenue and, ultimately, contribute to poverty reduction.14

Cultural Tourism Background

1.1.4 The Archeological Park of Copán, located in th e Department de Copán, was declared a
World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980 due to its ensemble of Mayan monuments and unique
ceremonial sites--on e of the m ost im pressive arch aeological com plexes along the "Maya
Circuit."15 The ruins are the most popular archeological destination in Honduras.

   Tourism has become the third largest sector of the Honduran economy in terms of its share of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), following garment industry (maquillas) and remittances. In 2002, tourism in Honduras grew by 20
percent with more than 800,000 visitors. The GoH aim was to increase this n umber to one million visitors by 2005
and to become a regional leader in tourism by 2021. Source: IHT 2021Vision for Tourism.

   The "hieroglyphic stairway" at the Archeological Park of Copán includes the longest single glyphic text found at
any Maya site. Its first settlers established at the site during the "Early Pre Classical Period" (before 200 AC) though
some of the artifacts found at the site indicate that early settlement of Copán dates around the year 1400 BC.

1.1.5 Despite its economic potential, the Department of Copán ranked among the poorest in the
country.16

Government's 2021 Tourism Development Strategy

1.1.6 Based on its long-term Tourism Developm ent Strategy (2000-2021), IHT prepared a
comprehensive Plan of Action for 2000-2006 with the aim to boost tourism growth. 17 Its main
objective is to `prom ote and finance tourism deve lopment in support to equitable, sustainable,
and responsible growth that generates em ployment and promotes local/regional developm ent',
by: (a) enhancing infrastructure and transportation; (b) developing new destinations; (c) building
institutional partnerships at the regional and local levels; (d) creati ng opportunities for private
sector investm ent; (e) devel oping m arketing cam paigns; and (f) im plementing tourism police
units in key sites and destin ations. In the f ramework of its Plan, IHT planned to create an
"Archeological Tourist Circuit. " This strategy would be applied to Cop án--as the main cultural
tourism destination in Honduras, as well as to    other under-utilized and/or undeveloped sites
across the country with tourism potential as a way to diversify destinations.

1.2 The Rationale of World Bank Assistance

1.2.1 The Copán Project was aligned with the 2000 Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Honduras18, and incorporated in the subsequent C AS presented to the Board in June 2003. The
2000 CAS overriding priority was to set on a com prehensive pove rty reduction strategy and
social developm ent with equity. B etter integr ation between econom y a nd social policies was
seen as a critical requirem ent for the econom ic growth and sustained reduction of poverty. 19
Sustainable tourism was identified as a significant growth sect or of the econom y and a potential
alternative source of income for local communities. The Project aim ed to contribute to these key
priorities by way of: (i) gene rating income and em ployment opportunities for local populations,
(ii) im proving local investm ent clim ate for pr ivate sector developm ent, (iii) strengthening
institutional capacitie s f or better s ervices de livery, and (iv) creating an ar cheological circuit to
retain visitors and increase local revenues.

1.2.2 According to the PAD, the Bank was in a pr ivileged pos ition having gained valuable
"experience in ways to create conditions for pro-poor sustainable tourism developm ent in the
Copán Valley" particularly due to its involvem ent in two pr evious operations: the on-going
Sustainable Coastal Tourism Project, through wh ich the Bank was providing assistance to the
GoH in "reducing poverty and promoting prosperi ty through equitable eco- and heritage-based
16
   The av erage illiteracy rate i n the Department of C opán was 49 p ercent, malnutrition was 55 p ercent, and 7 5
percent of households had Unmet Basic Needs.
17
   At appraisal, t he structural is sues affecting the tourism sector development as a whole in Honduras included: (i)
lack of a long-term tourism development strategy; (ii) legal and institutional obstacles to private sector investment in
the sector; (iii) inadequate infrastructure to support tourism access (i.e., airports, roads); (iv) inadequate basic public
services (i.e., water, sanitation, solid waste management, energy supply); (v) lack of inter-institutional coordination
on tourism development; (vi) limited application of land use planning; and ( vii) low human capacity to document,
preserve and manage cultural assets.

   The 2000 CAS stressed the importance of social inclusion, particularly of women in rural areas, indigenous and
Afro-Honduras populations, which were especially disadvantaged group among the poor.

tourism", and the PROFUTURO Pr oject im plemented in Copán, "providing an opportunity to
scale-up the experience of financing several acti vities in Co pán, specif ically sm all civil work s
and capacity building". Another com parative advantage was the Bank "focus on reducing
poverty and increasing      prosperity of poor households     " by linking incom      e generating
opportunities with the tourism sector and other entry points in the local productive chains.

1.3 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.3.1 As stated in the PAD the project sought to        "achieve sustainable tourism developm ent
based on the cultural and natural patrim ony of the Copán Valley and surrounding areas which
will, as a result, create invest ment opportunities for the priv ate sector, f oster employment, and
reduce poverty in one of the poorest regions of Honduras" by supporting: (a) the creation of an
archeological tour ism circuit integra ting th ree archeological parks (Copán, El Puente, and Los
Naranjos) and two archeologica l sites (Cerro Palenque and Pl an Grande); (b) adoption of
ecologically sustainable m anagement in the thr ee parks and two sites a nd surrounding areas to
address negative im pacts provoked by poverty, defore station, erosion, and natural disasters; (c)
environmental education that is app ropriate to the biodiversity and the h istorical characteristics
of the reg ion; (d ) cap acity bu ilding f or em ployment ass ociated with park/site developm ent,
eco/cultural guiding, and the tourism        service s ector; (e) strategic pl anning for tourism
development among key community, private, and public stakeholders; (f) expanded training and
technical assistance for high-quality alternative products and services provided to indigenous and
locally-owned enterp rises, tourism operato rs, a nd m unicipal staff to improve public services,
generate income and improving lo cal investment climate; and (g) institutional strengthening for
cultural management and planning capacity (cf. PAD section A1).

1.3.2 Key Perform ance Indicators for the PDO, cite d explicitly in the PAD (section A1 and
Annex 1) to m easure impacts, were as follows: (a) average num ber of visitors increased by at
least 20 percent above the natural historic rate; (b) average length of stay increased at least by
100 percent with respect to baseline (2.6 days);      (c) level of average expenditures by tourist
increased at least 100 percent with respect to th e baseline; (d) 15 percent increase in m unicipal
revenues in the areas benefiting from the Project (expected thr ough growth in local econom ies,
employment, and increase in tax collection); (e) 5 percentage points incr ease in em ployment in
the region benefiting from Project (at least 4 percentage points fo r women, at least 6 percentage
points for men); (f) 100 percent incr ease in the num ber of s mall, local enterprises in the region
(with an increase of 35 pe rcent in indigenous enterprises) created and functioning sustainability;
(g) 100 percent increase in the num ber of hectar es under ecologically sustainable m anagement;
and (h) at least 70 percent of the visitors express satisfaction with the service received.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.4.1   The PDO remained the same and the key indicators were not changed.

1.5 Main Beneficiaries

1.5.1    The Project m ain targeted population wa s the poor, indigenous peoples and wom en in
the Department of Copán through the array of i nvestments made in public services, provision of
small grants, and capacity building activities. The Project also aimed to benefit the inhabitants of
the six municipalities where the three archeological parks and tw o sites included in the P roject
are located by contributing to local econom ic grow th related to tourism sector activities. In
addition, the Project expected to benefit the public adm inistration in Honduras through an
increase in tourism flow and revenues an         d im proving governm ent's capacity for urba n
management and archeological preservation (see Project results and th eir linkage to poverty
reduction in sections 3.2 and 3.5).

1.6 Original Components

1.6.1 The Project com prised three com ponents: (i ) Integrated Developm ent of Archeological
Parks and Sites; (ii) Income Generation Opportunities; and (iii) Institutional Development.

1.6.2 Component 1 ­ Integrated Developm ent of Archeological Parks and Sites (U S$ 7.5
million) aimed to es tablish an Arche ological Tourism Circuit linking th ree archeological parks
and two archeological sites thr ough the developm ent of m anagement plans and the provision of
key infrastructure and services. This com ponent would finance: (a) th e im plementation of the
management plan at the Archeological Park of Copán; and (b) the preparation of managem ent
plans and implem entation of investm ent priorities in the Archeological Park of El P uente, Eco-
Archeological Park of Los Naranjos, Archeologi cal Site of Cerro Palenque, and Archeological
Site of Plan Grande.

1.6.3 Component 2 ­ Incom e Generation Opportunities (US$ 1.96 m illion) o bjective was to
generate income and employm ent opportunities aim ed particularly at th e poor population living
in th e Pro ject defined area through : (a) lo cal Capacity dev elopment, skills enhan cement, and
training for staff and guides workin g in the archeological parks and sites; (b) skills developm ent
in the dom ain of tourism services delivery for lo cal residents, tourism operators and m unicipal
staff; and (c) training, technical assistance    and sm all grants aim ed at `vulnerable groups' 20
through the establishment of a seed grants program named Fondo Prosperidad.

1.6.4 Component 3 ­ Institutional Develo pment (US$ 5.38 m illion) aimed at strengthening the
capacities in tourism development and communication of public adm inistration agencies as well
as civil society and the private sector at national, regional a nd local levels. It included the
following activities: (a) instituti onal Capacity strengthening ai med at IHT, IHAH, and SCAD;
(b) techn ical assis tance and train ing for municipa lities to p repare a str ategic plan f or tourism
development; (c) the preparation of m arketing a nd prom otion strategy fo r IHT; (d ) a socia l
communications strategy for the Project, and (e ) support to the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
and the Project's monitoring and evaluation system.

1.6.5 PHRD Grant: Additional funding through a PHRD gr ant (US$ 400,000) were sought to
support capacity strengthening activities and the final impact evaluation study (see Annex 2).

1.7 Revised Components

1.7.1   The Project components were not revised and remained the same as in the PAD.

1.8 Other Significant Changes

1.8.1 Reconfiguration of Project Geographic Area . The Project included activities in five
archeological parks and sites. However, during Project implementation, an agreem ent could not
be reached with the lan downer of the property leading to th e Archeological Site of Plan Grande
in Guanaja. As a result, the pla nned activities and funds allocated for this site were canceled as
reflected in the Am endment Letter dated March 30, 2005. These funds were reallocated to other
activities, as described below.

1.8.2 Cancelation of Activities and Reallocation of Funds . On March 2008, the GoH inform ed
the IDA tea m that it ha d decided n ot to execu te the rem odeling of the Visitor Ce nter in the
Archeological Park of Copán and the proposed construction of the Aldea Maya due to lack of
consensus found among line Ministries on their relevance. The cancellation of both a ctivities did
not affect the achievement of the PDO given that the respective funds were reallocated to address
priority activities contained in the 2021 Na      tional Strategy for Tourism , including: (i)
consolidation of the Rosalila pyramid tunnels in Archeological Park of Copán; (ii) renewal of the
Municipal Market of Copán Ruinas , (iii) cons truction of a landf ill in th e Municipality of Santa
Rita; (v) renewal of the Copán Ruinas gateway; and (vi) construction of an observation tow er
and reconstruction of the suspended bridge in the Archeological Park of Los Naranjos.

1.8.4 Extension of Credit and PHRD Gra nt Closing Dates : There were two extensions m ade:
(a) from March 31, 2008 to September 30, 2008 due to the freezing of all gov ernment accounts
from December 20, 2007 to January 28, 2008. This a ffected the Project m anagement to com ply
with payment obligations due in Decem ber 2007 and Janu ary 2008 to the firm s responsible fo r
the execution of: (i) the Fuerte Cabañas restoration and the installation of Casa K'inich; (ii) the
CRIA renovation; and (iii) the re      habilitation of the pedestrian paths in L      os Naranjos
Archeological Park, totaling a 4 to 6 weeks dela y in the execution of those works; and (b) from
September 30, 2008 to March 27, 2009 in or der to a llow the s atisfactory completion of th e
above-referred Project activities as well as the completion of the Project's impact evaluation.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Key Elements of Project Design

2.1.1 The Project design benefited from the lessons learned from two previous Bank-financed
operations implem ented in the Copán Valle y: the PROF UTURO Pr oject and the Gender
Mainstreaming Program (GENFUND). The key lessons incorporated were the need to address

                                                16
the: (i) so cial ex clusion of the poor in tour ism activ ities; ( ii) lack of preservation m anagement
plans for the archeolog ical parks an d sites ; (iii) low levels of community particip ation in co-
production of public goods; and (iv) weak institutional capacity to protect the region's natural
endowment and cultural heritage assets.
2.1.2 The TTL at the tim e of the Project prepar ation was the sam e as for the above-m entioned
operations. This proved to be a bonus, the gained experience working in Copán region a allowed
the Project team to coalesce key experts and institutions for the Project design and execution.

2.1.3 The early involvem ent of strategic partners , w ho brought with them a range of sector
expertise an d a s trong cultural awareness in te rms of local developm ent need s, potentia ls and
trends, was also critical to make this Project more responsive to local needs.

Assessment of Project Design

2.1.4 Project Development Objective (PDO) : The high level Projec t objective of `reducing
poverty in one of the poorest regions of Hondur as [through] sustainable tourism de velopment'
was highly relev ant to the reality on the ground but quite am bitious given the Project scop e,
timeframe and resou rces at hand. To `ach ieve' sustainable tourism developm ent in the Copán
Valley and surrounding areas would ha ve required larger time horizon as well as mobilization of
a broader pool of resources and partners. Furt        hermore, to increm ent f lows of interna tional
visitors seeking Mayan experience in the Valley, Honduras would necessarily have to upgrade its
transport facilities, accessibility infrastructure, and lift the time-consuming procedures for border
entry visa requirements. The PDO also featured a multiplicity of sub-objectives bundled together
­ a common characteristic to pro jects prepared at the tim e.21 The Project outputs, however, were
specific and appropriate, and achieved satisfactorily at EoP.

2.1.5 Com ponents: The Project com         prised three fa irly distinct com ponents though
complementary in nature. The components ac         tivities were on the w    hole articulated and
implemented satisfactorily th roughout the Pro ject life due in great m easure to the decentralized
implementation arrangement adopted and the experienced technical team in place.

2.1.6 Institutional and Im plementation Arrangem ents: Project institutional fram              ework
contained innovative elem ents that played a key role to its effective execution. F irst, Project
management was carried out by an experienced team at IHT whic h earlier was also responsible
for the im plementation of the Sustain able Coastal To urism Project. The team hands-on
experience in i mplementing a Bank-financed o peration proved to be invaluable to a consistent
satisfactory m anagement perform ance (cf. IS Rs). Second, the Technical Support Agreem ent
signed betw een the Ministry of T ourism and Mi nistry o f Culture e nsured optim al technical
coordination related to Com ponent 1, which dealt with th e archeological parks and sites. Third,
the establishment of a decentrali zed Project im plementation office in the town of Copán Ruinas
allowed a strong local expert presence, and the articulation of an array of Project activities on the
ground. Fourth, the effec tive involvem ent of Asociación Copán, a reputable Honduran
archeological not-for-pro fit organization established in C opán Ruinas, to conduct research,
knowledge expansion and field work on Mayan cultu re, ensured the needed expertise to assist

21
   The ba seline was prepared on April 2004, about seven months after the Project starting date, by the consulting
firm COFINSA with technical guidance provided by IHT.

                                                       17
IHT and IHAH in the development and execution of the archeological preservation m anagement
activities. Finally, following inte rnational good practice, a specialized NGO with track record in
small business development in the region, was hired to manage Fondo Prosperidad activities.

Adequacy of Government's commitment

2.1.7 The Copán Project enjoyed strong GoH co mmitment and ownership throughout Project
design and implem entation. GoH had a strategy and comm itment towards developm ent of the
Copán Valley by transform ing the increasing num ber of visitors to the Archeological Park of
Copán into benefits for the local residents. At the identification mission in September 2002, GoH
presented the Bank team with a pr eliminary concept design .22 During the pre-appraisal m ission
of February 2003, over 30 participants, including gove rnment officials, line Ministries, research
institutes, and key experts partic ipated in a two-d ay meeting to reach a co nsensus on the Project
outline and to establish implementing arrangements. These also enabled for a speedy preparation
of the Project completed in 8 months.

Risk assessment

2.1.8 At Project design, eleven categories of risk 23 were assessed. On average, Project risk was
considered to be Moderate, and m itigation m easures were built in to the Project design. On
examination, however, some of the selected risks proved to be overly con centrated either on the
Country and Sector levels, leaving aside the Project level risks. Fo r instance, the risk related to
`access to C opán' cou ld not be add ressed by this Project, g iven that aside from i mproving the
access road to the Arch eological Park of Los Naranjos, the re we re neither subs tantive Project
investments nor other public sources allocated to     i mprove transport system on such a vast
(regional) scale.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 The Project life spanned from October 1, 2003 and, after two extensions, it was closed on
March 27, 2009. Major highlights and challenges faced during implementation are as following:

Highlights

2.2.2 Government's continuous support : GoH m aintained its initia l high inte rest and provided
support to the Project throughout its im plementation even during the change of Ministers of

22
  GoH officially requested preparation of the Project in a letter dated May 27, 2002.
23
   The m ain ris ks id entified i n th e PAD were: (i) Hon duras is n ot ab le to m aintain com petitiveness in to urism
market with respect to neighbor countries (N), (ii) Natural disasters affect the quality of attractions (M), (iii) Public
infrastructure (water and sanitation) remains of poor quality and/or is non-existent (S), (iv) Lack of qualified human
resource Capa city to sustain and preserve arch eological sites (N), (v) In security and/or lack o f pub lic safety in
tourism destinations a ffect t he number of visitors (S), (vi) Acces s to Copá n a nd the a rcheological circuit rem ains
slow and /or com plicated (S), (v ii) M unicipalities lack Cap acity to g enerate lo cal rev enue (lack of cad astre) to be
able to address priority needs (S), (viii) Local residents benefiting from training programs migrate out of the area
(N), (i x) Lac k of co ordination am ong t he Ministries of Tourism and C ulture, IHT a nd IHAH (M), (x) Fai lure t o

(xi) Tourism is not considered a priority by Government (N).(cf. PAD Section F2).

                                                           18
Tourism in 2006. The handover of the Project from the previous Minister to the upcom ing was
smooth and didn't result in any de lays in the Project im plementation process. Counterpart funds
were timely provided, which also reflect a consistent commitment of GoH to the Project.

2.2.3 Implementation Capacity of the PCU : The experienced staff of the Project Coordination
Unit (PCU) set up un der IHT, th e execu tion ag ency, satisfacto rily fulfilled the planning,
management and fiduciary functions of the P roject. Project was consider ed one of the best
performing operations in the Bank portfolio in Honduras.

2.2.4 Decentralization of Project operational activities to municipal level. The establishment of
a Project implem entation office in the town of Copán Ruinas allowed for an expeditious
implementation pace of the Project activities as well as the harmonization of its components with
the agenda and priorities of the local stakeholders. This office was originally established to carry
out the Project activities ex ecution and m onitoring on the gr ound. The office, however, sought
the space o pen by the municipal authorities, a nd expanded its scope of work by guiding the
urban developm ent in Copán Ruinas. As a resu lt, the loca l Projec t implem entation of fice was
renamed as the Municipal Urban Planning Offi ce.24 Highlights of the Office perform ed tasks
include (i) m anagement support to activities developed with the Fondo Prosperidad and in the
Archeological Park of Copán, (i i) technical coordination am ongst IHT, IHAH and the m unicipal
authorities, and (iii) support to the municipal administration for the preparation of its Municipal
Development Plan and of a unique urban design         scheme for the pres ervation of the colon ial
legacy, which led to th e transformation of the town i mage. The m unicipal authorities bestowed
the Office with the autho rity to review, approve and monitor the execution of new c onstructions
and rehabilitations of civil works, in order to ensure that they were in harmony with the proposed
urban design concept, and that no negative environmental impacts would occur.

Challenges

2.2.5 Project implementation delays. The Project suffered only two recorded delays:
    At mid-term (2006): There was an implementation hiatus of 6 months due to change in GoH.
    Prior to clo sing (December 2008): Due to freezing of Governm ent accounts, the P CU wa s
unable to pay, during the period of 6 weeks, the contractors in charge of the civil works at Fuerte
Cabañas, Los Naranjos and CRIA.

2.2.6 Relative short life span of Fondo Prosperidad. Although 91 percent of Fondo granted
businesses were performing at EoP, its execu tion would have benefited from larger time horizon
to allow th e necessa ry tim e f or participa ting bus inesses to consolida te while sys tematically
observing how these businesses performed during and beyond the Project life period.

Mid-term Review (MTR)

2.2.6 The Project MTR was carried out during the week starti ng on July 31, 2006. At MTR, a
total of US$ 7.75 m illion had been disbursed, repr esenting nearly 67 percent of the IDA credit.
The Project completion rates at MTR were as follows: 50 p ercent of activities completed and 64

24
  The Office comprised a highly experienced architect (Office Coordinator) and was staffed by a junior architect, a
procurement officer, an engineer and a M&E assistance.

                                                        19
percent of funds disbursed under Component 1; 77 percent of activities completed and 61 percent
of funds disbursed under Com ponent 2; and 91 per cent of activities completed and 78 percent of
funds disbursed under Component 3.

2.2.7 The MTR m ain recomm endations were: (i ) no significant changes in the design and
structure of the Project were proposed given the Project satisfactory implementation performance
to date; (ii) a detailed tim etable was agreed to ensure the tim ely completion of the civil works
prior to Project closing, and (iii) to complete the recruitment of the Project Coordinator.

2.2.8 The MTR assessm ent of each component prov ided th e following le ssons: (i) a clearly
defined inter-institutional agreem ent signed am ongst line Ministries and the Municipality of
Copán Ruinas proved to be essential to the effective implementation and monitoring of activities;
(ii) the right sequencing of activities related to interpretation and signage of the cultural heritage
assets of the parks in r elation to the prepar ation of their resp ective management plans led to an
optimal technical/operational result s; (iii) the so cial marketing approach to the selection process
of Fondo Prosperidad grantees m eant to prevent rais ing undue expectations am ong local
population; (iv) the Muni cipality of Copán Ruinas and th e PCU collaboration resulted in the
updating of the Municipal Development Plan and the preparation of urban design guidelines.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

2.3.1 Monitoring : The adopted M&E system            proved to be functional and captured the
implementation of Project activities accurately and in a tim ely m anner. The system recorded
technical, p hysical and f inancial pr ogress ev ery three m onths. The r evision and f ulfillment of
goals established in the annual working plan       (POA) were adopted upfront by the PCU. The
system was rated Satisfactory (S) throughout the Project im plementation and, after the last
supervision m ission, the system was adjusted to Moderately Satisfactory (MS) consistent with
the PDO overall rating.

2.3.2 Impact Evaluation: The PCU contracted a consu lting firm to carry out th e Project impact
evaluation prior to closing (ANED, 2008). The PCU also hired an independent consultant for the
financial and economic analysis of the Project. However, the analysis w as limited in scope with
no election of a control group. As a result, the ICR team adopted an alternative model to estimate
the economic returns of the Project with a control group (see Annex 3 for details).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 The Project was assigned a `B' environm ental classification. Four safeguard policies
were trigg ered, nam ely: Environm ental Assess ment, Natural Habita ts, Cultural Pr operty, and
Indigenous Peoples.

2.4.2 An Environmental Assessment (E A) was ca rried out as p art of the preparation of the
management plans for the parks and sites. The EA also took into account the requirements of the
Natural Habitats an d Cultural Property safeguards. The E                    A provided specific
recommendations for th e preparation and im plementation of the m anagement plans, particularly
with rega rds to inf rastructure im provements a nd construction activities. All m anagement plans

                                                 20
also includ ed a Natu ral Resources Managem ent Plan to restore and protect the parks/sites and
their surrou nding areas, as well as Guidelin es for Public Uses of the Parks to guide and
disseminate key attractions offered to the visitors. In addition, CHF carried out an environmental
screening prior to accepting any investm      ent proposal to be    possibly financed by Fondo
Prosperidad.
2.4.4 On the Cultural Property safeguard, during preparation, fi eld visits of Project areas
were carried out by an archeo logist, an envi ronmental spe cialist, and a socia l sc ientist.25 The
management plan for each park/site incorpor        ated approaches and me thods for preventing
damage, destruction, or theft of antiquities. During im plementation, a local renowned nonprofit
organization ( Asociación Copán) with an extensive experience in th e field of archeolog ical
research and education was responsible for the pr eparation of the technical designs and provided
expert advice to the PC U. Proposed activities we re also duly reviewed by IHAH staff to ensure
that there would be no damage or negative impacts on the cultural property.

2.4.5 Project design and implementation also incorporated the principles underlying the Bank's
Indigenous Peoples Policy by addressing indigenous populations (` Chorti') need s to accru e
benefits from the Project activities and invest ments. 72 out of the 255 i ndividuals who received
funds from Fondo Prosperidad were indigenous.

Procurement

2.4.6 The PCU was staffed with an experienced procurement specialist. Overall procurem ent
performance of the PCU and procur ement processes had a Satisfacto ry rating throughout Project
implementation. No misprocurement was found by the Bank.

Financial Management

2.4.7 Financial Management ­ F inancial Managem ent func tions were carried out by the
PCU/IHT including conciliation of accounts, inventories of Project assets, contracting of external
audits and procurem ent proces sing. The PCU/IHT was staffed           with a team of experien ced
financial managem ent specialis ts. Financial Managem ent was rated Satisf actory during th e
period of 2004­2007, and subsequen tly was downgraded to Modera tely Satisfac tory due to
inconsistencies in the in ventory of fixed assets. These inconsistencies were prom ptly addressed
and allowed the Project to return to a Satisfactory FM rating. The Project m        aintained proper
internal con trols, includ ing di stribution of fiduciary responsi bilities, and provided adequate
oversight throughout im plementation. Management of Project funds, including m anagement of
bank accou nts, m aintenance of supporting d ocumentation for Project expend itures, and
production of interim financial reports, were also Satisfactory throughout im plementation. The
last Financial Management rating in the ISR was Satisfactory.

2.4.8 Disbursem ent ­ The Project d isbursed 100 percent of Bank proceeds and executed them
almost completely (100 percent of the Cred      it and 99.3 percent of   the Trust F und). Bank
disbursements during the Project followed a regular pattern, with two peaks, one in the third year
and another in the last year of the Project execution. Averag e yearly disbursem ents am ounted


25
     IHAH periodically updated the cultural property framework pertaining to each park/site.

                                                          21
US$ 2.3 m illion (17 percent of the funds), with exception in the th ird year of the Project, when
US$ 5 million was disbursed.

2.4.9 Audit ­ As per the Cr edit Agree ment, audited financial statemen ts for IHT (4.01 b) and
audited financial statements for Project Account s (4.01 d) should be furnished to the Bank. The Project
audit reports were submitted to the Bank annually with a delay of about two m onths. All Project
audits were unqualified and no m       ajor issues were identified by the auditors throughout
implementation. Institutional audits for the IHT we re also prepared annu ally. With exception in
2005, all in stitutional audits were qualified, alt hough qualifications did not affected Project
implementation. The last institutional audit report has yet to be furnished to the Bank.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Operation and Maintenance: IHT established operation and m aintenance agreem ents
with respective partn er agency for each of the buildings an d structu res rehabilitated under the
Project. For instance, IHT signed an agreem ent with Asociación Copán for the continuation of
the stud ies related to the consolidation of the tunne ls in Copán Archeological Park. Another
agreement was signed with the M unicipality of Copán Ruinas for the m aintenance of Fuerte
Cabañas and the Casa K'inich. The Municipality has indicated that it will continue enforcing the
regulations and usage of m ethods/tools deve loped and applied by the Urban Developm             ent
Office, f inanced by th e Projec t. Th ese ac tivities will b e ca rried out by an Urban Managem ent
Unit to be estab lished within the municipal g overnment structure and jointly financed by the
Chamber of Tourism and Comm erce. The Mun icipality of Santa Rita w ill ope rate the landf ill
financed by the Project, as agreed p rior to its construction. The Ministry of Culture will continue
to manage the daily operations and adm inistration of the Archeolog ical Parks and Sites guided
by the m anagement plans for the parks/sites           developed under the Project. According to
discussions conducted during ICR m issions in 2008, the Minister of Culture indicated its
commitment to invest in the restoration of th e archeological tunnels damaged by the heavy rains
that affected Honduras in 2008, and to m onitor the im plementation and use of the ticketing
system implemented by the Project in the Archeological Park of Copán.

2.5.2 Follow-on Operation: Prior to Project closing, the Minist er of Tourism expressed interest
in a follow on operation, and presented a deta iled outline to the Bank. However, the GoH
decided not to request it due to the ef fects of global financial crisis, which led the Go H to focus
on other critical issues, particularly on food security.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory

3.1.1 The PDO continues to have high overall rele vance considering its quest for a sustainable
tourism developm ent in Honduras--a priority in its econom ic growth and poverty reduction
strategy. This Project pioneered the concept of tourism developm ent with social inclusion and
poverty reduction objectives; since its m ain activities addressed local populations' needs--rather
than investing in facilities exclusively for visitors ' benefit. In term s of its design, it featured an

                                                  22
integrated approach of protecting natural resour ces linked to the preservation of Mayan cultural
assets. More im portantly the Project provided H onduran experts and policy m akers with an
opportunity to devise new approaches for the implementation of GoH long-term strategy.

3.1.2 The Project conceptual and technical innova tions also provided the learning ground for
the r estructuring of a sim ilar p roject in Peru ("Vilcanota Valley Rehabilitation and
Management") and the design of a new project         in Costa Rica ("L imon City-Port"), both
operations assisted by the Bank, demonstrating its replicability.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 The P roject was successful in m eeting th e over-arching PDO of "achiev ing sustain able
tourism developm ent based on the cultural and natural patrim    ony of the Copán Valley and
surrounding areas which will, as a result, create investment opportunities for the p rivate sector,
foster em ployment, and reduce po verty in one of the poorest regions of Honduras". This is
demonstrated by the following achievements and outcomes:

3.2.2 Increase in tourist population ­ The Archeological Park of Copán and of Los Naranjos,
which benefited substantially from the Project i nvestments, are considered the m ost im portant
archeological destinations in Honduras and with greater potential to attract and retain visitors for
a longer stay in the region and thus to incr     ease local revenues. For exam ple, the im proved
facilities particularly at the Archeological Park of Copán contributed to an increase tourist inflow
457 percentage in the Western region between 2001 and 2007.

3.2.3 Improvement in the local economy ­ The Project had a positive effect on the local
economy, which led to an increase in incom e earnings by the tourism service sector (i.e., hotels,
restaurants, souvenir shops, taxi services). For example, the average expenditures by tourist have
increased from US$117 in 2004 to US$ 696.6 for the W estern Zone in 2008. This value is about
250 percentage increase from 2004 to 2008. A lso, c onsidering that one vi sitor expends about
US$ 47 on average per day in the town, this increase m ay represent about a gain of about US$
1.9 million to the local economy per year.

3.2.4 Municipal revenues in the areas increased from L.22,225,000.00 in 2004 to
L.207,125,442.44 in 2008. The final value refers to the re venues of the municipalities of Copán,
La Jigua, Pimienta, Potrellos, Santa Cruz Yojoa (Guanaja was not included given the cancelation
of the activities to be financed in this site). Al though the increase in ta x revenues accrued by
these Municipalities can not be attrib uted exclusively to the projec t, it is very like ly that most of
the increase would have resulted from the project activities.

3.2.5 Increase in per capita income ­ The annual growth rate of Copán's per capita incom e
was 8 percent while the national rate was 4 percent. This increase could be partially attributed to
the Pro ject. In add ition, 70 percent of enterprises supported by Fondo Prosperidad st ated a
monthly salary of US$ 291 for individuals in co mparison to national average of US$ 131 in the
same period. Approxim ately 75 percent of enterpri ses were considered successful by generating
an average of 20 percent increas e in the fam ily incom e. Only about 10 per cent of the total



                                                  23
enterprises, those loca ted in the remote a reas, have encountered difficultie s mostly due to their
limited access to the main roads (and therefore markets).

3.2.6 Jobs creation ­ The Project also contributed to the creation of employment opportunities.
For example, the number of jobs created in th e Western Zone has incr eased from 7,555 in 2004
to 8.675 in 2008, an in crease of 15 percen t, which has ex ceeded th e target of 5 p ercent. The
number of s mall, local enterprises has increa sed from 338 i n 2004 to 407 in 2008, which is an
increase of 60 percent, although it has not m et the target of 100 perc entage increase. A pre-
feasibility study conducted to identify the profitable niche m arkets for the developm ent of
tourism-related incom e genera tion opportunities showed that Fondo Prosperidad financed 69
businesses (out of 500 proposals submitted). This was more than double of the propo sed goal set
at appraisal (30). According to the impact analysis , at the end of the first year of functioning, 91
percent of the businesses assisted were still func tioning. The Project also surpassed the appraisal
goal that approximately 33 percent of the beneficiary would be wo men, given that 49 percent of
the direct beneficiaries of the Fondo were women.

3.2.7 Improved local capacity for business management and tourism development ­ The Project
                   :
strengthened the capa city of lo cal business pe ople in e ssential areas, such as m arketing and
productive chains. In ad dition to financial supp ort, CHF organized 32 workshops and training
modules in these areas. Approxim ately 650 indi viduals participated in the w orkshops and
training, som e of whom underwent more than one type of training, which m akes the total of
1,559 participants. Local residents also received technical training in a range of skills needed for
the developm ent and enhancem ent of the archeo logical parks and sites. Training modules in
environmental and archeological preservation works were provided to selected individuals to
become archeological assis tants and guides f or the archeological parks of Copán and Los
Naranjos; in total it pre pared 40 ne w tourist g uides. The Project also financed 7 specialized
workshops in a range of them es related to tourism guiding and archeology with 180 participants.
Training was also provided to enhance cultural      tourism services delivery and the quality of
tourism products, targeted to tourism operators and m unicipal staff working in the tourism
sector, with 116 participants.

3.2.8 Institutional strengthening for cultural management ­ The Project satisfactorily
supported the preparation of the management plan for the two pa rks and the three sites, with
inputs of renowned archeologists and anthropologists. The management plans26 enabled the main
26
   The Management Plans financed by the Project addres sed all the most critical aspects that a given plan shoul d
contain, including: (i) a Natural Resource Management Plan focused on issu es related to investigation, monitoring,
and scientific cooperation; protection of native species; natural resource management and conservation strategy; (ii)
a Pu blic Use Plan t o disseminate kn owledge ab out t he monuments and si tes t o vi sitors; i mprove l inkages am ong
different parts of the parks; integrate all mu seums in the same archeological tourism circuit; (iii) an Interpretation
and Security Plan with information signage and security infrastructure for parks and museums (activities including:
constructing and improving trails, interpretive signage, safety for visitors, maps, fences, video surveillance cameras,
alarms, identification and repair of acts of vandalism); (iv) a Community Outreach Plan to promote knowledge and
visits fro m lo cal resid ents (activ ities in cluded: d issemination v ia TV and bro chures, p ublic relatio ns, recreation,
community learning opportunities); (v ) an Infrastructure Plan to ex ecute small c ivil work s to increase th e flo w of
visitors; and (vi) a Monitoring Plan to collect information about visitors in order to plan future expansion.




                                                            24
government agencies involved in tourism and culture (IHT, IHAH a nd SCAD) to learn new
management approaches and provided them with an effective management tool for the protection
and preservation of the Mayan heritage and thei r surrounding areas. Evidence suggests that the
plans im plemented in t he Archeolo gical Parks of Copán and of Los Naranjos have im proved
conservation of their m onuments, fostered a bette r spatial distribution of visitors, and provided
key historical inform ation on Mayan culture and social organization for visitors of all ages.
According to the Administrator of the Archeo         logical Park of Copán,     the state-of-the-art
conservation techniques used for the upgrading of tunnels within the Mayan pyram ids were
critical to w ithstand the hea vy rains of Septem ber 2008, whereas other tunnels which were not
subject to the protection works were severely damaged by the rain.

3.2.9 Strengthening ecological management ­ The num ber of hectares un der ecolog ically
sustainable m anagement has increased from 256 hectares to 260 hectares in the Archeological
Parks of Copán and of Los Naranjos. This is only an increase of 4 percent, compared to the target
of 100 percent increase. The    Project financed an environm ental education program ` Clean
Neighborhood' benefiting residents of Copán Ruinas. A ccording to th e Municipality of Copán,
this town- wide progr am was instrum ental in ra ising the re sidents' awareness abo ut
environmental health, and built the foundation for the im provement of the urban environm ent
particularly of the low incom e neighborhoods. The Project also financed developm ent and
acquisition of environmental learni ng display m aterials to b e used by the visitors, students and
their f amilies at the Casa K'inich, which attracted m ore than 20,000 visitors prior to project
closing.

3.2.10 Long-term tourism strategy ­ The Project was considered by GoH as one of the m ain
vehicles for the im plementation of its long-term Tourism Strategy. In addition to the project
investments in tourism-related activities, the project also provided technical assistance for IHT to
develop and market a new tourism brand for Honduras ( Marca Honduras). This timely initiative
has been considered by IHT as one of the policy m        ajors which has prom oted Honduras in a
highly competitive regional tourism m arket, resu lting in an increase d of 11.3 percent (to
confirm/update this figure) in the num ber of vi sitors to the country in the period of the Project
implementation.

3.2.11 Higher tourist satisfaction ­ According to IHT's 2007 Expenditure Survey and Tourist
Profile Reports, 96.5 percent of visitors have expressed satisfaction with the service received.
The rating consists of: 32.3 percent excellent, 46.5 percent very good and 17.7 percent good.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 The independent econom ic and financial anal yses carried out during Project preparation
and closing, show that the Project has been econo mically and financially viable. At the core of
both analyses is a calculation of the projected fl ow of tourists in the Archaeolog ical Park of
Copán between 2003 and 2017. At appraisal, assum ing a fixed discount rate of 11.5 percent over
the net income stream, it was expected that the net present value (NPV) of the Project would be
US $ 6.1 million in the "m oderate" scenario an d US$ 25 m illion in the "high" s cenario. Th e
economic evaluation conducted in 2007 re-estim ated the NPV and obtained a positive NPV of
US$ 29 m illion, which is a 16 percent above th e "high" scenario. A hig h proportion of Fondo

                                                25
Prosperidad investm ents seem to be profitable at EoP. The FRRs for selected 15 businesses
analyzed in-depth rang ed from 13 percen t to 75 percent except one whose ERR was 7% due to
logistical issues. In addition, according to the economic analysis carried out by the ICR team, the
annual per capita incom e growth rate in Copán was 8 per cent while the national rate was 4
percent during the 2001­2007 period, and the annual ra te job relative growth was 4.7 percent at
the tourist national level and 8 percent for the local population. Assum ing the national behavior
as the natural trend in absence of the Project, at leas t a 3.8 percent of the annual increase in the
might be partially attributed to the Project. See details in Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1 This rating is bas ed on the following con siderations: (i) despite th e am bitious high level
objective, the Project outputs were highly relevant to the reality on the g round, and were largely
achieved, (ii) the P roject was a p ioneer of it s kind in the LAC region portfolio, and provided
GoH with seasoned advisory and technical expertise, (iii) the Project has been rated as one of the
best performing operations of the Bank's portfolio in Honduras, with a Satisfactory technical and
fiduciary perform ance throughout its execution, (iv) the P roject enjoyed continued high GoH
support, and its activities have been fully integr ated into the agendas of IHT and the other key
public entities, and (v) the Project d emonstrated its potential replicability, and important lessons
were learned for future similar operations.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 The Project aimed to assist the GoH to address poverty reduction and social development
issues in the Copán Valley by way of investments in: (i) increasing tourism inflows; (ii) fostering
income generation opportunities for the population in the Project areas, pa rticularly indigenous
people, through Fondo Prosperidad; and (iii) generating indirect benefits to the poor segments of
the population by stren gthening local institutional management capacity and inves tments made
in the provision of public services.

3.5.2 The econom ic analysis suggests that the im           proved facilities pa rticularly at the
Archeological Park of Copán c ontributed to in crease tou rist in flow (11 percent). This had a
positive ef fect on the local econo my, which enj oyed an incre ase in incom e earnings by the
tourism service sector (i.e., hotels, restaurants, souvenir shops, taxi services). Considering that
one visitor expends about US$ 47 in average per day in th e town, this incre ase may repr esent
about a gain of about US$ 1.9 million to the local economy per year.

3.5.3 The economic analysis findings indicate: (i) the creation of employment opportunities for
255 individuals of which 125 were wom en (49 percent), and 72 were indigenous people (28
percent), (ii) 70 percent of en terprises monthly salary of US $ 291 for individuals, and US$ 463
for fam ilies, and (iii) a pproximately 75 percen t of enterp rises were co nsidered su ccessful by
generating an average of 20 percent increase in the family income.



                                                 26
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.4 Institutional Capacity strengthening devel oped under the Project is an essential elem ent
for the sustainability of this type of initiative , particularly relev ant in the Copán region. The
Project strategy was twofold: first, every civ il work financed was complem ented by a specific
technical assistance and second, it delivered a dis tinct array of Capacity developm ent activities
aimed to strengthen institutional capacity in tourism and cultural patrimony management among
public, private, and civil society experts and organizations at both the national and local levels.

3.5.5    The following long-term impacts have been noted:

(i) At Local Level:
    In two years, the Urban Planning Office in C opán Ruinas prom oted activities that had a
    direct im pact on the overall enh ancement of the town's im age and on the municipal
    government structure. The Office assisted the M unicipality in the preparation of a Municipal
    Development Plan as well as in the development of the urban design guidelines, establishing,
    for the first tim e, parameters a nd regulations for town construc tion. The Office also assisted
    the Municipality in designing and executing a un ique street sign system and cleaning up the
    streetscape visual presentation, and organized activities to pr omote environmental protection
    and public fairs. 27 The Office coordinated all activities with other key municipal units to
    ensure coherence and relevance of the activ ities with the m unicipal urban developm ent
    agenda. Civil society representatives particip ated actively in the design and im plementation
    of all activities, including in the nam ing of the streets, and in the neighborhoods clean-up
    program. The supervision m issions confirmed that the visible results of the activities carried
    out by the Office have been duly recognized by the municipal authorities, key stakeholders
    such as the Cham ber of Tourism and Commerce, and endorsed by the population.
    Throughout the Project im plementation, the Office de veloped ways to transfer and
    disseminate its knowledge through m anuals, a nd Capacity developm ent for the municipal
    authorities and officials. The Chamber of T ourism and Commerce and the Municipality of
    Copán Ruinas agreed to share the costs for carrying out the urban planning work conducted
    by the Office, upon the Project closing.
    The Project also assisted the Municipal Touris m Unit to s trengthen its institutional structure,
    management capacities, outreach strategy and op erations. Most activities prom oted by the
    Urban Office were coordinated with the Municipa l Tourism Unit in order to ensure ef fective
    results on the ground. The Unit is currently part of the Ad ministrative Co mmittee that will
    manage and operate Fuerte Cabañas.

(ii) At National Level:
     The preparation of the five m        anagement pl ans f or the parks/s ites enabled the m ain
     government agencies involved in tourism and culture (IHT, IHAH and SCAD) to learn new
     concepts for the m anagement of archeological parks and sites. The Pl ans have also provided
     these agencies, for the f irst time, with an e ffective management tool for the protection and
     preservation of the respective parks and sites.

27
  Th e Office en vironmental program was jo intly p repared wit h th e M unicipal Tou rism Un it an d i ncluded th e
establishment of: (i) a c ommunity contest aim ed at preser ving th e n eighborhoods env ironment; (ii) th e Craft Fair
"Augustina", which featured production of new crafts produced in Copán; and (iii) a Japan Festival.

                                                         27
   The Project also brought together key national institutions (IHT, IHAH and SCAD) and local
   governments and expert civil society or              ganizations--which often had divergent
   orientations--and forged a positive dialogue among them on park/site management. This was
   one of the key factors that contributed to th e satisfactory outcome of Project implementation.
   The attained inter-institutional technical coordination is also essential for the sustainability of
   Project's results, and for future initiatives in the Copán Valley.
   The restoration of Fuerte Cabañas and the installation of a children's m useum, Casa K'inich
   have provided Hondurans, partic ularly students, with a new a lternative to le arn about the
   Mayan life through cultural recreational activiti es. By Project com pletion, the m useum had
   already received more than 20,000 visitors.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.6 The revival of discussions between the private sector and IHT to negotiate the price of land
surrounding the Archeological Pa rk of Copán, which would allow the GoH to expand in one
third the park area (from the current 80 to 120 manzanas ­ equal to 207.6 acres), is one positive
unexpected outcome of the Project. This measure would (i) integrate dispersed Maya monuments
within the park proper, and (ii) increase the buf fer zone thu s preventing future en croachment of
the urban expansion on the park.

3.5.7 Another unintended outcome was the important archeological discovery of the tomb of one
of the first rulers of Copan, which may belong to a son or brother of Copan ruler Yax K'uk Mo
from Teotihuacan. This discovery was headed by the Director of the Asociación Copán while
working on the protection of the underground tunnels of the temple of Oropendola, which was
financed by the project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.1.1 Sustainability: From the outset, the Project main sustainability strategy has been to ensure
that its activities and wo rk in progress be em bedded with local agents an d institutions involved,
in orde r to institu tionalize its app roaches, pr ocedures an d activities. Creating the sense of
ownership through participatory processes--for in stance the engagement of the local population
in the selection of the nam es of the Copán Ruinas streets, w as an im portant strategy adopted in
the quest for sustainability, particularly of    the urban planning and m      anagement activities
financed by the Project. Using matching funds, was a third importa nt element adopted to ensure
the relevance of the investm ents made by the Proj ect and future hand over of their O&M to the
local institutions. For instance, the allocation of municipal funds to complete the rehabilitation
works initiated under the Project in the Fuerte Cabanas and the municipal public market, both in
Copán Ruinas, sign als the im portance a ttributed by the loca l au thorities as c ustodians to
safeguard and preserve these structures. The       impact evaluation report shows that about 75
percent of the businesses financed by Fondo Prosperidad are operational after two years of
operation. The sustainability of those entrepre neurs is also guaranteed by establishm ent of
                                                 28
partnerships with key agen cies su ch as th e CITEAT ( Centro de Innovación Tecnológica,
Artesanía y Turismo) in Copán Ruinas, which is in char ge of providing training to im prove
product quality, m arketing and comm ercialization. JICA is also suppo rting artisan indigenous
groups in product im provement. The Cham ber of Tourism and Comm erce and the Municipality
of Copán Ruinas have also agreed on sharing the costs for carrying out the urban planning work
previously conducted by the loca l P CU. Despite the positive Project outcom es, the long-term
sustained tourism development in the region hinge s upon factors, particular ly political stability
and will of future administrations, which are beyond the scope of this operation.

4.1.2 Human Capital and Institutional Development: Strong evidence from the i mpact
evaluation as well a s supervision and ICR m issions demonstrate the extent to which the Project
contributed to enhance hum an and institu tional capacities at national an d local levels through a
robust program of capacity developm ent. For instance, the IHT staff applied the knowledge
acquired to develop and m arket a new tourism brand for H onduras ( Marca Honduras). The
Project-financed training for the restoration     of the m onuments has taught the staff of the
Archeological Parks of Copán and Los Naranjos how to manage the p arks in a more ef fective
manner. Fondo Prosperidad trainings in business develo pment, product enhancem ent and
marketing were highly dem anded and tailored acco rdingly to the selected bu sinesses. A t
institutional level, 24 new expert s in restoration of m onuments and investigation m ethods were
inducted to IHAH, while the Urba n Planning Office was absorbed by the municipal structure as
an um brella agency covering for urban plan         ning and managem ent functions. It is worth
mentioning that the archeologist responsible for the restoration works in the Archeological Park
of Copán was nominated Deputy Secretary of the Mi nistry of Culture in Guatemala due, in great
measure, to his expert contributions in the implementation of the Project.

4.1.3 Environmental Management: As discussed in 2.4.2, with            the Project assistance and
financial support, environmental assessment and management practices have been integrated into
the Project-financed management plans for the parks/sites as well as infrastructure improvements
and construction/restoration ac tivities. The m anagement plan s also provide IHAH with a
framework to regulate and to protect th e resp ective parks natural an d cultu ral resources. In
addition, an environm ental screening was carried out as part of the selection process by Fondo
Prosperidad. Finally, a range of environm ental awar eness activ ities p romoted by the Urban
Planning Office in Copán Ruinas have been fully adopted by the Municipality and are at the core
of its Municipal Tourism Unit program of activities.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.1 The Copán Project was fully aligned with GoH long-term developm ent objectives and
built upon the lessons learned from previous operations assisted by the Bank in the region. The
Project pioneered the co ncept of inclusive tourism development and provided Honduran experts
and m anagers with new m ethods and tools for the im plementation of GoH long-term touri sm


                                                29
strategy. Its preparation brought together an arra y of agencies and expe rts, providing a sound
political and analytical foundation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.2 Nine supervision m issions--organized in close collaboration with the PCU--were
conducted during the Project life. Mi ssions were conducted in the Vall ey and sites rather than in
the capital town, and engaged specialized techn ical experts. Fiduciary re views were carried out
at least twice yearly, and `No objections' were provided in a timely manner.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.3 The Project was a pioneer of its kind in the LAC region portfolio, and provided GoH with
seasoned advisory and technical expertise in        the dom ain of sustainable cultural-tourism
development. Strong supervision has contributed to facilitate inter-institutional coordination and
to raise the Project overall satisfactory implementation rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.1 Project design was fully alig ned with GoH's strategy for tourism developm ent, and
enjoyed strong GoH commitment and ownership from its design throughout its execution stages,
even during the change of Ministers of Tourism in 2006.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2 Project m anagement was carri ed out by an experi enced team at IHT which processed
more than 1,200 contracts for w       orks, goods, a nd services in an effective manner. The
establishment of a `local im plementation' Office in the town of Copán Ruinas, the involvem ent
of local expert organizations, such as Asociación Copán, and the hiring of a specialized NGO to
manage the local econo mic development activities are all in line with good practices for Project
management.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.3 Despite the M&E deficiencies, the Project has been rated as one of the best perform ing
operations of the Bank's portfolio in Honduras,       with a Satisfactory te chnical and fiduciary
performance throughout its execution. The Project enjoyed conti nued high GoH support, and its
activities have been fully integrated into the agendas of IHT and the other key partners.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1 Selected from evaluation reports, and im plementation supervision m issions, the Project
generated an array of valuable lessons for the Borrower and the Bank. The following are the
main lessons learned:
6.1.1 Bringing the Project execution close to the target population. The establishm ent of a
decentralized PCU in Copán Ruinas facilitated the empowerment of and collaboration with local
key stakeholders during Project design and im plementation. It has also provided an optim um
operational base to link it with a ra nge of partnering institutions and interact with representatives
of civil society, and public and private sectors in a timely and fluid manner. Its multi-disciplinary
team was able to effectively link the Pro       ject activities w ith the im plementation of relate d
municipal priorities and the private sector.

6.1.2 The role of strategic technical partners for an effective implementation. The hiring of
specialized technical as sistance during the P roject des ign and executio n stages was critical to
address potential challen ges faced by the Project in term s of technical expertise. The selected
partner organizations had a prove n track record and abundant fi eld experience regarding their
respective d omains of expertise in conserva tion of archeological m onuments and parks and
income generation activities.

6.1.3 Relevance of an integrated approach for regional development. Despite its lim ited
resources, the adoption of an integrated concept of cultural tourism developm ent with poverty
reduction o bjectives w as instrum ental for th e Pr oject in m eeting its overarching developm ent
objective w ith significant im provements in ke y areas including better urban planning, jobs
generation and protection of natural resources linked to the preservation of unique cultural assets.
The adoption of cultural tourism as an engine of growth was instru mental and unique in
comparison to traditional integrated regional development projects.
 
6.1.4 Cultural tourism as an opportunity for the promotion and expansion of locally-owned
micro businesses. In sharp contrast with ot her models of tourism development, cultural tourism
opened opportunities for incom e generation activiti es for the poor, particul arly in "culturally
reach" com munities. Cultural tourism enabled indigeno us comm unities to unbundle their
knowledge and traditions as incom e generation assets, demonstrating its potential as a legitim ate
business area for the Bank and client governm ents to move forward their poverty reduction
agendas.

6.1.5 Graduation path for expanding local business opportunities. Fondo Prosperidad applied
important operational principles tested elsewhere, including: (i) im         plementation by an
experienced or au tonomous agency (to p revent political overtones), (ii) an agile prom otion
mechanism, and (iii) twining priv ate secto r and civ il society re presentatives in the te chnical
review and approval of grant proposals to ensure an unbiased selection system , (iv) technical
guidance and m entoring provided throughout the im plementation of this com ponent by experts
from CHF and PCU, was conside red essen tial, given the very low levels of schooling and
literacy found a mong t he beneficiaries of this grant; (v) the required issuance o f a bill of
exchange b y each recipient of funds ensured th e positive application of these funds toward s

                                                 31
realization of the busin ess investm ent plan. Fondo, however, would have benef ited from a
graduation path for the selected bus inesses to be able to m ove from seed funds to comm ercially
priced services. The design of Fondo should have also incorporated a post-granting technical
assistance program to provide tim ely guidance to the awarded businesses. It could also have
promoted training of beneficiaries with a stro ng focus on commercialization and m arketing as
well as established strategic partnerships with larger businesses to set up endurable backward
and forward links in the producti ve chain, and a strategy to      link seed fund beneficiaries to
exitsing lo cal f inancial system , such as com mercial banks in Copan and the Cajas Rurales.
Lastly, for the purpose of expanding knowledge        and learning, and dispelling preconceived
notions, an ex-post assessment would provide a measure of the businesses' perform over a longer
period of time.

6.1.6 Matching micro business type with local economic context. Effective local econo mic
development programs/activities require an up- front mapping of the local econom ic conditions
and opportunities to ensure th at the selection of businesses types and line of products
corresponds with the marketplace dem ands and fit consumer trends. Copán Ruinas absorbed 61
percent of all th e resou rces allocated by Fondo Prosperidad, f or it is a regiona l ce nter with a
more dynam ic m arketplace receiving a considerable inflow of visitors. The least successful
micro-enterprises were those located in remote areas, with poor access roads.

6.1.7 Management of expectations. An ex-post assessment of Fondo points out the importance
to manage expectations in development of this type of activity. Fondo Prosperidad had created
an impression among the population in general that these were "gifts" wh ich eventually would
be distributed again in the future. This aspect warrants further analysis so that in future programs
distributed funds are not m istaken as "gifts", and there are proper communication m echanisms
in place to ensure clarity of purpose.

6.1.8 Importance of compliance mechanisms in place to monitor the use and recapture unspent
funds. Due to lack of enforcem ent mechanisms (i.e. a code of responsibility and obligations on
the part of recipients of f unds) awarded businesses were not obliged to return back to Fondo the
unspent funds, nor partially recover the funds spent to acquire implements (i.e. tools, equipments
and furniture). The design of Fondo could have incorporated a revolving fund, so recovered
funds woul d be accessed by well perform ing busine sses in order to continue op erating and

6.1.9 Need for a Consistent Monitoring and Evaluation System. The selection m ade of Project
high level objective and related indicators, a t the appraisal, was ambitious considering the scope
of activitie s. On the other hand,      the in corporation of the M&E system          within Project
management structure and its direct linkage w ith the Ann ual W ork Plans contrib uted to an
optimum yield in the execution level by allowing regular revisions and tim ely analysis of the
completed a ctivities in r elation to pr ogrammed goa ls. The m ain lesson extr acted r efers to th e
need for the preparation of a coherent set of i ndicators related to Project developm ent objectives
and activities in consis tency with its scope, reso urces and tim eline. The se lection of indicators
should be realistic in term s of the availability of information and the possibility of establishing a
simple but meaningful baseline to be tracked as the projects unfolds. Another lesson refers to the
importance of putting in place an M&E system which allows a timely and accessible Project tool.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1 IHT expressed its keen interest in further pursuing a second Project, which would allow to
revisit activities which were planned but not executed (i.e. Aldea Maya, Visitors Center) as well
as to conso lidate and ex pand the r esults attained by the Project, particularly in reference to the
generation of econom ic opportunities and em ployment initiated under Fondo Prosperidad. The
PCU concurred with this view on the need to          expand the current Project scope, citing the
Archeological Parks, as well as the Aldea Maya, the Visitors Center and the economic evaluation
of the public cultural asse ts pertaining to the proposed archeo logical circuit. Furthermore, the
second phase could expand over the built base         for the incom e and employm ent generation
activities and improve access to productive activities in the Valley. Lastly, it argues that a second
Project would consider adoption of an alternative route for the proposed Archeological Circuit in
line with the latest achievements of the national tourism strategy.

7.2 As previously discussed, however, the GoH deci ded not to request a second phase due to the
effects of global financial crisis, which led the GoH to focus on other critical issues, such as food
security while opting for a fast disbursem ent Ba nk-credit to serve as a cushion to eventu al
external financial shocks.

(b) Co-financiers

7.2 N/A

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

7.3 As part of the im pact evaluation, the su rvey conducted am ong Pr oject key stakeholders
indicated th e interes t in a second stage of Fondo Prosperidad with the r eplication of the
experience and methodology used, but expanding its coverage so to probably include the array of
proposed businesses that weren' t selected by the grant. The other reason given was that Fondo
Prosperidad enjoyed increasing trust among the local population and this has led to an expanded
process of public participation and involvem ent; this has also led to the recasting of the concep t
of seed capital in the micro-business environment.

                                      Outputs by Component


1.    The Project's three components were, in general, satisfactorily implemented. The following
section summarizes the results by component and subcomponents.

Component 1 ­ Integrated Development of Archeological Parks and Sites (US$ 7.5 million)

2.    As discussed in section 1.7, the following are the main changes made to the original design
of Component 1: (i) the decision not to renovate the Visitors Center of the Archeological Park of
Copán; (ii) the decisi on not to build the Aldea Maya loca ted in the Archeolog ical Park of El
Puente; (iii) the cancellation of the planned works in the Archeological S ite of Plan Grande; (iv)
the addition al resou rces needed for the ceiling of the Mayan Sculptu re Museum ; (v) the
financing of improvements of the Municipal Market of Copán Ruin as; and (vi) the c onstruction
of a landfill in the Municipality of Santa Rita.

3.   All activities developed a nd im plemented under Com ponent 1 were supervised by
Asociación Copán, a reputable no t-for-profit archeo logical organization located in Copán
Ruinas.

Subcomponent 1.1 ­ Archeological Park of Copán (US$ 5,319,393.00)

4.   The Archeological Park of Copán, a W orld He ritage Site, is hom e to what was once a
major ancient Maya center within the "Mundo May a"­ a cultural continuum of heritage assets
spanning from México to Panam a. Today, the Pa rk attracts about 170,000 visitors annually and
ranks as one of Honduras' primary tourist destinations.

5.    Given the cultural and econom ic importance of the Archeological P ark of Copán, 34
percent of the Project funds were allocated to the developm ent and implem entation of the array
of activities contained in its Management Plan.

6.     The Management Plan developed for the Park includes: (i) a program for the protection and
conservation of the Park monum ents and ritual sites, (ii) a Natu ral Resources Managem ent Plan
which would guide in restoring and protecting its m onuments and its natural surrounding areas,
(iii) a Public Use Plan, which would guide public visitation and disseminate knowledge about the
Park, and (iv) a Community Outreach Plan that       includ ed the redesig n of Park's website, a
signage system to guide and interpret its m onuments and the Park itself , a social communicatio n
and public relations strategy, and interactive community learning activities.

7.    Improvements and restorations were successfu lly carried o ut by a tea m of national and
international experts, and concentrated on urgen tly needed activ ities pr ioritized in the Park' s
Management Plan, namely: (i) the restora tion and protection of key sculptures (               stellae)
previously exposed to weather conditions; (ii) excavation, stabilization and reinforcem ent of 5
km of underground archeological tu nnels within the Rosalila Tem ple; (iii) design and placem ent
of state-of-the-art interpretati on signs to guide visitors throu gh the Park; (iv) renovation of the

                                                  35
park entrance with installation of improved signage and parking, (v) instal lation of an electronic
ticketing system; and (v) upgrading of visitors' bathrooms.

8.    The activities of this sub-com ponent also included improvements in two support buildings
adjacent to the Park, nam ely the expansion of the Regional Center for Archeological Research
(CRIA), and the renovation of the ceiling of the Mayan Sculpture Museum. The obje ctive was to
offer visitors a greater learn ing ex perience of Mayan cu lture and so cial organization and to
expand the attractions in the Park. The expa       nsion of the CRIA building, which     houses all
archaeological research and all ex cavated artifacts found in Copán Park (a collection with m ore
than 20,000 pieces), allowed the concentration in        one place of m ost docum ents related to
archeological research in the Valley as well as visitors to have a firs thand opportunity in seeing
the ongoing conservation works. By offering these new attractions, the Management Plan sought
to ensure a better distribution of visitors and, hen ce, to attain adequate carrying Capacity of the
Park while increasing revenues th rough entrance fees and the sale of crafts, publications and
tourism products in the Museum shop.

9.    In addition, the subcomponent financed the restoration of Fuerte Cabañas, a historic
military f ort loca ted in the town of C opán Ruinas, and th e installatio n of the Casa K'inich
Museum in its n ew lo cation at th e Fuerte. T he developm ent and acquisition of cultural and
environmental learning display materials to be used for the visitors, students and their families as
well as the developm ent of a co mmunity outreach program at the Casa K'inich were also
financed by the subcom ponent. According to th e impact evaluation, by Project completion, the
museum had already received more than 20,000 visitors.

10. A communication strategy was also developed to enhance public inform ation about the
archeological assets and m onuments and their relationship with the proposed A rcheological
Circuit in the Copán Va lley. To this end, the Pa rk web site was redesigned, public inform ation
was im proved using m ass m edia channels (i.e. newspapers, bulletins, radio), and a set of
pamphlets, maps and posters were produced to di sseminate events and special attractions offered
by the Park. Nevertheless, in a survey conducted during the impact evaluation 28 about 44 percent
of the Park visitors' complained that there were no sufficient available information on the history
of monuments in handout printed materials, which denotes a need to acco mmodate demand with
the production and distribution of public information materials. In addition, 12.5 percent referred
to lack of town maps with the location of its adjacent archeological parks, and 9.4 percent raised
the issue of insuf ficient inte rpretative signag e w ithin the Park m onuments, and lack of guide
books. However, the survey concludes that 85           percent of visitors--those who have at least
visited once the Park before the implem entation of the Project found the Park substantially
improved, well maintained grounds and improved presentation of monuments.

Subcomponent 1.2 ­ Eco-Archeological Park of Los Naranjos (US$ 1,602,509.00)

11. The Eco-Archeological Park of Los Naranjos, established in 2001, is located at the northern
shore of Lake Yojoa in the Depa rtment of Cortés, about 80 km south of San Pedro Sula and 155

km of Tegucigalpa. In 1995, the Lake Yojoa, w               ith its Mayan heritage assets was declared a
National Monument.

12. The Project assisted in the updating of the firs t Management Plan prepared for the Park in
1996 by Asociación Copán, which includes            a Social Enviro nmental Assessm ent and
recommendations linking the preservation of the archeological monuments with natural resource
management.

13. The Project also financed the execu tion of som e critical ac tivities pr ioritized in the Plan,
including: (i) the rehab ilitation and repaving o f the m ain access ro ad to the Park, (ii) the
construction of an obse rvation tower in wooden structure, with approxim ately 15 m eters of
height (Torre Mirador) to be used by bird watchers, (iii) the construction of a suspended bridge
(puente colgante) over the Rio Cangrejal, which was com pleted in June of 2007, a nd handed
over to the care and m aintenance of Fundacion Parque Nacional Pico Bonito (FUPNAPIB); (iv)
the construction of suspended paths (senderos sobre polines), and (v) the design and installation
of the guiding signage.

14. According to the im pact evaluatio n, these wo rks enhanced significantly the touristic
attractions in the Park. The susp ended paths with about 740 m eters in length were in substitution
to an old path which was found in advanced disr epair. The new path a llowed for the continuous
circulation of visitors after heavy rains flooded several areas of the Park in 2008.

15. The installation of a security sys tem and the construction of an Inte ractive Environmental
Learning Center, proposed during ap praisal, were not executed. Due to scarcity of resources, the
abovementioned activities were prioritized as s ubstitutes fo r the s ecurity system and Learning
Center. The survey conducted with visitors during the impact evaluation confirmed this decision
with 100 percent of the sam ple expressing that the security system of the Park w as "good".
While, about 50 p ercent considered the s ecurity of the Park hasn't chan ged, and 50 percent of
respondents found that it had improved. The survey also reveals that 93 percent of visitors to the
Park attributed to the value of the archeological assets as the m ain reason why they decided to
visit it. W hile, the secu rity conside rations rank ed in th ird place, an d parking f acilities a s th e
fourth consideration. The survey results suggest that the cancel lation in the execution of the
security system and expansion of th e parking sp ace in the P ark wouldn't have influ ence in the
expansion of number of visitors.29

16. The survey also rev ealed that 80 percen t of the vis itors indicated that "s ignificant
improvements" were made in the Pa rk, this referred mainly to the e levated paths (75 percent of
respondents).30

Subcomponent 1.3 ­ Archeological Park of El Puente (US$ 181,665.00)

17. Located in the Municip ality of La Jigua in the Departm ent of Copán, t he Archaeological
Park of El Puente is about an hour ride to the east of the Copán Park. The park's 5.5 hectare was
designated as an Archeological Zone in 1989 and has becom e Honduras' second most important
archeological park.31

18. Despite its accessib ility and proxim ity to Copá n, El Puente receives very few visitors . To
encourage visitors to d iscover El Pu ente, one of IHT strateg ies was to b uild a "May a Village"
(Aldea Maya) ­ a reconstruction of a traditional Maya living com pound with interpretation of
daily lif e ac tivities and a garden displaying a variety of nativ e plants and trees used by the
ancient Maya for their cuisine, medicine and construction purposes.

19. The Project financed the develop ment of the Management Plan for the Park,                 which
includes: (i) a topographic analysis of the area , (ii) guidelines for im provements of its public
facilities, (iii) promotion of research studies, (iv) guidelines for the im provement and expansion
of the Visitors Center and enhancem ent of m ain attractions, (v) p lan fo r the site in terpretation
signage, (vi) security infrastruc ture, and (vii) g uidelines f or the exp ansion of the tr ansmission
line or acquisition of a generator.

20. The Project also financed the p reparation of architectural design for building of the Aldea
Maya in the Park. The proposed Aldea Maya, however, was not built, following a request from
the Minister of Culture, who found that the se          lected area was inadequate both in size and
location--mainly due to the fact that it was within a flood pl ain. Despite the PCU efforts to
identify an alternative location for building the Aldea Maya, there were no suitable sites found in
the vicinity of the Park to r ealize this activity. L ikewise, the execution of the proposed works to
expand and equip the V isitors Center, construc tion and equipping of a centre of archeological
investigation, the expansion of the transm ission lines, improving the Park's v isitor secu rity
system, and improve monuments interpretation and guiding signage system, where not executed.

Subcomponent 1.4 ­ Archeological Site of Cerro Palenque (US$ 251,760.00)

21. Located only 40 km from the m ajor industrial town of San Pedro Sula, Cerro Palenque is
one of the least dev eloped archeo logical sites in the Copán Valley. W ith its strategic position
overlooking the confluence of the Ulúa and Com ayagua rivers, the Maya inhabitants of Cerro
Palenque controlled trade and acces s to the Valley, its heritage re mains make it one of the m ost
significant archaeological sites in the Valley, after Copán. The park is surrounded by natural
landscape that has regenerated and is now covere d with a secondary forest. The Archaeological
Site was established in 1997, whe       n IHAH ac quired 109 hectares of the area. No tourist
infrastructure, signage or trails, currently exists at Cerro Palenque.

22. The Project financed the preparation of the fi rst Management Plan fo r the Park. The Plan
includes (i) a Strategic Environm ental Asses sment f or the site, with re commendations f or its

31
   The Japanese Government funded the excavations in the Park, as part of the La Entrada Archeological Project,
starting in 1990. After four years of intensive research and conservation, El Puente opened its doors to the public on
January 20, 1994.

                                                         38
preservation, and for guiding arch eological works to be conducted, and (ii) a Natural Resource
Management Plan to restore and protect the Mayan site and its surroundings.

23. While no a ctivities pr ioritized in the Plan we re financed, its Mana gement Plan provides
important guidelines for the conservation and es       tablishment of the Site. Accor ding to th e
Management Plan of the Park, the Site contains a great quantity of Mayan archeological remains,
however it also po ints out to the array of tech nical dif ficulties in con ducting the conserva tion
works given the characteris tics of the architectu ral elements of the buildings. The research and
excavation conducted on the Site suggests that further decisi ons m ust be undertaken on the
preservation m anagement of the archeological asse ts at th e Archeological Site before defining
the tourist product that it may render.

Subcomponent 1.5 ­ Archeological Site of Plan Grande on Isla Guanaja (US$ 145,396.00)

24. The Project financed the development of the Management Plan for the Site, which includes
a Social and Environm ental Assessm ent with recommendations for preservation, and for the
archeological works to be conducted on the Site.

25. Other activities, such as the deve lopment of a Public Use P lan with r ecommendations for
future expansion of the site, could not be fina nced m ostly because the area b elongs to private
owners and an agreement was not reached during the Pro ject life, despite the IH T and PCU
efforts. Given that, IHT with the Bank task team agreed upon to cancel this Project
subcomponent after the finalization of the Management Plan.32

Component 2 - Income Generation Opportunities (US$ 1.96 million)

Subcomponent 2.1 ­ Income Generation (Fondo Prosperidad)

26. Fondo Prosperidad was established on January 13, 2005 a nd closed its act ivities on June
30, 2006, having operated for 18 months.

27. The PCU contracted a consu lting firm, CHF, to m anage Fondo Prosperidad.33 A specific
operational manual was prepared to guide sm all producer groups and individuals in the process
of applying to Fondo and infor mation on the procedures adopted for the approval of initiatives.
In addition, basic training was provided on how to apply to Fondo and prepare proposals.

28. Fondo Prosperidad was applied to the f ive p articipating municipa lities, with r espective
number of beneficiaries, na mely: Copán Ruinas (45) , Santa Rita (8), La Jigua (3), Pim ienta (5),

   CHF contract ranged from January 13, 2005 to September 30, 2006. The fo llowing activities and products were
stipulated in the CHF contract: (i) Financial management of Fondo Prosperidad; (ii) p reparation of timefram e and
work p lans; (i ii) p reparation o f th e set of criteria for the selection of beneficiaries of Fondo Prosperidad; (iv)
identification of t raining ne eds, design o f t raining a nd pl an f or C apacity st rengthening/technical assi stance; (v )
provision of technical guidance on marketing products or services by the small businesses; and (vi) preparation of
outcome indicators.

and Santa C ruz de Yojoa (8). According to th e economic analysis, 65 pe rcent of the businesses
supported and 61 percent of the Fondo Prosperidad grants were allocated in the Municipality of
Copán Ruinas given its proxim ity to the Archeological P ark of Copán, the m ost im portant
tourism destination in the region.

29. A pre-feasibility study was c onducted to identify the prof itable niche m arkets for the
development of tourism-related income generation opportunities. Based on the results of the pre-
feasibility study, Fondo Prosperidad financed 6 9 business es (out of 500 proposals s ubmitted).
This was more than double of th e proposed goal set at appraisal (30). According to the im pact
analysis, at the end of the first year of functioning, 91 percent of the businesses assisted were still

Delivery

33. As part of the Subcom ponent 2.2, a database was created containi ng local residents and
human resources of Copán dedicated to the tour ism sector activities. A total of 7 specialized
workshops were delivered with 180 participants.

34. Local residents received technical training in a range of skills needed for the develop ment
and enhancem ent of the archeological parks and sites. Training m odules in environm ental and
archeological preservation works were prepared and conducted to selected individuals to become
archeological ass istants and guides for the arch eological parks and sites, in Copán and Los
Naranjos; in total it prepared 40 new tourist guides.

35. Moreover, a training co urse in archeology, with duration of 4 m onths, including the range
of conceptu al, technical and pract ical asp ects, was offered to tr ain as sistants in archeological
work. Twenty-four individuals received such training, almost half of the Project appraisal goal at
60 individuals.34

36. Training was also provided to enhance cultural tourism services delivery and the quality of
tourism products, targeted to tourism operators and m unicipal staff working in the tourism
sector, with 116 participants.

Component 3 - Institutional Development (US$ 5.38 million)

37.     Component 3 ai med at strengthening the           capacities in tourism developm ent and
communication of public administration agencies as well as civil society and the private sector at
national, regional and local levels. I t included the following activities: (a) institutional capacity
strengthening aim ed at IHT, IHAH, and SCAD;            (b) technical assistance and training for
municipalities to prepare a strateg ic plan fo r tourism de velopment; (c) the preparation of
marketing and promotion strategy for IHT; (d) a social communications strategy for the Project,
and (e) support to the Project Coordination        Unit (PCU) and the Projec t's m onitoring and
evaluation system.

38. Component 3 also supported the Project            management, including adm inistrative and
fiduciary responsibilities. Most activities proposed in this         component were successfully
completed and sign ificantly streng thened th e relationship between the central and local
government and civ il society. A key elem ent for this success can be attribu ted to pro ject
execution activ ities being decentral ized to th e Copán Valley, ins tead of the cap ital city. Th e
forged partnerships w ere critical to ensu re ownership and general consensus on Project
objectives as well as to harm onize the central gove rnment and local population's priorities. In
this environm ent, it was possible to foster eff ective institutional streng thening. Four im portant
activities w ere added and im plemented under this com ponent: (i) the renovation of           Forte
Cabañas, (ii) the upgrading of the Municipal Market in Copán Ruinas; (iii) the enhancement of
Copán Rui nas town image (` fachada municipal'), and ( iv) the constru ction of the landf ill and
road access in Santa Rita.

Subcomponent 3.1 ­ Local Institutional Strengthening and Communications

39. The Urban Planning Office in Copán Ruinas developed an Urban Development Plan for the
town with the ultim ate goal of transfor ming C opán Ruinas im age and growth path. The Plan
included a series of programs that aimed at preserving the town's historic fabric, the recuperation
of green areas and the improvement of natural resource management.

40. The Plan established, for the first tim e in the region, guidelines for ur ban cultural planning
and developm ent. Based on the Plan, the Urba n Planning Office carried out the following
activities: ( i) the esta blishment o f regula tions and procedures fo r the approval of new
construction plans and /or restoration of dwelling s in Copán Ruinas; (ii) the econom ic valuation
of m unicipal buildings; (iii) an urban transit and traffi     c training program ; and (iv) the
development of regulations for outdoors and busi ness' signage and select ion of a palette of
colors applied for build ing facades. In two years, the u rban design regu lations were applied to
nearly 500 new constru ction projects and/or renovation works submitted to the Urb an Planning
Office for its review and approval of permits.

41. Underpinning the striking and fast results       of this program was the Municipality full
institutional support to the process of developing and enforcing the new norms and regulations.

42. Another feature was the public aw areness bu ilding and consultations prom oted by the
Urban Planning Office. Each regulation and norm es tablished was previously debated within the
Municipality and its Council, and later public disseminated through TV, radio and brochures.

43. The Office also prov ided for mal training in environmental awareness and trans it n orms.
Table 8 below presents some of the for mal training provided. A range of infor mal lectures and
trainings in urban renewal in general were provided to the local inhabitants, which have not been
recorded by the PCU.

44.      Civil society partic ipated active ly in th e design and implem entation of the Urban
Development Plan. For instance, the town's inhabitants defined the name and the symbols of the
streets in a participatory m anner through workshops facilitated by the Urban Office staff. In the
contest for the "Clean Neighborhood" Program           , citizen s were m obilized and, through a
competitive process, re ceived incen tives to im prove the urb an environ ment of their r espective
neighborhoods.




                                                43
45.    Throughout the process, the Urban Planning O ffice engaged other m unicipal officials to
ensure the buy-in and institutionalization of its activities within the municipal technical structure.
The Municipal Tourism Unit was especially strengthened, and now it convenes the
Administrative Committee that will be managing Forte Cabañas.

46. The Urban Planning Office also developed a plan to transf er its knowledge, m anuals, and
capacity development to the municipal authorities and officials of Copán Ruinas.

47. Consequently, when the opportunity to use       unspent Project funds from a cancelled
subcomponent, it was decided, in consultation with the population, that one of most im portant
symbols of the town, the Municipal Market and the town's gateway, should be restored.

Subcomponent 3.2 ­ Project Coordination Unit and Monitoring and Evaluation

48. This subcomponent financed the establishm ent of the Project Coordination Unit (P CU) in
the capital town and a branch of the PCU in Co pán Ruinas (Urban Planning Office). Personnel
specialized in financial management and procurement, among other areas, was hired. Consultants
were recruited to provide training and carry   out studies related to project im plementation.
Equipments were acquired for the PCU. An operations manual was developed.

49. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system was also established and the baseline survey
prepared.

Additional Activities financed by the Project

50. Three additional activities were executed, in     part, with the reallo cated funds from the
cancellation of the activities proposed in Subcomponent 1.5 ­ Archeological Site of Plan Grande
on Isla Guanaja. The Project funds were re allocated for the construc tion of: (i) the expansion
and restoration of the Municipal Market, (ii) upgrading of the Copán Ruinas Gateway, and (iii) a
Landfill in the Municipality of Santa Rita.

Restoration and Expansion of the Municipal Market

51. Upon the PCU and the Municipality of Copán Ruinas request, the Urban Planning Office
prepared architectural p lans for the resto ration and expansion of the Municipal Market, which
aimed at (i) preserving the building's historic integrity, (ii) expanding the commercial area of the
market, (iii) im proving public circ ulation areas, and (iv) converti ng the m arket into a tou rist
attraction. The expansion of the commercial area would also allow absorb ing into the m arket
artisans and street vendors, thus solving the issues of congested sidewalks, traffic circulation, and
ultimately improve the town's image.

52. The construction, which began in December 2007, was alm ost concluded in March 2009,
time of last supervision m ission. Project funds we re only sufficient to re store one side of the
market, which is the most visible from the main streets of the town. The Project-financed activity
expanded in 75 percent the comm ercial area of the m arket, upgraded public bathroom s, and



                                                 44
restored an d pain ted the exterio r façades of the m arket. The only work pend ing was th e
installation of doors of the new stores.

53. The Municipality was very pleased with the re sults of the restoration and expansion that it
decided to request a loan from a private Bank to restore and expand the other side of the market.

Enhancing the Copán Ruinas Gateway

54. As part of the strategy to revitalize the town's image, the Municipality and citizens decided
to transform the m ain entrance to the town as a tourist attraction, as this area connects the
Archeological Park of Copán to the town.

55. The plan included the restoration and constructi on of the new external walls f or the soccer
field, upgrading of public bathro   om facilities, restoration of the stadium 's façade, and
landscaping of the site.

56. The construction works were concluded           in May 2008. The population indicated its
satisfaction with the results and requested that the Municipality invested in replacing the grass in
the stadium. The soccer field became the most important leisure space for the local communities,
and the res toration of the field increased atte ndance to th e weekly soccer gam es, as well the
security structure provided--it also improved significantly the town's image.

Construction of Santa Rita's Landfill

57. The Municipality of Santa Rita--located about 9 km south of Copán Ruinas, was identified
as one of the im portant environm ental zon es within th e a rea of Pr oject influence. In lieu of a
dumpsite, its garbage was often left on the side ways of the highway th at connects Santa Rita
with Copán Ruinas. Often the garbage piles were incinerated at the improvised dumpsite leaving
a seriou s n egative im pact on env ironmental hea lth affecting both m unicipalities, as well as
tourists who passed by the highway were exposed         to this hazard. In this context, and in
consistency with the Project goal of supporting act ivities with a regional development im pact,
the PCU and the local governm ent came to an a greement, with the Bank approval, to use som e
of the Project's rem aining funds for the cons truction of a landfill in Santa Rita an d an access
road linking to the landfill.

58. An environmental assessment was conducted pr ior to the constructi on and no m ajor issues
were raised. The landfill occupies an area of 3.486 hectares and is located about 3 km away from
the town. Given that th e present daily production of solid waste is less than 7.67 tons, it was
decided that the operations of compression an d confinement c ould be executed with m anual
tools, and therefore the landfill would be a M anual Sanitary Landfill. According to the term s of
reference, the landf ill has a lif e expectancy o f 20 years. The construction of the landfill was
concluded in December 2008.

59. The access road lead ing to the la ndfill in Santa Rita, which suffered dam ages by the
landslides caused in the rain storm s of 2008, wa s duly repaired. The landfill started o perating in
March 2009 . However, the task team found that th e use of the lan dfill was n ot followin g

                                                 45
adequate norm s and procedures. Training for so lid waste m anagement had been provided in
December 2008, but ap parently it was insufficient to instruct the pop ulation on ways to ado pt
environmental habits for safe disposal of so lid waste and the personnel responsible for the
landfill's use and management.36

Technical Assistance Support from PHRD Grant

60. In 2005, a PHRD grant on the am ount of US$ 400.000 was awarded to IHT--the Project
and Grant implem entation agency, to design a nd im plement the follow ing Project support
activities: (i) design an d im plementation of community stre ngthening and capacity building
activities; skills development and training f or workers and gu ides in the archeological parks and
sites (Component 1); (ii) suppo     rt for the capacity building      in tourism service delivery
(Component 2); (iii) supported incom         e generation opportunities funded through       Fondo
Prosperidad (Component 2); (iv) integrated a particip atory strategy into th e existing Monitoring
and Evaluation plan (C omponent 3); and (v) suppor t preparation of infor mation m aterials and
public on environmental awareness for dissemination purposes (Component 1). The PHRD was
requested m ainly to strengthen local capacity an d to bu ild awareness of m arket preparedness
among indi viduals, co mmunities, and enterp rises in advance of and in coordin ation with th e
launching of the competitive Fondo Prosepridad funds.37

Technical Assistance Support from PHRD Grant

61.     In 2005, a PHRD Grant on the am ount of US$ 400,000.00 was awarded to IHT. The
Grant covered the following constraints identified at an early stage of the Project implementation
and not fully addressed during the Project design, includin g: (i) lack of upfront pre-investm ent
strategy for Com ponent 2 (Incom e Generation Oppor tunities) necessary to inform individuals
and producer groups on how to participate in Fondo Properidad, (ii) limited funds for capacity
strengthening on local economic development, (iii) lack of a part icipatory M&E system, and (iv)
lack of resources for environmental awareness activities.

Activities financed by the Grant and its results

62.    The Grant financed consultancy services and training activities critical for the satisfactory
implementation of the Copán Project and attain the income generation goals of the Project. The
Grant supported im plementation of the fo           llowing P roject ac tivities: (i) design and
implementation of skills developm ent and traini ng for workers and guides in the a rcheological
parks and sites (Com ponent 1); (i i) support for the capacity streng thening in tourism enterprises
(Component 2); (iii) integrate a participatory strategy into the existing monitoring and evaluation

63.   The impact evaluation and economic analyses reports were also financed by the Grant.

64. The other activities financed by the Grant befo re closing were: (i) workshops and training
activities re lated to solid waste m anagement in the Municipality of Sa nta Rita in Septem ber
2008, and (ii) a workshop to dissem inate the Proj ect results in Decemb er 2008 in Tegucigalpa.
There are no recorded num ber of participants in both workshops and no evidence of the actual
outcome of solid waste management training. Due to the timing of the evaluations, they were not
able to as sess if solid waste tr aining led to any behavioral changes in the community and
municipal staff.

      Component B ­ Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation
      Component C ­ Environmental Awareness

66. The overall outcom e of the th ree components was considered satisfactory by the impact
evaluation and the economic analyses.

67. Component A financed consulta ncy services and training activities aimed to ensure that
benefits generated from the Project-assisted t ourism activitie s were adequate ly captured by
individuals and loca l c ommunities. It p rovided resour ces f or stagin g an ar ray of learn ing
seminars aimed to improve the quality of touris m services, as well as p romote greater awareness
on the im portance of preserving Mayan cultural         her itage assets an d local env ironmental
endowments. Furtherm ore, as the selection of Fondo Prosperidad beneficiaries began, it also
became clear that there was a need to prepare th e future micro entrepreneurs for the m arket and
business dem ands. The trainings, workshops and consultancy services financed by the Grant
were the refore es sential to enha nce beneficiaries' capacity in a range of skills and business
competences to attain the income generation and poverty reduction goals aimed by the Project.

68.     The technical assistance provided to the co mmunity m embers (e.g., training in touris m
services) and to th e micro enterprises financed by Fondo Prosperidad was highly rated by the
participants, and 80 percent of th e financed businesses were succe ssful, according to the im pact
evaluation analysis carried out by an independent consultant firm.

69.     However, there was a generalized perception among participants of this Component that
the market preparedness training received was insufficient, and that there was a lack of follow up
technical as sistance in that area. Also, th e eco nomic analysis identified a lack o f technical
assistance in som e key areas, such as fi nancial m anagement. The grants provided by Fondo
Prosperidad and the technical assistance supported by th e Grant did not contribute substantially
to connect the beneficiaries with the banks and other financial institutions.

70. Component B called for engaging consultancy services to de velop capacity for a more
participatory approach to M&E, through provision of a series of learning workshops and training
activities to be ca rried out in the proje ct a reas. This ap proach was c onsidered essentia l to
encourage active participation of beneficiaries in M&E process.

71. The Component supported the preparation of the im pact evaluation and economic analyses
reports. The participatory M&E system was integr ated into the Proje ct management structure,
and its direct linkage with the A nnual W ork Pl ans contributed to an optim um yield in the
execution level by allowing regular revisions and timely analysis of the completed activities in
relation to programmed goals.

72. Component C m ade provisions for hiring specialized consu ltant services to prepare
information and training m aterials and traini ng m odules with the aim to enhance public
environmental awareness as part of the Project implementation. Activities financed before the
Project closing were: (i) workshops and training activities related to Solid W aste Management,
carried out in the m unicipality of Santa Rita, carried out in in September of 2008. The grant
financed food and transportation expenses; and ( ii) a workshop to dissem inate results of the
project, carried out in December in Tegucigalpa.39

73. The im pact evaluatio n indicates that         the dissem ination m aterials, publications,
presentations and training have contributed      to increas e public env ironmental awareness,
particularly in the Municipality of Copán Ruinas.

Grant Management

74. Execution: The Grant was executed satisfactorily       with 99.19% of disbursem ent. The
remaining 0.81% (US$ 3,241.60) was returned to       the Bank, as per Bank procedures. These
resources h ad been originally allocated to tw o activ ities: ( i) des ign and installa tion of
interpretation signage system in Los Naranjos Pa rk, and (ii) training of guides in L os Naranjos
Park.

75. Audits: The Grant audits have been com pleted and the reports were all unqualified. There
were only m inor inter nal con trol issues ra ised in the re ports tha t d id not af fect the Gran t
implementation.

76. Extension o f PHRD Grant Closing Date : The Grant activities were tied to the Credit
implementation activities. The GOH requested and the Bank grante d two extensions for Project
and PHRD Grant implementation, as previously explained in paragraph 1.7.4.

77. Reallocation of funds : The Bank also agreed to reallocate US$ 22,737 t o the Consultant
Services category from the Trai ning and W orkshops category. These funds were used to hire
consultant services for the prep aration of the interpretation signa ge system, and for the training
of tourist guides in Los Naranjos Park. However, these activities were not com pleted given that
the PCU in Copán was closed in October 2008,           and the last contracts for the Project staff

39
     Note: The PCU did not provided the exact number of participants of the abovementioned workshops.

                                                        48
working in the PCU in Tegucigalp a ended in December 2008. As a result, no Project staff was
available to follow up and com plete these activi ties--which had suffered a significant delay due
to the heavy rains that affected the entire country in the period of September/October 2008.

Bank Supervision

78. The Bank team provided tim ely support to the PCU throughout the Grant im plementation.
The team also early identified the need for additional training in areas such as trade and financial
management, marketing and touristic services, and alerted the PCU and part ners of the need to
promote activities that would ensure the su stainability of the business financed under Fondo
Prosperidad in the lon g term . During the f ield vis its, however, the Bank team could have
supervised more closely the t echnical assistance given to Fondo Prosperidad beneficiaries an d
provided more hands on support to the PCU and part ners on ways to address these issues, by, for
instance, following-up the techn ical visits to th e enterprises and revis ing the con tents of the
training courses.

Japanese Government Visibility

79. Several measures were taken to ens ure the v isibility of the J apanese Government. First, at
the beginning of each w orkshop or presentation of studies financed by the Grant, th e PCU staff
always m entioned that the im plementation of those activities was possible because of the
resources donated by the Japanese Governm ent. Second, beginning in 2005, the Municipality of
Copán Ruinas launched an annual event - The W eek of J apan - in honor to the 70 years of
support from the Government of Japan to Honduras. The Japanese Ambassador to Honduras and
the Minister of Touris m participated in the in auguration of this annua l event, which included
activities, s uch as an a rt cr aft exhibition that displayed products from the m icro entrepreneurs
financed by the Project and the gran t. The t-shir ts produced and wore by the participants in the
inauguration event, in 2005, had the flags of Honduras and of Japan.

Main lessons learned

80. In hindsight, the Project would have benefitted by carrying out an ex-ante assessment of
the needs and opportunities for skills enhancement in order to inform the preparation of an
effective technical assistance component. Effective local econom                      ic developm ent
programs/activities require an up-fro nt mapping of the local econom ic conditions, o pportunities
and resources to ensure that th e selection of businesses types and line of products corresponds
with the m arketplace dem ands and fit consu mer trends. The techn ical as sistance program
provided to Fondo Properidad beneficiaries, for exam ple, could have been a bit longer in
duration and m ore diversified to effectively ad dress an ov erall l ack of experience in busin ess
management. During the supervision visits, some of the m icro entrepreneurs indicated that the
training length was not sufficient, and that th e technical support provided after the train ing was
not either not reliable o r inadequate. Similar activities would benefit fr om: (i) the provision of
technical assistance support for at least one year after the first disb ursement; (ii) continuous
evaluation of the training contents and relevance to ensure that the adeq uate assistance is being
provided; (iii) technical assistance tailored to the cultural specificities of the different sectors and
characteristics of the beneficiaries (eg. indigenous population language).

                                                  49
81. Effective institutional, organizational and human skills enhancement require a strategic
perspective, larger time horizon and a continued support in order to be sustained over a period
of time. On the positive side, the institutionaliz     ation of the PCU within the m    unicipal
administration structure of Copán Ruinas confor ms to a best pra ctice in te rms of capacity
strengthening approach. The PCU managed to build a competent team under the leadership of an
experienced architec t/urban planner, which in turn m entored and trained a cadre of younger
planners and m anagers to continue working w ithin the m unicipal administration. The technical
assistance for public sector sk ills enhancem ent was part of the Project and Grant original
objectives. However, the capacity streng thening for loca l public ad ministration--part of the
Component A, lacked a clear strategy, and, hen ce a training agenda, which proved to be a
hindrance in launching the initially intended training program.

                                Economic and Financial Analysis


Appraisal and Closing Financial and Economic Analyses

1. Two financial and econ omic analys es were carri ed out for the Project, one at prep aration
(2003) and the other at completion (2007).

2. At preparation, the financial and economic analysis suggested that the Project would help to
realize the potential of the inst alled capacity of the tourist i ndustry in the region and prom ote
growth in the [Honduran] tourism industry by:          (i) investing in public and in private goods
(preservation works in the sel ected parks and sites), (ii) ge nerating job opportunities through
Fondo Prosperidad (and therefore increase incom e of the population living in its areas of
influence), (iii) increasing the inflow of visitors in the region and their daily expenditure, and (iv)
diversifying attractions by developing new sites near Copán (cf. PAD Annex 4).

3. Projections were m ade based on data from IHT's Establishm ent Inventory and Tourism
Spending Survey, which since 2000 has collected information on number of visitors, length of
stay and spending per visit/day, se parating the reported to tals ac cording to the visitor' s orig in.
These data were valid ated and adju sted based o n the information directly acquired in site visits
and in key infor mant interviews, carried out by the appraisal team . The econom ic analysis also
drew on lab or market data from GoH's nationa l bi-annual multi-purpose household survey an d
on data on the cost structure of the tourism industry gathered specially for this study.

4. For analysis purposes, the estim ations perf ormed in the PAD provided two possible
scenarios: with medium expectations and with high expectations.

5. At closing, the financial and economic evaluation estimated the net present value (NPV) and
the internal rate of return (IRR) of the Pr oject over a 15 years period between 2003 and 2017.
Calculations were perform ed at appraisal (2003) and at the clos ing of the project (2007), which
allowed contrasting and improving the projections originally estimated in the PAD.

6. The core of the calculations is the p rojected flow of tourists in the Archaeological Park of
Copán between 2003 and 2017. Based on this projection and data from IHT, it was estimated the
income stream generated by the tourism sector in Copán due to the Pr oject im plementation.
From this income stream the investment costs and other costs were discounted in order to obtain
the net income stream.

7. Assuming a fixed discount rate of 11.5 percent over the net income stream, it was concluded
that th e net present valu e (NPV ) of the Project would be US $ 6.1 m illion in the "moderate"
scenario an d US$ 25 m illion in the "high" s cenario acc ording to th e PAD estim ations. The
economic evaluation co nducted in 2 007 re-estimated the NPV taking in to account th e observed
net incom e stream between 2003 and 2007 and obtained a positive NPV of US$ 29 m illion,
which is a 16 percent above the "high" scenario.



                                                  51
8. According to the PAD scenarios, the internal rate of return (IRR), the discount rate that
equates the NPV to zero, would reach 20.7 percent in the "moderate" scenario and 46 .7 percent
in the "high" scenario. However, the asse ssment obtained by the 2007 econom ic evaluation
calculated an internal rate of return close to 79 percent, which is 69 percent above the "high"
scenario.

ICR Economic Analysis

9. The ICR team also carried out an econom ic an alysis in order to identify and m easure the
causal effects of the Project outcom es. This an alysis focused on Com ponents 1 and 2, with the
following e xpected ou tcomes: incr eased ( i) nu mber of visitors, ( ii) per capita inco me and (iii)
employment opportunities.

10. The methodology adopted a treatm ent and a cont rol group. Given the Project focus on the
archeological tourist sector and the fact tha t its investments were geographically located in the
western zone of Honduran, a pr oper counterfactual group ­ ba sed on a different geographical
location ­ was not observable. In turn, becaus e of the close correlatio n of the outcom es at the
national and the departm ental levels, it was assum ed, from a very conservative persp ective, that
in the absen ce of the Project, th e natural trend of its expected outcom es would be sim ilar to the
national level. From this approach, the national level would play the role of the control group ­
pseudo control group.

11. Once the control group was established, the Pr oject causal effects were isolated by using a
Difference in Difference (DiD) strategy. This methodology consists of m easuring the average
change in a given indicator within two periods    ­ before and after th e intervention, for both
treatment and control groups, and then comp      aring the changes for the two groups. The
differences between the two groups reflect the isolated causal effect of the Project, as presented
in the tables below.

12. Main Findings

       Increased number of visitors to the Archeological Park of Copán: It was observed an
       increase in the number of visitors to the Archeological Park of Copán. Between 2001 and
       2007, the annual visitor growth ra te of the park was 11 percent. During the sam e period
       the national level showed r oughly the sam e trend (11.3 perc ent). Assuming the nationa l
       tourist sector as control group, there is insufficient evidence to show that the positive
       trend in the tourist sector in Copán is due solely to the Project implementation.

       Increased per capita income: Although per capita incom e in Copán follows a sim ilar
       trend observed nationally during 2001­2007 peri od, the gap between these series has
       been reduced significantly. The annual growth rate of Copá n's per capita incom e was 8
       percent while the national rate was 4 percent.

       Increased job creation: The Project estim ated an annual increase of 2.7 percent in the
       number of jobs created between 2003      and 2008 for the residents surrounding the
       Archeological Park of Copán. In turn, the observed annual ra te was 4.7 pe rcent at the

                                                 52
               tourist national level and 8 percent for the park residents. Assuming the national behavior
               as the natural trend in absence of the Projec t, at least a 3.8 percen t of the annual increase
               in the number of jobs might be partially attributed to the Project.

Origin and Justification

1. Honduras is endowed with rich natural and cultural resources, yet it is ranked as the third
poorest country in Latin Am erica, and has a hi gh incidence of extreme poverty found in rural
areas. These resources and endowment are being threatened by the inappropriate use of land,
degradation of water resources and poor planning and management.

2. In order to prom ote economic growth, Honduras is carrying out a strategy to further develop
the tourism industry, capitalizing on its exceptional natural resources and cultural endowments.

3. Tourism is considered one of the econom ic ac tivities with highest growth rates w orldwide
and has demonstrated a great pot ential in the generation of e mployment opportunities, cultural
exchanges, and contributions toward fiscal resources and poverty alleviation.

4. The GoH received the credit 3764-HO from the International Development Agency (IDA),
which financed the Regional Developm ent Project in the Copán Valley, executed by the Project
Coordination Unit (PC U), locate d within the Honduran Institu te of Tourism (IHT). The main
objective of the Project is to promote national and local touris m through the proper m anagement
and appropriate use of cultural a nd natural resources in the Copán Valley, and to establish the
necessary mechanisms to ensure its long term sustainability.

Project Objective

5. The Regional Development Project in the Copán Valley aimed at development of sustainable
tourism based on the natural and cultural patrimony of the Copán Valley. This objective was
also applied towards creating investm     ent oppor tunities for the private sector, generating
employment and reducing poverty, in one of the poorest regions of Honduras.

6. It was exp ected that th e Project w ould m eet the aforem entioned ob jective th rough the
following proposed line of actions:
       Creation of a tourism circuit in the Copán Valley, integrating the Archeological Parks of
       Copán , El Puente and Los Naranjos, with th e Archeological Sites of Cerro Palenque and
       Plan Grande, and the provision of a sust       ainable environm ental managem ent plans
       covering the 3 parks and 2 sites and their surrounding areas, in order to reduce the
       negative impacts caused by poverty, deforestation, erosion and natural disasters;
       Provision of environm ental education course s addressing the biodi versity and natural
       characteristics of the region;
       Capacity str engthening to enhanc e technical sk ills and ab ilities linked to em ployment
       opportunities related to the development of parks and cultural-tourism guides;
       Strategic planning for the development of tourism service sector among key communities
       and private and public stakeholders;
       Provide training and technical assistance to ex pand m icro and sm all enterprises in the
       production of alternative services among businesses owned by local population, including
       indigenous groups, tour operators , and m unicipal staff with the objective to im prove the



                                               60
       quality of services, generate income and in    crease th e av erage s tay o f visito rs, and
       promoting a better climate for local investment.

7.   The project activities were grouped into three key components:

8.   Component 1: Integrated Development of Archeological Parks, included design and
     implementation of touris m inf rastructure works, preparation of plans for the archeo logical
     parks and site management guidelines, included under the Project. Component 1 financed:
     (i) Preparation and i mplementation of the m anagement plan for the archeological park of
          Copán , including educational and cultural activities related to the environment; and
     (ii) Preparation of park/sites m anagement pl ans, and their implem entation, focusing on
          priority issues identified in El Puente, Los Naranjos, Cerro Palenque and Plan Grande
          parks and sites.

9.   Component 2: Income Generation Opportunities, included a training program                 and
     incentives (i.e. grants) f or the development of income generation opportunities aimed at the
     local population in the f ramework of the Project, particularly targeted for the low income
     groups. Component 2 financed:
     (i) Local training, skills Capacity developm ent, and training for archeological assistants,
          guides, and workers required in the domain of tourism services;
     (ii) Income generation opportunities, assistance in the preparation of pre-feasibility studies,
          identification of econom ically viable m arket niches, training and technical assistance
          for `vulnerable' social groups, and Fondo Prosperidad, to finance sub-pr ojects tailored
          to the market niches identified under the pre-feasibility study.

10. Component 3: Institutional Development and Municipal Strengthening Support, included
    the design and training courses for Capaci     ty strengtheninig in tourism and cultural
    management aimed for public, private and nonpro fit participants, both at local and national
    level. Component 3 financed:
    (i) Trainings and communications
    (ii) Staffing and equipping the Project Coordi    nation Unit (PCU), and establishing a
         monitoring and evaluation system.

Subsequently, urban planning and de sign activities for the Municipa lity of Copán Ruinas were
included under this component.

Compliance with Project Objectives

11. The Project objectives established at the outset were very ambitious. To assess the impact of
project activities required to wait beyond the project's execution peri od (i.e. project cycle). This
point is best exem plified by the proposed arch eological park circuit. Although the planning and
management activities are underway, the establishment of the archeo logical circuit as such will
take more than the allo cated 5 years period of the project tim eline. What can be as sessed with
greater precision (sp ecificity) is the development of planned ac tivities and their satisf actory
execution.

Component 1: Integrated Development of Archeological Parks

12.    Component 1 results included:

(i)    Project activities in compliance with the policies and regulations for the conservation of the
       natural and cultural patrim ony of the region. This was achieved thro ugh a participatory
       process of public mobilization and consensus built41 amongst the communities' members in
       the sphere of influence of the parks and sites that integrate the archeological circuit.

(ii)   Important investments made in the Archeological Park of Copán and in the Municipality in
       which it is located, including the following subcomponent:
          Park Management Plan and Public Use Plan prepared and in use
          Rosalila tunnels consolidated, leading to important archeological discoveries
          Upgraded building installations of the Center for Archeological Research (CRIA)
          Signage and interpretative system prepared and in use
          Canopy for sculptures protection installed
          Restoration of the Sculpture Museum ceiling
          Upgraded public bathrooms
          Main entrance gate renovated
          Canopy covering the Escalinata Jeroglífica installed
          Adopted effective conservation m anagement actions aim ed at the natural and cultural
          patrimony, leaving a po sitive public im pression, expressed by scien tists, practitioners,
          communities and visitors in general

(iii) The relatively modest investments made in Los Naranjos Park resulted in:
         Rehabilitation of the suspended pathways at the Yojoa Lake
         Study completed for the signage and interpretation of the Park's monuments
         Erecting an observation tower for bird watching

(iv) Investments m ade in El Puente and interv entions in Cerro Palenque and Plan G                           rande,
focused on the preparation of their respective site management plans.

Component 2: Income Generation Opportunities

13.    Component 2 results included:

(i)    Assisted to establish and/or strengthen 69 small businesses, which promoted and enhanced
       participation of women and indigenous groups in the tourism sector.
(ii)   Training courses provided in the areas of pub lic relations, adm inistration, environm ental
       legislation, accounting, cultu ral tourism, archeological research, am ong others, resulted in
       enhanced sk ills and im proved Capacity to id entify work o pportunities in serv ice sector
       linked to cultural and natural ,at individual and at community levels;

   Note: the Borrower report in Sp anish refers to "socialization of objectives" which can be interpreted as reach ing
social consensus as to the means and ends of the proposed interventions.


                                                         62
(iii) Provided technical training co urses aim ed for gainful em         ployment linked to park
      development, for guides, etc.
(iv) Provided training for a cadre of archeological assistants

14.    Component 3: Institutional Development and Municipal Strengthening Support

15.    The results of Component 3 included:

(i)   The creation of the Urban Planning Office in        the Municipality of Copán Ruinas,
      institutionalized or "em powered it" within local administrative structure, while it elevated
      project's visibility. This, in turn, enabled  the expansion of a range of activities being
      financed. The recognition for the work carri ed out by UPO, both by key actors and the
      general population is widely expressed and in a sense it is a valid reference of the s uccess
      of this initiative.
(ii) Enhanced value of the historic m unicipal buildings such as Fuerte Cabañas, the Municipal
      Market, and the town's entry gate, etc.
(iii) Urban Developm ent Plan, Landscaping Plan and Natural R esource Conservation Study
      prepared and implemented in Copán Ruinas.

Results and Unexpected Impacts

      1. Institutionalized the following activities:
          The establishment of a community based activity aimed at environmental conservation
            through open com petition for the "Selection of the cleanes t neighborhood" in Cop án
            Ruinas
          The artisan market Agustina, which adds a new tourism product in Copán
          The Japan Festival


      2. Municipal Support
          Population willingness to participate to improve Copán's urban image;
          Promoting new signage system and street addressing.


         3. Expansion of APC
          Re-launched discussions with private sector regarding nego tiations with the State o n
            the privately held lands, in order to expa nd the buffer zone of APC, is among one o f
            the unexpected project impacts

Innovative Aspects of the Project

Decentralization of project execution ­ The establishm ent of an executive and adm inistrative
unit, a t th e projec t s ite ­ th e Urban Planning Office, and hiring of an in ter-institutional an d
multidisciplinary team , facilita ted th e im plementation of a nationa l d evelopment strategy in a
sustainable manner. In addition, it fostered optim al use of availa ble resources and strengthened
the ties between the policy objectives of the government with the private sector operations.

Lessons Learned

Institutional Capacity building ­ In future projects, it is c rucial to c learly establish at the outse t
the type, outreach and conditions of institutional capacity bu ilding activities, given that le aving
this open en ded may lead to the can cellation of this activity, as it h appened with th e PDRVC,
hindering the possibility of improving capacities within the executing institu tion. Thus, m issing
an opportunity to invest in human capital formation at the project executing agencies.

Ambitious Impact Indicators ­ The selected im pact indicators were too ambitious, with regards
to the activities being developed under each of the project's subcomponents. Moreover, given the
changes made in project activities, these should ha ve led to the adjustment of the initial project
indicators--in lieu of adjustm ents these indica tors should not have been used to continue
evaluating project results.

Identification of technical partners ­ The identification and hiring of strategic partners to provide
expert inputs in project design and execution for two of the three project components contributed
to address possible challenges in project execution; given the ample practical ex perience in
dealing with archeological parks and income generation activities .

Simplifying the M&E system as an applicable and accessible instrument ­ The construction of a
complex M&E system used for assessing project pr ogress tended to be very hard to i mplement,
raised project costs and did not necessarily bring about a bette r project execution. The project
launched the M&E process essentially linke d to the project's annual plan (aka POA), through a
system of revisions and analysis of goal compliance this was incorporated into the organizational
culture (i.e. PCU/IHT), and enabled an optimal performance in terms of levels of execution.

Contracting of follow-up and technical assistance in archeological issues ­ The challenge faced
in im plementing a project with a com ponent dea ling with a very specia lized dom ain, such as
archeology, was solved at the proj ect design phase, with the hiri ng of a specialized and teste d
technical organization--the Asociacion Copán , competent to prepare ToRs, and act as a technical
interlocutor. It also provided supervision follow-up of the wo rks being executed as well as
consultancy services contracted by the PCU for activities linked to the parks.

Consolidation of an Inter Institutional Team ­ The consolidation of an inter-institutional team
integrated by representatives of PCU-IHT,     IHAH and AC, working jointly, f acilitated and
increased the efficiency of the remodeling and construction works undertaken in the parks and
sites.

Clarity in work performance ­ Clarity of the technical team in terms of their respective functions
and roles and how these roles affected the syner gy attained at the Project Unit. High sense of
belonging and clarity among the technical team as to the importance of their activities had on the
tourism sector helped achieving the stated objectives.

Dissemination process and training in Fondo Prosperidad ­ The public inform ation
dissemination process of FP activit ies and the range of possibili ties it offered local population
groups and beneficiary municipali ties, particularly through the wo rkshops organized in the early

                                                   64
mobilization stages, en abled a f irst cut in th e sele ction process f or it p rovided screen ing
elements-- the profile of beneficiaries and the conditions set to access the grant funds. This initial
process spared the technical team from undertaking lengthy and unnecessary investment analysis
of proposals presented beyond the sc ope and objectives set by FP, while for the participants
from undertaking useless efforts in cases when these were not able to comply with the elegibility
criteria adopted by FP.

Contracting of a firm to manage Fondo Prosperidad ­ The hiring of CHF, which was in charge of
developing the first national experience, with the execution of the firs t FP under the Sustainable
Coastal Development Project, enabled to:
       Adjust the working methodology
       Incorporate lessons learned during the execution of the previous FP
       Design and adoption of tools to guide in the selection process of beneficiaries

Technical assistance providers (TAP) ­ The creation of th e TAP ­ an instrument that allowed f or
rational input of expert resources from CHF, provi ded technical as sistance inputs to the initial
projects presented to the Selection Committee, as well as to the final beneficiaries of FP.

Call for proposals and public approval of projects ­ The call for proposals was launched through
public notice placed in lo cal newspapers with widespread nati onal circulation of the list of FP
beneficiaries, this public disclosu re created an open space for public consultation to v alidate the
selection process that were finally approved. Although it is true that under the PDRVC there
were no public com plaints, the process created trust and opened a new perspective that could be
used in future projects, capitalizing on the atmosphere of trust generate d by the execution of FP
with the local population.

Sustainability of technical assistance provided to grant recipients (FP) ­ The launching of
productive initiatives that bene fited the m ore `vulnerable' so cial groups required a follow up
period and a broader level of trai ning activities in order to r educe gaps in basic knowledge and
inexperience in ways to prepare proposals, in      the process of producti on, comm ercialization,
marketing and financial management, elements which ensure the sustainability of such process.

Monitoring of infrastructure works with architects from the initial design stage to the execution
stage and creation of instruments which enable absorption of beneficiaries' observations ­ The
monitoring of construction work s provided by architects improve d th e f inal resu lts of th ese
works. However, a m echanism should be created in order to capture, re gister, evaluate and
introduce, if necessary, observations made by beneficiaries, both as to the construction process as
well as to the equipm ents provided, for this monitoring would have enabled to im prove, in great
measure, to the overall results.

The construction and/or improvements made in the rented spaces ­ Often is the c ase that th e
commercial space used do not belo ng to benefici aries, im provements made end up benefitting
the owner of such space, hence reduce the overall    benefit of the recipients of grants. The
experience indicated that rem odeling or im provements m ade to ren ted commercial prope rty
ended up benef itting the owner, who of ten tim es would not renew the leasing contr act to the
original FP beneficiary.

                                                 65
Management of expectations ­ The establishment of guidelines and rules governing conditions
required f or access ing FP grants-- publicly dis closed en abled to m anage expect ations am ong
potential beneficiaries and, at th e same time, informed others about possibility of accessing said
grants.

Project Sustainability

The project ensures its sustainabi lity given that its ac tivities are adapted to local work dynam ic,
local acto rs and ins titutions involv ed, and by financing the works and activ ities which are
considered a priority by these institutions.
It is necess ary th at n ational and local author ities engage and take ownership regarding the
activities and projects being im plemented by t he PD RVC, in order to ensu re sustainability of
these activities.

The IHAH, is fully aware of the significant inve stments undertaken in th e archeological parks,
particularly in Copán , has take n a ctions in o rder to ensur e the ir continuity and mainten ance,
making use of the parks/sites management plans and committing to updating them as needed.

With regards to m icro entrepreneurs, both with regard to the craftsmen and the gene ral tourism
services, the sustain ability of these effo rts is ensured by the creation of CITEAT ( Centro de
Innovación Tecnológica, Artesanía y Turismo, in Copán Ruinas), th at is in charge o f following
up on the work being undertaken, providing tr         aining to im prove product quality, including
improved design, m arketing and comme rcialization. It is also im portant to m ention the support
being provided to indigenous craftsmen groups by JICA, mainly in product improvement.

As to the construction w orks being undertaken in Copán Ruinas, as part of the enhan cement of
the economic value of municipal buildings, including the Fuerte Cabana as well as town's entry
gate and the m unicipal m arket, their sustainabil ity hinges upon the fact th at these have led to
further investments made using municipal funds (i.e. expansion or complementary works), which
will improve their overall uses sustained over a long period of time.

Sustainability of activities linke d to urban developm ent is harder to achieve, given the lack of
technical personnel and funds to hire profe       ssionals. However, the Cha mber of Industry,
Commerce and Tourism o f the Municipality of Copán and IHAH are preparing a cooperation
agreement proposal to m aintain and operate the Projec t investments --given their awareness of
investments made by PDRVC, and the overall pos itive impact that these improvements have had
on the town.
