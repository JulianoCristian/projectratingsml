satisfactory; the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate; the Bank's\n            performance was moderately satisfactory; and the\n            Borrower's performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: empowerment is\n            an important output for Community Driven Development (CDD).\n            One of the primary purposes of the CDD approach is to\n            empower local communities to affect change by improving the\n            process by which local development decisions are made. This\n            project attempt to use participatory Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) system did not work well. The rationale\n            for using a participatory M&E is that the beneficiaries,\n            by monitoring their own performance, will learn and adjust\n            accordingly. Adaptive management and learning is an\n            important ingredient for success. The flexible CDD design\n            used for this project allowed a rapid scaling up at the end\n            of the project in order to achieve the full benefit of cost\n            savings. This project demonstrated that, given a menu of\n            choices that included both community infrastructure and\n            livelihood investments; there was a strong demand for\n            livelihood investments."}, "docdt": "2011-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
