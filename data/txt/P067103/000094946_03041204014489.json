resulting from the subprojects to be implemented\n            under the Participatory Agricultural Development and\n            Empowerment Project. The guidelines provide a framework for\n            screening community, and farmer groups subprojects, and\n            further show the determinations to be made, and appropriate\n            mitigating measures to be taken. Measures to mitigate\n            typical impacts of watershed management include (in addition\n            to public awareness, and regulatory enforcement) a careful\n            site selection protecting natural habitats, and, the use of\n            indigenous plant species, followed by biodiversity\n            assessments and monitoring. The possible infringement on\n            property rights, or intrusion on physical/cultural\n            resources, stipulate the provision of compensation in\n            compliance with the legal framework, as well as provision of\n            alternative income sources. Measures to conserve tillage,\n            thus avoid contamination of groundwater, and disturbances on\n            the ecological functioning of farming systems, will require\n            soil conservation measures, fertilization management,\n            including appropriate residue management and enforcement of\n            air quality standards. Similarly, an integrated weed\n            management will be promoted, complemented by an integrated\n            pest management approach. The inappropriate uses of\n            fertilizers may foster soil salinity and water pollution;\n            therefore, training on the use of fertilizers will be\n            provided, and, tests will be conducted to monitor salinity contents."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T22:55:03Z"}
