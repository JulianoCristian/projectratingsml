feasible, to provide resettlement and\n            compensation activities as part of sustainable development\n            programs----while meaningfully consulting displaced and\n            compensated persons and providing them opportunities to\n            participate in planning and implementing resettlement\n            programs; and to improve or at least maintain the standard\n            of living. The policy applies to all displaced persons\n            regardless of the total number affected, the severity of\n            impact, and whether or not they have legal title to land.\n            Particular attention should be paid to the needs of\n            vulnerable groups among those displaced; especially those\n            below the poverty line, the landless, the elderly, women and\n            children, indigenous groups, and ethnic minorities or other\n            displaced persons who may not be protected through Tanzania\n            land compensation legislation. Implementation of the\n            sub-projects requiring resettlement plans cannot commence\n            before necessary measures for resettlement and compensation\n            are in place according to steps identified in the\n            resettlement plan. These measures will include providing for\n            compensation and other assistance required for relocation,\n            prior to displacement, and preparation and provision of\n            resettlement sites with adequate facilities, where required.\n            In particular, the taking of land and related assets may\n            take place only after compensation has been paid, and where\n            applicable, resettlement sites, new homes, related\n            infrastructure, public services, and moving allowances have\n            been provided to displaced persons. For subprojects\n            requiring relocation or loss of shelter, the policy further\n            requires that measures to assist the displaced persons be\n            implemented in accordance with the subproject's\n            resettlement plan of action."}, "docdt": "2003-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
