1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Tanzania’s economy responded well to the ambitious structural and social reforms
initiated in the late-1980s. Average annual GDP growth increased from about 1.6 percent
during the first half of the 1990s to 3.5 percent in the mid-1990s, and ranged from 4.0 to 5.8
percent over the five years preceding appraisal (Poverty Reduction Support Credit, April 2003).
GDP growth also reversed Tanzania’s trends in poverty. From 1990/91 to 2000/01, overall food
poverty declined from 22 to 19 percent while basic needs poverty declined from 39 to 36 percent
(Agricultural Sector Development Program (ASDP), May 2006). Most of these reforms,
however, had a stronger impact in the urban and service sectors. Poverty declines were most
rapid in major urban centers such as Dar es Salaam (from 28 to 18 percent) and least rapid in the
rural areas (from 41 to 39 percent) where poverty remained widespread.

The rural poor earn their livelihoods primarily from agriculture, which contributes about
26 percent of GDP and 75 percent of export earnings, and employs roughly 80 percent of
the labor force. About 3.5 million farm families cultivate 4.5 million hectares of land. Most of
these people are extremely poor, use low input/low output agricultural systems that lead to
depletion of soil nutrients over time, and obtain yields (for the principal food crops) that are only
20 to 40 percent of the potential.

Reforms created a good foundation for agricultural growth; however, several factors
delayed a significant supply response and augmented risks. For example, the removal of
agricultural input subsidies increased the costs and risks of higher-yielding technologies in many
parts of the country. As demand for inputs fell, retailers and traders exited local input markets
and competition declined, raising trading margins and reducing the profitability of purchased
inputs to smallholder producers (PADEP PAD, p. 3). These factors also highlighted the need to
raise productivity.

In 2001, the Government of Tanzania (GoT) approved the Agricultural Sector
Development Strategy (ASDS) and its operational program, the Agricultural Sector
Development Program (ASDP) to address these issues. ASDP aimed to channel 75 percent of
all public investments in agriculture through District Councils. Its core principles were to:
empower rural communities and farmer groups to participate in decisions regarding the
allocation of scarce funds for public investments; increase agricultural productivity and access to
markets; and decentralize public investments and involve the private sector in service delivery.

PADEP was designed to help execute ASDP along the agreed core principles. The Bank had
experience in implementing community-based procurement, and community-driven development
(CDD) projects in East, Central and West Africa, and in Latin America. The Bank contributed to
re-orienting the Tanzania project from one focused on the supply of fertilizer and government
managed soil testing services and reliance on government structures for service delivery, to one
focused on the demand side, strengthening rural communities and farmer groups (FGs), and
developing capacity at the district level (discussed in Section 2.1). PADEP was approved by the
Board on May 27, 2003 and became effective on August 28, 2003.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The PDO was to raise the production of food, incomes, and assets of participating households
and farmer groups in about 840 villages in a sustainable manner through the implementation of
small agricultural development subprojects planned and managed by community members and
farmers' groups.

The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): (i) agricultural productivity of participating
households increases by at least 10 percent; (ii) rural incomes, assets and liquidity of
participating households increase by at least 10 percent by the end of project implementation,
compared to control groups and pre-project levels; and (iii) at least 75 percent of subprojects
have implemented their Environmental Management Plans (EMPs).1

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

An estimated 500,000 smallholder farmers (with two hectares or less) in 840 villages were
expected to benefit directly from greater incomes and food security as a result of adopting
improved agricultural technologies, accessing productive infrastructure and better soil and water
management. In the mainland, PADEP targeted 26 districts, with 30 villages in each. In
Zanzibar, beneficiaries were in the Unguja and Pemba islands (equivalent to two mainland
districts), covering 60 villages spread over 27 Shehias.2 Women were expected to benefit, as
PADEP specified that at least two signatories of subproject accounts had to be women, and, in
terms of subproject leadership, either the chair or the secretary of any subproject had to be a
woman. Overall, PADEP anticipated that women would make up 40 percent of subproject
membership. PADEP also estimated that an equally large number of smallholders would benefit
indirectly through demonstration effects of repeated application of improved technologies.

1.5 Original Components

Component 1: Community Agricultural Development Subprojects (US$50.51m) sought to
assist GoT in providing matching grants to communities and farmers’ groups (FGs) to finance
agricultural development projects. It consisted of: (a) Community Investment Subprojects (CIS)
(US$34.4m); and (b) Farmer Group Investment Subprojects (FGIS) (US$16.11m). The aim was
to empower rural communities and FGs to make decisions to improve their economic well-being
and to act on them. Communities and organized FGs were to have primary responsibility for
using participatory approaches in executing small-scale investment activities supported by
PADEP, including identifying and planning of subprojects, implementing technical
recommendations, local procurement of inputs, contracting of service providers, and monitoring
and evaluation (M&E). This component focused on capacity building of local authorities,

communities and FGs through tailor-made basic training in participatory methodologies such as
Participatory Rural Appraisals (PRA), basic financial and procurement skills, participatory M&E,
environmental and social assessments, and HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention.3

Component 2: - Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (US$19.48m) aimed to
enhance the institutional and human capacity to ensure that the subprojects chosen were
adequately considered in key dimensions, such as environmental, economic, financial and social,
and implemented with acceptable quality. It included strengthening the Project Coordination
Units (PCUs) for Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar, together with the Ministry of Agriculture and
Food Security (MAFS) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and Cooperatives
(MANREC) at the national level, and the District Councils at the local level, to provide adequate
support to implementing agencies in their policy, institutional and regulatory functions. This
component covered:
        (a) National Level Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (US$9.05m), which
aimed to build capacity in key entities including in MAFS, and finance policy studies to review
and rationalize agricultural taxes, levies and fees on crop and livestock sub-sectors; improve the
policy and regulatory framework to enhance private sector participation, and support the
implementation of the Seed Act (1973) and the Plant Breeders Right Act (2002); and strengthen
technological linkages by rehabilitating four strategically-located soil testing laboratories.
        (b) District Level Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (US$5.78m), which
included, for each participating district, a capacity building program in planning,
implementation, and M&E of participatory community agricultural development interventions
based on district needs assessments. Participating districts were required to form District
Facilitation Teams (DFTs) for PADEP, comprising an agricultural and livestock development
officer, a community development officer, a cooperative and marketing officer, and a district
treasurer. This subcomponent financed training for DFT staff in PRA, public-private sector
partnerships, basic financial management, procurement procedures, environmental and social
impact assessment, and farmer-research-extension-market linkages.
        (c) Project Coordination and Management (US$4.65m), to facilitate activities at
community, district and national levels. This supported: design, testing and installation of a
computer-based management information system (MIS) and intensive training of community,
ward, district and national level staff in PM&E approaches; baseline data collection, as part of an
extended PRA exercise in each community/FG; and beneficiary-led assessments by village
governments to assess the benefits from subprojects as they reached completion.

Reallocation of Funds and Extension of Closing Date. In mid-2008, Zanzibar’s Ministry of
Agriculture, Livestock and Environment (MALE) requested an 18-month extension of PADEP
activities in Zanzibar to cover 78 Shehias beyond the original 94. At that time, despite rapid
disbursement, about 27 percent of the total funds were undisbursed due to appreciation of the

SDR against the US dollar (from 1.36US$/SDR in 2003 to 1.56US$/SDR in 2008) and a gain in
the US dollar against the shilling (from 950Tsh/US$ in 2003 to 1150 Tsh/US$ in 2008). As
grant ceilings to communities were fixed in shillings at 2003 exchange rates, PADEP had more
shillings than needed to implement the planned number of investments (Aide Memoire,
May/June 2008). Given this unanticipated increase in funds, some cost increases, and shifts in
implementation priorities in the final year, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Cooperatives
(MAFC) requested a reallocation of funds. On May 21, 2009, Schedule 1of the DCA of June 23,
2003 was revised accordingly (Table 1). This reallocation did not signify any change in project
design. PADEP was extended until June 30, 2010 to allow for scaling up Zanzibar, for
completing the Impact Assessment and for mainstreaming of good practices into the ongoing
Agricultural Sector Development Project (approved on June 15, 2006).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Government was committed to empowering farmers and advancing its
decentralization agenda, and set up a unit headed by an experienced officer of the rank of
Permanent Secretary to prepare the project. The initial proposal was to design a project
focused on soil fertility and agricultural intensification. Through the participatory and
consultative process, however, this early design was rejected due to its emphasis on the use of
inputs (i.e. inorganic fertilizer) rather than on an open menu of appropriate technologies. Further,
in the course of project preparation and stakeholder discussions, the importance of participation
of communities and participants in investment decisions had become clear. Consequently, the
project was redesigned to focus on strengthening the capacity of districts to assist rural
communities to identify, design and implement productive investment projects of their own
choice. The array of projects was opened up to include not just those related to soil fertility, but
also those related to water resource management, crop management, livestock, marketing, agro-
processing, and rural infrastructure (such as warehouses, markets, irrigation and feeder roads).

The project team adopted a highly participatory process, spent time in the field with
farmers, farmer organizations, NGOs, and district and grassroots level elected officials. An
inter-ministerial committee with representation of the private sector actively participated in
project preparation. Government (central and local levels) committed many senior staff from


                                                 4
several ministries and maintained a continuous flow of counterpart funding to complete project
preparation, despite the delays due to the re-orientation of the project.

Project design benefited greatly from best-practice experiences in CDD approaches to
rural development from other countries and regions. These included the key elements of:
beneficiary ownership and participation in priority setting, planning and monitoring, and
financing; positive incentives for collaboration; pluralism and competition among service
providers (public and private) to improve the efficiency of the system; and commitment for
building social capital through organizational and technical training of beneficiary groups and
community-based organizations for success and sustainability. The design also took on board
lessons on launching, implementing and supervising subprojects from the Tanzania and Malawi
Social Action Funds. PADEP’s success depended greatly on managing and channeling funds
through block grants against development plans prepared by communities and local authorities.

Two pilots helped to test farmer and CDD approaches to community procurement to help
ease skepticism surrounding these innovative methods. Pilots showed that there was
considerable enthusiasm among beneficiaries and district-level staff for the proposed approach,
and with sufficient resources allocated for training and capacity building, this approach could
deliver the expected results. Based on this, PADEP prepared training modules in several areas
including in PRA methodologies, sub-project preparation and appraisal, financial management,
and procurement.

The Participatory M&E Design was Overly Ambitious. The design of the M&E system
proposed in the PAD was to be based on a participatory M&E approach. The project design
overestimated the capacity of these beneficiary groups to implement this M&E program resulting
in significant problems with the timeliness of reports and the quality of data obtained. An Impact
Assessment (IA) was prepared as planned in the PAD, but this was only completed 8 months
after project completion. (see M&E section of ICR below)

PADEP’s Results Framework, specifically its PDO and outcome indicators were too
narrowly focused on traditional quantitative indicators (i.e. rural income, assets and
liquidity), which proved difficult to monitor and measure using a participatory M&E approach,
and did not capture the fundamental element of farmer empowerment, which was to play a
critical role in achieving and sustaining the outcomes (discussed in Section 3).

2.2 Implementation

PADEP was implemented in 33 districts on the Mainland and in nine districts in Zanzibar. On
the Mainland, project activities commenced in three different phases, which allowed using each
phase to learn and improve the next. In Zanzibar, the project was implemented in five districts in
the original period and in four during the scale up. The main factors that facilitated project
implementation, or negatively affected it, are set out below.

Positive factors in project implementation:

   The government provided strong support to the project. This included exceeding the planned
    government contribution by 85 percent (in Tshs terms) (GoT ICR, p. 8), its commitment to
                                                5
    empower farmers and to decentralize fiscal and administrative responsibilities to district
    councils.
   The design’s participatory approach was carried through in implementation. Community
    contribution to the project, which exceeded the design target by 68 percent, was a result of an
    effective use of participatory approaches, indicating strong commitment and likely
    sustainability of community investments (GoT ICR, p. 8).
   PADEP’s set of selection criteria employed at the national level, which emphasized villages
    that had medium to high agricultural potential and were clustered, resulted in rapid
    technology adoption and strong supply response. In Zanzibar, for example, PADEP scale-up
    phase actively sought areas that had: Farmer Field School (FFS), which had trained farmers
    and extension staff.
   PADEP took the necessary time to try to build capacity at district level and at farmer level to
    develop and implement subprojects (under Component 2), as a result 75 percent of
    subprojects were implemented by farmers groups.
   Membership of project committees at community level differed from the membership of the
    village/shehia government, making it easier for the latter to oversee committee performance.
    This would not have been possible if members of the committee were drawn from members
    of the village/shehia government.

Factors that negatively affected project implementation:

   Unreliable yield data produced by the participatory M&E system made it more difficult to
    fine tune project implementation. (see Section 2.3).
   Uneven supervision by the Bank team (see Section 5.1b).
   Inadequate participation of the private sector and inadequate links to markets. PADEP’s
    design involved use of private service providers, measures to improve farmer access to
    markets, and to appraise profitability of investments. Unfortunately, these were not
    adequately implemented due to district level obstacles and lack of knowledge at district level
    about approaches to private sector development. For example, PADEP developed farmers
    but did not emphasize the links to the market to sell farmer output. This was an opportunity
    foregone, and reduced investment viability and undermined impact.4
   Weak coordination and conflicting operational policies and modalities between
    organizations and institutions that worked with communities contributed to confusion and
    delays. For example PADEP required beneficiaries to contribute, but other programs gave
    absolute grants (Zanzibar ICR, p. 45).
   Weak links between extension and research, particularly at the district level, affected the
    achievement of some subproject outcomes. These related to: (i) farmers being presented with
    conventional or generic solutions and/or the wrong choice and application of crop and
    livestock based technologies, for example, cultivation of crops and varieties that were not
    tolerant to drought led to crop failure in drought prone areas; and (ii) the inability of
    extension agents to cope with the pace of release of new technologies, and thus provide

      appropriate and timely advice to farmers. Inadequate refresher training aggravated this
      situation.5

Other issues at subproject level that delayed implementation include the following:
  i.    Skepticism on the part of some facilitators and the public regarding the CDD approach
        slowed the identification and planning process.
  ii. Initial reluctance of farmers to make financial contributions (based on past experience)
        in anticipation that other organizations would provide matching grants that would cover
        their share slowed implementation.6
 iii. Although the CDD approach stimulated the demand for improved livestock and crop
        varieties, this demand could not be fully met. Farmers had to travel long distances in
        search of improved breeds. In addition, in Zanzibar, for example, artificial insemination
        technology still remains in the hands of few private service providers who cannot
        adequately meet existing demand. Similar problems were experienced for crops like
        cassava, potatoes, paddy and others, which did not have adequate multiplication and
        distribution mechanisms.
 iv. Delayed training of Phase I and II DFTs/WFTs on applying PADEP’s environmental and
        resettlement policies affected the application of actual mitigation measures in Phase I and
        II subprojects (see Section 2.4, MTR Aide Memoire and Memo of Safeguard Specialist’s
        comments, June 2006). Also, some CIS/FGIS committees in the Mainland were not
        allocated sufficient funds to implement ESMPs.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The design of the M&E system proposed in the PAD was to be based on a participatory M&E
approach. The concept was to train district councils, wards, villages and farmers groups in
participatory monitoring and evaluation approaches. There was a plan to complete a baseline
analysis using this approach. There was also an elaborate plan to have monthly reports from the
village level feed into a Management Information System. While this approach worked
reasonably well for simple enumeration of sub-project inputs and subproject counts, there were
significant problems with the timeliness of reports and the quality of data obtained for sub-
project outputs. The project design had overestimated the capacity of these beneficiary groups to
implement this M&E program. In order to correct this problem the project M&E system included
a well-structured survey that produced a comprehensive Impact Assessment (IA) report. But this
was only completed 8 months after project completion.

The indicator categories used in the M&E system were in line with the specific project objective
of increasing the production of food, income and assets of participating households. But the
PAD lacked specific definitions for these indicators. In the PAD both the project objective and
the key project outcome indicators did not capture the importance of the capacity building
through the CDD process as outcome in itself. A component output indicator capturing the
empowerment of local groups was added to the project during implementation to capture this
important project impact. This was an innovation of the project.

Implementation capacity added to the already existing design problems. The M&E system
suffered from a shortage of technical knowledge and discontinuity of the project’s M&E staff.
Without strong support from the core M&E staff, local capacity was insufficient to collect robust
data. Although the Bank team sent a number of technical consultants to address this issue, the
implementation of the advice was uneven.

The participatory M&E system was used to track one outcome indicator, agricultural yields and
livestock productivity. No information was collected on income or assets. Crop yield and
livestock productivity data was collected for about 50 percent of the subprojects, and
documented along with input information such as the number of households per FGIS/CIS, and
operational costs supported by the project and the beneficiaries. The data on agricultural yields
and livestock productivity had significant data quality issues and was therefore not reliable. For
example, about three quarters of all observations report exact productivity increases of 50, 100,
200 and 300 percent or more. When distribution patterns for the data were examined there was
also evidence of serious data anomalies. It is clear that through a combination of poor design
and difficulty in implementation the participatory approach to M&E did not work well. The
productivity data collected through the participatory M&E process was abandoned in favor of the
data collected under the IA. The lack of a baseline and data availability made it difficult to
assess project progress and to make mid course adjustments to the project during implementation.

Verifiable evidence on PADEP’s achievements at MTR was weak. The project did carry out a
beneficiary-led assessment at MTR, however, this did not include information on income and
assets. In practice, and in order to circumvent the lack of verifiable quantitative evidence,
PADEP favored an innovative qualitative approach. Based on routine field visits, PADEP
produced success stories of improved farmer’s livelihoods, and conducted radio and TV shows
with empowered farmers. This information was then used as qualitative backstopping for the
achievements of the project.

In order to compensate for the poor design and performance of the participatory M&E the PMU
commissioned a comprehensive Impact Assessment (IA). This decision was combined with the
decision to extend the project by two years. The first attempt at the IA, completed in September
2010 did not cover a sufficiently large sample of beneficiaries. Based on the recommendations
of the ICR mission, the sample size was increased. The final IA, conducted the survey from May
2009 to August 2010 and delivered the results in February 2011, was of a significantly higher
quality, covering eight districts, 186 villages, and 6,334 households (of which 2,406 where
beneficiaries and the remaining part non-beneficiaries). Data was collected on PADEP and non-
PADEP households as well as PADEP and non-PADEP villages, allowing the comparison of
project and non-project rural households and villages.

Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) rated M&E as ‘MS’ (except for the rating of ‘U’ in 2004
when the installation of the computerized M&E system was delayed). The rating was upgraded
to ‘S’ from 09/16/2009 and thereafter. Based on the evidence available for the ICR, this rating
was not appropriate as the M&E system was not performing well. Repeated management
comments and recommendations on the lack of credible outcome information and lack of



                                                8
evidence of the project’s impact on farms were seemingly not followed up (see ISR #9 of
11/30/2007, #11 of 8/28/2008, and #12 of 3/18/2009).

Overall, the design, implementation, and utilization of the participatory M&E system struggled
to achieve its objectives. PADEP’s documentation hence provides little evidence of an effective
use of the quantitative M&E system throughout the project. PADEP’s qualitative approach is
unique and commendable (for example, to shed light on issues such as farmer and gender
empowerment), though not sufficient to fully inform achievements of the PDO over a
representative distribution of subprojects during implementation. The final IA was of high
quality and allowed an ex post evaluation of the project that will be useful for designing future
CDD projects in Tanzania.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards
PADEP was rated as category B, and triggered the following safeguard policies: OP/BP 4.01
(Environmental Assessment); OP 4.09 (Pest Management); OP/PB 4.12 (Involuntary
Resettlement); OP/BP 4.36 Forests; and OP/PB 7.50 (Projects on International Waterways). The
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF) were disclosed on March 31, 2003. The ESMF included an environmental
and social checklist by subproject types to assist DFTs, communities and FGs in the screening
process. Subproject-specific safeguard documentation, such as subproject Pest Management
Plan (PMP), subproject Dam Safety Measures (DSM) and subproject Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP) were prepared and disclosed in the Country, prior to subprojects' approval for funding.
Although the project did not entail any involuntary resettlement, a resettlement framework was
required for all subprojects that may have implied changes in land use or in access to land,
associated with subproject activities. The notification of riparian countries on International
Waterways abstraction for small-scale irrigation purposes was sent on March 24, 2003.

All PADEP beneficiaries were required to prepare Environmental and Social Management Plans
(ESMPs) to access PADEP matching grants. At the MTR in June 2006, it was decided that,
although environmental and social impacts were generally positive, for those cases where
negative effects were anticipated, the preparation and application of mitigation measures lagged.
This was related to the fact that Phase I and II District and Ward teams began training in
applying PADEP’s environmental and resettlement policies only in May 2006, and all of the
completed subprojects visited by the mission were planned before this training occurred. Hence
many of the earlier project proposals did not include clear social or environmental mitigation
measures (p. 12, MTR Aide Memoire, June 2006). The project’s environmental safeguards had
also been rated ‘U’ in December 2004, as a supervision mission found that although farmers
provided information on how they intended to address potential environmental and social
impacts, the safeguard checklists were not appended to the subprojects’ write-ups. Although the
environmental rating was upgraded in 2005, it remained ‘MU’ throughout most of 2006 and
2007 due to the unclear assignment of accountability for implementing environmental mitigation
measures (in the PRA training materials) and the poor monitoring and reporting of actual
mitigation measures.



                                                9
Since the MTR, PADEP has taken steps to improve environmental and social risk management.
These include: preparation of EMPs for all ongoing and completed subprojects; revision of the
subproject appraisal guidelines to ensure due consideration to environmental issues in the
application process; creation of a mechanism for monitoring and reporting of the execution of
mitigation measures to track the performance and adequacy of EMPs, and commissioning of an
environmental and social audit. The 2008 Environmental Audit of selected districts in the
Mainland and in Zanzibar found that most ESMPs were generally satisfactory. However, the
audit found that reporting on the performance of mitigation measures was not done. Furthermore,
the findings of the audit exercise were not shared with the DFOs, possibly affecting
implementation of the recommendations from environmental audit. Apart from these observed
minor weakness related to the implementation of ESMPs, the audit found no significant negative
environmental impacts associated with the implementation of the visited subprojects.

Financial Management (FM)
PADEP’s financial management at national and district levels has remained satisfactory
throughout implementation. The project has maintained an adequate budgeting system and a
computerized FM system. Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) were received on time and found to
be satisfactory. The internal audit unit of the Ministry, which audited the project financial
statements for the year ending June 30, 2009, raised a few minor queries. These related to the
lack of acknowledgment of cash receipts from districts for CADS, ineligible expenditures, and
incorrect disbursements to districts and poor records. Management resolved these issues
adequately by PADEP’s closing mission in March 2010. The external audit reports were
submitted on time and were unqualified.

Procurement
PADEP’s procurement at national and district levels has remained satisfactory throughout
implementation. The final procurement review conducted in May 2010 indicates that
procurement under the project was conducted according to World Bank guidelines and the
National procurement system, with no cases of non-compliance. All contracts processed were
scheduled in the procurement plan, which was updated on an annual basis, and improvements
were noted to the procurement data management system and related payment records.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

During the PADEP implementation period, the GoT has carried out its original intention to
channel most agricultural public investment through its multi-donor ASDP program supported
by IDA credits 4192-TZ, 4639-TZ, and 4740-TZ, at national and local government level, using a
sector wide approach, with a declining share of investment channeled through project mode. The
participatory planning and implementation modalities developed and implemented through
PADEP influenced positively the resource allocation procedures developed under the District
Agricultural Development Plans. Village level development planning, as well as PADEP’s
successful approach to integrating the EMP process in the project cycle is now a key feature in
the DADP process and is enshrined in the ASDP national guidelines. In addition, the human and
physical capacities of the PADEP team at national level have been successfully integrated into
the ASDP team at thematic group and management levels.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

PADEP’s objectives were highly relevant to the development issues being addressed during the
project implementation period. PADEP was consistent with the Government’s priorities under
the Tanzania Seventh Poverty Reduction and Support Credit (PRSC-7, June 9, 2009) and
Tanzania’s National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP, or MKUKUTA)
and the Zanzibar Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (ZSGRP, or MKUZA). The
government strategies outline the tools for achieving Tanzania’s Development Vision, which is
to improve the standard of living of Tanzanians, especially in rural areas where the majority of
the poor work, through higher farm productivity, food security and incomes, improved
agricultural policies and better rural infrastructure.

PADEP’s objectives are also consistent with the FY07/08-FY09/10 Joint Assistance Strategy for
Tanzania (JAST), which supports the remaining years of the MKUKUTA and MKUZA. One of
the main elements of PADEP’s design—empowering farmers through placing greater control of
resource allocations in their hands--supports the decentralization thrust of the government, and
the implementation of District Agricultural Development Plans (DADPs)—now a
comprehensive tool for agricultural development at district level. The implementation process is
perceived as highly relevant by all stakeholders and has been mainstreamed into ASDP and its
possible successors. Stakeholders also regard the learning process as significant. In particular,
local farmer and gender empowerment, the creation of social capital, combined with the
development of local financial management and procurement capacity is perceived as a major
political breakthrough of the Bank’s CDD approach in Tanzania.

Sub-projects covered 10 main themes, livestock improvement (41 percent); crop improvement
(27 percent); agricultural mechanization (9 percent); horticultural improvement (7 percent);
inputs-outputs marketing improvement (7 percent); rainwater harvesting and storage (5 percent);
smallholder irrigation improvement (3 percent); environmental, watershed management and soil
and water conservation (3 percent); produce processing (2 percent); and fish farming (less than 1
percent).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Achievement of the PDO is rated as satisfactory. It was to be measured by three outcome
indicators, as stated in Section 1.2 and listed below. The project exceeded all three of these
indicators. It should be noted that these indicators were set at conservative levels in the project
design recognizing the need for significant capacity building during the process of
implementation.

i) Agricultural Productivity of Participating Households Increased by at least 10 percent. This
target was met. Productivity increases for maize and paddy rice is estimated to have increased
by more than 10 percent over the period of the project. Since no baseline or reliable annual
yields were estimated these yield increases had to be deduced from the comparison of yield
differentials between PADEP and non-PADEP households at the end of the project as computed

                                                 11
by the IA. At the end of the project, maize yields were 40.2 percent higher and paddy rice yields
were 69.1 percent higher for PADEP households than non-PADEP households. Even taking into
consideration some possible selection bias at the beginning of the project that favored the
inclusion of more productive households in PADEP, it is still reasonable to deduce that yield
increases as a result of PADEP households increased by at least 10 percent.

(ii) Rural incomes, assets and liquidity of participating households increase by at least 10
percent by the end of project implementation, compared to control groups and pre-project levels.
This target was met. The household incomes were 28 percent higher for beneficiaries of PADAP
when compared to non-beneficiaries in PADEP villages and 134 percent higher when compared
to non-beneficiaries in non-PADEP villages. The increase in household assets was measured in
two ways a) total estimated average value of assets purchased (at the price of the original
purchase) per household over the last 5 years and ii) percent of farmers reporting the purchase of
assets within the last five years. Average value of assets (valued at the time of purchase)
acquired by participating households in participating villages over 5 years are estimated to be on
average about 66% higher For PADEP beneficiaries than for households in non-participating
villages, but it is difficult to attribute all of this difference to PADEP. The percentage of
households acquiring assets in the last 5 years is higher for PADEP participating villages than for
non-participating households. (assets tracked are land, livestock, housing, agricultural assets,
radios, mobiles phones and bicycles). (Source: IA, February 2011)By comparing incomes and
assets for PADEP beneficiaries against non-PADEP households, it can be reasonably deduced
that household incomes and household assets for PADEP households increased by at least 10
percent. Liquidity was not mentioned in the project objective, nor defined in the indicators.
Based on discussions with TTLs familiar with the project this may have been an editorial error in
the logframe, a residual from the time when this project considered a rural finance component.
The IA summarized data on membership in a savings groups as a proxy indicator for liquidity.
The impact assessment finds strong evidence that membership in savings groups is much higher
for beneficiary households when compared to non-beneficiary households (80.2 percent for
PADEP households versus 20.8 percent for non-beneficiaries in PADEP participating villages,
and 13.0 percent for non-participating villages), which suggests that PADEP improved liquidity
through increased savings. In addition, 44 percent of PADEP beneficiaries indicated that access
to credit had increased during the implementation period of the project (IA, February, 2011).
These improvements in household incomes, assets and liquidity are impressive when considering
the small average size of these livelihood investments under PADEP. The average investment
per household was US$65.

(iii) At least 75 percent of subprojects have implemented their Environmental Management Plans.
According to the IA, 100 percent of sub-projects had implemented their Environmental and
Social Management Plans (ESMPs). All subprojects were required to prepare environmental
EMPs as a requisite to receive PADEP matching grants, and this was done. PADEP is one of the
few rural projects in Tanzania that has attempted to comprehensively integrate environmental
issues. As discussed in Section 2.4 above, the 2008 Environmental Audit concluded that the
quality and implementation of most of ESMP were generally satisfactory. ESMPs were prepared
as an integral part of subproject management aimed at improving decision making and ensuring
that subproject options under consideration were environmentally sound and sustainable. In most
subproject proposals, general explanations on environmental impacts were given, but some
lacked the key features of an ideal ESMP. Key features that were not clearly indicated include
                                                12
the responsibility for undertaking planned mitigation and/or enhancement measures, and specific
time for implementing the measures during subproject implementation. The Audit states that
irrespective of such weaknesses, there was an overall satisfactory integration and management of
environmental issues into the process of identifying, developing and implementing subprojects.
This was revealed by a considerable increase of the degree of environmental awareness in
farming communities.

3.3 Efficiency

Using representative farm-models for each type of crop or livestock intervention, a cost-benefit
analysis was done, computing benefit-cost ratios, internal rate of returns (IRRs) and their
corresponding net present values (NPVs) (see Annex 3). This analysis focuses on the returns
from the investments that supported farm operational costs and farm-level capacity building
arising from the CIS and FGIS, as presented below. These estimates are based on average
production costs estimated from the M&E system and productivity increase estimates from the
IA. The rates of return, which range from 23 percent for maize to 120 percent for paddy rice all
exceed the required rate of return for the project.. A sensitivity analysis of income levels from
different cropping activities shows that these income levels are robust. All crops and livestock
activities, with the exception of maize, met the minimum required rate of return with a 15
percent reduction in price or a 15 percent decrease in yield. (Annex 3).

        Note: In the PAD analysis for maize and rice was carried out in five and three locations, respectively.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

PADEP was relevant at the time of appraisal and continues to be relevant. The project exceeded
all of the project outcome targets, and in most cases by a significant margin. Despite a history of
weak monitoring and evaluation during the project life, a comprehensive final impact assessment
covering eight districts, 186 villages and 6,334 households was conducted from May 2009 to
August 2010, covering PADEP and non-PADEP households. This assessment showed that
irrespective of the district, the proportion of PADEP farmers adopting improved crop or
livestock technologies is consistently higher, with corresponding differences in yield and
productivity. The increased productivity had a positive impact on farm incomes (see Annex 3).
It was also demonstrated that these benefits had a spillover effect with increased levels of on
farm investment, improvements in food security, and progressive diffusion and adoption of
technologies by non-beneficiary farmers. The sustainability of project interventions is rooted in


                                                        13
the participatory approach taken by the project, which has mobilized local resources and
increased women participation and overall ownership of the development process.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The IA finds evidence of reduced poverty through improved household food security and
incomes. PADEP beneficiaries consumed slightly more meals per day than non-beneficiaries. .
Overall, 70 percent of the project beneficiaries attributed improvements in food security to the
project (IA, February, 2011, p. 37 - 40). PADEP activities have also enhanced the level and
reliability of incomes by reducing yield risk, and enhancing diversification and value addition.
PADEP provides relatively strong evidence of increased female participation in social decision-
making. The project explicitly empowered women through its emphasis on gender balance in the
composition of groups (see Section 1.4). At least 40 percent of group composition and
leadership positions in both FGISs and CISs were allocated to women – an important condition
for getting the selected interventions funded. As a result, women have become active
participants in both FGISs and CISs, and are becoming increasingly responsible for marketing
agricultural produce, and are also gaining control of income generated from the household
enterprises.

In interviews with stakeholders at all levels it was strongly acknowledged that PADEP had
contributed greatly to building local capacity. In particular, it has increased “social capital” at the
village level. Measured mostly through qualitative approaches, the project appears to have had a
major impact on social development through formation and strengthening of participating
community and FGs.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

PADEP aimed to strengthen institutions and build capacity at the national, district and
community levels. With respect to policy and regulatory activities in the Mainland, the project
has financed national level efforts to improve existing policies and regulations pertinent to
agricultural sector development that included: establishment of an office for plant breeders
registration, the Plant Protection Act (1997), Fertilizer Bill, and Veterinary Act; support for
SACCOS and VICOBAS formation among farmers; and continued seed sector reform efforts,
especially the development of Seeds Regulations under the Seed Act of 2000. With regard to
institutional strengthening, the project supported the Plant Health Services Department and
Tanzania Official Seed Certification Institute (TOSCI) to train frontline staff on enforcement of
input-output market regulations.

As discussed in Annex 2, PADEP also strengthened technological linkages through rehabilitating
and equipping four soil laboratories and developing soil laboratory operational plans. National
capacity was built through training of ASLMs, and support to ZIELU at all Zonal Agricultural
Research Institutes (ARIs) to enhance dissemination of new technologies. As a result of the
latter, a range of technologies were packaged and disseminated to farming communities in their
respective areas. Other areas of long-term capacity building and institutional development
included strengthening public-private partnerships in service delivery, reviews to improve the
business environment, and the development of business associations, such as the Agricultural
                                                  14
Council of Tanzania, Tanzania Meat Processors Association, and Tanzania Milk Processors
Association.

At district level, training enhanced capacities of district staff as described in Annex 2. Capacity
building involved not only members of the district/ward facilitation teams (DFTs/WFTs) but also
members of the Council Management Teams (CMTs). The project also facilitated LGAs to
establish and strengthen relationships between public and private sector in service delivery to
farming communities. At community level, technical assistance and training of participating
community and FG members have assisted these groups to prepare, implement and monitor
subprojects.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project created a number of important externalities. These include:

   Positive economic externalities. In addition to strict farming activities, PADEP increased
    access to market information, enhanced the development of self entrepreneurship behaviors
    and also advocated for a culture of capital-management among communities, farmers being
    required to have a saving account and deposit at least 50 percent of the value of inputs
    needed for the following season. Other externalities arose from the improvement of the
    enabling environment, due to capacity building activities implemented at the national and
    local level, together with a support to regulatory and policy-making institutions (for example,
    endorsement of District Agricultural Development Plans - DADP, and support to SACCOS).

   Positive environmental externalities. PADEP has been one of the few agricultural projects in
    Tanzania that has attempted to integrate environmental issues in project formulation.
    According to the Environmental Audit Report, there was a considerable increase in the
    degree of environmental awareness to farming communities.

In general, stakeholders were of the opinion that the project design and approach were good. In
fact, some of the districts implementing PADEP have adopted its approach in implementing
various projects, including construction of health facilities. Moreover, there was a consensus
among stakeholders that PADEP activities can be easily mainstreamed into ASDP via DADPs,
as a good foundation had already been established.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
See Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The institutional sustainability risk to the development outcome is moderate. Based on the IA,
indicators of community empowerment show that local communities have been empowered to
make decisions and have positive impressions of the CDD approach. This would suggest that the
institutional development activities carried out under this project are taking root. In addition, it
is likely that many PADEP communities and FGs will continue to receive additional support

                                                15
under ASDP, further reinforcing these local institutional structures. The residual risk therefore
appears to be small on mainland Tanzania; Zanzibar does not participate in ASDP but continues
to receive support from other donors. Under Component 2, PADEP has contributed greatly to
institutional strengthening and capacity building. Some of the gaps that still need to be
addressed under ASDP include: refresher training for extension staff at both district and
community levels in order to consolidate the gains achieved; further strengthening of capacity at
community level to enable members of committees responsible for managing community
projects to follow up implementation of the projects; and more training for farmers participating
in projects at group level to enable them to use recommended technologies.

Financial Sustainability is rated as moderate. A sensitivity analysis of income levels by crop
and livestock indicates that the financial viability of most of these activities, with the exception
of maize, is robust. A 15 percent reduction in yield or price for any of the crops analyses would
still yield a rate of return above the projects required rate of return. The residual risk to financial
sustainability is that small scale farm enterprises face cash flow problems and revert back to low
input/low output agriculture. In the intermediate term this issue will be averted through
continued government and donor programs targeted at this issue. In the longer term, financial
intermediation services will need to be developed to provide deposit and lending services to the
sector, including support to input supplier credit programs.

The environmental risk to development outcome is low. PADEP was rated as category ‘B’ for
environmental purposes. Although it triggered several safeguard policies, project activities and
selected types of subprojects have only negligible and/or site-specific environmental effects.
The Environmental Audit 2008 found that communities had high levels of awareness of
environmental issues, and, despite initial delays, PADEP has conducted training of DFTs/WFTs
and has made substantial efforts to enhance the monitoring of subprojects, especially of
infrastructure-related subprojects.

The social risk to development outcome is low. PADEP has played a major role in creating
social capital in the participating villages, and has been instrumental in mainstreaming gender
and social equity in the local development agenda. The project has enabled the enhanced
participation of all social groups in planning, implementation and control processes, and thus
created a positive dynamic for good governance and social accountability mechanisms in
managing community and farmer group investment funds. There have also been demonstration
effects, with PADEP’s participatory approaches being copied in non-PADEP villages.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank team worked closely with the client, adopted a highly participatory process, and tested
innovative CDD approaches through two pilots in two districts to design a relevant project to
empower farmers and communities to identify, design and implement productive investment
projects of their own choice. The Bank should have done better in defining the PDO and

                                                  16
outcome indicators so that these could be relatively easily measured and attributed to project
inputs. The participatory M&E system design, while it worked reasonably well for collecting
input indicators and simple accounting data, overestimated the capacity of local entities to collect
information on outcome indicators.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank’s supervision quality of PADEP was uneven. The entire period can be divided into
three periods: from preparation until mid-2005; from then until the end of 2008; and from end-
2008 until project closure in June 2010. The quality at entry and supervision during the initial
years were satisfactory, and included candid ratings in the ISRs in most areas. For example,
ISRs flagged M&E and environmental safeguards issues and rated these as ‘U’ in several ISRs
during the first three years.

Supervision during the middle period was unreliable and less than satisfactory; this period was
characterized by: late ISRs or ISRs entered by the Program Coordinator or the Sector Manager in
the absence of the TTL; delayed Aide Memoires, sometimes by many months; last minute
cancellation of planned supervision missions; delays in providing no objections; and, overall,
lack of proper guidance by the Bank on implementation issues. ISR ratings and write-ups were
not candid, especially about the lack of M&E and information on the outcome indicators.

Supervision improved in the latter years with respect to timely no objections, ISRs and Aide
Memoires. The problem of lack of data from the Government concerning M&E and achievement
of outcomes however continued. During the middle and latter periods, TTLs made little progress
in addressing management comments on the lack of outcome information and lack of evidence of
the project’s impact on farms (see ISR #9 of 11/30/2007, #11 of 8/28/2008, #12 on 3/18/2009).
Supervision reports continued to report good progress towards achieving the PDO when there
was little information available on the majority of the PDO outcome indicators. The Bank TTL
did however work with the government to develop a comprehensive IA that allowed an ex post
evaluation of the project.

Overall, the Bank also could have performed better in following up on the issue of financial
sustainability of the subprojects, encouraging Government to conduct simple rates of return and
profitability analyses. For a project that aimed to increase farmer incomes, the World Bank team
should have required monitoring the long-term sustainability of subproject activities during
implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
This rating reflects the ‘S’ rating for Quality at Entry, the ‘MU’ rating for Supervision and the
‘S’ rating for Outcome (see ICR Guidelines, May 2010).

5.2 Borrower Performance



                                                   17
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

There was a high level of ownership on the part of the Government of Tanzania during the
preparation phase of the project. GoT was very committed to empower farmers and to
decentralize fiscal and administrative responsibilities to the district councils. As described in
Section 2.1, the participatory approach led to the redesigning of the project, from one focused on
inputs (fertilizer) to one that would include an open menu of appropriate technologies. The
Government remained committed throughout this long preparation process, and maintained a
continuous flow of counterpart funds. Total government contribution to PADEP exceeded the
design target by 85 percent (in Tshs).

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
At the national level, the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) of the Ministry—MAFC was
responsible for overall coordination of the project as well as for implementation of specific
activities of the capacity building and institutional strengthening component. At the district level,
the District Executive Director (DED), assisted by the District Agriculture and Livestock
Development Officer (DALDO) were responsible for project implementation. The PCU and the
staff of other implementing entities at the national, district and community levels largely
comprised of well-qualified and committed individuals. The new CDD approach to investment
was effectively communicated to all stakeholders resulting in extraordinary involvement of
farmers through the community and farmer groups. Evaluation of PADEP impact during the
MTR and at the end of the project show positive achievements in capacity building and farmer
empowerment. The PCU could have performed better in one area, M&E. While there was a
problem with the design of the participatory M&E system as discussed above, the PCU was slow
to recognize the problem and adjust accordingly. As a result they did not collect systematic data
that the project design envisaged, and hence information critical for management and assessment
of outcomes was missing. At the end of the project they did facilitate the preparation of a
comprehensive IA, but this was only completed 8 months after the closing of the project. The
performance of the PCU is in many respects commendable, but the significant deficiencies in
M&E justify an overall ‘MS’ rating.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
This rating reflects the ‘S’ rating for GoT performance and the ‘MS’ rating for Implementing
Agency performance.

6. Lessons Learned

Empowerment is an important output for CDD. One of the primary purposes of the CDD
approach is to empower local communities to affect change by improving the process by which
local development decisions are made. Developing sustainable change in these processes is
often as important as the sub-project activities themselves, particularly when considering the
empowerment of women. It is important to recognize that building capacity through a learning-
by-doing process is an important outcome, and that this outcome should be measured. It is also

                                                18
important not to expect implementation to be perfect while communities are developing these
capacities through a “learning by doing” process. This Project offers some interesting lessons in
the measurement and monitoring of community empowerment (Annex 2, Component 2,
Indicator 6).

Structured M&E Surveys Better Than Participatory M&E. This Project’s attempt to use
participatory M&E system did not work well. The rationale for using a participatory M&E is
that the beneficiaries, by monitoring their own performance, would learn and adjust accordingly.
However, the CDD approach uses a diverse menu of interventions that are integrated into local
community activities. This makes the attribution of appropriate outcomes to the project a
complex undertaking that can only be adequately be carried out by professional evaluators using
a well-structured survey. This approach, introduced late in the project, produced better results.
Therefore, for CDD projects it is recommended that the participatory approach for M&E only be
used in situations with very strong local capacity. In most situations it would be a lower risk
strategy to use structured independent surveys managed by professionals, starting with a baseline,
followed by a mid-term survey and an end of project survey.

Phased Start-up by District Allowed Course Corrections. Adaptive management and learning is
an important ingredient for success. This project had three tranches in its grant program, starting
with 8 districts in 2003, 8 in 2004 and 11 in 2005 on the mainland and 5 districts in 2003 and the
balance in 2005 for Zanzibar. This phased approach was extremely useful for adjusting
implementation based on the lessons learned in each earlier phase. It allowed for improvements
in procurement, financial management and M&E.

The Flexible CDD Design Allowed Scaling-up and Reallocation of Funds. The flexible CDD
design used for this project allowed a rapid scaling up at the end of the project in order to
achieve the full benefit of cost savings. About 30 percent more projects were completed than
initially planned. The flexible design also allowed demand driven allocation of funds to uses that
were important and technically manageable for communities.

The Project Produced Interesting Local Institutional Arrangements. All participating districts
formed interdisciplinary District Facilitation Teams (DFTs) for PADEP of up to 10 members to
facilitate implementation of farm-level activities. The teams comprised agricultural and livestock
development officers, planning officers, natural resources, community development officers and
cooperatives officers. In each district, a PADEP District Officer (PDO) was appointed to handle
day-to-day activities of the project at district level. In the Mainland, a Ward Facilitation Team
(WFT) composed of the Ward Executive Officer, Ward Agricultural/Livestock Extension Officer,
Ward Community Development officer, other extension staff and representative of NGOs
working in the ward was formed depending on situation. The major role of these teams was to
facilitate communities in identification, planning and implementation of village-level
investments. These teams were a major innovation and essential in mobilizing and facilitating the
entire process, that could be adopted by other agricultural programs and projects.

Using CDD for Livelihood Investments. This project demonstrated that, given a menu of
choices that included both community infrastructure and livelihood investments; there was a
strong demand for livelihood investments. In this case there was more total demand for

                                                19
livelihood investments than for small scale community infrastructure. It was also clear that these
relatively modest investments in livelihood activities, averaging about $65 per household, had a
significant impact on incomes and wealth accumulation and therefore poverty reduction. It was
also important to note that most of the livelihood investments were focused on improved
technologies in primary agriculture, such as seed and fertilizer, rather than on investments in
non-farm activities such as small scale agribusiness, which typically yield even higher returns.
This provides two lessons. First, that CDD is an effective instrument for delivering livelihood
investments in the form of embodied off-the-shelf technologies. Second, the introduction of
livelihood investments in non-farm activities, such as small scale agribusiness, requires a higher
level of local expertise and project training than this project provided - something that would be
well suited to a second or third phase CDD program.

                                   Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Community Agricultural Development Subprojects (CADS)

Two indicators were specified under this component:
1. 840 villages in 28 districts implement at least one community investment subproject and four
   farmer group subprojects following PRA methodologies; and
2. At least 75 percent of these subprojects are successfully implemented by participating
   communities and farmers' groups, based on agreed assessment criteria.

The CADS component consisted of Community Investment Subprojects (CIS) and Farmer
Group Investment Subprojects (FGIS). For the purposes of PADEP, a “community” was defined
as a single village/Shehia7, or a significant portion thereof, with a common investment interest.
Thus a community subproject was an investment that had public-wide benefits to target
beneficiaries. A “farmer group” (FG) was defined as a small group of (between 10 and 40
households) belonging to the same village that voluntarily agreed to engage in an investment
subproject that introduced technological innovations on their farms. For the CIS, PADEP
provided grants to participating communities to implement their agricultural development
investments and technical assistance and training associated with these investments. For FGIS,
the project provided grants to participating FGs for acquiring agricultural inputs and other
technological innovations, and associated technical assistance and training.

Indicator 1: The target that 840 villages in 28 districts implement at least one community
investment subproject and four farmer group subprojects following PRA methodologies was
surpassed. PADEP was implemented in 814 villages in 33 districts on the Mainland and in 174
Shehia in nine districts in Zanzibar. Between 4 and 16 FGs were supported in each
village/Shehia in order to implement demand-driven investments. The increase in the number of
districts on the Mainland was due to GoT’s decision to split some of the participating districts
into two during project implementation. Districts were admitted into PADEP in three phases,
and thus provided the opportunity to use each phase to improve the next. In Zanzibar, phasing
was at Shehia level and initially included five districts. Four were added during the scale-up (see
GoT ICR p. 6 for phasing of districts). The majority of participating districts achieved or
surpassed their targets without requiring additional financial allocation at community level
(Table 1). The variation was due to the flexibility built in the project design, where communities
were allowed to use funds saved from one subproject to invest in another subproject depending
on their priorities. The project targeted 500,000 households but reached 780,474.

Indicator 2: The target, that at least 75 percent of these subprojects are successfully
implemented by participating communities and farmers' groups, based on agreed assessment
criteria, was surpassed. With technical support and facilitation from DFT, WFT and PCU, all
100 percent of the 6,247 subprojects are being implemented by participating communities and
FGs, based on agreed assessment criteria (GoT ICR, June 2010, p. 13). CAD’s implementation
was preceded by capacity building activities for DFT/WFT members in all participating districts,
who in turn facilitated the process of planning and implementing community and FG subprojects.
The 1,069 CIS and 5,178 FGIS were grouped into ten major themes, and included (presented as
percentages): livestock production improvement (40.7); crop production improvement (26.8);
agricultural mechanization (8.6); improved horticultural production (6.5); output/input market
improvement (4.9); water harvesting (4.7); smallholder traditional irrigation improvement (2.9);
environmental management and soil-water conservation (2.9); produce processing (1.9) and fish
farming (0.1) (See GoT ICR with similar breakdowns, pp. 56-65). Each subproject had a
committee, and farmers, through their subproject committees, owned and managed financial and
other physical assets and controlled the decision-making process.

Component 2: Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening

Seven indicators were specified under this component:8

1. Each participating district has at least 5 staff who have been trained and conducted PRA in
   the target villages.
2. At least 50 percent of all planning, implementation and evaluation meetings between
   villagers and district service providers rated as satisfactory by participating households and
   village councils.




8
  During implementation, one output indicator was slightly changed and one was added to what was in the PAD, as
follows: Improve the quality of district agricultural development plans (DADPs) in participating districts (PAD
indicator), changed to, participating local government authorities (LGA) develop comprehensive DADPs and submit
for financing. The following indicator was added “participating communities empowered; able to identify, plan and
implement their own agricultural development activities”.


                                                       23
3. Proportion of agricultural public investments channelled through community driven
   development mechanism increases by 50 percent in participating LGAs.
4. Four soil testing laboratories are rehabilitated, equipped and used by participating LGAs on
   demand-driven basis.
5. At least 50 percent of subprojects use private channels for marketing of inputs and outputs,
   and 25 percent use private service providers for design, management or evaluation by end of
   the project.
6. Participating communities empowered; able to identify, plan and implement their own
   agricultural development activities.
7. Participating LGA develop comprehensive DADPs and submit for financing.

Indicator 1: The target that each participating district has at least 5 staff who had been trained
and conducted PRA in the target villages was surpassed. Each of the 33 district councils has a
team of 10 to 15 technical staff at district level and 4 to 6 at ward level in the Mainland trained to
facilitate the participatory process. In total, 420 DFT and WFT members received mandatory
training using seven modules namely: Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA); extended
Opportunities and Obstacles to Development (O&OD); Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation
and Project Planning and Appraisal; Public Private Sector Partnerships; Financial Management
and Procurement; HIV/AIDS; and Environmental and Social Safeguards (see GoT ICR for a
summary of training conducted on the Mainland and in Zanzibar). These teams later used the
modules, knowledge and skills gained to facilitate communities and FGs in conducting PRAs,
preparing subproject investment proposals, financial management, procurement procedures,
environmental management and social safeguards and participatory monitoring and evaluation
(PM&E). The teams also provided technical support during subproject implementation including
linking communities and FGs to the sources of needed technologies.

For each participating district, PADEP financed a demand-driven district capacity building
program. Comprehensive district capacity building plans were prepared in consultation with
stakeholders after a series of preparatory workshops in capacity building needs assessments. All
participating districts formed interdisciplinary DFTs for PADEP of up to 10 members to
facilitate implementation of farm-level activities. The teams comprised agricultural and livestock
development officers, planning officers, natural resources, community development officers and
cooperatives officers. In each district, a PADEP District Officer (PDO) was appointed to handle
day-to-day activities of the project at district level. In the Mainland, a Ward Facilitation Team
(WFT) composed of the Ward Executive Officer, Ward Agricultural/Livestock Extension Officer,
Ward Community Development officer, other extension staff and representative of NGOs
working in the ward was formed depending on situation. The major role of these teams was to
facilitate communities in identification, planning and implementation of village-level
investments. These teams were a major innovation and essential in mobilizing and facilitating the
entire process, that could be adopted by other agricultural programs and projects.

Indicator 2: The target that at least 50 percent of all planning, implementation and evaluation
meetings between villagers and district service providers rated as satisfactory by participating
households and village councils was surpassed. All 814 villages and 174 shehia participating
communities in the Mainland and in Zanzibar have rated the participatory approach used in
subproject identification, planning and implementation as highly satisfactory. The MTR
Beneficiary-led Assessment of PADEP, June 2006 and the Impact Assessment of February 2011
                                                 24
conclude that there is a very high degree of beneficiary satisfaction with, and unanimous
appreciation of the PADEP approach of participatory, bottom up identification, preparation and
implementation of subprojects. An important finding of the Beneficiary-led Assessment is the
appreciation by a majority of the participants of their contribution to CIS and FGIS. This
willingness to pay is an important indicator of the value participants place on the project
activities and approach. It is viewed by a majority as an important factor in ensuring the groups’
ownership and commitment to the subprojects, while providing them the freedom to run the
subprojects independently.

Indicator 3: The target that the proportion of agricultural public investments channelled through
community driven development mechanism increases by 50 percent in participating LGAs was
surpassed. In all 33 district councils already implementing the project, PADEP supports more
than 50 percent of the agricultural investment, all of which is channeled through community-
driven development (CDD) mechanisms. Prior to PADEP, Tanzania did not use CDD
methodology in the selection agricultural investments. At the pilot stage, PADEP was a lone
actor at the productive level at the district and sub-district level. It was joined by the Tanzania
Social Action Fund (TASAF) in implementing participatory approaches for social investment
(Beneficiary-led Assessment, June 2006, p. 2).

Indicator 4: The target that four soil testing laboratories are rehabilitated, equipped and used by
participating LGAs on demand-driven basis was achieved. As planned, PADEP completed the
rehabilitation of four soil analysis laboratories, namely, Uyole, Mlingano, Selian and Ukiriguru,
and provided them with modern equipment and tools (see GoT ICR, for the list of equipment
provided to the laboratories). All rehabilitated soil laboratories are assisted operationally to
provide demand-driven services to farmers. Twelve technical staff members from all four soil
laboratories were supported to attend a short course on remote sensing in soil management at the
University College of Land and Architectural Studies (UCLAS) in Dar-es-Salaam. Another batch
of ten technical staff was supported to attend soil analysis training courses and a batch of 8 staff
was trained on soil classification at Sokoine University of Agriculture, Morogoro. Following
successful completion of the rehabilitation and equipping of the soil laboratories, PADEP
supported development of an operational business plan for commercial use of the soil
laboratories, with the aim of making them more effective and also their operational sustainability.

PADEP also aided interventions for strengthening technological linkages and technology
dissemination between farmers, extension workers and research institutes, in order to increase
agricultural productivity. These interventions included support to all Zonal Agricultural
Research and Development Centers to prepare action plans and budgets for technological linkage
activities. The project disbursed funds to each zone in the Mainland as well as to the Zanzibar
Research Centre, to use for various linkage activities. (These are listed in the GoT ICR).

Indicator 5: The target that at least 50 percent of subprojects use private channels for marketing
of inputs and outputs, and 25 percent use private service providers for design, management or
evaluation by end of the project was achieved. PADEP recognized the importance of the private
sector in agricultural development, aimed to enhance private sector participation in inputs and
outputs marketing, and in the provision of advisory and technical services, and allocated



                                                25
resources to undertake activities to promote private sector involvement. Achievements in
enhancing public-private sector partnerships include the following:
 Over 270 subprojects (CIS and FGIS) identified by communities are specifically tailored to
    address marketing of inputs and outputs.
 Almost 90 percent of infrastructure projects were constructed by the private sector after
    being engaged by the communities. For example, all chaco dams, market and storage
    facilities were constructed by private contractors.
 About 100 percent of subprojects in the participating communities used private channels for
    accessing inputs and selling their outputs.
 Relationship between private sector and other stakeholders in the districts is progressively
    being strengthened. The project has facilitated partnership arrangements between farmers and
    private sector institutions and community-based institutions operating in some of the districts.
    For instance, in Masasi districts for many years Mkang‟u and Chikundi village communities
    have suffered shortages of inputs and faced output marketing problems. Following PADEP
    support they constructed storage facilities that are now used to stock and sell inputs and
    produce through a warehouse system. Selling their produce at one spot has helped them to
    bargain for better prices as they have “one voice”. Farmers have also hired out the storage
    facilities to a private operator who is buying crops like cashew nut, thus easing the burden of
    farmers from walking long distances to sell their cashew nuts.
 Most of the time, there is timely availability and delivery of goods and services (inputs and
    outputs markets) as a result of improvement in policy and regulatory framework.
 There is increased participation of NGOs and other institutes in the delivery of agricultural
    services. For example, in Masasi and Nachingwea districts farmers have been linked with
    Small Scale Industries Organization (SIDO) located in Lindi town that trained and provided
    farmers with advisory services on the appropriate equipment for small-scale cashew process.
    Similarly, in these districts Roman Catholic Church provided training to FGIS members on
    oxenization through its program on Village Oxenization Development (VODP), while the
    Anglican Church extended technical assistance to the farmers by training them on production
    of improved seed.
 Sixteen districts implementing PADEP established District Private Sector Advisory
    Committees (DPSAC). These DPSAC have held stakeholders‟ dialogue meetings on various
    issues pertaining to increased participation of the private sector in agricultural development
    activities. For example, in the Singida DPSAC, such dialogue led to active involvement of
    the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) to provide certificates of quality production of
    sunflower oil, which increased competitiveness of oil in local and international markets. In
    Iringa district, consultations at the DPSAC initiated active involvement of the Tropical
    Pesticides Research Institute (TPRI), which helped to minimize incidences of poor quality
    pesticides in the market.

With respect to policy and regulatory activities on the Mainland, PADEP’s outputs and
achievements include: the Fertilizer Act of 2008 and fertilizer regulations; support for Savings
and Credit Cooperative Societies (SACCOS) formation among farmers; implementation of the
Seed Act of 2000 and Seed Regulations; and draft Contract Farming Legislation. Outcomes
from these interventions include good remunerations being offered to the plant breeders since the
establishment of the Plant Breeders Rights. Many of the improved crop seeds and livestock


                                                26
breeds are now available to farmers, and fertilizer trade is now regulated following the enactment
of the law.

The project also strengthened private sector associations at national level. The most notable
outcomes include establishment of Agricultural Council of Tanzania (ACT), Meat Processors
Association, Tanzania Livestock Traders Association, the Tanzania Milk Processors Association,
and the Horticultural Development Council of Tanzania (HODECT). These institutions are
currently active in providing intended services not only to the farming communities, but also to
the public at large.

Despite these achievements, the private sector and services it can offer in agricultural
development are not widely understood at all levels of project implementation. As such its
services were limited to structural construction and agricultural inputs/outputs marketing.
Interest on provision of advisory and technical services to communities is limited, and therefore
largely provided by public sector. There is also lack of clear guidance and a suitable
environment for facilitation of PPP in the agricultural sector, particularly small scale
agribusiness.

Indicator 6: Participating communities empowered; able to identify, plan and implement their
own agricultural development activities. Although there is no measure of this indicator, it is
apparent that PADEP has empowered participating communities in all aspects, as stated under
Indicator 3 above and described in the ICR text’s Section 3 on Outcomes. One of the ways that
PADEP expected to achieve its objectives was through empowering self-selected rural
communities and FGs to own resources and make key decisions regarding the choice of
sustainable and remunerative productive technology.

In the context of PADEP, the Impact Assessment (IA) of February, 2011 defines empowerment
as follows: it essentially involves people taking control of the development process, including
decision making, planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and resource control. In this
study empowerment issues were considered at three overlapping levels: (i) empowerment of
individuals, particularly marginalised people within their communities (e.g. women, the poorest
and the youth); (ii) strengthening of groups and community organisations and their capacity to
work together for common objectives (i.e. for community investment subprojects); and (iii)
strengthening of a community in its relations with outsiders and the wider society (including
local government authorities, central government and the private sector). The IA uses two
categories of indicators of empowerment: The first is the proportion of farmers who participated
in PRA exercises and the proportion of farmers involved in identification of group investment
subprojects. PRA was particularly seen as an empowering tool as it is an important element of
situation analysis. More specifically, as a tool it enables beneficiary groups to study and clearly
understand their socio-economic and ecological opportunities and constraints. Based on the
results of the PRA, beneficiaries are able to design solutions to their production constraints.
Also, previous projects and programs put no emphasis on farmer empowerment. The second
category of indicators of farmer empowerment is the participation and involvement of women in
FGs, leadership of FGs, marketing of agricultural products and control of income. PADEP
promotes technological innovation through farmer groups in which members have voluntarily



                                                27
agreed, with the endorsement of their Village Council, to engage in an investment subproject that
introduces technological innovation.

Most of the target beneficiaries in the IA felt that their ability to implement investment
subprojects was a result of the level of empowerment attained through: their participation in
PRAs and in making decisions on investment subprojects to implement; training received
through groups; the increasing self-confidence of women; grants provided by PADEP for
acquisition of improved technologies and inputs; being directly given freedom to manage and
make decisions on the use of financial resources contributed by the project; and the procurement
of resources required to implement investment subprojects.

Almost 74 percent of the interviewed project beneficiaries in the IA participated in PRAs, while
almost 85 percent of them were involved in identification of group investment subprojects.
During interviews and FG discussions, most of the farmers were of the opinion that they were
free to contribute ideas during the meetings and that their ideas were taken into account in
arriving at the final decision.

With respect to the second category of indicators, the IA clearly shows that almost 86.1 percent
of the project beneficiaries in participating villages were members of FGs, while only about 18.6
percent of the non-beneficiaries were members. The situation is different in the non-participating
villages where only 14.5 percent of the interviewed farmers were members of FGs. The IA also
showed that with the exception of three districts, there were a higher proportion of women (19.4
percent) who were responsible for marketing the produce in beneficiary households compared to
non-beneficiary households (15.6 percent). Over 95 percent of sub-projects had women as
treasurers (GOT, ICR). Women who were interviewed in participating villages attribute this
largely to the project’s efforts to sensitize women to take a leading role in agricultural
development.

Indicator 7: The target that Participating LGAs develop comprehensive DADPs and submit them
for financing was achieved. The project played a key role in facilitating LGAs to develop high
quality DADPs as part of the Agricultural Sector Development Project (ASDP) implementation.
DADP preparation processes and DADP implementation status were assessed in 62 LGAs by
providing funding to district teams and technical backstopping by the National Facilitation Team
of the Agricultural Sector Development Project (ASDP). Based on the PADEP’s experiences,
DADP planning and implementation guidelines were developed. The guidelines are currently
being used for training in all LGAs. A total of 132 DADPs are developed each year by respective
LGAs and assessed for quality following this intervention.

Review of DADP training materials at the district level: Based on their experiences in
developing training materials, PADEP staff assisted ASDP to review four training manuals on
DADP implementation. These manuals include Project Planning and Appraisal; Extended
Opportunities and Obstacles to Development (O&OD); Community Procurement Manual; and
Environmental and Social Management Manual. These documents are used to train DFTs and
WFTs to improve their DADP implementation skills.




                                                28
The Regional Secretariats play an important role in DADP implementation. The project
supported the capacity needs assessment in 10 Regional Secretariats in the Mainland, and
continues to support the DADP review process in all 10 Regional Secretariats where it operates,
namely in Mtwara, Lindi, Morogoro, Iringa, Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Manyara, Singida and
Tabora. To enable these Regional Secretariats to supervise and provide technical support to the
district councils, PADEP provided them with financial support on a quarterly basis. The ten
Regional Secretariats received support amounting to Tsh. 145,894,000 to undertake
backstopping of PADEP activities (see GoT ICR, Appendix 15, p. 72).

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

    A- Overview and preliminary remarks

1.      This annex presents the economic and financial analysis for the PADEP. The
analysis focuses primarily on the quantifiable economic and financial rates of return for
the project. Some of the less quantifiable benefits and costs are also described here in
qualitative terms and in more detail in Annex 2 Outputs by Component.

2.      The analysis computed benefit-cost ratios (BCRs), internal rate of returns (IRRs)
and their corresponding net present values (NPVs) at the farm level for different crops. It
focuses on the returns from the investments under Component 1 (Community
Agricultural Development Subprojects) that supported farm operational costs and farm
level capacity building. More specifically, the analysis estimates the returns from
increased productivity arising from the main Community Investment Subprojects (CIS)
and Farmer Groups Investments Subproject (FGIS) that typically fall into one of the
following categories: (i) improved livestock husbandry; (ii) improved crop and
horticultural production; (iii) agriculture mechanization and agro-processing; (v) water
harvesting; (vi) input-output marketing; (vii) smallholder irrigation; and (vii)
environmental management.

3.      The sources of the data used in this analysis are PADEP’s M&E database, the
results of the Impact Assessment (IA) dated February 2011 and key information from
direct discussions with project’s stakeholders during field visits9. Average production
costs for different crops and livestock operations were estimated from the M&E system,
and considered to be reliable. Productivity increases were estimated from the IA because
no baseline yield estimates were collected by the M&E system and yield data collected
by the M&E system during project implementation was deemed unreliable. Estimated
productivity increases as a result of the Project were calculated by comparing output
levels for PADEP participants to non-participant farmers. These data were collected for
maize, rice, sunflower, and eggs.

4.      Overall, the results suggest high rates of return, in the order of 23 to 120 percent.
The sensitivity analysis shows that, with the exception of maize, the project rates of
return are robust even for yield or price declines of 15 percent. This is particularly
impressive given the relatively small size of investment of US$65 per household.

    B- Identification of PADEP’s benefits (quantifiable and non-quantifiable)

5.      The main quantifiable benefits from PADEP are essentially due to the increased
yields of farm outputs. Due to the demand-driven character of PADEP, a wide range of


9
 Field visits took place during the pre-ICR mission (August 1-15, 2010) and the ICR missions (September
13-26, 2010), in several districts of Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania (more specifically Mvomero, Arusha
and Meru districts).

                                                  34
investments were financed. In order to capture PADEP’s benefits at the farm level, the
analysis reports of the performance of the main crops and livestock products supported
by PADEP, namely maize, rice, sunflower, millet, beans and eggs. The subprojects that
result in these yield increases fall into one of the following categories.:

      Improved livestock production (about 40 percent of the total subprojects).
       Increased yields in livestock products are due to activities such as: (i) cross-
       breeding, (ii) artificial insemination, (iii) zero grazing, (iv) integrated disease
       control and management, (v) nutrition, local fattening and (vi) improved housing.

      Improved crop husbandry and horticultural production (about 34 percent of the
       total subprojects). Increased yields are due to (i) the use of improved seeds and
       seedling, (ii) improved agronomic practices such as recommended plant spacing,
       (iii) the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers, (iv) timely weeding and planting,
       (iv) integrated disease and pest management and (v) post harvest management.

      Agricultural mechanization (about 8 percent of the total subprojects). Yield
       increases are due to the use of (i) ox-drawn implements, (ii) tractors, (iii) power
       tillers, (iv) sub-soilers and (v) agro-processing technologies.

      Water harvesting technologies and smallholder traditional irrigation
       improvement (8 percent of total subprojects). Increased yields were due to the (i)
       rehabilitation of weirs and canals, (ii) drilling of boreholes and (iii) construction
       of water gates to increase water flow, distribution and water use efficiency.

6.    More indirect and unquantifiable benefits in the analysis are expected to come
from:

     Positive economic externalities. The project resulted in an improvement in the
      business environment in which farmers operate thus reducing transactions costs.
      In addition to strictly farming activities, PADEP increased access to market
      information, enhanced the development of self entrepreneurship behaviors and
      also advocated for a culture of capital-management among communities, farmers
      being required to have a saving account and deposit at least 50 percent of the
      value of inputs needed for the following season. Other externalities arose from the
      improvement of the enabling environment, due to capacity building activities
      implemented at the national and local level, together with a support to regulatory
      and policy-making institutions (for example, endorsement of District Agricultural
      Development Plans- DADP, support for Savings and Credit Cooperative
      Societies- SACCOS, support to implementation of the 2008 Fertilizer Act, Seed
      Act of 2000, Plant Breeders Rights and draft contract farming legislation).

     Positive social externalities. PADEP brought being and welfare at the household
      level, due to an increase in purchasing power (from about a 30 percent increase in
      incomes, as reported in the IA) that allowed access to a broader amount of assets
      (land, livestock, rehabilitation of houses, hand hoes, ox-plough, radios, mobile

                                             35
        phones, bicycles). PADEP also strengthened human capital through: (i) the
        empowerment of communities (through trainings in participatory appraisal,
        monitoring and evaluation); (ii) the empowerment of grassroots producers’
        organizations; (iii) gender balance in sub-projects activities, with women
        comprising at least 40 percent of membership of sub-projects; and (iv) HIV/AIDS
        prevention.

      Positive environmental externalities. PADEP has integrated environmental issues
       in project formulation. According to the Environmental Audit Report, there was a
       considerable increase in the degree of environmental awareness to farming
       communities.

     C- Descriptive analysis

7.     Under PADEP the cost sharing was between the Government of Tanzania -which
averaged 2.3 percent of PADEP’s total costs, the Bank (80.8 percent) and project direct
beneficiaries (16.9 percent).

8.      The matching fund provided under Component 1 has enabled farmers’ to increase
purchasing power and share risks for farm consumable inputs and infrastructure. The
project covered 50 percent and 80 percent of operational costs for FGIS and CIS
respectively (fertilizers, seeds, technologies for livestock breeding improvement). Also
under Component 1, the project contributed 100 percent of the costs for technical
assistance and training for both CIS and FGIS groups.

9.      According to the M&E database of PADEP, 780,474 farming households10
contributed matching grants in cash and in kind amounting 19,812,792,943 Tanzanian
Shillings11. The average contribution is about Tsh. 25,400 per farmer for the 2-year life
cycle of each CIS and FGIS. Findings from field visits, however, highlighted that the
valuation of the contribution in kind might have been underestimated for several
community investments (undervaluation of labor for construction works).

10.    Besides, Tsh 54 billion has been disbursed by the project for both the Mainland
(Tsh 47.77 billion) and Zanzibar (Tsh 8.44 billion)12. PADEP hence financed about Tsh
70,000 for farm operational costs and grants for training and technical assistance to
farmers.

11.     The incremental costs at the household level averaged Tsh 94,000 (about US$ 65)
for 2 years.

12.    These relatively small investments allowed farmers to increase their incomes by
about 30 percent (IA). This simple observation shows that limited investments at the farm
and community group level, together with a strong ownership and empowerment of
stakeholders, has yielded high returns, suggesting that the project has been efficient and
economically attractive.

   D- Quantitative analysis: methodology and assumptions

13.     Given the difficulty of assessing the returns to institutional strengthening and
capacity building (at the district and national levels), the present analysis focuses on the
returns from Component 1 of PADEP only.

14.     Farm budgets for some of the most important crops under PADEP (maize, rice,
millet, sunflower and eggs) were mainly based on PADEP’s IA and some findings of the
M&E database. At the FGIS and CIS level, the M&E database could typically provide
data on about 40 percent of the total number of subprojects (i.e. about 1,600 sub-projects).
The M&E database gives key information on: (i) the number of households per
subproject, and (ii) the share of sub-projects’ operational costs supported by PADEP and
beneficiaries (incremental costs). This characteristic data was provided for crops and egg
production.

15.     Yield increases attributable to PADEP are calculated as the difference in average
yields between PADEP participants and non-participants at the end of the project, based
on the IA February in 2010. This method has the advantage over comparing beginning
and end of project yields in that it removes some of the time related attribution issues
such as policy changes, weather and changing technology. However, it may introduce a
selection bias because better performing farmers or villages were selected as PADEP
participants. This selection bias would in all likelihood result in an overestimation of the
yield increases attributable to PADEP. In calculating the stream of benefits from PADEP
investments, it is assumed that yields would increase steadily over a period of 5 years to
reach the 2010 PADEP observed yields in that year. This assumption is based on
discussions with farmers and key informants during field visits which highlighted that
yield increases were progressive and step-wise. A net stream of incremental benefits was
computed over a 10-year horizon.

           Note: The yield change as a result of PADEP is assumed to be the yield difference between
           PADEP beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries in 2010. .

16.     The collection of rural price data essentially benefited from the IA. Whenever
price data was unavailable in the IA, the calculations used average price data collected
during field visits and internet trade information platforms13. Prices have not been
disaggregated around the agricultural cropping cycle (therefore ignoring the sometimes
significant price fluctuations during the cropping cycle). All prices were given in
constant 2008-2009 prices.

       E- Results

17.    As assumed in the PAD, internal rate of return (IRRs) and benefit-cost ratios
(BCR) were computed for an assumed project life cycle of 10 years. A standard 12
percent opportunity cost of capital was used to compute NPVs. The IRR for PADEP’s
main enterprises, together with their corresponding NPVs and BCR are presented in
Table 2.

18.      The IA carried out by the Government performed efficiency analysis for 2
irrigation schemes (Idodi and Tibirinzi) and a warehouse scheme (Namajani warehouse).
The results shown in table 3 highlights that the warehouse and irrigation sub-projects
have been economically viable.

     F- Sensitivity Analysis

19.     A basic sensitivity analysis was performed using two key variables affecting the
project: (i) output prices and (ii) agricultural yields.

20.      Food price inflation was high in Tanzania. The weighted average costs of the
food basket (food CPI- Consumer Price Index) rose by 13 percent between 2007 and
2008 and 17 percent between 2008 and 2009 according to LABORSTA14 statistics. Thus,
the sensitivity analysis tested the impact of a 15 percent decreases in food prices on
PADEP’s returns. Results are given in Table 4 below. The sensitivity analysis found that
results for rice, sunflower and livestock enterprises are robust against changes in output
prices.

The sensitivity analysis tested the impact of a 15 percent decrease in agricultural yields.
Results are given in Table 4. The sensitivity analysis shows that results are robust against
potential changes in yields for rice, sunflower and livestock enterprises. The profitability
of maize husbandry, however, is sensitive to decreases in price and yield levels. More
specifically, if maize prices or yields decrease by 15 percent, the IRR and BCR values
fall below the t he minimum required rate of return for the project...

                          Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

A beneficiary survey was conducted as part of the larger impact assessment (IA)
completed in February 2011. The key results from this survey are primarily related to
beneficiary empowerment and beneficiary satisfaction with the CDD approach used. The
results are summarized as follows:

The IA uses two categories of indicators of empowerment: The first is the proportion of
farmers who participated in PRA exercises and the proportion of farmers involved in
identification of group investment subprojects. PRA was particularly seen as an
empowering tool as it is an important element of situation analysis. More specifically, as
a tool it enables beneficiary groups to study and clearly understand their socio-economic
and ecological opportunities and constraints. Based on the results of the PRA,
beneficiaries are able to design solutions to their production constraints. Also, previous
projects and programs put no emphasis on farmer empowerment. The second category of
indicators of farmer empowerment is the participation and involvement of women in FGs,
leadership of FGs, marketing of agricultural products and control of income. PADEP
promotes technological innovation through farmer groups in which members have
voluntarily agreed, with the endorsement of their Village Council, to engage in an
investment subproject that introduces technological innovation.

Most of the target beneficiaries in the IA felt that their ability to implement investment
subprojects was a result of the level of empowerment attained through: their participation
in PRAs and in making decisions on investment subprojects to implement; training
received through groups; the increasing self-confidence of women; grants provided by
PADEP for acquisition of improved technologies and inputs; being directly given
freedom to manage and make decisions on the use of financial resources contributed by
the project; and the procurement of resources required to implement investment
subprojects.

Almost 70 percent of the interviewed project beneficiaries in the IA participated in PRAs,
while almost 90 percent of them were involved in identification of group investment
subprojects. During interviews and FG discussions, most of the farmers were of the
opinion that they were free to contribute ideas during the meetings and that their ideas
were taken into account in arriving at the final decision.

With respect to the second category of indicators, the IA clearly shows that almost 86.1
percent of the project beneficiaries in participating villages were members of FGs, while
only about 18.6 percent of the non-beneficiaries were members. The situation is different
in the non-participating villages where only 14.5 percent of the interviewed farmers were
members of FGs. The IA also showed that with the exception of three districts, there
were a higher proportion of women (19.4 percent) who were responsible for marketing
the produce in beneficiary households compared to non-beneficiary households (15.6
percent). Women who were interviewed in participating villages attribute this largely to
the project’s efforts to sensitize women to take a leading role in agricultural development.

  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION STAKEHOLDERS WORKSHOP
            Held at Blue Pearl Hotel, Dar es Salaam, 4th June 2010
                                 (Summary)

The Participatory Agricultural Development and Empowerment Project (PADEP)
convened a one day project closing workshop for stakeholders, on 4th June 2010. The
workshop was attended by a broad range of stakeholders of Agricultural Development
from Tanzania (Mainland and Zanzibar). These included participating Ministries from
both Mainland Tanzania and the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar; representatives
from ASDP Lead Ministries, the World Bank and other Development Partner Agencies;
leaders from participating Regions, Districts, and Villages as well as farmer
representatives from participating groups and communities. The main objectives of the
workshop were to: (i) provide feedback to stakeholders on experiences, lessons learned
and challenges encountered during implementation of PADEP; (ii) agree on positive
aspects of PADEP implementation that can be up-scaled to similar on-going and future
initiatives; (iii) advise the government on positive strategies to improve the agricultural
sector. The workshop involved presentations of implementation completion report,
achievements, lessons and challenges by farmers and local government authorities;
plenary discussions and questions and answers sessions.

Experiences and lessons to success: Stakeholders indicated that: (i) the application of
participatory approaches to problem identification and planning promoted a sense of
ownership of the sub-projects to beneficiary. In turn this promoted empowerment of the
beneficiaries on decision making processes (ii) capacity building through training to
Project implementation teams prior and during implementation stages was another reason
behind successful implementation (iii) DADEP implementation was mainstreamed in
existing administrative structures in participating districts – this facilitated close
monitoring of project activities by districts (iv) team work spirit, transparency in financial
matters (budgeting income and expenditure) (v) collective decision making including
those on procurement processes also contributed to the success of the Project.

Farmer experiences: During the discussions farmers shared their experiences and
expressed how their livelihoods have improved through increased household incomes and
production resulting from implementing PADEP sub-projects. Farmers informed the
workshop that CDD approach was the basis of their success. The project had a practical
way of empowering farmers, something that made them partners in the project
implementation process.

Constraints and challenges: Stakeholders identified the following project implementation
constraints and challenges:
•       Deficiencies in resource contributions from some districts,
•       Sub-standard products that did not correspond to value for money in certain sub-
projects

                                             44
•      Inefficiency on part of some implementing staff. This resulted in delayed
accomplishment of planned activities in some areas
•      Dormant Bank accounts where funds were left for longer periods without use
•      Incomplete contracts by some of the contractors. These either abandoned their
contracts or delivered sub-standard services and goods
•      Interference through giving directives by non-project experts and incompetent
persons,
•      Some sub-projects did not consider participatory approaches in their formulation,
•      Delayed implementation progress reports in some cases
•      How to address issues related to marketing of commodity products in sub-projects

How to improve similar on-going or future initiatives in the sector: Learning form
PADEP, stakeholders proposed to government that participatory approaches to project
formulation and implementation through CDD should be scaled up to other projects in
the sector. Specific improvements proposed are:
•       Development of commodity markets should be given priority during formulation
of agricultural development programs and projects. Such priority should also be
emphasized in ASDP implementation.

•      Participatory plans have shown successes in developing the agricultural sector.
This approach should continue to be emphasized in future development initiatives.

•       The government (in particular LGAs) should work out means of integrating
former PADEP assisted farmer groups into ASDP through DADPs. The groups can also
be integrated into projects/initiatives of other NGOs

•         To avoid duplication of efforts all agricultural development projects should be
mainstreamed into one. This policy is already applicable to ASDP but its implementation
is still below satisfaction. In Zanzibar ASSP should also be mainstreamed into the new
Zanzibar ASDP.

•       Government regulations and procedures for procurement of contracts for services
of projects should be adhered to. Stern measures should be taken against defaulters.

•       Disbursement of funds directly to end users is a very appropriate approach. What
is needed is concrete supervision on the use of funds. Of particular concern are funds
directed to construct or invest into agricultural development infrastructures where
supervision by relevant experts is of utmost importance.

•       Tax exemption on agricultural equipment such as power tillers should be
seriously considered in order to promote a fast adoption of such equipments/technologies.

•      The government should lift the ban on sales of agricultural produce to
neighboring countries in order to promote market and conducive prices to farmers as well
as boost the country’s foreign exchange earnings



                                           45
•       The government has decided to implement ASDP in phases at village level
(learning from PADEP). This process should be approached with care and its
implementation should be harmonized throughout the country.

                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION

1. Towards the turn of last century poor performance of the agricultural sector and
   abject poverty compelled Tanzania to review its rural development policies and
   approaches so as to promote sustainable rural livelihoods. In 2000, the Poverty
   Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and later the National Programme for Economic
   Growth and Poverty Reduction (NPGPR or MKUKUTA) and the Zanzibar Strategy
   for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (ZSGRP or MKUZA) as tools for achieving
   Tanzania’s Development Vision 2025 and 2020 respectively, were launched. In the
   Mainland, the Rural Development Strategy (2001) and a complementary Agricultural
   Sector Development Strategy (ASDS, 2001) were formulated in order to translate the
   PRSP into implementable actions.

2. In 2003, the Government designed the Agricultural Sector Development Program
   (ASDP), which spelt out how to implement the ASDS. In an attempt to achieve the
   objectives of the above policy framework and strategies, various programmes and
   projects are implemented. One of the Projects is the Participatory Agricultural
   Development and Empowerment Project (PADEP), which is a key instrument,
   designed to achieve sustainable agricultural development.

3. Most of the past projects and programmes were designed using top down approach
   with limited participation of rural communities followed by inappropriate and
   unfeasible technological linkages. Consequently, these projects failed to create
   desired impacts. The launch of PADEP was, therefore, an attempt to put in place a
   system that encourages participatory planning, implementation, monitoring and
   evaluation. PADEP focused on empowering Districts and Communities in developing
   their capacities to identify and implement demand driven and sustainable productive
   investments.

4. The overall development objective of PADEP is to increase farm incomes and reduce
   food insecurity, thereby contributing to reduction of rural poverty. The immediate
   objectives of the Project are to:
       (i) Strengthen the capacity of rural communities to plan and implement demand-
           driven agricultural development initiatives;
      (ii) Strengthen the institutional and human capacities of Local Authorities and
           national level to plan and implement community agricultural development
           initiatives;
     (iii) Increase agricultural productivity and production by promoting integrated and
           sustainable use and management of natural resources through adoption of
           improved technologies; and
     (iv) Enhance private sector participation in input and output markets, and in the
           provision of services to rural communities.



                                           47
5. The Performance of the Project is monitored through various indicators of objectives
   hierarchy. At sector level, the project contributes to the agricultural sector goals of
   reducing rural population below poverty line from 27 percent at baseline. At outcome
   level the project performance was measured through increase in agricultural
   productivity by at least 10 percent, increase in rural incomes, assets, and liquidity of
   participating households, including the following:
      (i) 840 villages in 28 District Councils implement at least one community
            investment subproject and four farmer group subprojects,
      (ii) At least 75 percent of these subprojects are implemented by farmer
            communities and groups,
      (iii) Each participating District has at least five staff who have been trained in
            participatory approaches,
      (iv) At least 50 percent of all planning, implementation and evaluation meetings
            between village communities and District service providers rated as
            satisfactory by participating households and village councils,
      (v) At least 50 percent of agricultural investments are channeled through
            community driven development mechanism,
      (vi) Four soil testing laboratories are rehabilitated, equipped and used by
            stakeholders,
      (vii) At least 50 percent of subprojects use private channels for services and
            marketing of inputs and outputs, respectively.

6. To realize the above objectives the Project implemented two main components
   namely: (i) Community Agricultural Development Sub-projects (CADS) and (ii)
   Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (ISCB). The CADS component
   provided grants to participating communities and farmers groups for agricultural
   development investments. Institutional strengthening and capacity building activities
   provided technical and financial support for identification, preparation,
   implementation, monitoring and evaluation of subprojects using participatory
   approaches. The Project operated at three levels namely, Community, District and
   National level.

7. The Project was designed to cost USD 69.99 million to be contributed by the targeted
   beneficiaries (USD 11.82 million), Local Government Authorities (LGAs) and the
   Central Government (USD 1.59 million) and the World Bank (USD 56.58 million).
   Overall, about 80 percent of the total Project costs were spent as grants for
   Community Agricultural Development Subprojects (CADS) and District Capacity
   Building (DCB).

8. Each District in the Mainland was allocated USD 1,380,000 to implement the CADS
   component over a period of three years. Each participating village was allocated Tshs
   35,000,000.00 (equiv. USD 35,000) in the Mainland and Tshs 20,000,000.00 (equiv.
   USD 20,000) in Zanzibar to implement Community Investment Subproject (CIS). In
   addition, Tshs 11 million (equiv. USD 11,000) in the Mainland or Tshs 7,800,000.00
   (equiv. USD 7,800) in Zanzibar to implement Farmers Groups Investment Subproject
   (FGIS). On the other hand, target beneficiaries were required to contribute in kind

                                            48
     and cash at least 20 percent for CIS, and between 20 and 50 percent for FGIS
     implementation costs.

STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION

Project coverage

9. The Project was implemented in 33 District Councils on the Mainland and nine (9)
   Districts in Zanzibar. On the Mainland, these Districts started implementation of
   Project activities in three different phases. Phase I involved 8 Districts, which started
   implementation in year 2003. These included Morogoro/Mvomero15, Hai/Siha,
   Hanang, Singida, Masasi/Nanyumbu, Arusha/Meru, Nachingwea and Iringa/Kilolo.
   Eight Phase II District Councils started implementation in 2004. These included
   Iramba, Babati, Mbulu, Kiteto, Uyui, Urambo, Sikonge and Karatu. Phase III District
   Councils that joined in 2005 are Monduli/Longido, Moshi, Rombo, Mwanga, Same,
   Handeni, Ulanga, Kilindi Lushoto, Korogwe and Kilombero. The main reason for
   adopting phasing was to use each phase to learn and gain experiences and use lessons
   learnt to improve the next phase.

10. In Zanzibar, the Project was implemented in all nine Districts. Phase one covered five
    Districts and during scaling-up period the remaining Districts were reached. In Pemba
    it covered Wete, Chake-Chake, Micheweni, and Mkoani Districts; whereas in Unguja
    Districts covered were North A, North B, South, Central, West and South Unguja. In
    total 814 villages and 174 Shehia, on the Mainland and Zanzibar, respectively were
    reached. In these villages a total of 6,247 subprojects (i.e. 5,178 FGIS and 1,069 CIS)
    were identified and implemented surpassing the target of 4,790 subprojects planned to
    be implemented.

Financial performance

11. Overall the financial performance of the Project in respect to Project cost and
    financing, disbursements, accounts and audits, procurement and technical assistance
    is satisfactory. The total expenditure to-date is SDR 38,566,182.13 (Tshs
    76,842,978,214).

12. The United Republic of Tanzania contributed a total of Tshs. 2,945,405,019 (equiv. to
    US $ 2,244,900). The design required the Government to contribute Tshs.
    1,590,000,000 throughout the Project lifetime. These figures show that the
    Government contribution was highly satisfactory as it exceeded against the target by
    85.2%. The contribution from farmers was also highly satisfactory. According to the



15
   Split districts are Masasi/Nanyumbu, Iringa/Kilolo, Hai/Siha, Morogoro/Mvomero, Monduli/Longido and Arusha/Meru
respectively. The split was done after the Project had phased out in those districts and some of the participating villages are in those
new districts



                                                                  49
   monitoring and evaluation database Farmers contributed matching grants in cash and
   in kind amounting to Tshs 19,812,792,943 against that target amount of Tshs.
   11,820,000,000. This is about 67.6% above the target.

13. The financial management on the Mainland is based on the manual financial
    accounting system that was specially developed for the Project. A computerized
    financial management system called Epicor and Excel in the Mainland and Zanzibar
    respectively, were used at all levels for capturing financial data and producing
    periodic reports. The main customized report, which was produced quarterly and
    annually at PADEP headquarter includes Statement of Receipts and Payments of
    Funds, Expenditure Statement by Category and Expenditure Statement by
    Component/Activity.

14. The PCU handled all financial management coordination, including the preparation
    and submission of monthly withdrawal application requests, quarterly Financial
    Monitoring Reports (FMRs) and annual Project accounts. A total of 143 withdrawal
    applications worth Tshs.76, 842,978,214, which was equivalent to USD 58,346,961,
    were requested and replenished. Twenty nine (29) quarterly Financial Monitoring
    Reports were shared and seven annual Project financial reports were prepared and
    audited and a clean certificate was obtained in all cases.

15. CADS Component: A total amount spent and accounted for to IDA by 30th June
    2010 was Tshs. 46,507,496,865 (equivalent to USD 35,313,209). Out of the total
    CADS expenditure amount spent for implementation of CIS and FGIS is Tshs.
    39,237,184,295 (equivalent to USD 29,905,414) for Tanzania mainland and Tshs.
    7,270,312,570 (equivalent to USD 5,541,216) for Zanzibar component.

16. Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening Component: At district level, a
    total of Tshs. 9,650,824,214 (equiv. to USD 7,327,885) was disbursed and accounted
    for as a support for institutional strengthening and capacity building activities in
    Mainland and Zanzibar by 30th June 2010. Out of this Tshs. 8,472,978,943
    (equivalent. to USD 6,457,852) was for Mainland and Tshs. 1,177,845,271
    (equivalent. to USD 897,719) for Zanzibar. At national level a total amount spent and
    accounted for to IDA for institution capacity and institution strengthening by 30th
    June 2010 was Tshs. 16,892,536,414 and Tshs. 2,566,976,519 (equivalent to USD
    14,831,461) for Mainland and Zanzibar, respectively. In addition, another fund
    amounting USD 713,299 was spent and accounted to IDA as Project Preparation
    Fund (PPF).

17. During the implementation period, two financial re-allocations were undertaken in
    August 2008 and in May 2009 after the decision by the Joint implementation review
    missions (Table 7 & 8). Specifically, the May 2009 re-allocation was meant to
    support: (i) up-scaling of the Zanzibar component; (ii) developing an exit strategy for
    completed and on-going community agricultural subprojects to ensure sustainability;
    (iii) mainstreaming of Project experiences and lessons into ASDP (Mainland); (iv)



                                            50
   undertaking Project Impact Assessment study; (v) documentation of lessons and
   experiences and (vi) preparation of Implementation Completion Report.

Procurement

18. Recruitment of key staff at the PCU was done at the beginning that spearheaded
    smooth implementation of the Project. Thereafter, the Project procured various items
    required to facilitate implementation at National and District level. These include
    vehicles, motorcycles, office equipments, generators, cameras, and computers and
    computer accessories.

19. The Project prepared a participatory community procurement manual that was used to
    train beneficiaries on how to undertake procurement. Depending on the cost of items
    or services to procure, adherence to the Government’s Public Procurement Act,
    Public Procurement Regulatory Act and IDA procurement Guidelines were
    emphasized. Towards the end of Project implementation this manual was reviewed so
    that it can be used for DADP implementation.

20. Using a five-year procurement plan, the PCU in collaboration with ASLMs undertook
    procurement at the National Level. At District level, District Councils were given a
    grant used for, among others, procurement of goods and services following a capacity
    building need assessment that was undertaken by each LGA. At community and
    farmers group level, the CIS and FGIS Committees were responsible for procurement
    of goods (construction materials, seeds/seedlings; fertilizers and other agrochemicals)
    and services (capacity building, technical services such as engaging civil works
    contractors) for community investment subprojects. Community participation in
    procurement enabled subproject ownership by the farmers and enhanced
    sustainability.

Subproject identification, preparation and implementation

21. Community Driven Development approach (CDD) was used to implement the Project
    in order to ensure farmers inclusion and empowerment so as to get sustainable results.
    Thus, a total of 6,247 investment subprojects (130%) against the plan of 4,790
    subprojects were identified, prepared and implemented by community members. Out
    of these, 1,069 (109%) were community investment subprojects and 5,178 (136%)
    were farmer’s groups investment subprojects. The variation was due to the flexibility
    built in the Project design whereby communities were allowed to use funds saved
    from one subproject to invest in another subproject depending on their priorities.

22. Thematically, implemented subprojects covered ten major themes. Overall, more
    communities and farmers groups invested in technologies related to livestock
    improvement (41%); crop improvement (27%); agricultural mechanization (9%);
    horticultural crops improvement (7%); inputs-outputs marketing improvement (5%);
    rain water harvesting and water storage (5%); smallholder irrigation improvement
    (3%) environmental, watershed management and soil and water conservation (3%);

                                            51
   produce processing (2%) and less than 1% on fish farming. These results show that
   when farmers are given opportunity in decision-making they invest in areas that affect
   their felt needs.

Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building

23. A total of 640 District and Ward Facilitation Team (DFT/WFT) members received
    mandatory training in PRA, extended O&OD, Participatory Monitoring and
    Evaluation and Project Planning and Appraisal. The DFT/WFT were also trained on
    Public Private Sector Partnerships, Financial Management and Procurement,
    HIV/AIDS, Environmental and Social Safeguards and basic computer skills. District
    and Ward Facilitation Teams supported farm level subproject committees to identify,
    prepare and implement demand driven agricultural interventions.

24. Each participating District was provided with a Capacity Building Grant amounting
    to over Tshs 175,000,000.00 that enabled them to build their capacities to undertake
    the Project activities in their jurisdiction areas. On the other hand, ten Regional
    Secretariats in the Mainland, namely: Mtwara, Lindi, Morogoro, Iringa, Tanga,
    Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Manyara, Singida and Tabora were supported to supervise and
    provide technical support to the District Councils under their administrative areas.

Support for DADP Development and Institutionalization

25. The Project used its implementation lessons and experiences to facilitate Districts to
    develop quality DADPs. Based on the Project’s experiences, DADP’s planning and
    implementation guideline was developed and the Project supported DADP training
    programs and backstopping. The Project has also supported training of 22 members
    of the ASDP’s National Facilitation Team (NFT) on DADP planning and
    backstopping implementation process. The trained NFT members were thereafter
    involved in training over 1,980 DFT and WFT members and 63 Regional Secretariat
    officers from all 21 regions on DADP formulation and implementation processes. A
    total of 132 DADPs are developed and assessed for quality each year following this
    intervention.

Review of DADP training materials

26. The Project assisted ASDP to review four training manuals on DADP implementation.
    These include Project Planning and Appraisal; Extended O & OD; Community
    Procurement Manual; and Environmental and Social Management Manual as part of
    mainstreaming of PADEP experiences. These documents are currently being used by
    ASDP to train DFTs and WFTs to improve their DADP implementation skills.

Policy and Regulatory Framework Improvement

27. The Project supported formulation of fertilizer legislations with a view of developing
    competitive fertilizer market; drafting of regulations governing the Veterinary Act No.

                                            52
   6 of 2003; preparation of the guidelines for implementing the Seed Act and Plant
   Breeders’ legislation and the establishment of the Plant Breeders Registrars’ Office;
   supported Tanzania Official Seed Certification Institute to train their front line staff
   on enforcement of inputs and outputs market regulations; and the formulation of
   Contract Farming Bill (in 2009). Furthermore, support was given to formation and
   capacity enhancement of the Agricultural Council of Tanzania (ACT) including
   preparation of its strategic plan and establishment of Horticulture Development
   Council of Tanzania (HODECT).

28. On the other hand, in Zanzibar the Project supported Ministerial training needs
    assessment; review of Cooperative Policy; streamlining Environmental Policy to
    include aspects of global climate change and rainfall variability. The Project also
    supported forum for public and private sectors dialogue in areas for improvement of
    policy and regulatory framework to enhance private sector development, and
    restructuring of Department of Policy and Planning.

Technological linkages

29. The Project rehabilitated and equipped four soil-testing laboratories located at Selian,
    Uyole, Ukiruguru and Mlingano research institutes at the cost of Tshs 319,494,635.00.
    All zonal Agricultural Research Institutes were also supported to compile and
    disseminate released technologies and a booklet containing those interventions was
    prepared and disseminated to stakeholders. The Project further supported
    technological linkage activities such as workshops, study tours and exchange visits to
    enhance knowledge sharing among stakeholders.

Environmental and social safeguards

30. By design, PADEP was to ensure adherence to the World Bank environmental and
    social safeguard policies. The safeguard policies which were directly related to the
    Project activities are OP/BP 4.01 Environmental Assessment, Op 4.09 Pest
    Management, OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement, OP 4.36 Forests and OP 7.50
    Project on International Waterways. An ex-ante Environmental Impact Assessment
    (EIA) of the Project was conducted at the beginning of the Project implementation.
    The results from EIA showed that PADEP funded subprojects generally were to have
    minimal impacts to the environment. The study recommended that Environmental
    and Social Management in subprojects should begin with screening of proposed
    subprojects during the PRA process and assigning category to a subproject to
    determine the magnitude of the expected impacts.

31. All 6,247 subprojects that were funded by the Project had mandatory section on
    Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) as an integral part of the
    subproject management. The prepared ESMP was made simple to allow farmers to
    use it. A training module on environmental management and safeguards was prepared
    and used to train the DFT, WFT and farmers to raise their awareness on
    environmental issues. This module was later reviewed and approved by Agricultural

                                            53
   Sector Lead Ministries to be used in ASDP implementation. In July 2007, the Project
   undertook environmental audit, which observed that despite few cases of poor
   planning and implementation of the plans, generally there was satisfactory quality and
   implementation of most of ESMPs.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND OUTCOMES

Productivity of Crop and livestock enterprises

32. Average productivity of various crop enterprises among Project beneficiaries is
    steadily increasing. For instance, a maize yield in the participating villages indicates
    increase from an average of 2.07 ton per ha (at baseline during PRA) to 2.60 tons per
    ha reported in the Impact assessment study conducted towards the end of 2009.
    Productivity in maize was higher in Iringa, Iramba and Karatu compared to the other
    five Districts that were sampled during the impact assessment study. In Iringa yield
    increased from an average of 3.70 tons per ha in 2005 to 4.06 tons per ha in 2008/09;
    Iramba from 1.80 tons per ha in 2004 to 3.94 tons per ha in 2008/09. Cassava yields
    increased from 2.24 tons/ha in 2004 to 4.12 tons/ha in 2008/09 in Masasi, 2.47
    tons/ha in 2005 to 2.99 tons/ha in 2008/09 in Pemba, and 3.06 tons/ha in 2005 to 4.17
    tons/ha in 2008/09 in Unguja. Ceteris peribus, the change was associated with the
    Project interventions. Average productivity of milk rose from less than 4.25 to 8.5
    litres per cow per day among beneficiaries. Irrespective of the District, Project
    beneficiaries achieved higher milk yields per cow per day than non-beneficiaries in
    participating and non-participating villages.

33. The proportion of beneficiaries using improved crop based and livestock technologies
    is higher than the proportion of farmers using similar technologies in non-
    participating villages. Interviews with farmers showed that 81.6% of the beneficiaries
    compared to 55% of non-beneficiaries had adopted improved seeds, while 46.3%
    beneficiaries compared with 23.9% of non-beneficiaries had adopted inorganic
    fertilizers. The proportion of beneficiaries who have adopted improved livestock
    breeds is 57.3% while only 15% of non-beneficiaries have adopted the same. Forty
    six percent of the beneficiaries were practicing zero grazing compared with 17% of
    the non-beneficiaries.

Food security
34. Project beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries indicated improvement of household food
    security after implementing PADEP supported interventions. On average 76.7% and
    35.2% of those who indicated improvement of food security in participating and non-
    participating villages respectively, associate the improvement to the uptake
    agricultural technologies disseminated during the Project period. Almost 44% and
    14.5% of the non-beneficiaries in participating villages and non-participating villages,
    respectively, acknowledged that they were able to feed their households from own
    farm produced food without purchase and external support throughout the year. The
    proportion of non-beneficiary households in participating villages, which were able to
    feed themselves throughout the year, varied from 19.9% in Unguja to 66.8% in Iringa.

                                             54
35. Quarterly progress reports from Iringa District Council show that Idodi and Magozi
    villages were before PADEP a hunger prone area because the wet season was too
    short to sustain a single paddy crop. But since the completion of their irrigation
    subprojects the villages are now food granaries for neighboring villages. Irrigation
    and improved cropping husbandry practices were particularly the reason behind their
    success. In other communities like Idodi, storage facilities enabled farmers to store
    food crops for a longer period using a grain banking system.

Impact on Income
36. Income security is also one of the targets to be achieved by PADEP and hence
    MKUKUTA. An impact assessment study showed that most of the Project
    beneficiaries indicated that their incomes have generally increased. The proportion of
    PADEP beneficiaries who indicated that their enterprise and household incomes have
    increased since implementation of FGIS is higher than for non-beneficiaries.
    Beneficiaries indicated also that income is more reliable compared to non-
    beneficiaries due to use of technologies that reduce production risks like irrigation,
    water harvesting and soil water conservation (PADEP Impact Assessment Study,
    2010).

Impact on access to produce market and market information
37. PADEP believes that a reliable market is a major incentive of change in any
    agricultural intervention. A number of Project interventions were put in place to
    improve market access including enhancement of private sector participation in
    providing goods and services. Despite differences between Districts, the proportion of
    Project beneficiaries indicating increase in market access is higher than the proportion
    of non-beneficiaries who indicated increase in market access during the past three to
    five years (PADEP Impact Assessment Study, 2010). Interventions which might have
    contributed to improvement in market access include promotion of farmer groups,
    enhancement of public-private sector partnership in input and output markets, training
    programme to link groups with private sector; road, market and storage infrastructure
    improvement through CIS.

Impact on household assets
38. A good number of Project beneficiaries have purchased households assets from
    income proceeds from their investments subproject to improve their welfare. Results
    from impact assessment study quantified data on the number of households that
    purchased livestock, farm implements, bicycles, sewing machines, radio, TV, mobile
    phones and solar power for home use. Other beneficiaries built new or rehabilitated
    old houses by removing thatches in favor of iron-corrugated sheets.

Sustainability of the Community Driven Development approach
39. The success of PADEP is rooted in the participatory approach (Community Driven
    Development – CDD) that was employed in mobilizing farmers to formulate,
    implement, monitor and evaluate subprojects. CDD operates on the principles of local
    community empowerment, participatory governance, demand-responsiveness,

                                            55
   administrative autonomy, greater downward accountability, enhanced local capacity
   and sustainability. CDD gives stakeholders’ decision-making powers and control over
   planning and implementation process. The approach further enables beneficiaries to
   control investment resources thus increasing their empowerment. Within this context,
   the approach that PADEP adopted provides greater chances of sustainability not only
   of the interventions, but also the approach as it addresses felt needs of the
   beneficiaries. This is good news for ASDP, which is using a similar approach.

40. The group approach (synonymous to farmer field schools) that was used to implement
    the subprojects has cemented partnerships and strengthened the tendency of self-
    confidence among the farmers. It was a conduit through which new messages on
    improved agriculture were channeled. The group approach was particularly
    instrumental in accessing and disseminating agricultural technologies that have
    contributed to improvements in farmers’ welfare. Implementation of ASDP is already
    using the CDD approach in order to meet its objectives.

41. The institutional setup within which PADEP has been operating, that is, through
    village communities and subproject committees increased efficiency and
    accountability. At local level, the Project operated through existing groups, which
    later formed subproject committees, which were responsible for day-to-day activities.
    At Ward and District levels, the Project design encouraged the formation of
    facilitation teams that fall within the LGA administration structures. These teams
    undertook all the facilitation process. This system has enhanced the capacity of the
    LGA to render services within the framework of the democratically elected
    governments.

CONCLUSIONS

42. The participatory approach puts farmers on the driver’s seat, empowering them to
    participate in decision making, planning, implementing and controlling resources
    including those which are provided by the Government. In so doing, the relationship
    between the public service providers became that of equal partners, whereby
    extension services ceased to be instructors and became facilitators. Implementation of
    the Project has opened doors for long-term agricultural transformation. The successes
    achieved through PADEP indicate that with proper approaches, Tanzania can
    transform the agricultural sector in a more sustainable manner. The biggest secret of
    success is farmer empowerment, allowing them to participate in decision making,
    planning and owning the entire implementation process.

      LESSONS LEARNT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

43. Throughout Project implementation lessons were drawn and challenges faced were
    resolved using experiences gained in different phases of implementation. This section
    summarises some of the lessons, highlight challenges faced and the recommendations
    for on-going and future interventions such as DADPs.

(i)     Use of interdisciplinary facilitation teams composed of members from different
        departments at District and Wards levels was a good idea. Different disciplines
        complement each other to address farmers’ problems and needs in a holistic
        manner. However, more often the participation of DFT/WFT members from
        departments other than agriculture and livestock was limited. This is because they
        had other obligations and their departmental assignments. As a result facilitation
        and supervision of field activities turned to be difficult because the size of the
        trained team envisaged providing support to communities and farmers groups
        became small. It is recommended that:

           Districts should have adequate, specific and permanent facilitation teams that
            will be available and work as a team to support communities towards
            achieving development objectives.
           Districts should also build capacity to all extension staff to impart skills on
            participatory planning and implementation processes.

(ii)    Empowering rural communities through the participatory approaches in
        identifying, prioritizing their agricultural problems/needs, propose their
        interventions, implement, monitor and evaluate them won a great appreciation by
        the farmers. Furthermore, farmers were given a rare opportunity to own financial
        resources, undertake procurement of goods and services and took active role in
        preparing investment proposals. While this is widely acknowledged and scaled-up
        to other Districts that were not implementing PADEP, the challenge is whether
        these LGAs have adequate capacity to implement CDD approach through DADPs
        when they have limited understanding and appreciation of the approach. It is
        recommended that after PADEP closure ASDP/ASSP/ASDP-L should enhance
        using CDD approach in holistic manner to cover all LGAs

(iii)   Sustainability of development interventions within the CDD framework largely
        depends on beneficiary’s ownership of the process of planning and
        implementation. Matching contributions (in cash or kind) for community and
        group-level subprojects have enhanced community empowerment, ownership and
        accountability. Farmers’ willingness to contribute directly correlated to the level
        of participation leading to appropriate choice of interventions. It has been
        observed, however, that in some Districts there is weak coordination and
        conflicting operational policies and modalities between organizations and
        institutions that work with communities. For example, PADEP required
        beneficiaries to contribute but other programmes give absolute grants. It is
        recommended that the Government and other development partners need to

                                             57
       harmonise policies to address matching contribution issues amongst development
       programs.

(iv)   Some Districts embarked on procurement of goods and services before
       developing a comprehensive District capacity needs assessment that addressed
       needs of Ward and Village level where the actual work is done. For example,
       most of the Districts went on strengthening transport systems at District level
       instead of Ward level where village facilitators are based. Only few Districts,
       namely: Rombo, Mwanga, Babati; and Unguja and Pemba, procured motorcycles
       for the Ward level (WFT) staff. In some cases this denied farmers timely
       availability of technical support for successful and sustainability of their
       agricultural interventions. It is recommended that Districts should carry out
       comprehensive capacity building needs assessment to consider all level of
       implementation especially ward and village levels. Procurement of goods and
       services should adhere to their plans.

(v)    Farmers know their problems, causes and effects, better than anybody else but
       might not know exactly existing alternative solutions to address these problems.
       Farmers need assistance from facilitators to interpret their problems and identify
       appropriate solutions. In some cases, interventions identified by communities did
       not address real needs of farmers. This may be due to poor interpretation of
       farmers’ problems by DFT/WFT. For example, one of the misinterpretations of
       farmers’ problems is evident in subprojects that addressed marketing problems,
       which was interpreted to be construction of market structures, while the problem
       was better market prices. Later market structures were found to be under-utilised.
       The solutions might have been provision of market information to these farmers
       and organised them for collective marketing strategy. It is recommended that:

          Districts should build teams with adequate facilitation skills and technical
           knowhow in carrying participatory situational analysis and interpreting
           farmers identified problems to enable them to make choice of the appropriate
           solutions.
          District should also strengthen linkages between research and extension so as
           to reach and increase uptake of technologies available at researchers’ shelves.

(vi)   Where farmer empowerment is well implemented, demand for new technologies
       and extension services have increased. There were many cases where farmers
       came up demanding for technical advice, especially on where they could source
       new technologies. Farmers from Pemba and Unguja Islands went all the way to
       Babati and Dodoma, in the Mainland to search for improved dairy goats and cows.
       There were times when the demand was higher than what the supply side could
       offer. As more farmers are empowered the demand for services is also growing. It
       is recommended that public services should continuously encourage growth of
       private sector in service provision to meet farmers’ demands.




                                            58
(vii) Financial absorption capacity for farming communities is a function of close
      collaboration and trust between farmers, facilitators and leadership especially at
      District level. Specifically, good and committed leadership at District level
      involving District Commissioners, District Executive Directors, DALDO and
      Councillors has contributed greatly to PADEP to achieve its objectives. Past
      negative experiences in similar interventions where leaders misused farmers’
      resources jeopardise efforts to mobilise contributions from farmers. Another
      challenge is on how the DFT/WFT could convince communities by providing
      relevant information and guidance during mobilisation of farmer’s own
      contributions so as to attract matching grants from the government. It is
      recommended that:

          District Commissioners (DC) and other District leaders should be involved
           and sensitized from the beginning to understand Project concepts, so that they
           can provide needed support, particularly in mobilising farmers to participate
           and contribute.
          A small budget should be allocated to facilitate DCs to regularly backstop
           during implementation of community-based initiatives.

(viii) When local communities have been empowered through sensitization and training,
       they can become the most efficient managers of the environment. It was observed
       that strong community environmental management committees are emerging in
       some villages more than any other time before. However, most of the DFT/WFTs
       are inadequately equipped to facilitate communities to develop and implement
       environmental and social management plans to avoid adverse effects that are
       likely to happen during and after implementation of subprojects. It is
       recommended that further training should be conducted to DFT/WFT on
       environmental and social safeguards so that they can assist communities to
       develop and implement ESMP.

(ix)   Community financial and procurement management has proved to be an efficient
       and effective means of procuring goods and services at local level. When
       procurement is done at Community and District level time spent to deliver
       procured goods and services is tremendously cut down. However, existing public
       procurement legislations do not provide clear institutional framework for
       procurement to be managed by beneficiary communities. There is need for
       institutionalization of a decentralized financial and procurement management to
       allow effective community participation in ASDP implementation.

(x)    Farmers have not maximised the benefits that go with their investment in
       agriculture. Instead, they have experienced low farm gate prices especially during
       harvesting time and/or crop loss due to inadequate investments in value addition
       and lack of entrepreneurship skills. Lack of knowledge in value addition and
       entrepreneurship skills among farmers is due to weaknesses in facilitation among
       the DFT/WFTs. It is recommended that under ASDP implementation training on


                                           59
       value addition and entrepreneurship skills should be mandatory before farmers
       decide on investment opportunities.

(xi)   Following Project support to farming communities a good number of them have
       increased crop and livestock productivity. Surplus production has to be marketed
       so as to stimulate further investment. A reliable output market is particularly
       important as it provides farmers with opportunities to realise the returns to
       investments made in farming. While it is often easy to increase production,
       sustaining that level depends on whether there are market and price incentives to
       encourage farmers to continue investing in improved technologies. In addition,
       farmers need to be availed with reliable market information. It is recommended
       that Districts should continue to support establishment and strengthening of
       farmers associations into stronger marketing entities that would give them more
       bargaining power for better pricing of their produce in order to maximise benefit
       from market and storage infrastructure available in the villages.

(xii) The private sector is a major pillar for agricultural transformation in Tanzania.
      The sector provides goods and services such as supply of inputs, buying
      agricultural produce from farmers and construction of agricultural infrastructure.
      During the Project implementation, it was observed that involvement of the
      private sector in services provision was minimal mainly because the modalities
      for public-private sector partnerships in agricultural development are not well
      articulated. It is recommended that:

          Private Service providers should be sensitized and empowered so as to
           contribute towards supporting agricultural services particularly in the rural
           areas.
          Participation of the private sector in planning agricultural development
           programmes at all levels is important and necessary. Each District Council
           should establish a District public and private sector advisory committee and
           have private sector members in the DFTs where they can participate in
           planning and implementation.
