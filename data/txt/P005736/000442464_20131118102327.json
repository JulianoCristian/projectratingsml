outcome was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: weaknesses in the structures that\n            are used to integrate communities into the development\n            process can undermine securing genuine collaboration of\n            communities over the long term. It is important that\n            community organizations have sufficient legal standing to\n            ensure their legitimacy in representing the\n            communities' priorities to government agencies, that\n            communities view the leaders of such organizations as\n            legitimate, and that all segments of the population are\n            represented. Demonstrating the effectiveness of natural\n            resource management interventions requires attention to\n            monitoring and evaluation of actual outcomes. Measuring\n            actual results is not only important for understanding\n            whether the intended development impact has been achieved,\n            but also for assessing the cost effectiveness of the\n            measures supported and generating information on what needs\n            to be improved. Effective promotion of income-generating\n            projects requires more than support for production."}, "docdt": "2013-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
