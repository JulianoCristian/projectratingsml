users in\n            development programs. The main project components are two.\n            First, the Natural Resources Management Operations component\n            comprises two sub-components: (a) the project will finance\n            Participatory Development Plans (PDP) prepared by local\n            communities, assisted by the Regional Agricultural\n            Development Offices (CRDA) technical staff, to address their\n            priorities for soil and water conservation, agricultural and\n            pastoral development, small-scale irrigation systems and\n            other rural infrastructure, and women's support\n            activities; and (b) the project will finance erosion control\n            and water recharge investments in the three related\n            CRDA's, mainly on public lands, as part of the\n            government's national soil and water conservation\n            strategy, to protect the areas where a participatory\n            approach will be tested. The second component, Institutional\n            Strengthening, at both the CRDA and central levels, will\n            support Ministry of Agriculture human resources and\n            information systems development, and adjust the incentive\n            framework for sustainable resources management."}, "docdt": "1997-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
