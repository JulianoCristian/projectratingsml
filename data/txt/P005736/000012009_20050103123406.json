The first important lesson\n            in designing an integrated rural development type of\n            project, is that start-up will be slow due to the need to\n            carefully prepare local development plans in close\n            collaboration with the beneficiaries. Consequently, a\n            project preparation phase would be desirable, during which\n            institutional coordination units could be established, and\n            the required training, mainly for an integrated\n            participatory approach (IPA), provided. A second lesson is\n            that projects with complex institutional frameworks require\n            effective monitoring and evaluation systems, which should be\n            comprehensive and operationally sound, contain quantifiable\n            impact and output indicators, as well as physical and\n            financial achievement indicators, in order to be effective\n            project management tools. Third, it is necessary to address\n            simultaneously local private needs for productive\n            investments and public needs for socio-economic investments\n            in order to create the income and wealth necessary to\n            maintain the public investments. Both types of investments\n            need to be accompanied by public and/or private training and\n            advice to achieve their full potential. Finally, since\n            integrated rural development projects normally combine soft\n            investments (technical assistance and training), with hard\n            investments (physical works at the field level), the\n            assistance of other co-financiers with different terms and\n            conditions is often required. This can be risky, especially\n            when co-financing affects the project's key activities.\n            In such cases, the project financing plan must be well\n            designed, with co-financiers willing to fulfill their\n            commitments, and in addition, remedial measures must be anticipated."}, "docdt": "2004-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
