{"cdata!": "The loan would help finance the\n            Government's 1984-90 investment program for basic\n            education in the North and Center-West. The program\n            objectives are to define a long-term development plan for\n            basic education, and to improve the quality of basic\n            education in grades 1 - 4 of seven states and two federal\n            territories in the North and Center-West regions. In\n            addition, these objectives aim to expand access to basic\n            education within the region where existing facilities are\n            inadequate. The project includes two components: i) national\n            programs and (ii) specific sub-projects. Risks to project\n            success include the possibility of continued financial\n            difficulties in Brazil. To minimize this risk, the Bank\n            would disburse at a higher rate (72%) for 1984 and 1985, and\n            a lower rate (40%) thereafter. Frequent turnover of project\n            related personnel, particularly at state level, could break\n            the continuity in project implementation. To limit this\n            risk, salary incentives have been agreed with the\n            Government, and continuous project related training and\n            technical assistance are incoporated into project design."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
