The project will\n            accomplish this through expanding the scope of its\n            activities and extending its involvement into new areas in\n            nine participating States.  The project provides credit for\n            a rural storage component, involving the construction of\n            about 7,800 rural godowns in six States; a soybean\n            production and processing component, involving the\n            establishment of 800 Oilseed Growers' Cooperative\n            Societies, together with soybean seed processing plants and\n            solvent oil extraction plants in six States.  The project\n            also includes a cotton processing component, involving the\n            establishment of eleven cotton ginneries and five spinning\n            mills in five States.  Furthermore, the venture provides an\n            institution building component, involving the establishment\n            of Staff Training Institutes in six States, and development\n            of a training program for staff of the rural godowns,\n            processing plants, and cooperative agencies."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
