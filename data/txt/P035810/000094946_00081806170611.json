The project will: 1) implement tax\n            reforms, while improving revenue mobilization; 2) reduce\n            regulatory barriers at entry, and operation of businesses,\n            and enhance competitiveness; 3) improve the financial\n            condition of utilities, initiating a privatization process;\n            and, 4) strengthen the social protection system, partly to\n            compensate the poor for utility tariff increases. It is\n            expected that the project will consolidate fiscal\n            adjustment, and improve private sector growth, fostering\n            reforms in the energy sector, while minimizing its social\n            costs. However, risks exist, particularly on the political\n            front associated with the social aspects related to the\n            impact of tariff increases, which may dissipate due to\n            sociopolitical pressures. Investor interest in the\n            privatization process are further risks to consider, as well\n            as the ambitious reform program, which will require a strong\n            institutional capacity for its implementation. Nonetheless,\n            it is considered that the benefits of the operation, far\n            outnumber the potential risks."}, "docdt": "2000-08-09T00:00:00Z"}
