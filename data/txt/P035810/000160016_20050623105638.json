As years passed and as the economy\n            improved, the need for reform assistance became less urgent\n            and the government tended to become lukewarm towards the\n            more difficult parts of the reform program. Towards the end\n            of 2004, four years after approval of the credit, it\n            appeared as though the government was not keen to draw down\n            the third tranche. This experience would appear to indicate\n            that adjustment loans are best limited to one or two\n            tranches and a period not exceeding 12 to 18 months. The\n            reform program was ambitious in relation to the envisaged\n            time frame and the implementation capacity of the government\n            agencies. Shifting political landscapes added to the\n            problem. Another lesson is the obvious merit of back loading\n            the disbursement. It is fair to conclude that a reasonable\n            amount of reform was achieved for the amount of money that\n            was disbursed under the first two tranches. The toughest\n            conditions were attached to the third tranche, which also\n            had the largest share of the total credit. The operation\n            also seems to highlight the need for proper sequencing of\n            reform. In countries with a high degree of nonpayment and\n            non-cash payments, sector unbundling actually exacerbates\n            the problem and creates intra industry arrears starving the\n            upstream activities of any cash. A measure of control over\n            nonpayment problem has to be achieved through such steps as\n            effective legislation against theft of power, dismissal of\n            erring employees, disciplined disconnection of supplies to\n            non-payers, prohibition of non-cash settlement of any kind,\n            institution of effective and speedy bankruptcy procedures\n            against large defaulting consumers, restructuring of the\n            arrears and rescheduling of debts and writing off\n            irrecoverable arrears, before undertaking sector unbundling."}, "docdt": "2005-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
