                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After significant implementation delays in the beginning of the life of the project, which led to its restructuring in 2008, progress has improved considerably. As of today, the
                         Government has disbursed a majority of the funds requested by each of the four pilot sites in community-based fisheries management (Batenty, Foundougne, Ngaparou and
                         Ouakam), and after more than two years of implementation of local management measures (e.g. closed seasons, use of larger nets, no-fishing zones, artificial reefs, etc.), the
                         communities are reporting larger catches and longer fishing seasons in some cases. To support these management measures, local and participative fisheries surveillance
                         operations have been organized and financed by the project, to contact the relevant authorities concerning any fishing activities in prohibited zones. The project is focusing now to
                         help these communities add more value to the fish they are catching, in order to capture more of the benefits of larger catches. In each case, for the targeted fisheries the project is
                         providing small grants to support increased value added to the fish products. At the same time, the project is providing support in the communities to diversify the economies, to
                         contribute to reduced fishing pressure on the resources to support their rehabilitation. These four pilots are meant to be replicable models, and the World Bank, via the Sustainable
                         Management of Fish Resources, is supporting the Government to introduce 8 more community-based fisheries in the central coastal region, in complement to similar efforts being
                         supported by other development partners.
