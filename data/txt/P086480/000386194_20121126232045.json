Some lessons learned includes: the\n            fundamental constraint of open access to the fisheries\n            resources may remain the key obstacle to the sector\n            achieving its potential. However, the project did\n            successfully pilot a model for local management of targeted\n            fisheries that can help address this constraint in the\n            coastal waters. In this model, the project supported\n            communities to establish private associations of fishers\n            that were legally recognized, and then these associations\n            developed regulations and plans for the management of\n            targeted fisheries. For this model to become truly\n            sustainable and fully address the fundamental constraint of\n            open access to the resources, the legal and institutional\n            framework will need to provide local users and associations\n            not just the authority to manage (i.e. regulate) targeted\n            fisheries, but also to limit access. Unless there is some\n            scope for control of access to these fishing grounds that\n            are locally managed, their success will also be their\n            downfall as improved fisheries and higher catch rates will\n            only attract more fishers from neighboring waters, so that\n            overall exploitation increase to the point that the stock\n            sizes and catch rates decrease to pre-project levels.\n            Greater community involvement in identifying issues and\n            solutions ensured greater ownership of initiatives,\n            enhancing prospects for sustainability of new approaches.\n            Formalizing the co-management proposals through legal\n            agreements between community associations and government\n            gave communities a voice and shared accountability with\n            decision-makers. The ecosystems approach requires a\n            long-term commitment over 10-15 years in a phased approach,\n            particularly as it relates to biodiversity conservation. In\n            the shorter term, modest gains are to be expected. The\n            establishment of biosphere reserves requires broad and\n            sustained consultation with stakeholders to engender a\n            common vision. This would have worked better if it was\n            managed by an entity associated with the biosphere reserves."}, "docdt": "2012-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
