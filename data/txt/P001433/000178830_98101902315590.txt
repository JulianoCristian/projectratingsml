LIBERIA - WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMIARY
Borrower:             Republic of Liberia
Beneficiary:          Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC)
Amount:               US$8 million
Terms:                Standard
Relending Terms:      The full amount of the credit would be relent to LWSC
for 20 years, including 5 years of grace at 7.5 percent.
Project               The project seeks to ensure a reliable supply of potable
Description:         water and increased access to service for the Monrovia
population, including low income households, and to
initiate a coordinated and systematic approach to the
provision of service outside Monrovia. To achieve these
objectives, the project would assist in improving and
expanding water production, treatment and distribution
facilities for the Monrovia area, undertaking a compre-
hensive nation-wide sector study and providing management
improvement and staff training programs. At least 50,000
new low income consumers in Monrovia would have access
to safe, potable water through the provision of public
standpipe service under the project. The project faces
no special risks, although the realization of the insti-
tutional objectives of the project will depend on such
factors as the ability of the consultants to train local
staff and the availability of suitable local personnel to
receive training.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
FOR A WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Liberia for the equivalent of US$8.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a water supply project. The
proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Liberia Water and Sewer Corpora-
tion (LWSC) for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7.5
percent per annum. The African Development Bank would provide parallel
financing for the project with a loan of US$2.9 million repayable over 16
years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at 8 percent per annum,
irncluding a statutory commission of 1 percent per annum. The Commonwealth
Development Corporation is considering a loan of US$2 million equivalent
repayable over 20 years including 5 years of grace with interest at about
8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic mission visited Liberia in March 1973.  Its report
"Liberia: Growth with Development - A Basic Economic Report" (No. 426a-LBR
dated March 1, 1975) was distributed to the Executive Directors. An economic
report on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Liberia" (No.
1642a-LBR) dated February 28, 1978 has also been distributed to the Executive
Directors.
Structural Characteristics
3.        The growth of Liberia's economy remains heavily dependent on the
performance of the enclave sector consisting mainly of: (a) iron ore mines,
(b) rubber plantations, and (c) forestry concessions. These enclaves are
the main source of export earnings. Iron ore mining is by far the largest
single activity in the enclave sector, accounting for about one third of
gross domestic product at factor cost. There are only limited linkages be-
tween the enclaves and the rest of the economy; as a result, the benefits
of economic growth have been unevenly distributed.
4.        Another dimension of structural imbalance is the disparity between
traditional agriculture and the (monetized) modern sector. Traditional agri-
culture has minimal inter-action with the rest of the economy; however, it
supports the majority of the population - as much as 60 percent - who live at
or near subsistence level. With a population of about 1.7 million, average



- 2 -
per capita GNP in 1977 was US$430. While the enclave sector yields a per
capita GDP of about US$2,500 compared to US$550 for the rest of the monetized
economy, the great majority of the population who live in the traditional non-
monetized sector have a per capita income of about US$100 per annum. To help
redress these imbalances the Government is trying to increase its earnings
from the concessions and use the resources to diversify the economy with
increased participation by Liberians.
Development Plan
5.        The Government has prepared a Four-Year Development Plan covering
the period July 1, 1976 to June 30, 1980. In preparing the Plan the Govern-
ment was assisted by a planning team financed jointly by the Bank, the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the Government (Reference: President's Memorandum to
the Executive Directors, No. R74-61 dated March 25, 1974). The Plan identi-
fies the basic, long-term objectives of Liberia's socio-economic development
as: (a) diversification of production; (b) dispersion of sustainable socio-
economic activities throughout the country; (c) greater involvement of
Liberians in development activities; and (d) equitable distribution of the
benefits of economic growth so as to ensure an acceptable standard of living
for the people throughout the country. The average annual growth of real GDP
during the Plan period was envisaged at around 6.8 percent. However, because
of delays in the implementation of expected investments in iron ore mining
and some slackening in demand for the country's main exports, a Bank economic
mission estimated that real growth during the four-year period is unlikely to
exceed 3-4 percent. Total development expenditure was projected at US$415
million, of which US$251 million would be financed from foreign sources and
US$164 million domestically. Firm commitments accounted at the start of the
Plan for almost 60 percent of the expected foreign financing. However, the
Plan is currently being revised to take account of developments during the
first two years. On the basis of preliminary analysis it is estimated that
the cost of the public investment program will increase substantially largely
to reflect increased costs but also the inclusion of additional projects.
Actual development expenditures over the first two years of the Plan are
estimated at about US$200 million. Given the financial, manpower and insti-
tutional constraints it is likely that the implementation of a number of the
projects, as revised, will be delayed beyond the Plan period.
6.        The Development Plan attaches highest priority to the development
of agriculture and basic infrastructure. The objective is to diversify and
modernize agricultural production, increase productivity, improve associated
rural economic activities such as marketing and processing, and provide
social and physical infrastructure to promote income distribution and improve
the quality of life in the rural as well as urban areas. The Government has
already embarked on two important agricultural development projects in the
Bong and Lofa counties which are being assisted by the Bank Group. Other
projects in forestry and rubber are just getting under way which will lead
to greater participation of Liberians in the development of the country's



- 3 -
principal agricultural resources. At the same time the Government plans to
expand water supply and electric power utilities in both the urban and rural
areas and to improve the road network, the inadequacy of which presently
constitutes a constraint to growth. However, the shortage of adequately
trained manpower at all levels is likely to prove a major constraint to the
Government's efforts to develop and diversify the economy. The Government is
keenly aware of this and has adopted a number of policy measures, supported
by the three Bank Group financed education projects, to tackle the problem.
However, by their very nature, these policies are likely to bear fruit only
in the long term; over the short and medium terms, the Government will have
to rely heavily on foreign technical assistance.
Recent Economic Developments
7.        During 1973-1975 Liberia, like most other developing countries, was
hit by higher import prices and international inflation. While strong world
demand for Liberia's major export, iron ore, brought large gains in export
prices in 1974, the 1975 recession in the industrialized countries signifi-
cantly reduced the demand for the country's most important export commodi-
ties -- iron ore, rubber and timber. With growth performance continuing to be
largely a function of enclave activities, growth of real GDP -- which averaged
about 6.3 percent a year in the 1967-1970 period has slowed down significantly
and is estimated to be about 1.0 percent in 1977.
8.        Liberia has had a long history of sound fiscal management and public
sector resources have not come under undue pressure during the past decade.
A satisfactory growth in government revenues averaging about 13.5 percent per
year between 1970-1975 enabled the Government to finance increasing expendi-
tures. Recurrent expenditures during this period grew by about 10 percent
while development expenditures increased nearly fourfold. However, public
sector finances have recently come under increased pressure which is likely
to continue over the medium term mainly because of an anticipated acceleration
in the rate of growth of government expenditures coupled with a more moderate
rate of growth in revenues. The rate of growth of government revenues is
likely to be moderate in view of the anticipated lower GDP growth rate as well
as the continued slack in world demand for iron ore. There may be scope for
an increased revenue effort on the part of Government as well as improvements
in the efficiency and pricing policies of the public corporations so as to
ease the pressure on central government finances. In this context, Government
has recently enacted a new Revenue and Finance Law and is also negotiating
with the iron ore companies regarding its share in profits and future dividend
distribution policies.
Balance of Payments
9.        During the 1964-1972 period, merchandise exports grew by 10 percent
and imports by 5.9 percent annually in current prices. Thereafter, from
1972-74, mostly reflecting accelerated international inflation, imports rose
by 29 percent annually, exceeding the 22 percent annual export growth. Oil
imports increased from US$12 million in 1972 to US$56 million in 1974. From
1975 to 1977 the decline in the quantity of exports has been partly offset by



-4-
favorable movement in the terms of trade but the trade surplus nevertheless
declined from US$111 million in 1974 to US$58 million in 1976, while the
current account deficit reflecting the substantial remittances of capital
and other factor income from enclave operations widened to about US$81 mil-
lion in 1975 and US$46 million in 1976 as compared with the surplus of US$55
million in 1973. The rising current account deficits have been financed
mostly by private capital transactions.
Creditworthiness
10.       Liberia's external public debt outstanding and disbursed was esti-
mated at about US$201 million as of December 1976. Debt service payments as
a proportion of exports of goods and non-factor services were estimated at
4.3 percent in 1976 as compared to 5.7 and 7.7 percent for 1974 and 1972
respectively. Debt service payments as a percentage of government revenues
have also declined from 24.3 percent in 1972 and 21.1 percent in 1974 to 13.4
percent in 1976. Based on the existing debt, both ratios are projected to
increase gradually in the next few years as export earnings are expected to
level off and the public revenues grow more moderately. The Bank Group share
of the public debt outstanding and disbursed is presently about 18 percent.
Liberia's debt service ratio through the 1980s is expected to remain rela-
tively modest (below 10 percent) unless there is an unexpected deterioration
in external conditions. In this context, it should be noted that Liberia's
exports are highly concentrated in a few commodities (mainly iron ore and
rubber) with unstable world market prices. Given the country's satisfactory
economic performance and its modest debt service ratio, Liberia should be
regarded as creditworthy for a significant amount of Bank lending, blended
with some assistance from IDA.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
11.       The Bank has made 17 loans (including one Third Window loan) for
projects in Liberia totalling US$108 million; there have been 7 IDA credits
totalling US$36 million and one technical assistance grant of US$200,000
for development planning. IFC has made two equity investments totalling
US$550,000 in the share capital of the Liberian Bank for Development and
Investment (LBDI). The Bank Group assistance has been for roads, agricul-
ture, rural development, power, education, DFC and ports. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of
September 30, 1978 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       The objectives of Bank Group operations are:  (a) to help Liberians
take greater initiatives in developing their own resources for the benefit
of their own people; (b) to support policies and programs leading to broader
sharing of the fruits of economic progress; (c) to help the Government in
broadening the economic base and in overcoming infrastructural constraints to
growth; and (d) to assist the Government in mobilizing development resources
from other external agencies. In furthering these objectives particular
attention is being paid to the need to expand the supply of trained manpower
so as to relieve this potential constraint to development.



13.       In line with the priorities established in the Government's Four-
Year Development Plan, the Bank plans to give increasing emphasis in its
lending program over the next few years to agricultural and rural develop-
ment. The Bank Group is co-financing with USAID two agricultural projects
currently under implementation in Bong and Lofa Counties.  These projects are
designed to assist a total of about 17,000 subsistence peasant farmers to
diversify their production base and to increase their productivity and income
through the provision of an integrated package of support services and infra-
structures. The rubber project, which is being implemented with Bank Group
and CDC financing, would lead to expanded exports, increased productivity and
incomes for small and medium size farmers, strengthen credit and extension
service and promote greater Liberian participation in the development of this
subsector. A forestry project, recently approved by the Executive Directors,
would strengthen the Government's forest service, initiate an industrial
plantation program and help Liberia to better manage and exploit its forestry
resources. Further Bank Group assistance to the sector being considered could
include a possible tree crop project, which would support the government's
economic diversification strategy, and a rural development project which would
finance increased agricultural production and social infrastructure in selected
low income rural areas and strengthen the local capability for planning and
implementation.
14.       In infrastructure, the proposed water supply project is designed
to help rehabilitate and expand the Monrovia water supply system, extend water
distribution to lower income groups in the metropolitan area, and strengthen
the management, staffing, and finances of the Liberia Water and Sewer Corpora-
tion. These improvements should enable LWSC to expand its activities through-
out the country. A fourth highway project, which includes improvement of
priority sectors of selected primary roads, and road maintenance, was approved
by the Executive Directors in June 1977. A feeder road project designed to
open up the agricultural hinterland of Liberia in support of the on-going and
proposed agricultural and rural development programs has been appraised and
will shortly be presented to the Executive Directors for consideration. In
the power sector, a fourth power project was approved in June 1978 which would
expand the Liberia Electricity Corporation's thermal power generating facil-
ities to meet demand until a new hydro-electric generating facility has been
constructed and made operational around 1985. The project also includes
management and training assistance to LEC and service connections to about
5,000 urban poor households in Monrovia. In the social sector, three educa-
tion projects have been financed by the Bank Group. The first two projects
aimed at improving secondary education, education planning and management, as
well as extending the educational system to rural areas through the provision
of secondary schools and 100 village community schools. The third project
emphasizes vocational and technical training. The Bank plans shortly to
undertake a study of the manpower needs of the economy and ways in which to
augment the supply of trained manpower, as the basis for a fourth education
project.

PART III - THE SECTOR
Sector Institutions and Background
15.       The establishment, operation and maintenance of water supply and
sewerage facilities in Liberia is formally the responsibility of the Liberia
Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC). However, due to the limited development
of the sector to date and the weak organization of LWSC, this responsibility
has not yet been fully exercised outside Monrovia. Responsibility for the
public supply of water was entrusted to the Public Utilities Authority (PUA)
until 1975. PUA was established in 1962 as an autonomous statutory corporation
and its responsibilities included electric power as well as water and sewer-
age. In 1973 PUA became a public holding corporation with subsidiaries for
water and sewerage, power, telecommunications and broadcasting. At that time,
the former Water and Sewer Division of PUA became the Liberia Water and-Sewer
Corporation (LWSC). In 1975 PUA was abolished and its four subsidiaries,
including LWSC, became independent public corporations. Due partly to the
limited capability of LWSC and partly to the lack of coordination among the
various government departments, several Ministries are involved at present in
the sector in an ad hoc fashion, constructing small water supply facilities
within their own areas of activities (Ministry of Health at clinics, Education
at schools, etc.). Private water supply services also exist in the concession
areas. However, the government has recently initiated interministerial
discussions for the proper coordination and allocation of responsibilities
within the sector.
16.       LWSC's policy-making body is a ten-member Board of Directors chaired
by the Minister of Planning and Economic Affairs.  The chief executive of the
corporation (which has a total staff of about 360) is the Managing Director.
LWSC plans, constructs, maintains and operates the water supply facilities
of Monrovia.  However, outside the capital it only operates, on behalf of the
government, two water supply systems in the county towns of Greenville and
Harper. The government is currently constructing three further county water
supply systems and three more are in advanced planning stages. The Federal
Republic of Germany (KfW) is providing assistance for these systems.
17.       LWSC faces acute management, staffing and financial problems.  The
shortage of qualified technical and adminisLraLive manpower in the country
necessitates the employment of expatriates for management level posts and
requires intensified local training for the sub-professional staff. To this
end, the proposed project includes a management improvement study, 11 man
years of management-level technical assistance, and the establishment of a
comprehensive training program.
Water Resources and Service Levels
18.       Liberia's climate is characterized by an intense rainy season from
May to November with precipitation reaching 140 inches per annum at the coast
and decreasing to 80 inches per annun inland. A number of major rivers



- 7 -
provide generally reliable discharge in all seasons. Although ground water
resources have not yet been adequately explored, Liberia's water resources
seem to be adequate in general and, in some areas, abundant. The first
systematic assessment of these water resources will be carried out under the
proposed project in conjunction with the proposed Liberia Water Supply Sector
Study.
19.       As of 1977, only some 20 percent of Liberia's population was served
by piped, safe water, most of them in urban areas. About 64 percent of
Monrovia's population, or about 160,000 people, had access to potable water
as of 1977. In Monrovia service is provided in principle by metered house
connections and public standpipes in low income areas. There were about 6,800
legal connections and 23 public standpipes in Monrovia in 1977. Illegal con-
nections are widespread and estimated to exceed the number of legal connec-
tions. Two of the main components of the proposed project are: (i) a program
to erect public standpipes in the high density low income housing areas to
provide immediate service to the urban poor and (ii) improvement of LWSC's
billing and collection procedures and progressive conversion of illegal into
legal connections.
20.       Data on rural water supply services are scant.  The Water Supply
Sector Study to be carried out under the proposed project will provide a
first inventory of existing services and will make recommendations for future
development policies and institutional arrangements.
Sewerage
21.       The only piped sewer system with conventional treatment facilities
in Liberia is in Monrovia; at present, it serves only about 10 percent of
the city's population. The rest relies on septic tanks and pit latrines.
The general standard of waste disposal is below the desirable level, particu-
larly in some of the densely inhabited low income areas. A comprehensive
review and possible further development of the waste disposal services of
Monrovia is envisaged in about 4-5 years time.  There is practically no
information available on sanitation standards in the rest of Liberia at
present. However, a brief review of the situation will be carried out under
the Water Supply Sector Study and recommendations will be made for further
studies.
Water Consumption, Tariffs and Social Measures
22.       Statistical records of past water consumption are inadequate and
unreliable. Available data indicate that the average domestic consumption
per capita in Monrovia is about 31 gallons per day (1977) with extremes of
7 gallons in the low income and up to 150 gallons in the high income areas.
Inefficient billing and collection and the widespread use of illegal con-
nections contribute to this high average. Per capita consumption is projected
to decline to about 22 gallons by 1980 as a result of a reduction in illegal
connections and other efficiency measures. At the same time, the number of
legal house connections and public standpipes and, therefore, the numlber of
consumers with access to potable water is expected to increase significantly.



- 8 -
23.       Current water tariffs produce an average price of US$1.98 per 1,000
US gallons sold, which is one of the highest in Western Africa. The basic
reason.for such high tariffs is that, in the past, tariff increase was the
only measure used by LWSC to deal with its financial problems; there was
little or no attempt to improve the poor billing and collection performance of
LWSC as well as its high operating expenses and system losses. The relatively
high tariffs together with a minimum domestic connection charge of US$35 have
contributed to the spread of illegal connections. Under the project, the lump
sum payment of the minimum connection charge would be abolished and henceforth
be recovered through tariffs and a tariff study would be carried out to
establish a tariff structure and level that will be consistent with social,
economic, and financial objectives.
24.       In the past, the government has paid for the consumption of water
at public standpipes as a measure to improve public health standards. This
policy will be continued despite the proposed substantial increase in the
number of standpipes from 23 to about 130 during the project period. The
extended standpipe service will provide safe water to about 55,000 additional
people, all in the poorest areas of Monrovia. The proposed tariff study would
make recommendations for a social block water tariff commensurate with the
ability of the low income group to pay. This measure, together with the
abolition of the minimum domestic connection charge is designed to encourage
new private connections as well as the conversion of illegal into legal con-
nections.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       Preliminary engineering design for the expansion of the production
and distribution facilities were prepared by consultants (Alvord, Burdick
and Howson (ABH) Consulting Engineers of USA) under financing by the African
Development Bank (ADB). During the project preparation these plans were
substantially modified mainly to defer major, premature expenditures. The
project was appraised in October 1977. Credit negotiations took place in
Washington June 5-8, 1978. The Liberian delegation was led by Mr. Byron Tarr,

Project Objectives
26.       This project will be the first Bank Group involvement in the water
sector in Liberia. The project is designed to assist the Government and LWSC
in expanding Monrovia's water production and distribution capacity, increasing
access to service for the urban poor, improving LWSC's managerial efficiency,
planning capacity and financial viability, providing a sector study as a basis
for a sector development plan and strategy, and providing effective training
opportunities and facilities for LWSC's Liberian staff.

Project Scope
27.       The project, which would be carried out over the period 1979-82,
consists of the following:
(i) the construction of a new raw water supply line from the
Mt. Coffee reservoir to the White Plains water treatment
plant;
(ii) construction of an 8 MCD extension to the White Plains
treatment plant and an additional 1.5 MG water storage
capacity as well as improvement of existing facilities;
(iii) expansion and improvement of Monrovia's transmission and
distribution networks;
(iv) provision of public standpipe service for some 50,000
additional consumers in the low income housing areas of
Monrovia;
(v) consulting services for the design and construction
supervision of the project components and for further
studies of the future development of water supply in
Monrovia and the rest of Liberia;
(vi) consulting services and technical assistance for the
improvement of LWSC's management and operating practices;
and
(vii) establishment of a training program to help fill LWSC's
current and future sub-professional manpower requirements.
Project Implementation
28.       The project would be implemented by LWSC with the aid of consultants.
Eleven man-years of technical assistance is provided under the project for
reinforcing LWSC's management and project implementation capacity. The tech-
nical assistance program would include the services of a Project Manager and
a Distribution Engineer who would be charged with direct responsibility for
the physical implementation of the project. The Project Manager would be
responsible, under the Managing Director of LWSC, for the day-to-day coordina-
tion and supervision of all activities related to project implementation. An
expatriate Project Manager and an acting Liberian Deputy Project Manager have
already been appointed. The Distribution Engineer would be responsible, inter
alia, for the execution of the standpipe expansion program.
29.       LWSC has an existing agreement with Alvord, Burdick and Howson (ABH)
Consulting Engineers for the design and supervision of construction of the
water treatment plant at White Plains, the Freeway trunk distribution main



- 10 -
and minor distribution pipe reinforcements. LWSC has agreed that the arrange-
ments for construction supervision will be made in consultation with IDA
(Section 2.09, Project Agreement) with a view to ensuring that IDA will be
able to exercise through LWSC an effective supervision over the quality of the
work undertaken by the consultants. The appointment of all other consultants
to be engaged for the various components of the project to be financed by IDA
would take place on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA and LWSC (Section
2.02, Project Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
30.       The total estimated cost of the project is US$16.1 million, net of
duties and taxes, of which about US$11.3 million, or 70 percent, would be
foreign cost. The cost estimates are based on mid-1977 price levels and
include physical contingencies ranging from 5 percent to 20 percent and price
contingencies ranging from 7 percent to 9 percent per annum depending on the
project component. Import duties and taxes which may be levied on goods
and services to be financed under the project are estimated at about US$0.8
million but government policy provides for full reimbursement for such
expenditures.
31.       The project would be financed by IDA, ADB, CDC and LWSC/Government.
The proposed IDA credit of US$8.0 million, amounting to about 50 percent of
total project costs, would finance foreign costs of the following project
components: Supply and civil works for: (a) extension and improvement of the
White Plains water treatment plant, (b) Freeway main, (c) Mamba Point booster
station, (d) distribution extensions, (e) standpipe service extension, and
(f) water meters; Engineering and consultant services for: (a) project super-
vision, (b) management improvement program, (c) Liberia sector study, (d)
Monrovia demand, distribution and tariff study, (e) technical assistance and
training; and (f) block mapping program. The credit would be relent to LWSC
by the Government for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at 7.5 percent
interest per annum. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by LWSC. ADB
financing will be on a parallel basis and will finance the following compo-
nents: (a) supply and civil works for the raw water pipeline, the distribu-
tion system for the OAU conference complex, and the discharge header at White
Plains; and (b) engineering and technical assistance for design of ADB com-
ponents. The ADB loan of US$2.9 million equivalent (18 percent of total
project cost) would finance US$2.2 million of foreign costs and US$0.7 million
of local costs, or 75 percent of the total cost of ADB-assisted components.
CDC is considering a loan equivalent to US$2 million which would finance local
costs of the civil works component   on a joint basis with IDA.  Together, the
financing provided by the three external donors would amount to 80 percent of
total project cost or 100 percent of foreign cost plus one-third of local
cost. The remaining financing requirements of US$3.2 million (US$1.1 million
in foreign costs and US$2.1 million in local costs), representing about 20
percent of total project cost, would be provided through LWSC's internal cash
generation (US$1.3 million) and the Government equity contribution (US$1.9
million).

Procurement
32.       Major procurement contracts for goods and construction services
valued at US$7.7 million and to be financed from the credit will be awarded
through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group
guidelines. LWSC has now standardized on one type of domestic water meter and
additional requirements to be provided under the project (estimated to cost
about US$60,000) are to be obtained from the same manufacturer. Small items,
such as small diameter pipes and construction materials, which are considered
unlikely to attract international bids will be procured on the basis of com-
petitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with local procurement
procedures satisfactory to IDA. Such items are estimated to cost US,$850,000
in the aggregate. Consulting services and technical assistance to be financed
under the credit will be procured in accordance with normal Bank Group proce-
dures. The average man-month cost of consultant services is estimated at
US$6,000.  Goods and services financed by ADB will be procured in accordance
with ADB's procedures.
Disbursement
33.       The IDA credit would be disbursed over 4 years (FY1979-82) against:
(a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures on plant, equip-
ment and materials or 90 percent of local expendi-
tures on items imported but procured locally up to a
combined total of US$5,082,000;
(b) 24 percent of the total costs of civil works up to
US$756,000;
(c) 100 percent of the foreign costs of consulting services,
technical assistance and training, up to US$984,000; and
(d) an unallocated amount of US$1,178,000.
The Beneficiary - LWSC
34.       The beneficiary of the credit, LWSC, was created in 1973 as a sub-
sidiary corporation of PUA. It became an independent corporation in 1975
following the abolition of PUA (Reference para. 15 above). The Act that
created it empowers LWSC, inter alia, to establish and maintain water supply
and sewerage facilities throughout Liberia, to set rates, fees and charges, to
borrow or raise funds, and to sue and be sued.
35.       The present management and staffing position and organizational
structure of LWSC needs substantial improvement and strengthening. The
corporation has a total staff of about 360, of whom 12 occupy managerial and
17 supervisory positions. LWSC is particularly short of qualified technical
and financial management staff. Accordingly, a management improvement program
is included under the project. This program is designed to undertake a com-
prehensive study of LWSC's organizational structure, its management, staffing



- 12 -
and training requirements and operational practices and to make recommenda-
tions for their improvement. The study would take into account the manpower
and other needs of present and future water supply schemes in Monrovia and
in the county towns for which LWSC will in future be responsible. The con-
sultants to undertake the study have already been selected with the approval
of IDA. LWSC has agreed to carry out the recommendations of the study as
soon as they have been agreed with the government and IDA (Section 2.09,
Project Agreement).
36.       In contrast to the shortages of qualified staff at management and
supervisory levels, LWSC is overstaffed below these levels. There are about
36 employees per 1,000 water and sewerage connections, which is high even for
a labor intensive operation such as that of LWSC. LWSC has agreed that there
would be no further staff increases without consultation with IDA until the
completion of the management improvement and manpower requirement study
(Section 2.10, Project Agreement).
Training
37.       The establishment of a comprehensive staff training program for LWSC
is an important component of the project. The program will be designed and
executed with the assistance of consultants, and will be based on a detailed
review of the qualifications of LWSC's staff and careful assessment of their
training needs. Not later than March 31, 1979, LWSC would establish a train-
ing administration unit (Section 2.11, Project Agreement). The activities of
this unit would be closely coordinated with the existing and future national
and private training programs available in the country so that duplication of
efforts may be avoided.
LWSC's Financial Position
38.       The financial position of LWSC is weak.  Its overall financial
performance during 1973-77 was poor despite a relatively high tariff level
following average tariff increases of 50 percent in 1975 and another 50
percent in 1976. The principal reasons for the Corporation's poor financial
performance are low billing and collection rates and high operating expenses
and system losses.
39.       During the period 1973-77, an average of 50 percent of all water
produced was billed, the remainder being unaccounted for. Given system losses
of 25 percent, the remaining 25 percent had not been billed due either to
illegal connections or to underbilling. As of the end of 1977, illegal con-
nections were estimated to be about 8,600, as compared with 6,820 legal con-
nections. While LWSC is adequately protected under the law against fraudulent
acts by consumers, it is necessary to ensure a strict enforcement of the law.
To this end, LWSC has agreed to adopt as soon as possible but not later than
June 30, 1979 appropriate by-laws acceptable to IDA which would specify
detailed regulations and operational procedures governing illegal connections
and defaults by consumers (Section 3.04, Project Agreement). Furthermore, in
order to obtain more accurate data on the number and location of the illegal
connections and to establish a framework for the necessary improvements in



- 13 -
billing and collection, LWSC would undertake a block mapping program and has
already selected consultants for this purpose. The consultants would be
financed from the proceeds of the proposed credit. It is estimated that
about 2,000 of the 6,820 legal connections are currently underbilled either
because the meters are defective or because the connections are not metered.
In such cases, the consumers are billed a flat rate or minimum charge which
appears too low. To overcome this problem, LWSC has agreed to have working
meters installed on all legal connections not later than June 30, 1979 and
abolish the present flat rate charge (Section 4.07, Project Agreement). Also,
to eliminate a possible incentive for illegal connections and to make house
connections more affordable for low-income families, LWSC has already abol-
ished, effective July 1, 1978, the minimum domestic connection charges which
will in future be recovered through the tariffs.
40.       At present, LWSC collects only 70 percent of the total amounts
billed to non-Government consumers for the Water Division and 80 percent for
the Sewer Division. These rates are expected to improve as a result of the
creation in LWSC of a separate Commercial Department, headed by an experienced
Commercial Director. This department would strictly enforce disconnection
and reconnection policies. Also, LWSC has agreed to establish two additional
collection centers by March 31, 1979 outside Monrovia at locations convenient
for consumers who live outside the city (Section 4.08, Project Agreement).
The government, which had in the past been frequently in arrears, has agreed
that it would henceforth settle its bills within two months of billing. The
government has also agreed that it would be responsible for payment for water
consumed from public standpipes and by public institutions (Section 3.02,
Credit Agreement).
41.       LWSC achieved a rate of return on historically valued average net
fixed water supply assets in operation of -2.3 percent in 1974, 0.5 percent
in 1975, 4.5 percent in 1976 and an estimated 1.4 percent in 1977. With the
recent 12 percent tariff increase effective July 1, 1978 and vigorous imple-
mentation of the improvement measures proposed under the project and assuming
tariff increases of 10 percent per annum in future years, LWSC is expected to
achieve satisfactory rates of return. The Government and LWSC have agreed
that tariffs would be adjusted as necessary to achieve a rate of return on
revalued average net fixed water supply assets in service in Monrovia of not
less than 4 percent in 1979, 5 percent in 1980 and 6 percent in 1981, 7
percent in 1982 and 8 percent in 1983 and thereafter (Section 3.01, Credit
Agreement, Section 4.04, Project Agreement).
42.       To promote the orderly development of the sector and to avoid unduly
expensive investments in terms of capital requirements and operating costs, it
was agreed that the Government and LWSC would obtain approval of IDA prior to
incurring during the project period the following investment expenditures:
(i) in excess of US$500,000 per annum in addition to the agreed investment
program for the Monrovia Water Division; (ii) in excess of US$425,000 per annum
for the Monrovia Sewer Division; and (iii) in excess of US$500,000 per annum
for water supply or sewerage systems outside Monrovia (Section 3.03, Credit
Agreement; Section 4.09, Project Agreement). Furthermore, LWSC has agreed



- 14 -
that it would not incur medium- or long-term debts for the Monrovia Water and
Sewer Divisions in addition to those needed in connection with the proposed
project, unless the maximum future debt service is covered at least 1.2 times
by consolidated net revenues before interest and depreciation (Section 4.05,
Project Agreement).
43.       In the past, revenues generated by the Sewer Division remained
low mainly because LWSC did not make enough effort to increase the number
of sewerage connections in Monrovia, although the existing legislation
demands that any water consumer living within 100 feet of a sewer main
connect to the system. Under this project, Government and LWSC have under-
taken to enforce the legislation and, as a result of increased metering of
water connections, revenues are expected to increase (sewerage charges are
calculated on the basis of 60 percent of the consumer's water bill). However,
due to the current under-utilization of the sewerage treatment plant capacity,
relatively small operating subsidies and equity contributions from the Gov-
ernment may be required for the Sewer Division. The total estimated amount
is about US$1 million during the project period. In addition, Government
would contribute about US$1.9 million in equity to the Water Division as
ecunterpart funds for the project. It is proposed that, as a condition of
credit effectiveness, the Government should deposit with LWSC the 1978 and
1979 equity and operating subsidy requirements estimated at US$2.0 million
(Section 5.01, Credit Agreement).
44.       There are at present two secondary water supply centers outside
Monrovia which are owned by Government and operated on Government's behalf
by LWSC. These centers operate at a loss for which LWSC is reimbursed by
Government. Six more water supply centers are under construction or planned
with the aid of the Federal Republic of Germany (KfW). LWSC is the operating
entity and part owner, with the Government, of the six KfW financed centers.
This dual ownership of the secondary centers is unsatisfactory. Accordingly,
the Government has agreed to (i) transfer its share of the assets and liabili-
ties of all secondary centers to LWSC by December 31, 1979, and (ii) continue
to provide operating subsidies until more satisfactory arrangements can be
agreed upon as a result of the tariff study referred to in paragraph 23 above
(Section 3.03, Credit Agreement). Upon taking over any water supply or
sewerage facilities outside Monrovia, LWSC would submit for IDA's review and
comments a detailed program covering, inter alia, a description of the work
program, valuation of the facilities, staffing needs and capital requirements
(Section 3.03, Credit Agreement; Section 4.10, Project Agreement).
Project Benefits and Risks
45.       Using the present tariff as a proxy for benefits, the estimated
economic rate of return on the incremental project investment plus the
estimated additional operating costs and investments required to distribute
water to final consumers over the life of the project facilities is about
9 percent. The additional benefits derived from reduced medical costs,
reduced absenteeism, and increased productivity are not quantifiable; hence,
the economic rate of return is necessarily under-estimated.



- 15 -
46.       One of the most important public health benefits is the expected
reduction of the incidence of cholera in the low income areas of Monrovia.
Most of these outbreaks have been traced to the use of shallow wells whose
use will be substantially reduced with the expansion of the public standpipe
program particularly in the poor areas.
47.       Specific physical benefits of the project include the increaLsed
capacity and improved reliability of the water production, transmission and
distribution facilities of the Monrovia water supply system. At least 50,000
additional urban poor consumers would have access to piped water for the
first time. The management and operations of LWSC would be expected to
improve significantly and the new training program would help ensure adequate
skilled Liberian manpower for the sector. Further technical studies would
prepare the ground for the rational and systematic development of the water
sector throughout Liberia.
48.       The risks pertaining to the physical implementation of the project
are no greater than can normally be expected with projects of this type;
all phases of the work would be supervised by consultants acceptable to IDA.
However, the non-physical aspects of the project (such as management improve-
ment, staff training and improvement of LWSC's financial viability) could
be affected by unforeseen difficulties regarding, for example, the ability
of the consultants to train local staff and the availability of suitable
local personnel to receive training.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Liberia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Asso-
ciation and the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation and the Recommendation
of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Association are being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors.
50.       In addition to the special features of the Credit and Project
Agreements which are referred to in the text and listed in Section III of
Annex III of this report, additional conditions of effectiveness include:
(a) signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Republic of Liberia
and LWSC (Section 5.02, Credit Agreement); and (b) payment by government to
LWSC of the estimated subsidy and equity contributions required for 1978 and
1979 (Section 5.01, Credit Agreement).
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 305-LBR        First Education Project:  US$7.2 Million Credit of
May 17, 1972; Effective Date: December 18, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
After initial delays in awarding civil works contracts, project
implementation has progressed satisfactorily, and most project facilities were
in operation by the start of the school year in March 1978. All technical
assistance posts have been filled and the fellowship component has been fullly
implemented. The education, manpower, and university planning components have
been completed satisfactorily. The project Closing Date has been extended
to December 31, 1979 to allow for full disbursement of technical assistance
funds and retention period for construction. There will be a small cost
overrun that will be met by Government. Project management has been good.
Loan No. 1266T-LBR        Second Education Project:  US$4.0 Million Third
Window Loan of June 7, 1976; Effective Date:
July 8, 1976; Closing Date: October 31, 1980
Project implementation is about 15 months behind schedule due to
shortages of construction materials and unusually long rainy season but the
pace of implementation is now increasing. Most of project's technical assist-
ance personnel are in post and candidates for fellowships have been nominated.
Equipment lists are being prepared and furniture and vehicles are being pur-
chased. Construction of 40 of the 100 community school units is underway and
26 units were ready for the start of the school year in March 1978. Extension
of the Zorzor Rural Teacher Training Institute should be completed about five
months behind schedule in June 1978. The project is expected to be completed
about a year after the original completion date but within appraisal cost
estimates.
Loan No. 1417-LBR         Third Education Project:  US$6.3 Million Loan of
May 26, 1977; Effective Date: July 13, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily about six months
behind schedule. The Division of Educational Facilities has been established
and is carrying out design work on project and non-project schools. Contracts
for civil works at the VTC, AITB, and science and technology centers will be
awarded shortly, about six months behind appraisal forecasts. The technical
assistance and fellowship program for the VTC and AITB is being revised to
take account of changed circumstances since appraisal concerning the avail-
ability of technical teachers and assistance provided by other donors.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 306-LBR        Agricultural Development and Technical Assistance
Project: US$1.2 million Credit of May 17, 1972;
Effective Date: December 8, 1972; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
Implementation of the project suffered during the early stages
due to financial, administrative and managerial problems but the situation
gradually improved and all project objectives, except for the Pilot Rubber
Scheme, were achieved. The replanted acreage under the Pilot Rubber Scheme
is about 35 percent below appraisal estimates but the Scheme will be incor-
porated into the Rubber Development Project. The rice research program has
made good progress and will be continued under the Bong County Agricultural
Development Project. The credit has now been closed.
Credit No. 577-LBR        Agricultural Development (Lofa) Project:  US$6
million Credit of August 1, 1975; Effective Date:
May 26, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
After an initial delay in project start-up due to staffing difficul-
ties, the project is progressing satisfactorily with a good expatriate and
Liberian management team. Farmer response to the project is good. Some 425
ha of swamp rice, 300 ha upland rice, 600 ha coffee and 200 ha cocoa will be
developed this year. Appraisal targets for swamp rice and coffee would be
exceeded but a shortfall of about 1,000 ha for cocoa is expected due to lack
of suitable soils. Feeder roads, training, schistosomiasis surveillance,
construction of buildings and wells are being carried out satisfactorily.
Slow disbursements to date resulted from delays in project start-up and are
expected to accelerate from FY79. While Government funding and support for
the project has been fully satisfactory, its policy of distributing free inputs
outside the project area is still to be clarified, since the continuation of
such a policy could jeopardize the project objectives.
Credit No. 700-LBR        Agricultural Development (Bong) Project:  US$7
million Credit of December 29, 1977; Effective Date:
March 15, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
Signing of the credit was delayed by several months due to staffing
problems. Most of key project positions have now been filled and the project
implementation has begun. Since field operations began mid-season, accom-
plishments in terms of crop development for this season will be nominal.
The project helped to establish a Bong County branch of the Agricultural and
Cooperative Development Bank (ACDB) which has been recently set up by the
Government as a permanent agricultural credit institution. Project manage-
ment as well as Government funding and support for the project are good.

Loan No. 1544-LBR         Rubber Development Project:  US$7 million Loan and
Credit No. 786-LBR        US$6 million Credit, both of April 21, 1978:
Effective: October 3, 1978; Closing Date: June 30,
1984
Project start up activities (e.g. staff training, nursery preparation,
acquisition of land, building plan) financed by the Government are making good
progress and the project implementation is expected to commence on schedule.
The project manager is in post and the financial controller has been appointed.
Credit No. 839-LBR       Forestry Project:  US$6 Million Credit of July 28,
1978; Not effective: Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The project includes strengthening the Forestry Development Authority,
establishing of a 1,600 ha industrial plantation and technical assistance,
studies and training. Good progress has been made in project startup activi-
ties financed partly under the Project Preparation Facility.
Loan No. 907-LBR          Second Highway Project:  US$3.0 Millisn Loan of
June 13, 1973; Effective Date: December 28, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978;
Credit No. 395-LBR        US$2.6 Million Credit of June 13, 1973; Effective
Date: December 28, 1973; Closin' Date: December 31,
1978
The design and reconstruction of the Monrovia By-Pass has been com-
pleted with a small cost overrun. The feasibility studies of the improvement
of three roads in the vicinity of Monrovia are now completed; on two of the
roads which are important links in the main highway network, reconstruction
has been demonstrated as amply justified and was included in the Fourth
Highway Project. Technical assistance in the Government's four-year main-
tenance program is already showing benefits in improved running surfaces on
earth and gravel roads and plans are now being made to consolidate the gains
and develop them still further by closer attention to the organization and
planning of road maintenance. A study to determine how best to improve the
efficiency of the local civil engineering construction industry has been
completed. The loan and credit were fully disbursed by September 1978.
Loan No. 1156-LBR         Third Highway Project:  US$27.5 Million Loan of
August 28, 1975; Effective Date: October 14, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The construction of a major bridge and of an urban main road (5.4
mi.) in Monrovia and of a rural main road (83 mi.) is almost complete and
there was a minor delay due to initial bad weather and difficulties in the
supply of materials. The feasibility studies about 85 miles of main roads and
an urban transport study in Monrovia are making good progress. A feeder road
construction unit became operational in January 1977 and is operating success-
fully in connection with the Lofa County Agricultural Development Project
(577-LBR). Technical assistance in building up Planning and Programming
Division of the Ministry of Public Works is proving fairly effective. A
discussion is currently underway with the government regarding utilization
of possible savings in the loan.

Loan No. 1573-LBR        Fourth Highway Project:  US$13.8 Million Loan
of June 2, 1978; Effective September 11, 1978;,
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The Project includes reconstruction and improvement of the
Paynesville-Totota and Paynesville-Robertsfield road, technical assistance
for road maintenance and pre-investment studies. Contractors for thes road
construction are being pre-qualified and the negotiation is under way for
extension of the road maintenance consulting services.
Loan No. 1055-LBR         Second Development Finance Company (LBDI) Project:
US$4 Million Loan of December 3, 1974; Effective Date:
January 3, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979; and
Loan No. 1323-LBR         Third Development Finance Company (LBDI) Project:
US$7 Million Loan of October 7, 1976; Effective Date:
December 17, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The Loan 1055-LBR helped LBDI meet its financial requirements through
calendar year 1976. LBDI's loan approvals during calendar 1976 surpiassed the
projected level for the year. Commitments and disbursements were similarly
above targets. Disbursement of Bank funds, in particular, had been faster
than projected. The loan is fully committed and 95 percent disbursed as of
May 31, 1978. The Loan 1323-LBR, signed October 7, 1976, together with loans
from the African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank are ex-
pected to cover LBDI's foreign resource gap for the period 1977 and 1979.
Loan No. 1150-LBR         Third Power Project:  US$1.8 Million Loan of
August 1, 1975; Effective Date: October 20, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project finances technical assistance for establishing a
long-range development plan and detailed investment program as well as for
strengthening the management of the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) and
training its staff. LEC's management continues to need external support and
the training program needs to be expanded to include practical training for
middle-level staff. The financial performance of the utility has deteriorated
and remedial measures are being taken to improve LEC's financial viability,
e.g. tariff increases, improved financial controls, in connection with the
Fourth Power Project. LEC recently engaged a foreign electric power utility
to provide a management support team to replace expatriates who have left at
the expiry of their contracts.
Loan No. 1600-LBR        Fourth Power Project:  US$10.0 Million Loan of
July 7, 1978; Not Effective; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982
The project consists of expansion of thermal generating facilities
by 26 MW to meet demand up to 1985, power distribution to urban poor, rural
transmission studies and technical assistance for management and training.
The loan is expected to become effective shortly.
