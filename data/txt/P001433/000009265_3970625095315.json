The Bank maintained a firm position\n            on scaling down the size of the project to meet\n            Monrovia's immediate needs while the institutional\n            structure was being enhanced to become capable of managing a\n            more extensive long-term expansion program. The Bank also\n            remained firm in insisting that all feasible alternatives be\n            evaluated in order to identify the best possible approach to\n            meet the project's objective. The physical components\n            of the project have been very successfully completed. The\n            management improvement/technical assistance component of the\n            project was useful in that it enhanced the Liberia Water and\n            Sewer Corporation (LWSC)'s ability to manage operations\n            and construction during critical periods of project\n            implementation, but unfortunately it did not produce the\n            significant long-term institutional improvements envisioned\n            at appraisal. Political and economic factors outside of\n            LWSC's and the Bank's control certainly were\n            responsible, at least in part, for the failure of this\n            component to fully meet its stated objectives. Even more\n            significant, LWSC's lack of support and enthusiasm for\n            this component was not overcome in the course of project\n            supervision and ultimately became a self-fulfilling prophecy."}, "docdt": "1985-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
