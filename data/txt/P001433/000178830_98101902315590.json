systematic approach to the\n            provision of service outside Monrovia. To achieve these\n            objectives, the project would assist in improving and\n            expanding water production, treatment and distribution\n            facilities for the Monrovia area, undertaking a\n            comprehensive nation-wide sector study and providing\n            management improvement and staff training programs. At least\n            50,000 new low income consumers in Monrovia would have\n            access to safe, potable water through the provision of\n            public standpipe service under the project."}, "docdt": "1978-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
