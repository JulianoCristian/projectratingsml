1.  THE  .... . 
General
1.01      Liberia, with a surface area of- son.-, 42,2500 square iiles, has a
population of about 1.6 million (1974 Censms",  TvenLty-nine percent of the
population lives in urban areas which stiJ-I conlli ue to attract migrants
resulting in urban growtlh rates of nearl-y  %  eonmu--red to the national
average annual growth rate of 3.3%.
Water Resources
1.02      Liberia's hot and humid               1_savanti, lina-e` is characterized by a
short dry season from December to Aoril, 1ollowed by an intense rainy season
from May to November.  Precipitatior  -T             averages a high 140 inches/
annum reducing to 80 inches/annui in .;   higher elevation
regions.  A number of major rivers, ruorini-r'g       frorn N/E to S/W to the
Atlantic Ocean, carry a generally relliwl'e d        gtg but the flat, swampy
coastal reaches of the rivers are  ub           --tou"..J-i.e saline water intrusion
during the dry season.  The extent an        i       y of ground water resources
have not yet been systematically estabi shed  ubitl, some coastal aquifers have
been tapped to a limited extend and furti.-icr  .rIana the somewhat random drill-
ing programs have produced limited sup             i sure aquifers of the
broken sedimentary and igneous rocks whi .  --v       st of the land below the
lateritic soils.  In general, whi.le T.£.bera- g .veiter re-sources have not been
properly assessed, they appear to bee a.Jequate (:in soor'e areas abundant).
Organization
1.03      Until 1973, the countrywidoe fespo.ns-iIilties of the water and sewer-
age sector legally rested with a divisioii o Li n e iiberian Public Utilities
Authority (PUA) which also encompassed        r--e sevors o,- electricity supply,
telecommunications and broadcasting.  In iau;.lary  !973, PUA was transforrmed
into a holding company of newly-creaed               A corporations for each of
the above sectors, among them tlhe Libe-ria >lvc-,Ler arid Sewer Corporation (LWSC),
each headed by a Board of Directors c          by -a cabinet minister (in LWSC's
case, the Minister for Planning ac                         PUA was dissolved by
Presidential Decree in September lr7., '' `2 ,ecame law in 1976 and the
four corporations became autonomous  g       irne  s-  erprises0
1.04      LWSC is empowered to establil7 a.-w,d oT)-erate water supply facilities
"within and everywhere inside Liberia,; Isc'c.    po:-.esent9 th'is is not fully
exercised outside Monrovia, the capita.  A -uitobor of government ministries
(Lands and Mines, Local Government, X-a-th and Ed.iucatlon) are now engaged, to
varying degrees, and on their own inilat-m           5 : ii-.he establishment of small-
scale urban and rural water supply serv`7 c       ho't any coordinated planning.
Only the Ministry of Local Government 1-   a sstole mandate and that is for
the provision of rural water supplies,             water supply services also
exist in all the large mining and pla-ntati  -        ssion) areas.  However,
the government has recently initiated into            riol discussions for the
proper coordination and allocation or                 Oho s: :--s within th-e sector,

Sector Development and Objectives
1.05      Outside Monrovia, for which some water supply development plans
have been prepared in the past and a comprehensive one will be prepared
under the project (para 2.03 B(iv)), no specific long-term sector development
plan appears to exist in Liberia, largely due to LWSC's inadequate capacity to
handle it and the lack of coordination with other government departments
involved in the sector. Since the government, in the past, has relied to a
large extent on external financing for water supply projects (paras. 1.18-
1.20), the timing of any new projects depended on the availability of such
funds, rather than on the need for the services or any planning timetable.
Thus investments in the past were piecemeal and uncoordinated. However, there
is a growing awareness in the government of the need to improve development
planning in the Sector and the Liberia Water Supply Sector Study, which is
to be carried out in 1978/79 under the project (para 2.03 B(iii)), is intended
to prepare the ground for a national, long-term water supply development plan
for the country together with the formation of the appropriate institutional
framework for executing it.
International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade
1.06      In March 1977, the United Nations Water Conference held in Mar del
Plata, Argentina, declared the period 1981-1990 the International Drinking
Water and Sanitation Decade. The Plan of Actioni adopted by the conference
provides guidelines for governments and international organizations for ac-
tion to be taken to achieve the provision of safe water supply and sanitation
facilities for all by the year 1990. The period 1978-80 has been specified
for the assessment of existing situations and preparation of national plans
and programs for achieving these goals. The World Health Organization's
(WHO) Thirtieth World Health Assembly resolved to collaborate with member
countries during this initial stage and one of the actions suggested is a
rapid assessment of ongoing programs and their possible expansion. WHO staff
and resources are made available to assist interested countries and the Bank
is associated with this effort through the IBRD/WHO Cooperative Program
(CP). In Liberia the proposed Water Supply Sector Study would form a good
base for the country's participation in the program of the Decade. It is
anticipated that in response to the UN's initiative the Liberian authorities
will attach a higher than hitherto practiced priority to the provision of safe
water supply to all of Liberia's population.
Urban Water Supplies
1.07      About 15% of Liberia's population has access to piped public water
supply and an additional 5% is served by private organizations (mines, plan-
tations, etc.). Almost all public water supplies are in urban areas and
Monrovia accounts for nearly 80% of these. In fact there are only two other
towns, Greenville and Harper, with public water supply facilities; these
were constructed by the Government of Liberia but are operated by LWSC on the
government's behalf. The government has also entered into agreement with KfW
for implementation of six other urban water supplies schemes, three of which
are under construction and three are in an advanced planning stage (see also
para. 1.20).



-3-
Rural Water Supplies
1.08      Very little information is available but it is known that a nuimher
of separate well drilling and hand pump installation programs are underway.
Various ministries, utilizing foreign aid (UNDP, UNICEF, etc.), are con-
structing wells at selected locations such as: Education at schools, Health
at clinics/hospitals and Local Government at administrative centers, police
stations, etc. The entire program is ad hoc and without any central coor-
dination or planning. The government is aware of the problem and internal
discussions have commenced between the responsible ministries to remedy the
situation. These, together with the "Liberia Water Supply Sector Study"
proposed under the project should ensure a realistic long-term approach to
the future development of this subsector (para. 1.05).
The Project Area
1.09      The project is located in Monrovia, the capital city, commercial
center and main port of Liberia. Existing developments of the city are
concentrated on the coast bordered inland by extensive swamps and, on the
north, by the St. Paul River. However, new housing and industrial develop-
ment are taking place beyond the swamps due to scarcity of coastal land. The
topography of the city is generally flat (20-50 feet above sea level), with
the exception of the rocky prominence of Mamba Point, which rises to 230 feet
in the center of Monrovia.
1.10      The first Monrovia water supply system constructed in 1953, was a
1.0 MCD well field on Bushrod Island followed, in 1960, by a 1.5 MGD project
at White Plains (the present waterworks site) consisting of an intake on the
St. Paul River, slow sand filters, a 16" diameter transmission main and
distribution. Both of these works are now abandoned except for the trans-
mission main which is being rehabilitated. The present water works were
constructed in 1969 (with USAID funds) and consist of the following: river
intake with low lift pumps, 8 MGD nominal (12 MGD hydraulic) capacity treat-
ment plan, high lift pumping station (all at White Plains - see map 1), a 36"
diameter prestressed concrete transmission main and trunk and secondary and
tertiary distribution mains. The system is operating on a continuous overload
and at peak demand conditions has reached its physical maximum of 12 MCD.
1.11      Production, since 1973, has suffered further limitations during
each dry season when the Mt. Coffee Dam (hydroelectric project which controls
the flow of the St. Paul River) restricted the river flows and saline water
intruded into the system (the White Plains intake is within the tidal reach).
To counteract this, for the past four years, LWSC has constructed a temporary
earth/rock fill barrage downstream from the intake which was then washed away
during the rainy season (this practice will have to continue until the alter-
native solution is constructed under the proposed project).
1.12      The distribution system is effectively without storage.  A 1.0 MG
service reservoir, located at Mamba Point, has been out of service for years
due to technical problems. It is now being rehabilitated. Another 0.6 MG



- 4 -
reservoir, at the same location, is reserved exclusively for the Ducor Hotel.
This situation requires that pressure be maintained in the entire system by
the White Plains high lift pumps. This results in grossly excEssive service
pressures at the "beginning" of the network (up to 120 Ib./in. ), while sys-
tem restrictions can reduce the pressures to nil in the peak demand areas at
the "end" of the network. Such operating conditions undoubtedly contribute
to the estimated 25% system losses in the poorly constructed and maintained
distribution network.
1.13      Customer service, in principle, is by metered house connection with
a limited number of public standpipes (mostly inoperative). As a substantial
proportion of the distribution piping is above ground due to the rocky terrain
of central Monrovia, access to the pipes is easy and illegally constructed
connections are widespread. Although statistical data on service levels and
standards is both inadequate and unreliable, the table below gives the esti-
mated situation in Monrovia in 1977.

The Ministry of Public Health, with the assistance of the World Health Organ-
ization, is monitoring the use of shallow wells and closes them when severe
contamination is confirmed. There is some evidence that the public is aware
of the danger of contamination and the wells are, reportedly, seldom used for
drinking purposes. Some resale of water from private connections does take
place but the practice is not widespread, probably because of the availability
of free water from the illegal connections.
Sewerage
1.14      The first and only public sewerage disposal system in Liberia was
commissioned in Monrovia in 1969 with USAID funding at a cost of $7.2 million.
The system consists of a collection network, trunk sewers and force mains of
a/   Population served plus unserved.
b/   Public piped water system only.



- 5 -
some 200,000 feet length with diameters ranging from 6" to 60" covering about
30% of the area of Monrovia.  Full conventional treatment is provided (set-
tling, trickling filtration and sludge digestion) with a nominal capacity of
6 MGD. At present, only some 60% of this capacity is utilized due to the
limited number of connections. This somewhat ill conceived, long, delivery
system with inadequate maintenance results in extensive infiltration during
the rainy season when the quantities reaching the treatment plant are more
than twice the dry season flows. The sophisticated nature of the plant
aggravates the operating and maintenance difficulties.
1.15      The record of connections is unreliable but known connections are
said to number about 2,100 and the collection is almost exclusively domestic
sewage and human waste. This would represent service to only about 20,000
people but, during the day, the heavy use of public buildings would increase
this number considerably; this appears to be confirmed by the hourly varia-
tions in flows treated at the Sinkor Treatment Plant. Houses not within-
reach of the system (which covers the coastal area of Monrovia only) rely
on septic tanks and pit latrines. For the immediate future, only moderate
expansion of the system is envisaged within the existing trunk sewer and
treatment plant capacities (para. 5.09). Any major extensions will clearly
require a review of the concepts of both collection and treatment with a view
to employing methods and technology better suited to the needs and the finan-
cial and operating capacities of Monrovia (aqua privies, oxidation ponds,
etc.).
1.16      Sanitation in Monrovia, in general, although well below the desired
level, is not considered critical.  Some of the worst slum areas require
immediate improvement and a number of these are being tackled under an ongoing
USAID housing and slum upgrading project. For the rest, it is a matter of
priorities, available funds and executing capacity in Liberia. The present
priority is water supply, but it is envisaged that a full-scale study and
expansion of the city's waste disposal system will be carried out in 4-5
years time.
1.17      At present there is no information available on the existing forms,
levels and standards of sewage/waste disposal services outside Monrovia. The
terms of reference for the Liberia Water Supply Sector Study (para. 2.03B(iii))
includes the requirement for a brief overview of the situation and for recom-
mendations for further, appropriate studies of this problem.
Sector Financing
1.18      Capital expenditures made for the Monrovia Water Supply system
(para. 1.10) prior to 1964 were financed by the Government and transferred
as equity to the Water Division of the Public Utilities Authority (para.
1.03). Capital expenditures for gross fixed assets in service during the
period 1964-1977 amounted to approximately US$13.0 million and were financed
as follows: external loans (68%), Government equity contributions (15%) and
PUA/LWSC net internal cash generation (17%). In 1964, USAID provided a $7
million loan for construction of the White Plains water treatment plant and
transmission and distribution mains. In 1973, the ADB granted a US$2.2



- 6 
million equivalenc loa.n, of wiich so far $1.8 million has been disbursed, for
improvements of the existing system and for the de..gri of further expansions.
1.19      The Monrovia Sewerage system was commissioned in 1969.  During the
period 1965-1977. capital expenditures of $8.5 million were financed by an
external loan (85%) and Government equity contributions (15%).  Contributions
to investments for the sewerage system from net internal cash generation have
been negligible, due to the poor financial performance of LWSC's Sewer Divi-
sion (para. 5.02). The external loan was provided in 1965 by USAID for an
amount of $7.2 million.
1.20      The two existing secondary centers (para. 1.07) were financed by
the Government for a total amount of about $2 million and went into service
in 1971 and 1972 respectively. The total cost of the six-cities project
(para. 1.07) is estimated to be $23 million equivalent, to be financed by KfW
through loans (para. 5.21) with interest rates of 2% and final maturites of
20 to 30 years.  The total amount presently cormmitted by KfW is DM 29 million
(US$12 million). Disbursements as of the end of 1977 were $2.1 million.
II. THE PROJECT
General
2.01      In 1973, under financing by the African Development Bank (ADB),
LWSC employed Alvord, Burdick and Howson (ABH) Consulting Engineers (USA), to
prepare the design for the long-term expansion of the Monrovia water supply
facilities. The review of the consultants' report (1975) revealed that the
proposals for major extensions were not supported by adequate preparatory
work and further studies would be required to justify and/or modify them in
order to come up with a technically sound and economically and financially
justifiable project. The timing constraints (para. 2.02(i) and (ii)) would
not permit a lengthy (1-1/2 - 2 years) postponement of the critical components
without creating severe supply difficulties in Monrovia. Therefore, during
the preparation-appraisal period, the project now proposed was prepared as a
short-term program (with the exception of the raw water pipeline) that would
ensure adequate water supply for Monrovia up to 1983 (paras. 2.03 A(i) to (v) -
see also paras. 5.09 to 5.11). At the same time, it will prepare the ground
for a follow-up project as part of a rational long-term development program
(paras. 2.03 B(iii) and (iv)). The limiting of large immediate investments
was further supported by the analyses of LWSC's financial and managerial
competence (para. 5.02), both of which clearly indicated a lack of executive
capacity and the need for substantial improvements and strengthening before
major expansion of the water supply facilities is undertaken. Project com-
ponents paras. 2.03 B(ii), (v) and (vi) are designed, inter alia, to achieve
this.
Objectives
2.02      The objectives of the project can he summarized as follows:



(i)  to fulfill the urgent need for a permanent solution (as
opposed to the annual construction of temporary barrages)
for the prevention of saline water intrusion into the raw
water supply (para. 1.11);
(ii)  to provide additional treatment capacity at White Plains
since the existing facilities are constantly operated well
above the nominal ratings (8 MCD) and, in fact, have fre-
quently reached their hydraulic maximum capacity of 12 MGD.
(iii) to improve the performance of the trunk distribution
system in critical areas such as the high elevation Mamba
Point and the Mesurado river crossings;
(iv)  to substantially improve the water supply services to the
urban poor of Monrovia who have limited or no access to
piped water (estimated at 70,000 people) either because of
financial constraints (high connection charges) or because
the service does not fully cover the densely populated
slum areas of the city where public health standards can
be dangerously low;
(v)  to improve and strengthen the technical, financial and
administrative capabilities of LWSC, not only to better
equip it to cater for the ever expanding needs of Monrovia,
but also to prepare it for meeting its obligations of pro-
viding water supply and sanitation services in the rest
of Liberia; and
(vi)  to prepare the ground through appropriate studies for a)
the systematic long-term development of Monrovia's water
supply, and b) the development of other urban and rural
water supplies for the whole of Liberia in line with the
targets of the United Nation's International Drinking
Water and Sanitation Decade (para. 1.06).
Description
2.03      The proposed project components are as follows:
A.   Construction Works
(i)  The construction of an approximately 15,000 ft. long 36"
diameter raw water pipeline from the intake of the Mt.
Coffee powerhouse to the White Plains water treatment
plant;
(ii)  The construction of an 8 MGD nominal capacity extension
to the White Plains treatment plant including sedimenta-
tion, filtration and chemical dosing facilities. An



- 8 -
additional 1.5 MG treated water storage capacity and a
new discharge header will also be provided. The exist-
ing (9 years old) facilities will be improved and addi-
tional electrical control and alarm facilities will be
installed;
(iii) The construction of about 27,000 ft. of 16" diameter trunk
distribution main (Freeway Main);
(iv)  The construction of a booster pumping station with a 0.25
MG wet well, centrifugal high lift pumps and associated
pipeworks to serve the Mamba Point high elevation service
area of Monrovia in isolation from the rest of the city's
network;
(v)  Reinforcement, minor extensions and improvements of
Monrovia's primary and secondary distribution system;
(vi)  A "crash program" installation of some 100 public stand-
pipes and associated distribution pipeworks in the high
density slum areas of the city;
(vii) Distribution system for the newly constructed OAU con-
ference complex;
(viii) supply of 3,000 water meters.
.   Engineering, Technical Assistance and Training
(i)  Engineering services for the design and supervision of
construction - 35 man-months;
(ii)  Consulting services for the execution of a Management
Improvement Program for LWSC - 8 man-months (para. 3.03);
(iii) Consulting services for carrying out a Water Supply
Sector Study for the whole of Liberia excluding Monrovia -
10 man-months (para. 1.05);
(iv)  Consulting services for the execution of a Water Demand
and Distribution Study for Greater Monrovia (para. 2.02(vi)
and a Tariff Study (para. 5.10) - 18 man-months;
(v)  Consulting services for the execution of a Block Mapping
Survey to provide a comprehensive set of records of con-
sumer location and service connections - 54 man-months
(para. 3.18);



- 9 -
(vi)  Management level technical assistance for LWSC of 10-11
man-years consisting of one Project Manager, one Water
Supply Operations Manager, one Distribution Engineer, one
Commercial Director and one Information Systems Manager
(paras. 2.10, 3.16 and 3.20); and
(vii)  consulting services for the design and implementation
of a training program for LWSC's subprofessional staff -
12 man months - (paras. 3.08 to 3.12).
Project Cost Estimates
2.04      The total estimated cost of the project is $16.1 million exclu-
sive of taxes (para. 2.07) with an off-shore component of $11.3 million
(70%). A detailed breakdown of these figures is given in Table 2-1. The cost
estimates for the supply of plant and equipment and civil engineering con-
struction were established by the consultant and/or LWSC on the basis of
preliminary and for some components final designs. Unit costs were obtained
from 1977 pro forma quotations from a number of manufacturers for plant and
equipment and from recent tenders for similar construction works currently
underway in Liberia. The cost estimates for works to be carried out by LWSC's
own forces were based on 1977 wages paid by and cost of materials incurred by
LWSC. The cost of the proposed studies was estimated on the basis of recent
consultancy contracts in Monrovia (Urban Study) and Bank experiences with
similar studies in Western Africa. The average man month cost was estimated
at US$6,000.
2.05      The Physical Contingency allowances were established for each con-
tract according to the anticipated difficulties and they range from 5% for a
straightforward "supply of pipes" contract to 20% for the construction of the
ttMamba Point Booster Station"t in central Monrovia (heavy traffic, restricted
site, underground services).
2.06      Price contingencies for plant and equipment were based on current
international escalation values. International figures were also used for
civil engineering construction cost escalation since local inflation is not
considered significant. Government assistance for the development of local
construction is evolving slowly, but first priorities appear to be for
housing and road construction. Possible Bank assistance in this field is
being contemplated as part of the proposed feeder road project to improve
the domestic construction industry. The annual price contingency allowances
used are shown below:

2.07      All cost estimates shown are net of an estimated $0.8 million iTl
taxes and duties, since the Governmenit will reimburse LWSC for the payment
of duties on plant, materials and services imported for its operations.
Project Financing and IDA Credit
2.08      An IDA credit of US$8.0 million is proposed which would be onlent
by the government to LWSC (para. 5.07). The project will be cofinanced by
the ADB (with a loan direct to LWSC) with parallel financing arrangements
(selected separate components), and by CDC (with a loan direct to LWSC) with
joint financing arrangements pending a final decision by CDC's Board. The ADB
contribution totals US$2.9 million made up of a new loan of US$2.4 million and
about US$0.5 million already committed or disbursed under a previous loan for
engineering services. The CDC loan would be for an amount of $2 million.
Application of the IDA Credit and ADB loan to the project elements is shown
in detail in Table 2-1.
2.09      The remaining financing requirements of about US$3.2 million will
be met by LWSC from internal cash generation (US$1.3 million) and by the
government through equity contributions of about US$1.9 million (para. 5.15).
Implementation
2.10      The project will be implemented by LWSC with the aid of consultants.
Since LWSC's in-house capacity is very weak, 11 man-years of technical assis-
tance would be provided under the project (para. 2.03 B(vi)). It was agreed
that some components (paras. 2.03 B(ii), B(vi), and B(vii)) would be inte-
grated into one package for the purpose of inviting proposals from qualified
consultants, although a Project Manager was recently appointed separately
(para. 2.11).   Paras. 2.03 B(iii) and B(v) were also combined into one pack-
age. The two appointments most directly related to the physical implementation
of the project would be:
(i)  Project Manager - responsible for the day-to-day coordi-
nation and supervision of all activities related to new
works carried out by the consultants and contractors.
His exact position in the organization of LWSC will be
determined by the Management Improvement Program; and
(ii) A Distribution Engineer - responsible, inter alia, for
the execution of the standpipe expansion program.

2.11      An expatriate Project Manager and an acting Liberian Deputy Project
Manager were recently appointed. It is expected that the latter would take
over the post in about two years time, thus ensuring the continued existence
of an effective project management unit within LWSC for further developments.
2.12      LWSC has an existing agreement with ABH (para. 2.01) for the design
and supervision of construction of the Water Treatment Plant (para. 2.03
A(ii)), the Freeway trunk distribution main (para. 2.03 A(iii)) and minor
distribution pipe reinforcements (para. 2.03 A(v)). This consultant's per-
formance to date has not been entirely satisfactory and LWSC has agreed that
the arrangements for construction supervision will be made in consultation
with IDA, with a view to ensuring that IDA will be able to exercise through
LWSC an effective control over the quality of works undertaken by the
consultants.
2.13      New consultants will be appointed on terms and conditions acceptable
to IDA and ADB as appropriate for the design and construction supervision of:
(i) the Mamba Point booster station and other distribution
reinforcements (paras. 2.03 A(iv) and A(v)); IDA and
(ii) the Raw Water Pipeline and the OAU conference center supply
network (paras. 2.03 A(i), A(vii)) ADB.
The standpipe expansion program (para. 2.03 A(vi)) will be designed and
supervised by LWSC's own forces. The various studies to be carried out under
the project, for which draft terms of reference have been prepared by the
Bank, will be executed by consultants under terms and conditions acceptable
to IDA.
2.14      The project implementation schedule shown on Chart No. 2-1 was
finalized during negotiations.
Procurement
2.15      Procurement of goods and services to be financed from the credit
under the major contracts will be by ICB and in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines.  Bidding documents for the major pipeline will provide for the
offer of alternative materials (steel, ductile iron, concrete).  Offers will
be invited for separate supply of pipes only and laying of pipes only bids
as well as combined supply and lay contracts.  For the water treatment plant
alternative offers will be invited on the basis of: (i) performance specifi-
cations, and (ii) detailed design by consultants. The total value of these
contracts is about US$7.7 million.
2.16      Contracts for small diameter domestic water meters costing $60,000
would be awarded on a negotiated basis. LWSC has standardized on one type of
domestic meter and has trained technicians for its maintenance and stockpiled
spares. This arrangement is satisfactory since the extra cost required to
train repair technicians, stockpiles spares and organize new maintenance pro-
cedures would outweigh any conceivable price advantage which might otherwise

be gained. For the installation work to be carried out by LWSC's own forces,
contracts valued at $850,000 for the small diameter pipes, valves and con-
structiori materials required for Part A(vi) of the Project would be let after
competitive bidding based on local advertising in accordance with local pro-
curement procedures acceptable to IDA. These installations and their procure-
ment would be spread over the project period and would be unlikely to be of
interest to foreign suppliers. Works financed by ADB will be procured under
ADB's current procurement regulations.
2.17      Consulting services will be contracted by LWSC following IDA pro-
cedures.
Disbursement of the Credit
2.18      The proceeds of the credit would be utilized to finance off-shore
costs of the components identified for IDA financing (see Table 2-1) and
would be disbursed as follows:

Disbursements will be fully documented except for work done by force account
under Category II which would be against a certified statement of expenditures,
the documentation of which would not be submitted but held by LWSC for review
by Bank supervision missions. An estimated schedule of disbursements is shown

Environmental and Public Health Aspects
2.19      The consultant's original proposal for the securing of a salinity-
free raw water source for the White Plains Treatment Works was the construc-
tion of a barrage on the St. Paul River. In the evaluation and ultimate
rejection of this proposal, environmental considerations played an important
part. The potential interference in the normal flows of the river, bank
erosion and the danger of flooding at high tides will be eliminated by the
alternative solution of constructing a raw water pipeline from the Mt. Coffee
reservoir to the treatment plant.
2.20      The consequences of increased waste water (sullage) production due
to the increased water consumption resulting from the project, particularly
in the areas not served by sewers, have been reviewed. Considering the rela-
tively good natural surface drainage situation of Monrovia, the heavy rain-
fall and the proximity and size of the receiving waters (Atlantic Ocean and
large inland marshes), no appreciable pollution or other environmental prob-
lems are envisaged in the near future. Certain high density slum areas where



- 16 -
the waste disposal standards are particularly low will be upgraded under an
ongoing USAID financed program. However, a detailed review of the sewerage
problems of the whole of Monrovia is envisaged in about 4-5 years time to be
followed by overall improvement of the waste disposal facilities (paras.
1.15-1.16).
2.21      Waterborne diseases are prevalent in Monrovia with several cases
of cholera repeatedly traced to contaminated shallow wells used in a number
of slum areas which, at present, are poorly served with piped water. The
standpipe service extension component of the project is designed to impact
directly on this problem. It is anticipated that with the provision of
alternative safe sources of water the public health authorities will be
able to effectively close the wells which are some of the principal sources
of waterborne diseases. Closing of some highly contaminated wells has
already been carried out but the authorities are reluctant to act where no
reasonable alternative source of water is available. Monitoring of public
health standards in Liberia by the WHO is reasonably efficient.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
General and Organization
3.01      The ultimate beneficiary of the credit would be the Liberia Water
and Sewer Corporation. LWSC was established on January 30, 1973, by the act
amending the Public Authorities Law of Liberia (see also para. 1.03). Under
the Act, LWSC is empowered, inter alia, to establish and maintain water supply
and sewerage facilities throughout Liberia, to set rates, fees and charges, to
borrow or raise money, and to sue and be sued. The Act requires LWSC to adopt
suitable by-laws but this has not yet been implemented. In view of the
importance of such by-laws for the improvement of LWSC's operational effi-
ciency and financial position, LWSC has agreed that adoption of by-laws
acceptable to IDA would be effected by June 30, 1979. Existing legislation
is adequate to protect LWSC against fraudulent acts by consumers and both the
Government and LWSC have agreed to vigorous enforcement of the law (paras.
3.21 and 3.23).
3.02      LWSC has a ten-member Board of Directors which determines policies
and directs the management of the corporation.  The Board should consist of a
chairman, three cabinet ministers, five persons from the private sector and
the managing director of LWSC, all appointed by the President of Liberia.
For the appointment of the Managing Director of LWSC, with whom the Corpo-
ration's operational responsibilities rest, the consent of the Senate is
required.  The present chairman of the Board of Directors is the Minister for
Planning and Economic Affairs. At present there are only two Board members
from the private sector (the other three positions are held by government
officials). The government has agreed to make appointments to LWSC's Board
of Directors consistent with the Public Authorities Law.



- 17 -
3.03      The current organization of LWSC is shown on Chart No. 3-1.  As
the chart indicates, all services/departments report directly to the Managing
Director, requirirng his detailed involvement in all matters, which is unde-
sirable and impractical. As a result departments work in isolation and coop-
eration is nonexistent. The Corporation, as it is today, is not geared to
meet the growing demands placed upon it by the rapidly expanding needs for
water supply and sewerage services of Monrovia and the rest of the country.
Weaknesses are evident in all departments of LWSC; these are further dis-
cussed in paragraphs 3.04, 3.16 and 3.31. LWSC's management is aware of
the problems and readily agreed to the implementation by consultants of a
Management Improvement Program (MIP) (Project Item 2.03 B(ii)). Terms of
reference for the consultants have been agreed between LWSC and IDA and
consultants acceptable to IDA have recently been selected (para. 2.10). The
MIP is designed to perform a comprehensive review of LWSC's organizational
structure, its management, staffing and training requirements, and its operat-
ing practices and to make recommendations for their improvement.  In order to
ensure successful implementation of these recommendations, the consultants
would be required to assist in the recruitment of suitable managerial staff
and to supervise the implementation for one year after the completion of
the study phase of the program. LWSC has agreed that the recommendations
of the study, as finally agreed by the Government and LWSC, will be duly
implemented.
Staffing
3.04      LWSC has a total staff of about 360, of whom 12 occupy managerial
and 17 supervisory positions. The Corporation is particularly short of
qualified technical and financial management staff, the reasons for which are
twofold:
(i) The organization structure is outdated and does not pro-
vide adequate posts for LWSC's current and future work-
load (see para. 3.02); and
(ii)  Liberia is generally short of qualified technical manpower
necessitating the employment of expatriate staff for the
top positions.
3.05      Because of these constraints and in order to ensure efficient imple-
mentation of the physical components of the project as well as to bring about
the desired improvement in the management of the Corporation, particularly in
the commercial and data processing areas, the Project would include 11 man-
years of management level Technical Assistance (Project Item 2.03B(vi)) to
LWSC (see also paras. 2.13 and 3.16). LWSC has agreed that, following com-
pletion of this program, it will continue to employ (and take over the
financing of) staff with qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA
in the key positions initially filled by the Technical Assistance personnel.
The Government has agreed to inform IDA in advance prior to making any pro-
posed appointment to the position of Managing Director of LWSC.

3.06      In contrast to the shortages of qualified staff at management and
supervisory levels, LWSC appears to be overstaffed in most of its operating
departments. A crude indication of this is the about 36 employees per 1000
water and sewer connections found in Monrovia, which is high even for a
labor intensive operation such as Monrovia. The overstaffing is worse in
some areas of LWSC than in others but this can be corrected by training and
redeployment (para. 3.10). Although new staff requirements will develop
during the execution of the project, new recruitment should be kept to a
minimum by better utilization and reassignment of existing staff. LWSC has
agreed that there will be no further staff increases without consultation with
IDA until the completion of the MIP and the training survey (paras. 3.03 and
3.10), which will jointly review the corporation's manpower requirements and
set appropriate targets.
3.07      At present, there are some 25 staff members assigned to the two
secondary centers (Harper and Greenville) operated by LWSC. Thirtcen others
are in training in Monrovia for three new secondary centers (para. 1.07)
scheduled to go into operation in 1979. The manpower requirement studies
will also take into account the future needs of further water supply schemes
planned for other urban centers.
Training
General
3.08      There is little understanding or awareness among the senior manage-
ment of LWSC of the corporation's training needs or of the means of meeting
these needs. There is no organized training within LWSC and this, together
with the almost total lack of technical education facilities in Liberia leaves
little alternative to the employment of expatriates for senior positions for
the time being. The limited overseas training received does not appear to
have been very successful. At the subprofessional level, the lack of training
opportunities prevents both the redeployment of staff and the advancement to
higher positions. Consequently, staff morale is generally low, which, with
inadequate and inefficient supervision, results in poor operating and main-
tenance practices (paras. 3.13 and 3.14).
Future Training Facilities
3.09      The most important current development in Liberia in technical edu-
cation and training is the establishment under the Third Bank Education Proj-
ect of the Monrovia Vocational Training Centre (MVTC) and the Agricultural
and Industrial Training Board (AITB), the latter being the technical arm of
the National Council for Vocational Training. AITB will be responsible for
the coordination of all occupational training activities in Liberia within
the framework of the national policy and for establishing uniform training
curricula and skill standards for the various trade categories. The basis of
the national scheme will be a system of apprenticeship training leading to
certified craft skills in each trade. While the potential long-term benefits
of this program to LWSC are readily apparent, in the short term, two specific
limitations exist, namely:



- 20 -
(i) Under its current schedule the Education Project will not
be able to provide assistance to LWSC before 1980; and
(ii)  The currently planned MVTC program will not provide for
the special training needs of the water sector.
There is, therefore, a clear need to develop within LWSC an effective train-
ing program for immediate general skill needs as well as for special water
sector related manpower requirements. However, it is equally clear that
any such program must be closely allied to the national training program if
duplication of efforts and wasting of resources are to be avoided.
The LWSC Training Program
3.10      The training program to be designed and implemented under the
project would consist of the following:
(i) a review of LWSC's revised organization chart (to be pre-
pared by consultants; see para. 2.03 B(ii)) in order to
determine staffing and training needs;
(ii)  a detailed review of the qualifications of LWSC's sub-
professional technical, administrative and financial staff
to determine the need and/or possibility of training each
to fulfill his present role or be upgraded;
(iii)  the production of a series of training modules designed to
develop the appropriate skills and knowledge required by
individual staff and the provision of all necessary training
aids and manuals;
(iv)  the arrangement of six-month intensive training programs
in an overseas water sector training organization to train
three selected Liberians as instructors within LWSC;
(v) the construction and equipping of a simple training/
demonstration and workshop facility at the Sinkor Sewage
Treatment Works capable of accommodating 12 trainees (at
a time);
(vi)  the upgrading of the trade skills of existing general
service technicians (automotive, electrician, etc.)
through a program of about 50 man-weeks of off-the-job
training;
(vii) the integration of the proposed KfW training assistance
for the operating staff of the new outstations with the
overall LWSC training program; and
(viii)  the subsequent planned integration of the LWSC training
program with the services to be provided by AITB and MVTC.



- 21 -
3.11      The above training program would be designed and executed by con-
sultants (para. 2.03 B(vii). The LAMCO JV Operating Company based in Buchanaan
would be able to provide the facilities for the 50 man-weeks off-the-job
training (item (vi)). The training consultant would, together with LWSC's
management (including the technical assistance personnel - para. 2.03 B(vi))
coordinate a) the organization of the training program, b) LWSC's manpower
requirements in accordance with the findings of the MIP, and c) the establish-
ment of a training administration unit within LWSC's Personnel Department.
The total cost of the training program - items (i) to (vi) inclusive - is
estimated at US$153,000 (including 10 contingencies) of which about US$83,000
would be foreign exchange to be financed under the proposed credit (project
cost item D5).
3.12      The Government and LWSC have agreed that:
(i)  LWSC will sign a contract with consultants to commence work
on the program not later than March 31, 1979. This condition
has almost been met since the consultants were recently
selected ; and
(ii)  LWSC will establish a training administration unit within
its personnel department not later than March 31, 1979.
The final structuring of this unit will be subject to the
recommendation of the MIP (para. 2.03 B(ii)).
Operations and Maintenance
3.13      Water Supply - The water treatment and pumping facilities at White
Plains, while reasonably well run since the employment (two years ago) of an
expatriate superintendent, suffer from past neglect and, to some extent, poor
design. Extensive rehabilitation and improvements are to be carried out under
the project (para. 2.03 A(ii).
3.14      On the transmission and distribution side the shortage of suitably
trained staff in the operation and maintenance unit create a generally unsatis-
factory situation. Pipes, valves and other appurtenances are ill maintained
and give rise to frequent breakdowns and substantial production losses. The
situation has not been made easier by the existing type of high pressure
delivery system which requires excessively high operating and maintenance
standards for a developing country like Liberia. Since practically no storage
is provided in the distribution system, service pressures have to be main-
tained by the White Plains high lift pumps. As the terminal point of the
network is the 233 ft. high Mamba Point reservoir (exclusively used by the
Ducor Hotel) the low elevation areas of the city are subject to service
pressures as high as 120 p.s.i. The most obvious disadvantages of this system
are (i) that power failures at the pumps result in instantaneous water supply
failures, and (ii) that the high service pressures undoubtably contribute to
higher than normal system losses and to wastage at the consumer taps. As part
of the project, the Mamba Point high level service area would be isolated from
the rest of the system, and a new booster pumping station would be constructed



- Z2 -
at an elevation of approximately 60 ft. (para. 2.03 A(iv)) to pump water to
the Ducor reservoir; these measures would permit lower pressures in the rest
of the city. For the longer term, the Monrovia Demand and Distribution Study
(para. 2.03 B(iv)) would examine the possibility of converting the distribu-
tion network to a zoned system with elevated storage and gravity supply in
each zone. This would substantially reduce operating pressures and pumping/
power requirements.
3.15      Sewerage - The principal sewerage operating problem is the serious
infiltration of storm water into the sewers during the rainy season.  Manhole
covers are missing or broken in several places and sections of trunk sewers
are exposed due to soil erosion and cracked (particularly on the sea coast)
clearly indicating lack of routine maintenance and supervision. During the
intense rains (maximum recorded 15 inches in 24 hours), the treatment plant
receives about twice the flow it receives during the dry season; this results
in unnecessary power consumption and maintenance requirements. The Management
Improvement Program (para. 2.03 B(ii)) will also examine the sewer maintenance
procedures and recommend appropriate improvements.
Commercial Operations
3.16      The Commercial Division is currently part of the Finance Department
which is headed by the Comptroller (para. 3.19). Because of his wide range
of responsibilities, the Comptroller has been unable to devote enough time
to supervision of the commercial operations. In view of the urgent need to
improve billing and other commercial services (paras. 3.21 - 3.30), and the
desirability of separating the responsibility for billing from that for col-
lection, LWSC has agreed that the Commercial Division would become a separate
Department headed by a Commercial Director who would be part of the management
team (paras. 2.03 B(vi) and 2.10) and report to the Managing Director. The
current Commercial Division Manager would assume the position of Deputy
Commercial Director and would become Commercial Director after three years.
The functions of the Commercial Department would be: (i) meter reading and
billing; (ii) processing of requests for service, disconnection and reconnec-
tion; (iii) installation and repair of meters; (iv) supervision of - and
assistance for - the Block Mapping Program (para. 3.18) and continuous up-
dating of the block maps after completion of the Program, (v) maintenance of
customer files; and (vi) tariff studies.
Block Mapping Program
3.17      LWSC's block mapping program started in 1975 but has so far achieved
no tangible results. The aim of the present program is to identify and map
each property served with water, whether legal or illegal; to install meters
where they are missing or defective and disconnect or legalize illegal connec-
tions; and to establish and maintain comprehensive customer records. To date,
however, not a single block has been fully covered, and customer files remain
incomplete or non-existent. At the present rate and with the available per-
sonnel, the program would probably never achieve its purpose.



- 23 -
3.18      In order to revitalize the block mapping program and to establish
the framework for the necessary improvements in billing and collection
(paras. 3.21 - 3.30), LWSC has recently selected consultants who would be
financed from the proceeds of the proposed credit (paras. 2.03 B(v) and 2.10).
These consultants would do the initial block mapping, including the field work
required to identify and record all water and sewerage connections and the
preparation of the maps and other basic records. Once established, these
records would be taken over and maintained up to date by the Commercial
Department. It is estimated that three consultants (a manager, a surveyor/
recorder, and a field crew supervisor) would be able to complete the work in
about 18 months, i.e., by April 1980. The consultants would be assisted by
LWSC staff. This on-the-job training would enable LWSC to carry out periodic
updating of the block maps with its own staff after the consultants have
completed their work.
Comptroller
3.19      LWSC's expatriate Comptroller resigned effective December 1, 1977,
and was replaced by a Liberian Comptroller in May, 1978. The performance of
the new Comptroller will be closely monitored during his first year of tenure.
Data Processing
3.20      LWSC's data processing is done under contract with the Liberia
Electricity Corporation (LEC). The downtime of LEC's computer has been high
(20%) and LWSC work has generally been given low priority. In addition to
these data processing problems, LWSC lacks an adequate management information
system. To improve the flow of information within the Corporation, LWSC needs
an Information Systems Manager for a period of up to two years, who would be
part of the management team (paras. 2.03 B(vi) and 2.10). In addition to
determining which computer bureau could best serve LWSC's needs, the functions
of this manager would be to: (i) determine - in cooperation with the depart-
ment heads - LWSC's information requirements. The primary focus would be on
financial/commercial activities; (ii) specify the kind of data and the form
in which they need to be presented, and supervise timely data collection;
(iii) liaise with the data processing bureau; and (v) follow up on the
utilization of the data. The Information Systems Manager would have a
Liberian assistant who would be expected to take over after two years.
Billing
3.21       During the period 1973-1977 an average of 50% of all water produced
was billed, the remainder being unaccounted for. Given system losses of up
to 25% (para. 4.07) another 25% has not been billed due either to illegal con-
nections or to underbilling. In the first instance, estimates put the number
of illegal connections at about 8,600 (para. 1.13) as of the end of 1977,
compared with 6,820 legal connections. The proposed block mapping program
(para. 3.18) would be expected to provide by April 1980, more accurate data
on the number of illegal connections. In the second instance, about 2,000 of
the 6,820 legal connections are currently billed only a $10 monthly flat rate
or a $4.20 minimum charge, either because they are not metered or because of



- 24 -
defective meters. The implicit monthly consumption rates corresponding to
these charges are 6,000 and 2,500 gallons respectively (para. 5.04). To the
extent that actual consumption may be higher, unaccounted-for water would be
reduced if working meters were installed. Metering would also be required for
distribution and tariff studies. LWSC has an adequate supply of meters on
hand for immediate use and another 3,000 meters will be financed under the
proposed project (para. 2.03 A(viii)). It also has sufficient staff to
install them and adequate meter testing and maintenance facilities. LWSC has
agreed to have working meters installed on all legal connections by June 30,
1979. Corollary measures would be to abolish the flat rate charge immediately
after this goal has been achieved and to bill on the basis of estimated con-
sumption when a meter is defective (para. 5.05). Furthermore, the Government
and LWSC have agreed to enforce all water connection rules, regulations and
by-laws.
3.22      To eliminate a suspected cause of illegal connections and to make
a house connection more affordable for lower income groups, LWSC abolished
effective June 1, 1978, the $35 minimum domestic connection charge plus the
cost of labor and materials required for connecting the properties (excluding
any works inside the properties) of consumers located within 100 feet of the
water pipes. This will henceforth be recovered through the water tariffs
(para. 5.10). On the assumption that LWSC will be successful in carrying out
the above measures, the number of water connections is forecast to increase
by 67% during the period 1978-82. Total unaccounted-for water would decrease
from 53% in 1977 to about 39% in 1982, which is realistic.
3.23    , Over the past five years, LWSC has made virtually no effort to
increase the number of sewerage connections in Monrovia and there are cur-
rently only 2,100 connections, i.e., about one-third the number of water
connections. It is estimated that with modest investments (para. 5.09) the
number of sewerage connections would increase by about 31% in the period
1978-82. However, in order for this increase to materialize, LWSC would have
to pursue much more vigorously the enforcement of existing regulations which
call for any water consumer living within 100 feet of a sewer main to connect
to the system. The Government and LWSC have agreed to enforce all sewerage
connection rules, regulations, and by-laws. To encourage people to connect,
LWSC recently abolished the minimum domestic connection charge of $19 plus
the cost of labor and material for consumers located within 100 feet of the
sewerage pipes (para. 3.22). This will henceforth be recovered through the
sewerage tariff (para. 5.10). Since sewerage charges are calculated on the
basis of 60% of the consumer's water bill, sewerage billing would also be
expected to increase as a result of the proposal to meter all water connec-
tions (para. 3.21).
3.24      As indicated in paras. 3.21-3.23, the reduction of unaccounted-for
water and increased billing for water and sewerage will depend to a large
extent on LWSC's ability to increase the number of legal connections to
its water supply and sewerage systems. LWSC has agreed to inform IDA on a
quarterly basis of the progress achieved in increasing the number of connec-
tions (see monitoring indicators, para. 5.19).



- 25 -
Collection
3.25      LWSC currently collects 70% of the total amounts billed to non-
Government consumers for the Water Division and 80% for the Sewer Divi-
sion.  The higher percentage for the Sewer Division is due to the relatively
greater weight of industrial/commercial consumers within the total. Although
computer problems have caused delays in billing and other data processing
requirements (para. 3.20), LWSC staff has neglected to utilize the available
information to detect unusual consumption patterns and to identify customers
with long overdue accounts. Closer staff supervision is needed in this area.
The creation of a separate Commercial Department (para. 3.16) is expected to
enable the Comptroller to devote more time to collections.
3.26      Disconnection policy has been recently enforced more vigorously
with regard to industrial/commercial consumers, but not for residential
consumers. Many residential consumers with unpaid bills of over six months
continue to receive service. In case of disconnection, no systematic check
is made to ensure that illegal reconnection has not occurred. Reconnections
are frequently made without collecting unpaid balances. Strict enforcement of
LWSC's policy on disconnection and reconnection would be one of the major
responsibilities of the Commercial Department.
3.27      Collections have also been hampered by the fact that until July
1977, customers could pay their bills only at one unfavorably located office.
LWSC's recent move to a central location and the added possibility for
customers to settle their bills at three commercial banks in central Monrovia
are steps in the right direction. LWSC has agreed to establish, by March 31,
1979, two additional collection points. These would serve areas such as
Bushrod Island and Sinkor, which are far away from the city center.
3.28      As of the end of 1976, the Government owed LWSC $1.3 million, i.e.,
the equivalent of more than one year of service. However, as of June 30,
1977, the Government had cleared all outstanding arrears and instituted a new
payments system. For FY78, the budget for each ministry includes specific
amounts which can only be used for paying water and sewerage bills. The
ministries are expected to settle their bills directly with LWSC. The Govern-
ment has agreed that it will: (a) pay its water and sewerage bills within
two months after billing, and (b) assume responsibility for the payment of the
water consumed at public standpipes.
3.29      Collection from public institutions such as the JFK Hospital, the
University of Liberia, and the True Whig Party building has proven to be
extremely difficult. The Government has agreed that it will henceforth be
responsible for the payment of water consumed by public institutions. The OAU
Conference Center, which is presently under construction, would be included in
this category.
3.30      On the basis of the above measures, collections for non-Government
customers are expected to increase from 70% of billing in 1977 to 85% in 1982
for the Water Division and from 80% to 88% for the Sewer Division. LWSC has
agreed to inform IDA of the actual amounts billed and collected on a quarterly
basis (see monitoring indicators, para. 5.19).



- 26 -
Accounting
3.31      The main deficiencies of LWSC's accounting system are:  (i) lack
of proper inventory accounting; and (ii) inconsistent allocation of overhead
charges between Divisions. Inventory accounting procedures are inadequate,
with some items being either allocated to fixed assets or expensed on an
arbitrary basis. The external auditor has made specific recommendations
for setting up proper inventory records and procedures, which LWSC is already
implementing. The proposed Management Improvement Program (para. 3.03) would
make, inter alia, recommendations on a system for allocation of overhead
charges between Divisions. The quality and number of staff in the accounting
department are adequate, but LWSC would be expected to provide training
(para. 3.11), and improve staff supervision. A fixed assets register, with
assets recorded at current values, was recently completed by LWSC in coopera-
tion with the external auditor and engineering consultants.
3.32      LWSC keeps separate accounts and prepares separate financial state-
ments for its Monrovia Water and Sewer Divisions. LWSC has agreed to continue
this policy and to create a third Division with separate accounts and finan-
cial statements for the secondary centers when they are transferred to LWSC
(para. 5.22).
Financial Planning and Control
3.33      Short-term financial planning is adequate but expenditure controls
are unsatisfactory. The external auditor has recommended that separate cost
centers be set up for each department. Budgeting and expenditure authoriza-
tion would then become the responsibility of department managers. The Comp-
troller would coordinate the budgeting process and review actual expenditures
against budget. LWSC is in the process of implementing the recommendations
of the external auditor on expenditure controls by cost center.
External Audit
3.34      The existing external auditing arrangements are satisfactory.
In addition to the examination of LWSC's financial statements, the auditor
(Coopers & Lybrand) carries out a thorough review of internal control pro-
cedures. LWSC has agreed that it will continue to employ external auditors
acceptable to IDA and that the auditor's report and related documents will
be submitted to IDA within four months after the close of the fiscal year.
Insurance
3.35      LWSC carries no insurance other than that for motor vehicles.
Therefore, LWSC has agreed to review its need for asset and liability
insurance with the Government and to present an acceptable plan to IDA by
March 31, 1979.

IV. WATER DEMAND FORECAST
Population Growth
4.01      During the intercensal period from 1962 to 1974, Monrovia's popula-
tion grew at an average rate of about 8% reaching 204,210 persons at the time
of the 1974 census. Much of this growth was attributable to internal and, to
a lesser extent, international migration caused by the rapid economic growth
in Monrovia during that period. Many of the migrants to Monrovia have been
single men or have brought young families with the result that 66% of the
population of Monrovia was estimated to be less than 25 years old in 1974.
The rate of natural increase is expected to be 3.0% per annum through 1990,
with a slight tendency to decline. Increased emphasis on rural development
is expected to reduce the relative attractiveness of Monrovia so that the
rate of Monrovia's population increase due to rural/urban migration will
diminish from the present 4.7% per year to 2.4% by 1990. The overall annual
growth rate for Monrovia is, therefore, expected to decline from 7.7% (1977)
to 5.0% by 1990.
4.02      The combination of natural increase, arrival of young migrants, and
shortage of serviced land has led to the rapid, unorganized development of
low quality housing resulting in high density slum areas in central Monrovia.
The population forecast shown in Table 4-1, which appears to be reasonable,
shows a population growth rate for central Monrovia at less than average
largely because there is little remaining land for single story housing in
the central area. The building of multi-story housing cannot occur without
significant improvements in urban planning and availability of financing.
The lack of financing is the main reason for the many incomplete structures
in central Monrovia which have been under construction for several years.
These problems are being addressed in the preparation for the first Bank
urban project in Monrovia, now scheduled for 1981, for which a pilot study
was completed in December 1977.
Water Demand Forecast
4.03      It is difficult to produce a reliable water demand forecast for
Monrovia because of the lack of basic data. Metering, billing and collec--
tions are deficient and there is a large percentage of unaccounted for water.
The principal causes for the latter are inadequate record keeping and the
widespread illegal connections.
4.04      The short-term water demand forecast shown in Table 4-2 is a Bank
estimate based on: (i) the population forecast given in Table 4-1, and (ii)
on a set of present domestic "per capita consumption" estimates. The latter
were extracted from available records of metered consumers and from investi-
gations carried out during project preparation. Industrial and commercial
consumption are forecast to grow at 6% per annum. For want of better planning
information, it was assumed that industrial/commercial growth in Monrovia will
parallel the growth of GDP. Government consumption is forecast to grow at 5%
on an historical basis.

4.05      The analysis of available records indicates that the domestic per
capita water consumption in Monrovia ranges from as high as 150 gpcd in the
highest income brackets to 7-10 gpcd in low income households. However, il-
legally connected consumers in the low income areas may consume an average
of 30 gpcd. The overall average domestic per capita consumption in 1977 is
estimated at 31 gallons per day. This is relatively high for even a tropical
city and it is expected to be lowered by the proposed waste prevention (para.
3.16) and tariff measures (para. 5.10) but, from a public health point of
view, it is encouraging to note that where water is available, its use for
personal hygiene, even in the poorest areas, is more extensive than in other
parts of Africa.  The forecast average per capita domestic consumption is
also shown in Table 4-2.
4.06      The long-term demand forecast used for the sizing of the raw water
pipeline (para. 2.03 A(i)) is based on the assumption that the average daily
demand will grow from the present 10.6 MGD by an average of 6.5% per year,
more or less in line with the declining population growth resulting in a
nominal average daily requirement of 45 MG in the year 2000.
4.07      Water losses in the transmission and distribution system together
with water used for filter washing are estimated to account for 25% of the
total production. The most recent (1974) leakage survey indicated that the
major pipes are reasonably watertight and that the majority of losses occur
in the small diameter distribution pipes and appurtenances. Parallel with
the system losses a high percentage of wastage occurs in Monrovia due to the
excessive service pressures (para. 3.14) and to the protective measures used
by consumers of temporarily storing water in anticipation of the frequent
breakdowns of service. While some of this wastage, in the case of metered
consumers, is paid and accounted for, in the case of the flat rate and il-
legal consumers there is obviously no motivation (by the tariff mechanism)
to reduce it. These factors also contribute to the apparently high per
capita consumption in Monrovia. The forecasting problem is further com-
plicated by the unreliable production figures due to the frequent malfunc-
tioning of the flow meters at the treatment plant.
4.08      The measures to be implemented under the project for the reduction
of wastage (pressure reduction, improved maintenance) and the revision of
tariff should result in the overall reduction during the life of the project
of per capita demand which will later begin to increase again as the standard
of living rises.
V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
General
5.01      In line with LWSC's currently acknowledged responsibilities (para.
1.04), this section first deals with LWSC's financial performance as it re-
lates to its Monrovia activities (paras. 5.02-5.19). Subsequently, it reviews
the status of the secondary centers and the timing and conditions for LWSC to
eventually assume complete financial responsibility for these centers (paras.
5.20-5.23).



- 31 -
Past Financial Performance
5.02      LWSC's overall financial performance during the period 1973-77 has
been poor despite substantial tariff increases in 1975 and 1976 (para. 5.04).
The principal reasons for this are low billing and collection rates (paras.
3.21-3.30). The consolidated rate of return on unrevalued average net fixed
assets in operation ranged from -1.6% in 1974 to 4.3% in 1976 and is estimated
to be about 0.6% for 1977. The principal financial indicators of the Monrovia
Water and Sewer Divisions are shown below:

/1   Unrevalued average net fixed assets in operation.  Asset revaluation
was recently completed (para. 3.31).
Consolidated operating expenditures exceeded operating revenues from 1973
through 1975. The operating ratio improved to 83% in 1976 as a result of
tariff increases, but it is expected to deteriorate again to 98% in 1977.
Debt as a percentage of long-term capitalization has been very unfavorable
at an average of about 80%, since existing assets have been financed mostly
through borrowings (paras. 1.18-1.19) and were not yet revalued, while the
poor earnings performance of LWSC has eroded equity. The current ratio has
remained satisfactory because LWSC has consistently kept its current liabil-
ities to a minimum; current assets, however, consist primarily of accounts
receivable. LWSC's estimated liquid position as of the end of 1977 stood at
less than one month of cash operating expenses, which is inadequate. Annual
debt service coverage has been adequate at an average of 1.7, because repay-
ment of debt principal did not start until 1975.

5.03      Overall sector financing is discussed in paras. 1.18-1.20.  During
the period 1973-77, investments for the Monrovia Water and Sewer Divisions
consisted primarily of replacements and renewals. Unrevalued gross fixed
assets increased by 10%, from $19.6 million to $21.5 million. Work in prog-
ress increased from virtually zero to $2.2 million, consisting principally of
the rehabilitation of a transmission main financed by the African Development
Bank (ADB). LWSC internal cash generation contributed about 36% of construc-
tion requirements, the ADB loan 42%, and Government equity contributions 22%.

1973 and 1977 are summarized below:

Present Tariffs
5.04      Water tariffs were increased on average by 50% in September 1975,
and another 50% in April 1976, and by 12% effective July 1, 1978.   Current
tariffs provide averqge gross revenue to LWSC of $1.98 per 1,000 gallons
sold, or $0.50 per m . The relatively high tariffs are necessitated primarily
by the poor billing and collection performance of LWSC, high system losses,
and also by the high operating expenses associated with a system that relies
almost exclusively on power instead of gravity (para. 3.14). Sewerage tariffs
are set at 60% of the amount of the water bill for customers connected to the
sewerage system. The tariff structure is shown below:



- 33 -
TARIFFS AS OF JULY 1, 1978
A.  Water - Unmetered: $10.00/month flat rate, equivalent to 6,000 gallons/month
Metered:         0 - 2,500 gallons/month:  $4.20 (minimum charge)
2,501 - 20,000 gallons/month: $1.68 per 1,000 gallons
20,001 gallons/month and over: $2.24 per 1,000 gallons
B. Sewerage: 60% of the amount of the water bill for customers connected to
the sewerage system.
5.05      In 1977, average revenues from water sold to residential consumers
was $1.50 per 1,000 gallons and from industrial/commercial consumers and the
Government $1.95 per 1,000 gallons. The average monthly bill for sewerage
service was about $10 per connection for residential consumers, $121 for in-
dustrial/commercial consumers and $355 for the Government. The minimum charge
and the flat rate for water apply to residential consumers only. Although
intended for unmetered connections, these rates have been used mostly for
connections with defective meters. As a corollary of the agreement to have
working meters installed on all legal connections by June 30, 1979 (para.
3.21), LWSC agreed that it will abolish the flat rate charge immediately after
all legal connections have been metered. In the interim, the Corporation
would be expected to bill on the basis of estimated consumption wherever
feasible.

5.06      LWSC's financing plan for the project period 1978-81 is shown in
Table 5.1. For that period the combined funds requirements of the Monrovia
Water and Sewer Divisions are estimated at $26.3 million. This total includes
an increase in working capital of $4.3 million, and capital expenditures of
$15.4 million for the proposed project and $6.6 million for improvements
and extensions of existing systems; the latter category includes about $2.4
million of an estimated $15 million which would be required for a second
phase of development of the water supply system contemplated tentatively for
the period 1981-85.
5.07      The proposed IDA credit and ADB loans would finance 50% and 18%
respectively of the estimated project cost which is net of taxes (para. 2.07),
and would cover 90% of the off-shore costs and 14% of the on-shore costs, the
latter to be financed by ADB. CDC (para. 2.08) is expected to finance an
additional $2 million in on-shore costs, bringing the total on-shore portion
financed by the two co-lenders to about 55%. It was agreed that the IDA
credit would be on-lent by the Government to LWSC at 7.5% interest for 20
years, including a 5 year grace period. Borrowing terms for ADB-1 (1973) are
7% for 15 years. The terms of the ADB-2 loan are 8% for 16 years, including
4 years of grace, and future borrowings (including the proposed CDC loan) are
assumed to have terms similar to those of the Bank.

Future Investments
5.08      Extensions of the Monrovia water supply system to outlying areas,
where separate systems might be feasible and more economical, should be
avoided because of the high operating costs involved in pumping water over
long distances. Such extensions have happened in the past and may be consid-
ered again. However, the Government and LWSC have agreed that no additional
investments will be undertaken by, or on behalf of, the Monrovia Water
Division during the project period in excess of an aggregate amount of
US$500,000 in any one year without prior approval of IDA.
5.09      The existing sewerage treatment plant capacity is, on average, only
60% utilized (para. 1.14). Annual investments of up to $425,000 are considered
necessary for system improvement, extensions and connections to the sewerage
collection system over the next four years. Expansion of the capacity of the
treatment plant is not expected to be required until after 1981. The Govern-
ment and LWSC have agreed that no investments beyond the above would be
undertaken by, or on behalf of, the Monrovia Sewer Division during the project
period without prior approval of IDA.
Future Tariffs
5.10      Although present tariffs are high (para. 5.04) and further increases
are needed (para. 5.11), it is conceivable that future tariffs could event-
ually be reduced in real terms following improvements in technical and admin-
istrative efficiencies (paras. 3.14 and 3.21-3.30). Before a real change
in tariff level is introduced, however, the long-run marginal cost of water
production and distribution should be accurately estimated to ensure that the
price for consumption in excess of basic needs gives an economically efficient
price signal. A tentative evaluation of the long-run marginal cost has been
made (para. 6.06), using available information and rough approximations, which
indicates that the new average 1978 tariff of $1.98/1000 gals would be slightly
lower than the estimated long-run marginal cost of $2.15/1000 gals. A more
accurate comparison cannot be made until a long-term development plan and
adequate consumption data become available. LWSC has agreed to carry out a
water and sewerage tariff study by March 31, 1980 under terms of reference
acceptable to IDA. The findings of this study and their proposed implementa-
tion will be submitted to IDA for review by June 30, 1980. The Government has
agreed that it will assist LWSC in the implementation of the results of the
tariff study. The tariff study would specifically be expected to make recom-
mendations on the introduction of a "social block" in the water tariff and on
an appropriate tariff structure for the secondary centers (para. 5.21), as
well as a sewerage tariff structure which would eventually obviate the need
for continued operating subsidies to the Sewer Division (para. 5.13). In
the interim, the standpipe program and the recovery of the minimum water and
sewerage connection charges through tariffs (paras. 3.22-3.23) would reduce
the burden of water and sewerage charges on low income consumers.
5.11      On the basis of the present forecasts, LWSC's tariffs would need to
be adjusted annually at the estimated rate of inflation to meet the required
rate of return (para. 5.16), thus keeping tariffs constant in real terms.



- 36 -
Tariffs were increased by 12% effective July 1, 1978, and are forecast t:o
increase by 10% each year thereafter. The Government has agreed to make a
contribution to LWSC's operations for revenue foregone due to tbe delay in the
introduction of the 1978 tariff increase. The amount involved is estimated
to be about $300,000 (para. 5.15). Should tariffs increase as forecast, the
average revenue to LWSC per 1,000 gallons would increase from $1L98 in 1978 to
$2.90 in 1982. A principal consideration for keeping tariff increases to a
minimum is the consumer's capacity to pay, 70% of household heads in Monrovia
having monthly incomes of less than $100. It is probable that illegal connec-
tions occur most frequently among this income group. Conversion from illegal
to legal connections is not likely to materialize if tariffs increase too
rapidly. Moderate tariff increases would also minimize the impact on con-
sumption, and thus help realize the financial benefits expected from tariff
increases. It would furthermore avoid penalizing those consumers who do pay
their bills.
Government Contributions
(i) Sewer Division
5.12      Government subsidies to cover operating losses of the Sewer Divi-
sion are expected to be required over the next few years. The financial
performance of the Sewer Division cannot be greatly improved in the short
run. Existing assets are underutilized (para. 1.14), partly because regula-
tions of mandatory connection for certain categories of water consumers have
not been enforced. A higher utilization rate is expected as a result of the
measures proposed in para. 3.23. However, for the Sewer Division to break
even starting in 1978 the already high tariffs (para. 5.04) would have to be
raised to yield an average 33% increase in revenue per connection. Such a
measure would undoubtedly deter potential customers, while existing customers
might be unable to pay their bills. Tariffs are, therefore, forecast to
increase at the same annual rate as the water tariffs (para. 5.11), subject
to review as a result of the proposed tariff study (para. 5,10).
5.13      To improve the financial position of the Sewer Division, the Govern-
ment has agreed that it will provide subsidies to LWSC to cover the annual
operating deficits of the Sewer Division, pending implementation of the
results of the tariff study (para. 5.10). Included in the calculation of
these operating deficits would be operating and maintenance expenses, depre-
ciation and interest expense. Subsidies are reasonable considering that an
adequate sewerage system provides health benefits for the public in general,
and particularly for the lower income groups, by eliminating sewage discharge
and septic tank overflow from surface areas where they would create potential
hazard of disease and breading ground for mosquitoes. Similarly, benefits
would result from limiting river pollution through the provision of sewage
treatment. The provision of operating subsidies is also a requirement
of the 1965 USAID loan to the sewerage sector (para. 1.19) which, however,
has never been met. In addition, the Government has agreed that it will make
during 1978 an equity contribution of $226,000 to LWSC in order to provide the
Sewer Division with adequate working capital, and that it will provide such
further equity contributions as may be required from time to time for the
implementation of the Sewer Division's investment program up to the agreed
limit (para. 5.09).



- 37 -
(ii) Water Division
5.14      Projected revenues will not be sufficient to generate all counter-
part funds needed for the investment program of the Water Division. Short-
falls totalling about $1.6 million would occur in 1979 and 1980 (para. 5.15).
The Government has agreed that it will provide equity contributions to LWSC
as necessary during the period 1978-82 to cover the counterpart fund require-
ments for the investment program of the Water Division.
(iii) Overall
5.15      The estimated total amount of subsidies and equity contributions
required for the Water and Sewer Divisions should be determined by LWSC and
the Government before July 1 of each year, and provided for in the Govern-
ment's budget. The Government has agreed that the required amounts, based
on quarterly financial forecasts prepared by LWSC, will be deposited on a
quarterly basis and in advance in LWSC's bank account to ensure their timely
availability. The equity contributions and operating subsidies for 1978 and
1979 would be made as a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit
(para. 7.02). A summary of total estimated Government contributions required
during the project period is shown below:

Financial Covenants
5.16      On the basis of the present forecasts, the rates of return on
revalued average net fixed water supply assets in service in Monrovia are
expected to increase from an estimated 4.3% in 1979 to about 7.5% in 1982.
LWSC has agreed that it will adjust tariffs as necessary to achieve a rate
of return on revalued average net fixed water supply assets in service in
Monrovia of at least 4% in 1979, 5% in 1980, 6% in 1981, 7% in 1982, and 8% in
1983 and thereafter. Fixed assets will be revalued annually starting in 1978,
using appropriate price indices for plant and equipment as reported in the US
"Engineering News Record" or such other index as may be agreed upon between
IDA and LWSC (para. 3.31).
a/   For revenue foregone due to delayed implementation of the 1978 tariff
increase (para. 5.11).
b/   The 1982 equity contribution would be for a tentatively planned
expansion of the sewerage treatment plant.



- 38 -
5.17      To protect LWSC's financial position, the Corporation has agreed
that it will not incur medium- or long-term debts for the Monrovia Water and
Sewer Divisions in addition to those needed in connection with the proposed
project, unless the maximum future consolidated debt service is covered at
least 1.2 times by consolidated net revenues before interest and depreciation.
Government subsidies covering the operating deficits of the Sewer Division
would not be taken into consideration in the application of this covenant.
Future Financial Performance
5.18      Financial statements for the period 1973-83 are shown in Annexes
II-VII. The consolidated financial performance of LWSC in Monrovia would
improve steadily during the period 1978-1982. As shown in the table below,
between 1978 and 1982 the rates of return would improve from -0.1% to 5.9%,
the operating ratio from 97% to 76%, debt as a percent of long-term capital-
ization from 57% to 49%, the current ratio from 5.3 to 11.9, and the annual
debt service coverage ratio from 1.2 to 2.4. LWSC would provide from net
internal cash generation 33% of total funds requirements during the period
1978-82 (Table 5.1). The underlying improvements in billing and collection
are discussed in paras 3.21-3.30.

Monitoring Indicators
5.19      A number of financial and technical indicators are considered espe-
cially important for measuring LWSC's operating performance. LWSC has agreed
that it will submit until project completion quarterly reports on the monitor-
ing indicators listed in Annex I, and take such appropriate remedial action as
IDA might reasonably request. Until five years after project completion, the
Corporation would submit annual reports on the monitoring indicators.
Urban Water Supply Systems Outside Monrovia (Secondary Centers)
5.20      The water supply systems in the existing two secondary centers are
owned by the Government and operated by LWSC (para. 1.07). As of December 31,
1977, the assets of these centers had a combined net book value of about $1.6
million. These centers have been operating at a loss. The Government refunds
to LWSC actual cash operating losses, which are projected to average $75,000!
annum (excluding depreciation) for the period 1978-82. At present there are
no sewerage systems outside Monrovia.
5.21      Water supply systems in six additional secondary centers are under
construction or in the planning stage, with financing to be provided by
Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) (para. 1.20). The first three centers
are scheduled to go into service in 1979 and the other three by 1980 or 1981.
The Government has agreed with KfW to cover the operating deficits of these
systems, including depreciation and interest expense, plus the repayment of
the KfW loans. Based on current estimates and unless other arrangements
are made, the Government would have to make the following payments during
the project period:
(US$ 000)
1978       1979        1980        1981        1982
Operating Deficits           146        391         664         869        1016
Debt Service                 124        274         388         458         483
Total                  270         665        1052        1327       1499
The Government would find it increasingly difficult to assume the financial
burden of these secondary centers and, therefore, the terms of reference for
the tariff study (para. 5.10) include specific provisions for review and
recommendation of an appropriate cost recovery mechanism for all secondary
centers.
5.22      The current ownership status of secondary centers is unsatisfactory.
While the Government owns the two existing secondary centers, the situation
is not so clear for the next six centers, where in effect the Government is
the Borrower of a first KfW DM 8 million loan and LWSC the Borrower of a
second KfW DM 21 million loan. Therefore, the Government has agreed to: (i)
transfer its share of the assets and liabilities of all secondary centers to



- 40 -
LWSC by December 31, 1979, and (ii) cover all operating deficits (including
depreciation and interest payments) plus any cash shortfall resulting from the
repayment of the principal on the debt of the secondary centers as long as
other satisfactory arrangements have not been agreed upon (para. 5.21). The
assets of the two existing secondary centers would be transferred as equity
since they are debt-free, while the assets of the other six centers would be
transferred along with the debt. The Government has agreed to make payments
for the operating deficits in advance and on a quarterly basis.
5.23      The Government and LWSC have agreed that no additional investments
in excess of an aggregate amount of $500,000 in any one year during the
project period would be undertaken for water supply or sewerage systems out-
side Monrovia without prior approval of IDA. Furthermore, LWSC has agreed
that it will prepare, upon taking over any water supply or sewerage facilities
outside Monrovia, a detailed program covering, inter alia, a description of
the work program, valuation of the facilities, staffing needs, capital require-
ments, and the sources, terms and conditions of borrowings if any, and submit
the said program to IDA for review and comments.
VI. JUSTIFICATION
General
6.01      The project will provide a much needed overall improvement in
Monrovia's water supply services, both on the production and distribution
side. Improved or entirely new access will be provided for a large number
of the poorest of Monrovia's population. Further studies and institutional
improvement programs will prepare the ground for future water supply proj-
ects, both in Monrovia and elsewhere in Liberia, and for more efficient
operations.
Least Cost Solution
6.02      Because of the uncertainty associated with both the short- and long-
term water demand forecasts (para. 4.03) the strategy used in the feasibility
studies of the raw water supply and treatment plant extension has been to
favor solutions which offer the greatest flexibility and minimum risk should
the demand growth be significantly different from the forecast.
6.03      Sufficient gravity head is available to render uneconomical any
pressure main or pressure/gravity combination for raw water supply when
compared with a simple gravity main. The staging of the raw water pipeline
in two phases by constructing a 36-inch gravity main now with duplication in
about 1989 has about a 15% lower present value of capital plus operating costs
using 10% as the opportunity cost of capital discount factor, when compared
with a single 48-inch gravity main. Both alternatives would satisfy the
expected needs of 45 MGD in the year 2000. The choice of the 36-inch main
remains optimal for all likely variations in growth rate of demand.



- AL -
6.04      The alternatives of a permanent barrage across the St. Paul River
or a raw water storage reservoir at the White Plains treatment plant are
both technically and environmentally inferior solutions (para. 2.09) as
well as having a higher present value of capital plus operating costs dis-
counted at 10% when compared with a gravity pipeline from Mt. Coffee to White
Plains.
6.05      The proposed 8 MGD extension to the treatment capacity has been
sized to meet the demand until 1984. The penalty for oversizing the treat-
ment plant would be greater than for undersizing given the uncertainty of
the long term demand forecast, the high unit capital cost ($702,000/MGD) of
increasing treatment capacity, and the relatively low mobilization cost for
constructing future extensions. Should the demand be greater than forecast,
a small additional investment in equipment could increase the capacity by
about 50% above the nominal 8 MGD capacity as a temporary measure. It is
unlikely that the demand growth would be significantly lower than forecast
during the period up to 1984. By that time, a much clearer picture of
demand requirements is expected to be available.
Adequacy of Tariff
6.06      Precise data regarding the long run marginal cost of producing and
distributing water will not be available until the completion of the Monrovia
Demand and Distribution study (para. 3.16). Nonetheless, a tentative analysis
of the average incremental costs (taken as a proxy for long run marginal
costs) of expanding each system component has been made to test the adequacy
of the tariff in giving an economically efficient price signal to consumers
and to indicate the approximate rate of return based on the present tariff.
The average incremental costs are derived from information of varying quality
using a 10% discount rate as the opportunity cost of capital and are shown
below.

1/   Determination of the actual costs of water supply distribution in
Monrovia awaits the completion of the Monrovia Demand and Distribution
Study. In the interim, a rough approximation has been made on the basis
of the growth in distribution network assets and house connections in
Abidjan for the period 1967-76 and the corresponding growth in consump-
tion to compute the AIC of distribution over the expected life of the
facilities of 35 years.



- 43 -
6.07      Given the approximate nature of the data available to calculate
the average incremental cost, the average tariff effective July 1, 1978
($1.98/100() gals) and the tariff for consumption greater than 20,000 gals/mo.
1/ ($2.24/1000 gals) are both within the possible range of error in estimating
the AIC of water consumed and thus are accepted as giving an economically
efficient price signal to consumers. The tariff study (para. 5.10) would
review the long run marginal cost structure on the basis of more refined data
obtained during the Mlonrovia Demand and Distribution Study (para. 2.03 B(iv)
and would recommend the appropriate tariff levels for the social block and
high volume consumption.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
6.08      An estimate of the internal economic rate of return on the incre-
mental investment required to expand the entire system has been made, using
the same cost estimates as for the calculation of the AIC in para. 6.06 and
by valuing the benefits solely as the revenues obtained from the sale of
the incremental volume of water produced at the present average tariff of
$1.98/1000 gals. Results of this calculation are shown below. Since the
distribution and transmission cost estimates are the least reliable components
of total costs, a sensitivity analysis assuming a + 25% cost variation for
these two items is also shown. It is unlikely that the marginal transmission
and distribution costs will both be 25% higher than the base cost estimate
since newer housing developments will be located near the treatment plant
than assumed in the analysis of transmission costs and since Monrovia has an
extensive existing distribution network.

($1.98/1,000 gals)
taken as benefits
6.09      The use of tariffs as a proxy for benefits leads to an understate-
ment of the economic rate of return since the benefits of improved health
cannot be quantified. An increased supply of safe water would lead to lower
medical costs, reduced absenteeism and higher productivity.
Project Benefits
6.10      The specific benefits to be realized from the project include:
(i) the provision of a secure, year-round, saline-free raw
water source by construction of a pipeline from Mt. Coffee
to the White Plains treatment plant;
1/   407) of total consumption is used by consumers in this category.



-'4
;i   in inoreased firm capacity of tht'e MIt. Coffee hydro-
electrio plant from zero to 1')M'1V in the dry season,
wlhich, together with savings in raw water pumping and
treatment costs, would yield a net present value of cost
savings for the power and water sectors combined of about
$1) million using a 10% discount rate;
(iii) an increased volume of water to meet the needs of the
growing population of Monrovia (Project Item 2A(ii));
(iv)  an improvement in the access to service by the urban
poor;
(v)  a reduction in water leakage and wastage through pressure
reduction in the distribution network (para. 1.12) and
through improved metering which will permit closer system
nionitoring, thus improving the financial performance of
LWSC; and
(vi)  institutional improvements, which if successtullV imple-
mented, will result in both short- and long-term benefits.
In the short term, LWSC's operating practices slhould im-
prove together with its financial situation resulting in
more efficient service to the consumers. In the long run,
the improved operating efficiency and a well-developed
planning capability would ensure a systematic expansion of
water supply and sewerage service not only in Monrovia but
{n other, so far neglected, parts of Liberia.
Urban PovertyIa-ct
6.11      It is estimated that of Monrovia's 254,000 population in 1977 about
59,000 or 23% are below the urban poverty threshold ($137/capita/year--Bank
estimate 1975) and that this group will grow to about 80,000 by 1981. An
estimated 70,000 people have limited or no access to piped water in Monrovia.
The nature of the past urban development in Monrovia resulted in the poorest
inhabitants being found both scattered among high income residential areas
as well as in high density, well defined, slum areas. While the scattered
population is more difficult to locate, they generally have some form of
access to piped water (sharing connections, resale, illegal connection) since
the area is usually well served by the distribution network. The dense slum
areas, on the other hand, have limited tertiary pipe networks due to the
difficulties of laying pipes in the densely built-up areas. The project, in
tthe first instance, aims to improve the least served areas thlrough a "crash"
standpipe service extension program which, following the completion of the
1onrovia Distribution Study and the Block Mapping Program (paras. 2.03 B(iv))
and (v)) would develop into a systematic extension of the water supply ser-
vices into all areas identified as inadequately served.  During the first 3
years of the project, some 100 standpipes are to be installed together with
about 50,000 feet of distribution piping, in the slum areas of West Point,
9Uzzi Ouarters, Slipway and New Krm  Town, providing potable water to about



- 45 -
50,000 additional people. On completion of these works, other areas will
be tackled, but more precise estimates of the requirements to achieve 100%
service will be established under the Monrovia Distribution Study.
6.12      The standpipe installation "crash" program, together with the
government's agreement to pay for the standpipe consumption, is the first
component of a new policy of LWSC which is designed to have a significant
impact on water supply to the urban poor in Monrovia. Other measures include
the abolition of the (current) $35 water connection charge to domestic con-
sumers to encourage private (legal) connections and the eventual intro-
duction of more progressive tariff structure which would include a "social
block tariff" for the low income consumer. The definition of the latter will
be the target of a tariff study to be undertaken by LWSC (para. 5.10).
6.13      The first Bank project in Monrovia for urban development, slum
upgrading and low cost housing is being considered on the basis of pilot.
studies which were completed by consultants in December 1977. This urban
project will have the necessary sound basis for further betterment in water
supply and sanitation for the poor as a result of the production, distribu-
tion, and institutional improvements to be provided under this project.
6.14      Of the approximately 65,000 beneficiaries to receive new or
improved service by the end of 1981, 50,000 (70%) would be the urban poor.
Of the incremental water to be produced and distributed by the project facili-
ties, about 25% would be received by this group. About $1.1 million (12%) of
the $8 million IDA credit is directly related to the standpipe program and is
urban poverty lending.
Project Risks
6.15      Technical risks for this project are very low in view of the well
defined and relatively simple nature of the works. There are, however, cer-
tain financial risks because of the large degrees of improvements required
in the commercial operations of LWSC particularly in billing and collection
(para. 3.16) and the necessary government contributions in the form of oper-
ating subsidy and equity contributions (para. 5.15). Measures provided and
undertakings agreed to by the Government and LWSC during negotiations would
reduce this risk to an acceptable level.
6.16      To achieve the expected results of the Management Improvement
Program (para. 3.03), the full support of the Liberian Government and the
cooperation of LWSC (both of which have already been indicated) will be
required in implementing the anticipated changes in the organization and
operation practices of LWSC. Both Government and LWSC expressed keen interest
in the proposed measures and assurances were obtained from them during nego-
tiations to implement the required changes (para. 3.05).

VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations agreements were obtained from:
(a)  The Government of Liberia that it will take the following measures
to improve and protect the financial position of LWSC:
(i)  (a) Pay its water and sewerage bills within two months
after billing (para. 3.28, and (b) assume responsibility
for the payment of water consumed at public standpipes
(para. 3.28) and by public institutions (para. 3.29);
(ii)  (a) Provide subsidies to LWSC to cover the annual operat-
ing deficits of the Sewer Division, pending the implementa-
tion of the results of the tariff study, and (b) provide
an equity contribution of $226,000 to LWSC during 1978 and
such further equity contributions as may be required from
time to time for the implementation of the Sewer Division's
investment program (para. 5.13);
(iii)  Provide the necessary equity contributions to LWSC during
the period 1978-1982 to cover the counterpart fund require-
ments for the investment program of the Water Division
(para. 5.14);
(iv)  Cover all operating deficits of the secondary centers
plus any cash shortfall resulting from the repayment of
principal on debt as long as other satisfactory arrange-
ments have not been agreed upon (para. 5.22);
(v)  Deposit the estimated amount of operating subsidies and
equity contributions on a quarterly basis and in advance
in LWSC's bank account (paras. 5.15 and 5.22);
(vi)  Make appointments to LWSC's Board of Directors consistent
with the Public Authorities Law (para. 3.02), and inform
IDA in advance prior to making any proposed appointment
to the position of Managing Director of LWSC (para. 3.05);
(vii)  Transfer its share of the assets and liabilities of all
secondary centers to LWSC by December 31, 1979 (para. 5.22);
(viii)  Ensure that LWSC will comply with the investment expenditure
limitations agreed between IDA and LWSC (paras. 5.08, 5.09
and 5.22);
(ix)  Assist LWSC in enforcing all water and sewerage connection
rules, regulations and by-laws (paras. 3.21 and 3.23); and
(x)  Assist LWSC in the implementation of the results of the
tariff study (para. 5.10).



- 47 -
and (b)   The Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC):
(1) that it will take the following measures to improve and protect its
financial position:
(i) Adjust tariffs as necessary to achieve a rate of return on
revalued average net fixed water supply assets in service
in Monrovia of at least 4% in 1979, 5% in 1980, 6% in 1981,
7% in 1982 and 8% in 1983 and thereafter (para. 5.16);
(ii) Not incur additional medium- or long-term debt for the
Monrovia Water and Sewer Divisions unless the maximum
future consolidated debt service is covered at least
1.2 times by consolidated net revenues before interest
and depreciation (para. 5.17);
(iii) Carry out a water and sewerage tariff study and review the
findings of this study and their proposed implementation
with IDA by June 30, 1980 (para. 5.10);
(iv) Keep separate accounts and financial statements for the
Monrovia Water and Sewer Divisions and, in the future, for
the Secondary Centers Division (para. 3.32);
(v) Employ external auditors acceptable to IDA and submit the
auditor's report within four months after the close of
each fiscal year (para. 3.34);
(vi) Submit until project completion quarterly reports to
IDA on the monitoring indicators and take such remedial
action as IDA might reasonably request; and submit annual
reports on these indicators until five years after project
completion (para. 5.19);
(vii) Review its need for asset and liability insurance with
the Government and present an acceptable plan to IDA by
March 31, 1979 (para. 3.35);
(viii) Seek IDA approval before undertaking the following in-
vestment expenditures during the project period: (a) in
excess of $0.5 million per annum in addition to the agreed
investment program for the Water Division (para. 5.08);
(b) in excess of $425,000 per annum for the Sewer Division
(para. 5.09); and (c) in excess of $0.5 million per annum,
for water supply or sewerage systems outside Monrovia
(para. 5.22); and



- 48 -
(ix) Upon LWSC's taking over any water supply or sewerage facili-
ties outside Monrovia, it will prepare a detailed program
covering, inter alia, a description of the work program
valuation of the facilities, staffing needs, capital require-
ments, and the sources, terms and conditions of borrowings if
any, and submit the said program to IDA for review and comment
(para. 5.23).
(2) that it will implement the following program to improve its billing
and collection performance:
(i) Install working meters on all legal connections by June 30,
1979 (para. 3.21);
(ii) Abolish the flat rate charge of the water tariff immediately
after all legal connections are metered (para. 5.05);
(iii)  Add two collection points in areas outside the city center
(para. 3.27);
(iv) Enforce the existing water and sewerage connection rules,
regulations and by-laws (paras. 3.21 and 3.23); and
(v) Adopt by-laws acceptable to IDA by June 30, 1979 (para. 3.01).
(3)  that it will take the following actions to improve its management
and staffing:
(i) Make satisfactory arrangements for construction supervision
(para. 2.12);
(ii) Implement the recommendations of the management improvement
program (para. 3.03);
(iii)  Employ senior staff acceptable to IDA (para. 3.05);
(iv) Limit staff increases until completion of the management
improvement program and the training survey (para. 3.06);
and
(v) Employ a training consultant and establish a training
administration unit (para. 3.12).
7.02      Before declaring the loan effective, IDA should receive confirmatiol
that the Government of Liberia has provided $2,000,000 in equity contribution
and operating subsidies to LWSC for 1978 and 1979 (para. 5.15).
7.03      With the above agreements, the proposed project would be suitable
for an IDA credit of US$8 million to the Government of Liberia.
