"The Municipal Development Project will\n            assist local governments in providing infrastructure and\n            municipal services to a growing urban population.

The project includes\n            financing for: (i) basic infrastructure including\n            improvements for sanitation, drainage, slum areas, solid\n            wastes management, roads, traffic management and bus\n            terminals, and construction and upgrading of markets and\n            slaughterhouses; (ii) infrastructure maintenance operations;\n            (iii) nation-wide tax mapping; (iv) training programs; and\n            (v) technical assistance for project implementation and\n            structural reform studies."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
