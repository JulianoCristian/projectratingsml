Project will\n            assist local governments in providing infrastructure and\n            municipal services to a growing urban population.  It hopes\n            to achieve this by: (a) establishing a revolving fund, the\n            MDF, to provide local governments with direct access to\n            long-term development finance; (b) establishing a\n            national-level technical intermediary to assist local\n            governments in identifying investment priorities, evaluating\n            project proposals for financing through the MDF and acting\n            as a liaison with national and external funding agencies.\n            The project will also; (c) strengthen the local technical\n            and financial capacity for project implementation and\n            service management through a training program and\n            organizational and fiscal reforms. The project includes\n            financing for:  (i) basic infrastructure including\n            improvements for sanitation, drainage, slum areas, solid\n            wastes management, roads, traffic management and bus\n            terminals, and construction and upgrading of markets and\n            slaughterhouses; (ii) infrastructure maintenance operations;\n            (iii) nation-wide tax mapping; (iv) training programs; and\n            (v) technical assistance for project implementation and\n            structural reform studies."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
