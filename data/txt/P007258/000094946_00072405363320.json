Among factors affecting the project\n            are inefficient procurement, lack of capacity building, lack\n            of monitoring capacity, and insufficient International\n            Development Association (IDA) supervision. Recommendations\n            for future projects include: the adoption of project\n            implementation arrangements primarily focused on efficiently\n            discharging its fiduciary and procurement responsibilities;\n            the inclusion of assistance in developing institutional\n            structure for comprehensive sector management: realistic\n            assessment of borrowers supervision and monitoring capacity\n            through institutional risk analyses; linking counterpart\n            funding to fiscal or cost recovery mechanism reforms;\n            ensuring the borrower is a full partner in policy reforms\n            with a complete understanding of the interdependence of the\n            reform program; and enhancing IDA supervision through\n            appropriate staffing."}, "docdt": "2000-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
