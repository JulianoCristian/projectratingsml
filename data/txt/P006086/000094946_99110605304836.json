Some key lessons include: 1) It is necessary\n            to make a realistic assessment of the borrower's\n            implementation capacity building institutional risks, ensure\n            that strengthening of implementing agencies is carefully\n            phased and monitored, and follow up on agreed actions in a\n            timely manner. 2) The Bank should continuously monitor\n            compliance and commitment of the borrower to provide\n            counterpart funds at the highest level, and link those\n            levels with reforms of the fiscal/funding mechanisms. 3) The\n            borrower should be a partner to policy reforms long before\n            the project starts. The Bank should ensure a complete\n            understanding of the interdependence of all aspects of the\n            reforms program, carefully phase the implementation of\n            reforms and focus early implementation on the adoption of\n            key reforms, and keep supervision focused on institutional\n            issues and monitor achievements in a timely manner. 4) Civil\n            works should be implemented in a well-planned manner and\n            with clear supervision and monitoring procedures. 5) We\n            should include comprehensive local contractors development\n            strategies and action plans addressing the specific economic\n            issues, and paralleling action plans to strengthen\n            operational capacity in road agencies and/or streamlining\n            inefficient force account activities. 6) Bank supervision\n            should be improved through appropriate staffing."}, "docdt": "1999-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
