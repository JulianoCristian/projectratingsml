Some lessons learned\n            included: appraisal rated the risk of a resettlement-related\n            counterpart funds issue as 'substantial', and this\n            proved to be true during implementation. However, it did not\n            anticipate the magnitude of soaring land prices in the Delta\n            area which made this issue much more complex and the\n            resettlement process much more difficult during the course\n            of the project. The government knew as much as International\n            Development Association (IDA) did that timely release of\n            counterpart funds was a determinant factor for this project\n            but delays in the approval or release of resettlement funds\n            occurred due to bureaucratic factors, some of which were\n            beyond the control of the implementing ministry or even the\n            Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) and Ministry of\n            Finance (MOF). It should be recognized that although these\n            kinds of development interventions can be implemented well\n            they involve time-consuming processes with numerous social\n            uncertainties which do not fit the time-frame of a typical\n            IDA project. More flexibility should be allowed in budget\n            releases and the use of allocated resettlement funds in a\n            given year since physical works of irrigation projects must\n            fit into narrow construction windows of the Delta area (i.e.\n            the six-month dry season) by allowing unused budget to be\n            carried over into the next fiscal year. This, however, may\n            require a reform of the budget management system at the MOF\n            and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development\n            (MARD). Technical design flexibility should be allowed at\n            project design, appraisal and continue to be so during\n            implementation stage to quickly respond to new demands from\n            beneficiaries. The implementation could be much quicker if\n            the Government could arrange sufficient counterpart fund to\n            advance the technical design process to ensure the early\n            project start-up."}, "docdt": "2008-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
