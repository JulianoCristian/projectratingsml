The\n            prevention of salinity intrusion on canals serving the\n            agricultural areas, and the improvement of existing\n            irrigation systems, for those subprojects located in the\n            lower delta, are the main objectives. The main issues\n            concerning the Omon-Xano subproject, located in the\n            mid-delta, are to improve flood protection and drainage. The\n            project will facilitate local water and land transport, and\n            will finance land acquisition, compensation, and\n            resettlement expenses, incurred in as a consequence of the\n            project. The project's main components will: 1) improve\n            water resources infrastructure, through construction of\n            primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, together with the\n            necessary embankments, bridges, and roads. Compensation for\n            land acquisition and resettlement will be provided, as well\n            as training to affected families in drainage management\n            systems; 2) improve rural water supply and sanitation,\n            through clean water provision and better sanitation\n            processes; 3) strengthen water resources management and\n            improve environmental monitoring through institutional\n            capacity building. The component will manage engineering\n            design, implementation and supervision, and provide\n            institutional technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1999-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
