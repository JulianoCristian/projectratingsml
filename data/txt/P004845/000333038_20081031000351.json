In the mid-1990s, the\n            agriculture sector in the delta accounted for nearly 30\n            percent of the country's gross domestic product and\n            more than 80 percent of the rice exports, helping to make\n            Vietnam one of the largest exporters of rice. In the\n            mid-upper part of the delta where freshwater is available\n            all year round, many areas were triple cropped. However, in\n            the lower delta growth options were severely constrained by\n            sea-water intrusion into agricultural areas, further\n            reducing the availability of freshwater in the dry season,\n            and by annual inundation and flooding due to poor drainage.\n            This contributed to hard living conditions, with farmers in\n            some areas among the country's poorest people. Drinking\n            water supplies were often severely affected by salinity and\n            acidity. A key requirement in enhancing the productivity of\n            the agricultural sector and increasing the living standards\n            of the rural population, especially in the lower delta, was\n            to improve and rehabilitate water control infrastructure to\n            address salinity intrusion, irrigation, drainage, flood\n            protection, and drinking water supply."}, "docdt": "2008-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
