MOGADISHU WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (CREDIT 822-SO)
PROJECT CKMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This report presents the results of a review of the completion of
the Mogadishu Water Supply Project, for which Credit 822-SO of US$6.0
million was made to the Government of Somalia, to be relent through a
subsidiary loan agreement to the Mogadishu Water Agency (HWA). The Credit
Agreement was signed June 30, 1978, and became effective August 2, 1979.
The original closing date was June 30, 1982, but it was extended to
December 31, 1982. The date of the final disbursement was June 2, 1983.
Attached is a Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared by the
Water Supply and Urban Development Division of the Eastern and Southern
Africa Region. Regional division staff undertook a project completion
mission in October 1983 to gather information for the PCR and reviewed the
Appraisal and Loan Documents, the President's Report and other information
in Bank Group files. Completion reports were provided by MWA's consultants
on the physical project components (contracts).
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft
report to the Government and the Borrower for comments. Comments received
from MWA have been reproduced as Attachments A and B to the report.

MOGADISHU WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (CREDIT 822-SO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The project represented the Bank's first involvement in the
country's water supply sector. The project was planned as an interim
measure (para. 1.05 and 7.01) to supplement production capacity by 8,000
1.3/day and to strengthen the Mogadishu Water Agency's institutional
building and operational effectiveness during the period of preparation of
the follow-on project. The major highlights of the project are as follows:
(a) Physical:
(i) project implementation delays (about 2 years) caused by
start-up delays and revision of the physical project
components, which became necessary due to the results of
the water resource investigations (paras. 3.07 and 3.08)-
gb) Institutional:
(i) formation of MWA's Project Management and Planning Unit,
which became increasingly more efficient during the
project cycle (para. 3.06);
(ii) introductio-a of the commercial accounting system had to be
deferred to the follow-on project. In retrospect, this
condition was not fully realistic in view of MWA's
staffing problems (para 5.02); and
(iii) assessment of the sector's training need was carried out
under the project. The training component of the project
did not result in any direct benefit during the project
cycle. However, as a continuation, a training and manpower
development program is being formulated under the follow-
on second project (para. 6.07).
(c) Financial:
(i) approximately 20% cost overrun due to start-up delays and
physical revision of the project (paras. 3.20-3.22);
(ii) to minimize Government subsidy the water tariff was raised
twice in the project cycle (50Z in 1981 and 120Z in 1983),
but Government chose to maintain the uniform rate tariff
system (para. 5.04); and
(iii) MWA's cash position is adversely affected by the account
rece.ivables which varied widely depending mainly on the
payments by governmental institutions which account for
about half of the water sale revenues (para. 5.09).

MOGADISHU WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (CREDIT 822-SO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
Country Background
1.01      Somalia is a large, sparsely populated country.  Its varied
topography includes a hot and arid coastal p'ain, rugged mountains and
plateaus, and lowlands of varying fertility and rainfall (50 mm to 600 mm
annually). Its population in the mid-seventies was estimated at 3.5
million with a growth rate of about 2.5% per year. The urban population
was estimated at 1.0 million, half of which were living in Mogadishu. The
population growth in the urban areas has been significantly above the
country's average (3.5 percent per annum) amounting to about 6% per annum
in Mogadishu.
1.02      Somalia is among the poorest countries of the world-its annual
per capita income is estimated at about US$260. The mainstay of the
economy h2s long been nomadic pastoralism. Over 60% of the population
depend on livestock for their livelihood; about 20% are farmers; and 20%
are engaged in various agricultural operations. Due to the country's
limited natural resources, Somalia's prospects depend upon agricultural and
livestock development, whose progress will depend upon careful management
of the scarce land and water resources.
1.03      The pressing need to improve the water supply to the rapidly
growing urban areas, and particularly to Mogadishu, the capital city, had
arisen in an economically difficult period. Although in the early 1970s
Somalia made considerable progress in meeting certain basic needs, during
the seventies, the country's economy experienced stagnation in production
and a decline in per capita income.  Labor migration grew and this led to a
severe depletion of qualified and skilled manpower. The lack of an
incentive pay system and low Government salary scales coupled with
progressively rising inflation have further contributed to the weakening of
institutional development.  The project-the first in Somalia's water
sector-has evolved under difficult economic, financial and
institutional/managerial backgrounds.
Project Background
1.04      Water supply studies for Mogadishu date back to 1963 when, with
USAID assistance, investigations to supplement inadequate local sources of
supply had begun. These and succeeding investigations carried out in the
late 1960s culminated in the construction of the Balad Road wellfield and
the replacement of Hogadishu's deteriorating water distribution system in
1973. These improvements, also financed by USAID, were designed to meet



- 2 -
Mogadishu's water needs through 1980 but, due to the failure of several
production wells at the Balad Road wellfield and increases in water demand,
the need for further additions soon became apparent.
1.05      The Government first expressed interest in Bank Group financing
of a Mogadishu water supply project in 1975, when water demands were
approaching supply capacity. The project, prepared by MWA's consultants,
was designed as an interim project and included, besides a modest increase
in water supply capacity, investigations of groundwater resources of the
Afgoi-Balad-Mogadishu triangle as a preparation of a second water supply
project, and technical assistance to strengthen the Mogadishu Water Agency
(MWA).
1.06      The work covered by the project was substantially completed by
the revised Credit closing date of December 31, 1982, and by this time
almost the total amount of the Credit was disbursed. The remaining balance
of US$1,212.75 was disbursed on June 2, 1983.
1.07      This project completion report is based on information obtained
from Appraisal Report (No. 1860-SO), President's Report (No. P-2274-SO),
supervision reports, and project completion reports prepared by MWA's
consultants.
The Sector
1.08      At the time of the appraisal of the project, approximately 20% of
the rural population and 60% of the urban population (represented by the
cities of Berbera, Burao, Hargeisa, Kisimayu, Merca and Mogadishu) had
reasonable access to safe water.
1.09      In Mogadishu about 87% of the population were served from public
supply (9% through individual connections and 78% from public taps and
vendors). The modest water supply extension under this project did not
improve these ratios--on the contrary, the percentage of population served
has probably slightly declined, due to population growth and increased
immigration. More than 50% of the water supplied is used by Government and
institutions; consequently the level of service for the larger part of the
population is very low.
1.10      Public sewerage exists only in Mogadishu where service is
restricted to offices, hotels and a relatively small residential population
(about 3,000) located in the central portion of the city. Sanitation
facilities elsewhere consist of individual disposal systems (septic tanks
and pit latrines) serving an estimated 35% of the rural and about 77% of
the urban population.

1.11      Somalia's Three Year Development Plan, 1979-81, emphasized
improving urban water supply and sanitation and gave somewhat lower
priority to rural water supply. Because of Mogadishu's high rate of
population growth, its importance as Somalia's center of government and its
conspicuous deficiencies in water supply and sanitation, particularly high
priority was placed on sector improvements in Mogadishu.
1.12      The planned sector expenditures (on 1979 price level) in the
Three Year Development Plan amounted to SoSh 400 million.   Donor
assistance was committed for SoSh 267 million, or about 68% of the total
program cost. The First Mogadishu Water Supply Project was part of the
sector program (total expenditure about SoSh 50 million). A rural water
supply program was also carried out during this period, based on shallow
wells. Detailed breakdown by sectors and subsectors is not available, but
expenditures during the period were significantly bel'.w the planned levels
and the overall objectives which have been adopted were only partially
achieved.
1.13      There has been no change in the sector organization during the
project's implementation period. However, efforts have been increased
recently to achieve better coordination in the field of water development
both within the sector and related to national planning.
1.14      At the Central Government level, two organizations have key roles
in the sector:
(a) the National Water Committee (NWC, previously known as
Water Resources Development Committee), reinforced by the
recently established National Technical Committee (NTC);
and
(b) the Ministry of Mineral and Water Resources (MMWR).
1.15      The National Water Committee (NWC), chaired by the Minister of
MMWR is the highest policy and decision making body in the sector.
Committee members include Ministers of the Ministry of National Planning,
the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development, the Ministry of Livestock, Forestry and Range and
representatives of two autonomous agencies, the Water Development Agency
(WDA) and the National Range Agency.
1.16      The newly formed National Technical Committee (NIC) included
representatives of the same organizations, supplemented by representatives
of the Ministry of Health, WHO, FAO and the German Agency for Technical
Corporation (GTZ).



-4-
1.17      The Ministry of Mineral and Water Resources (NMMR) is entrusted
with the mandate of providing water for both human and livestock
consumption, which is at present derived mostly from groundwater
resources. MMWR is responsible for the collection and assessment of
hydrometeorological data, hydrogeological studies, design and
implementation of groundwater exploration projects and advising on water
legislation. Many of these functions are carried out through four
autonomous agencies under the MMNR.
1.18      The Water Development Agency (WDA) provides technical assistance
to rural and urban communities through regional offices (recently increased
from 7 to 16) and its headquarters is in Mogadishu. WDA is partially
funded through Government budgets and partially through revenue producing
activities (drilling and engineering)._/
1.19      The Modagishu Water Agency (MWA), which has been the executing
agency of the project, is responsible for Mogadishu's water supply.
Although MWA is still subsidized by the Government, the intention is to
make MWA a self-supporting public corporation, through increased tariffs
and improved institutional efficiency. The Government also intends that
MWA would eventually take over the responsibility for sewerage and drainage
in Modagishu, presently under the Mogadishu City Council.
1.20        The Hargeisa and Kismayu Public Utilities are responsible, as
autonomous agencies, for the water supply in their respective territories.
1.21       Other institutions active in the sector include the Ministry of
Agriculture, carrying main responsibility for surface water development,
and the Ministry of Livestock, Forestry and Range, through the Livestock
Development Agency and the National Range Agency, which is also committed
to well drilling programs. The Ministry of Local Government and Rurel
Development is active in rural water supply and sanitation.
1.22        The responsibility of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in the
sector has been limited mainly to exercising control and surveillance over
water quality and advising urban and rural communities on environmental
sanitation. Although MOH is attempting to assist in improving water supply
and sanitation in rural areas where hygiene officers are posted, its
efforts are largely confined to primary health care and control of
communicable diseases.
1/   WDA carried out the test drillings under the First Mogadishu Water
Supply Project and also participated through a joint venture in the
construction of the project's production wells.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS
Origin
2.01      The project originated with a request from the Somali Government
in 1975 for a development credit to help finance extension to Mogadishu's
water supply.
2.02      At the time of the Government's request, Mogadishu's existing
water supply system consisted of several sources of supply. The Balad Road
wellfield (financed by USAID and commissioned in 1973) was the principal
element, plus transmission main, various facilities for storage and
chlorination, and a distribution system with a total length of about 100
km. The Balad Road supply was supplemented with production from several
small-capacity tube wells located in Mogadishu. However, these wells have
not been connected to the distrlbution system but served as individual
water points for residential users and for livestock. The customers were
served through about 8,000 individual connections and 300 kiosks.
1.03      Total capacity of the wellfield at the time of commissioning
(1973) was about 24,000 m3/day (significantly less than the planned
capacity of about 31,000 m3/day), and the yield was declining in the
following years. By the year 1975, the growing demand was rapidly
approaching MWA's overall production capacity. In order to avoid major
water shortages in the following years, the Government requested IDA
assistance to finance a water supply extension project and in early 1976
retained consultants for the preparation of the project. NWA has launched
an Interim Improvement Program in 1977 to increase the wellfield's
production capacity through replacement of 4 of the 19 wells and
rehabilitation of the others.
Preparation and Justification
2.04      The first reconnaissance mission visited Mogadishu in October
1975, followed by an identification mission in February 1976 and two
preparation missions in June 1976 and April 1977. The project was
appraised in September 1977 in the field and the Staff Appraisal Report is
dated May 12, 1978.
2.05      It had been revealed during the preparation of the project that
the extension of Mogadishu's water supply could not be solved under one
project and a stepwise approach was more appropriate for the following
reasons:
(a) The vield of the existing Balad wellfield continued
declining by about 3% a year and only a minor extension
could be recommended to the existing wellfield without the
results of an extensive hydrogeological investigation of the
groundwater resources in the larger vicinity of Mogadishu.
However, due to the need to keep pace at least with the



rapidly growing (though suppressed) demand, and to
counterbalance the declining yield of the wellfield, an
interim first phase project had to be considered; and
(b) The necessary strengthening of the administrative and
operational capability and financial viability of the
executing agency (MWA) could better be incorporated in a
first phase project, thus preparing WA through gradual
improvements for following project phases with larger
scopes.
2.06      An advance for the preparation of the Mogadishu Water Supply
Project was requested by the Somali Government on August 2, 1977, to
partially finance the following:
(a) Consulting services to assist the Mogadishu Water Agency to
administer, manage, plan, design and direct the
hydrogeological investigations and evaluate the results
therefrom;
(b) Construction of exploratory boreholes; and
Cc) Procurement of material and equipment required for the
carrying out of the investigations.
2.07      The Association accepted the Government's request and a PPF
advance of US$500,000 was granted to cover part of the cost of the
hydrogeological study (total estimated cost amounted to US$1,350,000).
2.08      The project was technically justifiable in spite of the fact that
no significant improvements were expected in satisfying the demands.
However, by limiting new connections mainly to public standposts, improved
service could be extended to that portion of the population who were
dependent upon delivery of water from long distances. Reliability of the
service was also to improve through the addition of new generators at the
wellfield and an additional pump set at the booster-station.
2.09      The water supply sector in Somalia, of which MWA represents a
significant part, had obvious needs for institutional development. To
address these needs the project included support to the proposed Project
Management and Planning Unit, and to NWA's financial management through
advisors, services of accountancy consultants and identification of sector
training needs and proposal for a training program.
2.10      Return on Investment (ROI) 2/ on the project was calculated to
14.6% without shadow pricing. Shadow pricing of the foreign component of
capital and recurrent costs resulted in a reduction of ROI to 9.1%.
However, the economic rate of return, as calculated, is an underestimate of
project benefits since the consumer surplus is not reflected by using
revenues as a benefit proxy.

Project's Role in Long-Term Plan
2.11      The project had a very significant role in the long-term plan
through:
(a) contributing to the institutional development of MWA in the
first place and in a lesser extent through the
identification of training needs to the sector as a whole;
and
(b) providing the technical base for the further extension of
Mogadishu's water supply through the study of groundwater
resources in the larger vicinity of Mogadishu.
Project Description
2.12      The project as described in the Development Credit Agreement
included the following:
Ca)   Water resource investigation, including the drilling of test
holes and boreholes;
(b)   Extension of the Balad Road wellfield and support facilities
through drilling, developing and equipping about eight
additional wells to produce approximately 8.000 m3/day and
through extension and modification of the raw water
collector, transmission mains, the power plant and
electrical supply grid;
gc)   Provision of a standby pump set at the existing Mogadishu
booster station;
(d)   Extension of the water distribution grid, construction
of about forty additional public standpipes in Mogadishu and
construction of workshop and field staff quarters;
(e)   Strengthening the adminis:rative, maintenance and
operational capabilities of MWA through provision of expert
advisors, equipment, tools and vehicles, through design and
institution of a commercial accounting system, and through
identification of training needs and implementation of a
training program; and
(f)   An overall assessment of the training needs of the
Borrower's water supply sector as a basis for determining
the scope, cost and expected benefits of a water supply
sector training program.

2.13      Although the above description did not spell out the role of the
services of engineering consultants, the Staff Appraisal Report stated
specifically (para. 4.02 (g) on page 21 of the SAR) that these services
would include:
(a) engineering design and supervision of construction for the
project; and
(b) engineering design of the following Phase II project.
Provision for these services has been included in the Credit Agreement
under Category (3) of Schedule 1.
2.14      During the implementation period, a major revision of the project
scope, namely in Part B of the project, became necessary, due to the
findings of the water resource investigation. The revision and its impact
on the project as a whole is discussed in the next chapter of this report.
III. PROJECT DMPLEMENTAION, OPERATON AND COST
Loan Effectiveness and Project Startup
3.01      The Credit Agreement was signed on June 30, 1978.  The original
date of effectiveness, September 28, 1978 (as specified in Section 6.03 of
the credit agreement) was revised several times. The credit finally became
effective on August 2, 1979. The delay was caused by the difficulties in
filling the posts of advisors, which was one of the special conditions of
Credit Effectiveness.
3.02      Project appraisal was based on the consultant's "Feasibility
Study for Mogadishu Water Supply, Preliminary Report- (April 1977) and
Stage 1 Final Feasibility Study Report- (August 1977). The preliminary
report highlighted that extensive hydrogeological investigations were
necessary to identify the available groundwater resources in the larger
vicinity of Mogadishu. The final report proposed, in addition to the
investigations, a minor extension to the exisiting Ealad Road wellfield.
The Water resource investigations have been incorporated in the project and
engineering design was deferred until completion of the source
investigations.
3.03      The first major contract (Contract A), containing the main
physical elements of the investigation, namely drilling, constructing and
testing of pre-production and observation boreholes, was awarded to the
Water Developmet Agency (WDA) (see paras. 3.11 and 3.12), on March 23,
1978, in accordance with the time schedule of the SAR. However, first
slippage had already occurred in May, principally because of delays by
Government and MWA in arranging Letters of Credit for materials and
supplies. Further delays were caused by the inability of WDA to furnish
and maintain sufficient drilling rigs to adhere to the schedule. Although



this problem was partially solved through the loan of MWA-owned equipment
to WDA for use on the project, the works under Contract A were completed
only end-1979, about a year behind schedule. The final presentation of the
results of the investigations were submitted by the consultants in June
1980, after the originally scheduled project completion date.
Revision
3.04      The scope and extent of the project had to be substantially
revised as a consequence of the findings of the water resource
investigations. The invistigations proved that the continuous decline of
the Balad Road wellfield yield was due mainly to the over-exploitation of
the groundwater resources and only partially to the gradual worsening
condition of the boreholes and pumping equipment. Interim reports on the
hydrogeological investigations identified a new wellfield site along Afgot
Road, about 10 km west of Mogadishu. In order to prevent further slippage
in the project implementation which was already running more than a year
behind schedule, work on the engineering design and preparation of bid
documents was resumed.
3.05      The revision affected the physical components of Parts A and B of
the project. The planned extension of the Balad Road wellfield had been
replaced by the construction of eight production and three observation
wells at the new site (including the collector and transmission mains
within the wellfield), a 750 kVA capacity power generating plant, and a
switchyard and electrical supply grid within the wellfield. An additional
component was the transmission main from Afgoi to Mogadishu. The extension
of the water supply network in Mogadishu was only slightly affected by the
revision (Part D of the Project) and the other components (consultancy and
advisory services) remained intact. The impact of the revision on the
Implementation Schedule and the project costs is described under paras.
3.08 and 3.21 of this report, respectively.
Implementation Schedules
3.06      In accordance with conditions of the Development Credit Agreement
(Sections 3.04 and 6.01) a Project Management and Planning Unit (PMPU) was
set up within MWA by end-1978, to monitor project implementation and to
participate in the planning, design and supervision of construction under
the project. PMPU's activity, after initial difficulties, proved very
useful. However, MWA continued to employ consultants for construction
supervision and for the preparation and design of the follow-up project
(Second Mogadishu Water Supply Project, often referred to as Stage 2A
Project).
3.07      The slow project startup, delays in the completion of the water
resource investigation and the consequent revision of the physical project



- 10 -
components had an adverse effect on the timely implementation of the
project. Physical components of the project were substantially completed
by mid-1982 (as compared to the target complation date of March 1980) and
the project became operational on May 1, 1982. The Credit was closed on
the revised closing date of December 31, 1982, and the last disbursement
took place on June 2, 1983.
3.08      Due to the revision and change of the physical project
components, the implementation schedule (bar chart) as shown in the SAR
cannot be directly compared to the actual implementation. However, the
implementation schedule as provided in Annex 1 shows, besides the actual
implementation periods, the original schedule of the approximate equivalent
components as envisaged in the SAR.
Procurement
3.09      The consultants were first retained by MNWA in late 1976 to
prepare the Feasibility Study for Mogadishu Water Supply Expansion. Based
on their "Preliminary Report" the consultant's TOR was revised and a new
agreement was signed (October 1977) which included the proposed water
resource investigations. Physical elements of the investigations were
included in Contract "A' (see paras. 3.11 and 3.12).
3.10      The Design and Supervision of Stage 1, together with the Design
and Documentation for the follow-up Stage 2(A) project, were covered by an
Agreement signed on November 9, 1977. Work on the final design documents
was resumed in early 1980, and the following contract documents were
prepared:
(a) Contract No. 1: Drilling of Production Wells;
(b)  Contract No. 2:  Electrical and Mechanical Services;
and
(c) Contract No. 3: Civil Works.
3.11      Documents of Contract A (exploratory drillings) were completed
and issued in December 1977. Contract A was to be partially financed from
the PPF advance granted on August 24, 1977. Government requested that ICB
be waived relative to well construction and that the Water Development
Agency (WDA) instead be retained to perform this work. This request was
justified since only one private drilling contractor was located in Somalia
and the small number of wells had precluded much interest in the projert by
prospective foreign bidders.



- 11 -
3.12      Contract A was awarded to WDA after lengthly negotiations in
March 1978 and work commenced in October 1978. The original contract value
was SoSh 4,275,000 and the final certificate (dated January 27, 1983) was
SoSh 4,595,782.37. Works under the contract were com,%leted in December
1979, about seven months behind schedule.
3.13      Contract Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were awarded on the basis of ICB.
Prequalification was required for Contract Nos. 1 and 3.
3.14      Six firms were prequalified for Contract No. 1 (Drilling of
Production Wells)-five on the recommendation of the consultant's
Prequalification Report and, after further information had been provided,
the sixth, a joint venture of a drilling contractor and WDA. Tender
documents were issued on March 21, 1980 and bids were received from
three tenderers. The contract was awarded to the lowest tenderer for the
total contract price of SoSh 7,448,837 on September 16, 1I80. The
contractor was formally instructed to commence work on November 10, 1980.
The works were completed end-October 1982, about 14 months behind schedule,
for a total sum of SoSh 5,839,191.82. (Final certificate was issued on
January 27, 1983.)
3.15      Tender documents for Contract No. 2 (Electrical and Mechanical
Services) were issued in July 1979. Fifteen companies requested tender
documents but only four submitted tenders. The tenders were examined by
the consultants and a report was submitted to MWA in September 1980,
recommending that the contract be awarded to the lowest tenderer, for a
total sum of SoSh 14,116,758. After several meetings had taken place with
the contractor to resolve some minor technical and contractual aspects on
the contract, a letter of award was issued on December 15, 1980.
3.16      The manufacture of all equipment was completed by September
1981. Inspection of the pumps and generating sets was carried out at the
works prior to shipment.
3.17      Installation and erection works were substantially completed by
end-April 1982. Due to the delayed completion of the other two contracts,
the actual progress had little resemblance to the original works program
issued by the contractor.
3.18      Four firms were pre-qualified for Contract No. 3 (Civil Works).
Tender documents were issued on May 22, 1980 and bids were received from
two tenderers. The tenders were examined by the consultants and a report
was submitted to MWA in December 1980, recommending that the contract be
awarded to the lowest tenderer in the revised sum of SoSh 29,829,720.89.
The letter of award was issued on February 6, 1981 and the contractor was
formally instructed to commence work on March 24, 1981.



- 12 -
3.19      The works were substantially completed and although a
considerable amount of finishing work was still outstanding, supply was
turned on and the first water reached Mogadishu on April 7, 1982. Only a
partial completion certiftcate was issued (July 1982), because the
transmission main was not fully pressure-tested. Demand for water has
increased steadily and this has made it more and more difficult for MWA to
release the line for further attempts at testing. The problem is still
unresolved (see para. 3.39).
Cost and Disbursement
3.20      The slow project start-up and the changes in the project scope
caused a considerable cost-overrun. A detailed project cost estimate is
attached as Annex 2, and is summarized as follows:

The total amount of loan was US$6 million. US$3.29 million equivalent was
funded by the Somali Government.



- 13 -
3.21      The cost overrun is better characterized when expressed in local
currency (+38%), because the cost overrun in US dollars is largely offset by
the exchange rate fluctuation3/ and the decrease of foreign to local
cost ratios from 3 in the SAR to less than 2 for the completed project.
ApproximateLy 75% of the cost overrun was caused by the change (increase)
in project scope and 25% can be attributed to inflation during the four
year implementation period.
3.22      The actual total cost of the major physical project components
(covered by Contract A, 1, 2 and 3) amounted to SoSh 48.9 million, compared
to the original contract value of SoSh 55.6 million.
3.23      Cumulative disbursements are shown on the Basic Data Sheet
(p.(v). US$5.94 million was disbursed from the Credit (US$6 million) by
the revised closing date of December 31, 1982. The last disbursement was
made on July 2, 1983.
3.24      The final amount disbursed against each category is as follows:

3.25      The SAR disbursement profile was 3.5 years, custom made for the
project.  This was justifiable considering the small size of the project.
However, due to initial delays in project start-up and the revision of the
physical project components as a result of the findings of the water
resource investigations, the length of disbursements was in fact 4.5 years,
still well below the Eastern Africa average of 7.3 years. The graph of
accumulated disbursements on p. (v) shows that after commencement of
physical implementation, the rate of disbursement was satisfactory (90% of
the total loan was disbursed within a period of two years.

rate during the implementation period was US$1 = SoSh 7.231.

Operations
3.26      As it has been extensively discussed under the previous sections
of this report, the project was planned as an interim measure to back up
the existing water supply system and to provide assistance in the
preparation of a follow-on project with a more sizeable water supply
extension component.
3.27      All physical project components were substantially completed by
early April 1982 and the first water reached Mogadishu on April 7, 1982.
This water was initially used to clean and sterilize the line and the Milk
Factory reservoir which had not been in use f or several years, due to
shortage of water. The project was officially opened and supply turned on
to the public on May 2, 1982 (25 months after original target date of
end-March 1980, and 27 days after the contract completion date).
3.28      The actual and forecast water demAnd, production and consumption
figures (Annex 3) clearly show the impact of the First and Second (ongoing)
Project on satisfying the water needs in Mogadishu. The completion of the
first project provided improved supply in 1983 and 1984 at the given level
of services, (except in the peak demand periods) and the supply will be
fully satisfactory after the commissioning of the ongoing second project.
However, shortages in the peak demand periods can be expected as early as
1988-89, and major shortages after 1990, if further extensions are not
carried out by that time.
3.29      The production capacity of the new Afgoi wellfield is above the
planned level of 8,000m3/day. The average production in November 1982
amounted to about 9,700m3/day.
3.30      The power supply to the Afgoi wellfield installations is provided
by three 750 kVA generating sets. The generators were envisaged to operate
as the main source of power supply only until the commissioning of the
second project, then to serve as standby units, together with a fourth
similar generator provided under the second project. The generators have
been operated and maintained satisfactorily, but by end-1983 had already
logged about 9,000 hours each (i.e., nearly half of their useful life).
Extension to the power plant will be necessary under the second project,
because the Electric Power Authority cannot guarantee power supply from the
grid to Afgoi wellfield.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers and Borrower
3.31      MWA's consultants were retained to carry out all engineering
required under the project. Initially, there were concerns about the
suitability of the key field staff proposed by the consultants
for the hydrogeologic investigations. The problem was solved by retaining



- 15 -
specialist consultants as subcontractors on the water resource
investigation. The performance of the engineering consultants can be rated
above average.
3.32      Performance of the training consultants was satisfactory (for
further details see para. 6.07).
3.33      Accounting consultants were appointed to design the commercial
accounting system to be adapted by MWA under Part E of the Project. The
consultant's performance was satisfactory, although for other reasons,
their study and recommendations did not have the desired impact (see
para. 5.01).
3.34      The tariff study which was prepared by a separate consultant was
satisfactory. However, the Government declined to introduce the
recommended tariff system (see para. 5.04).
3.35      The exploratory drillings were carried out under Contract A by
the Water Development Agency. Some delay occurred in the early stages of
carrying out the works, mainly due to the contractor's inability to furnish
and maintain sufficient drilling rigs to carry out the works. The problem
was solved through the loan of MWA's own drilling rig to WDA for use in the
project. Although WDA's performance was not fully satisfactory at the
beginning, it improved gradually during the execution of the works.
3.36      Coutract No. I (Drilling of Production Wells) was awarded to
a joint venture of a drilling contractor and WDA. The conditions of the
contract included inter alia that the drilling contractor would be the
responsible partner and accept full liability for actions or default or the
joint venture, and would provide all drilling and management personnel.
3.37      The performance of the joint venture  was below expectations at
the beginning (delays occurred in the early stages of work due to frequent
changes in site personnel and due to late arrival of the specified type of
organic polymer drilling mud), but gradually improved during the execution
of works. The contractor has on several occasions filed notice of his
intention to claim, but has not followed any one up with the required
substantiation and documentation. No claims have been paid.
3.38      The performance on Contract No. 2  (Supply and Erection of
Electrical and ;{echanical Equipment) was generally satisfactory. The 33
kV stepdown transformer arrived in Mogadishu damaged and had to be
returned. The replacement transformer arrived in similar condition and it
too was returned. The third transformer arrived on site in January 1984
and was subsequently installed. As the transformer is required only when
the permanent supply line to Afgoi is energized, the late installation did
not delay the commissioning of the works. The contractor submitted no
claims during the contract.



- 16 -
3.39      The nerformance of the civil works contractor was also generally
satisfactoryb Early delays occurred in the execution of the works due to
late arrival of materials. However, the works were substantially completed
about a month after the contract completion date. A final completion
certificate has not been issued yet, because the pressure testing of the
transmission main has not been carried out fully. However, there is no
sign of fault in the main which was taken into service on May 1, 1982. It
is unlikely that the testing of the main can be carried out, as the line is
now actually the "lifeline" of the water supply to Mogadishu. Protracted
negotiations are still taking place on some of the contractor's claims.
However, using the engineer's estimate of the acceptable claims, the total
cost of the works would not exceed the original contract value. 4/
Performance of the Borrower
3.40      The Borrower is the Somali Democratic Republic, and the Minister
of Finance has been designated as the Borrower's representative. The
executing agency for the project was the Mogadishu Water Agency (MWA).
3.41      The date of effectiveness (originally scheduled for September 28,
1978) was revised several times due to delays in complying with the
conditions of effectiveness (see also para. 3.01). The Borrower's
performance after the date of effectiveness was generally satisfactory.
The Borrower attempted to obtain external funding to finance the expected
cost overrun on the project (due to the project revision) but without
success. The cost overrun was financed fully by the Somali Government.
The Project Fund Account, set up in the Ministry of Finance was replenished
from time to time, and no major payment delays occurred. Similarly, MWA's
performance in handling the physical execution of the project was generally
satisfactory. The financial and institutional performance of MWA is dealt
with under Chapter V and VI.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Market
4.01      Water requirements (annual consumption, demand and production)
are shown in Annex 3 (see also para. 3.29). Composition of annual
consumption by consumer category for the years 1976 through 1982 are shown
in Annex 4. The ratio of consumption between the various categories
remained virtually unchanged until 1978. The following years show a slight
trend towards increasing residential consumption and this trend is expected
to strengthen in 1983 and 1984, as a result of the moderate extension of
the water supply scheme under the project. A more dramatic change is
expected from 1985 onward, as a result of the commissioning of the
extension under the ongoing second project. No major water shortage has
been experienced (at the present level of service) since the scheme was put
into operation.
4/ Final payment was made in 1985.



- 17 -
4.02      In Supplementary Letter No. 1 (dated June 30, 1978) to the Credit
Agreement, Borrower undertook that a partial moratorium on new water supply
connections to private homes will be enforced, i.e., the number of new
connections will not exceed 400 connections committed before April 15, 1978
and 70 additional connections each year. The purpose of this measure was
to maintain adequate supply (pressure) at the water kiosks.   MWA did not
comply with this undertaking and about 1,800 new private connections were
made by end-October 1978. The situation was reviewed by the end-1978 Bank
mission and it was found that the effect of the new connections (as they
were provided mostly in the high population density areas with low per
consumption) was less than originally anticipated. However, the pace of
providing new connections slowed and only an additional 130 were made in
1979. With the completion of the reticulation system extensions and
commissioning of the works, over 6,000 new connections were made by
end-1981, amounting to a total of 16,930.
Project Role
4.03      At the time of the appraisal of the project (mid-1978)
Mogadishu's water demand (at the given level of service) was rapidly
approaching the maximum available yield from the source of water (Balad
Road wellfield). The roughly two-year slippage in project completion
caused increasingly serious water shortages in Mogadishu and in 1984 only
about 70% of the population had access to adequate water supply.
Commissioning of the modest extension of the water supply scheme under the
project on May 1, 1982, substantially increased the production and sales in
the following period. Without the project only about 50% of the population
in Mogadishu could have been provided with sufficient supply by end 1984.
The project also served as a vehicle for the preparation of the ongoing
second project.
Project Spin-off
4.04      As the project evolved under difficult country conditions, the
envisaged institutional development was only partially achieved. However,
MWA's management and the Project Implementation Unit have both become
increasingly efficient in handling project implementation matters, which
has resulted in smooth and successful preparation and physical
implementation of the follow-on project. The participation of the Water
Development Agency (WDA) in the execution of the project (Contract A and 1)
contributed to the increase of WDA's experience in well drilling operations
and to improvement of its overall performance.
4.05      At the appraisal of the ongoing second project, it was assumed
that the introduction of commercial accounting and the evaluation of MWA's
fixed assets would be carried out under the first project. As these



- 18 -
objectives have not been achieved as envisaged, technical assistance has
been intensified under the second project (additional advisors, water audit
study and asset evaluation study) to help MWA improve its operational and
financial performance.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Results
5.01      As the introducton of accrual accounting, on which the appraisal
was based, did not take place, no ready comparison is possible with the SAR
financial projections. Instead of the Income Statements, Balance Sheets,
and Sources and Applications of Funds Statements, only the Receipts and
Payments Statements are available with actual results. The summarized
Receipts and Payments Statements for the years 1977 through 1984
(1977-1982: actual; 1983-1984: estimate) are shown in Annex 5. Since the
revaluation of net fixed assets also did not take place, the operating
ratios as shown in Annex 5 exclude depreciation.
5.02      The introduction of the commercial accounting system had to be
deferred to the ongoing follow-on project. This can be atributed to the
following factors:
(a) In retrospect, this condition was not fully realistic in
view of MWS's staffing problems. Due to high staff turnover
and the difficulties in recruiting highly qualified
personnel, the additional staff base for such a transition
was not available. It has often been necessary for the
financial adviser to assist in the day-to-day work and due
to staff shortages, the retraining of the accounting section
staff was noy possible;
It
(b) The accounting system as designed by the consultants did
not address adequately the compatibility problems with the
prevailing Government accounting system; and
(c) No full recognition was given to the necessary strengthening
of the metering, billing and revenue collection systems.
However, it is expected, that during the ongoing follow-on project, with
intensified technical assistance, a step-by-step transition to commercial
accountirr will be carried out including the revaluation of the fixed
assets.
5.03      However, the financial statements highlight some important
features of MWA's financial performance. The operating ratio (as
calculated) has steadily increased from 1977 to 1982 (from 29 to 105). The



- 19 -
tariff increase (see para. 5.04) in 1981 helped to prevent a more rapid
decline in MWA's financial performance but with the limited available water
resources it was scarcely enough to counter-balance the rapidly growing
operating expenses. In 1982, in spite of the commissioning of the new
works, which provided about 2j% of this year's total production, MWA had an
operating deficit. This was due to additional high fuel costs (which
amounted to about 38% of the annual revenue), increasing other operating
costs and to the high amount of receivables. The average tariff in August
1983, coupled with increased water production and sales, were expected to
considerably improve MWA's financial performance in 1983 and 1984. The
forecast has not been extended beyond 1984 because the major extension of
Mogadishu's water supply under the ongoing second project is expected to
become operational by end-1984 or early 1985.
5.04      In compliance with Section 3.02(b) of the Credit Agreement a
Tariff Study was to be carried out by September 30, 1979. Due to initial
delays in project start-up and delays in selecting the consultant, the
study was carried out in early 1982 and the final report was submitted in
June 1982. Various block tariff structures have been analysed in the study
compared with the existing uniform rate tariff system. The Somali
Government decided to maintain the uniform rate tariff system. This
decision, in view of the status of MWA's financial administration, was
justifiable at the time of the last tariff raise (August 31, 1983).
The issue of introducing a progressive tariff structure has been repeatedly
taken up with Government/MWA during the ongoing second project, but no
final decision has been made as of end-1984. The following table shows the
tariff rates:
Tariff Rates
From - To                            SoSh/m3
March 1, 1973 - May 1, 1981             3.0
May 1, 1981 - August 1, 1983           4.5
August 1, 1983 - July 1984             5.0
August 1, 1984                        10.0 *
* Introduced under the follow-on second project.
5.05      These. rates represent the actual selling price in all the various
consumer categories. However, the concessionaries of the public fountains
(kiosks) receive 50% commission of the selling price. The actual average
tariff, as a source of revenue to MIWA, varies depending on the ratio of
sales at tne kiosks to the total sales. Annex 4 shows the composition of
annual consumption by the various consumer categories in percentage of the
total consumption. The total consumption at the kiosks has been fairly
consistent since 1979-about 18% of total consumption.  However, the
average tariff (as revenue source, and not as selling price) varied
considerably in the various years, as follows:



- 20 -
Average Tariff
(SoSh/m-3
Actual                    Estimated
1977  1978  1979  1980  1981  1982        1983   1984
(SoSh/m3)          2.85  2.85  2.85  2.86  3.80  4.16         9.05   9.05
5.06      The cost of water to those who have no private connections can be
actually much higher than the official rate. Water sold by vendors
depending on the distance from the nearest kiosks, sometimes double the
unit price of the water. In addition, the present tariff is near to the
maximum affordable price for a large proportion of kiosks users. The
extension of the system under the ongoing second project will bring the
water nearer to many consumers, but only the introducton of a progressive
tariff structure would terminate the anomalous situation that the poorest
segment of the population pay actually the highest rate for the water (see
also para. 5.04).
Financial Targets
5.07      In accordance with Section 4.06(b) of the Credit Agreement,
Borrower undertook to maintain the tariff levels in Mogadishu at a rate
adequate to cover MWA's cash operating expenses and depreciation or debt
service, whichever is larger.
5.08      MWA's accounting system has not been cb.nged to a commercial
accounting system and the revaluation of MWA's fixed assets did not take
place. Consequently, depreciation of the fixed assets cannot be taken into
account when evaluating MWA's financial performance. However except the
year 1982, the annual statements of Receipts and Payments have shown a
positive cash balance. Expenses included payments for inventories and
minor investments, and payments on debt servicing. Due to the tariff
increase introduced in August 1983, positive and improved cash balance is
expected in 1983 and 1984.  It is expected that the institution of a
commercial accounting system will take place under the ongoing second
Mogadishu Water Supply Project (see also para. 5.02).
5.09      MWA's cash position is adversely affected by the amount of
accounts receivables which has varied widely depending mainly on the
payments by governmental instititions which account for about the half of
MWA's water sales revenues. MWA has failed to maintain the receivables at
the level of maximum 60 days ecuivalent, as covenanted under the ongoing
second project. The receivables have been varying betwFen 60 and 120 days
equivalent. MWA has also wisely practiced making advance payments to the
contractors against the approved payment certificates, to avoid claims due
to late payments through Government channels. This practice contributed
largely to the achievement that no claims were submitted by the contractors
due to late payments. 5/
5/ OED Note: See item 3, pg. 35 for MWA comments on recent developments
with respect to receivables.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Management and Organizational Effectiveness
6.01      The Mogadishu Water Agency (MWA) was established in 1967 to
provide public water supplies in Mogadishu. In April 1970 it was merged
into the National Water Agency (NWA). In 1971, NWA was replaced by the
Water Development Agency (WDA) and MWA was reestablished as an autonomous
agency in 1978 under the Ministry of Mineral and Water Resources.  MWA's
annual budgets are approved by the Ministry of Finance subject to the prior
approval of MMWR.
6.02      MWA's organizational structure has not changed substantially
since the appraisal. However, the establishing of the Project Management
and Planning Unit as a condition of loan effectiveness, proved to be very
beneficial in implementation of the first Mogadishu project and in the
preparation and implementation of the ongoing second project. The Unit has
been fairly efficient in monitoring the physical implementation and project
financing. Less satisfactory has been the compliance with project
reporting requirements. Quarterly reports were frequently not submitted on
time and the quality of the reports fluctuated.
6.03      A Sewerage and Drainage Department was established in 1981 under
the Assistant General Manager, and a separate Training and Statistics Unit
was set up, answering directly to the General Manager.
6.04      Substantial weaknesses have been experienced in MWA's financial
administration. Financial recording was in serious arrears in early 1983.
This has been due primarily to the departure of the financial advisor and
the non-availability of most of the stationery and books for both the cash
accounting and the new commercial accounting system which the financial
advisor was in the process of introducing. Serious shortcomings have been
apparent in the accounting, metering and billing activities. High
receivables (mainly due to late payments oy governmental organizations)
caused occasional cash-flow prcblems. 6/
6.05      Key indicators of physical operations frequently have been
unavailable and this made it difficult to assess and monitor MWA's
operational performance. However, it should be noted that substantial
efforts have been made to operate and maintain the various wellfield
equipment, impaired by lack of spare parts and procurement difficulties.
Routine maintenance of the generators and pumps has been reasonably good.
Staff Recruitment, Manpower Development and Training
6.06      In the past, MWA has been troubled by high staff turnovers.  From
1979, some consolidation has become apparent, but migration of qualified
professionals to higher paid jobs and attractive positions made recruitment
to managerial/professional positions difficult. Although no major changes
6/ OED Note: See item 4, pg. 35 for MWA comments on recent developments with
respect to financial recording.



- 22 -
in salary levels can be presently expected, due to country considerations,
it is apparent that this largely contributed to the staffing problems and
to the generally weak work discipline.
6.07      The need for s training survey of both MWA and WDA was identified
in 1976-77 during the preparation of the project. The appraisal in
September 1977 led to the inclusion of a substantial training component to
be designed under the First Mogadishu Water Supply Project and implemented
by training consultants retained under the second project. Due to
prolonged delay in the appointment of the consultant, the Stage 1 study
started only in mid-1981. The report was submitted by the consultants
about a year later and reviewed and commented on by the Bank in August
1982. EEC undertook to finance the implementation stage under the ongoing
Second Mogadishu Water Supply Project. Bank assisted MWA to prepare a
training proposal and consultants terms of reference. 7/
Advisors
6.08      In order to strengthen the administrative, maintenance and
operational capabilities of MWA, the project provided for the recruitment
of a technical and a financial advisor (Section 3.03 of the Development
Credit Agreement).
6.09      The technical advisor took up his position in May 1979 and has
been assigned to the PMPU to assist in the project implementation and
monitoring. The advisor also assisted MWA to record and process
operational data.
6.10      The financial advisor appointed in April 1980 did not renew his
contract in April 1983 due to difficulties of the assignment. During his
two years in office he made considerable effort to prepare and train the
staff of the account section for the introduction of the commercial
accounting system, and assisted the financial department's staff and PMPU
in their day-to-day activities. However, the introduction of the new
system was prevented due to a shortage of qualified acounting staff, lack
of interest and weak discipline, and non-availability of the required
stationeries.
6.11      Due to difficulties in recruitment, the new financial advisor
assumed duty only in January 1984 under the second project, which provides
for the continuation of the advisors services.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievements
7.01      The project was designed as an interim measure to supplement
production capacity and to strengthen MWA's institutional building and
7/ OED Note: See item 5, pg. 35 for MWA comment on recent developments
with respect to training of technical staff.



- 23 -
operational effectiveness during the period of preparation of the follow-on
project.
7.02      Physical targets (i.e., to increase production by about 8,000
m3/day) were achieved. Revision of the physical project components, which
became necessary due to the results of the water resource investigations,
caused a two year dc:lay in completion of the project. The selected
alternative to the expansion of Mogadishu's water supply, i.e., the phased
development of the new wellfield at Afgoi, represented the least-cost
solution. The project included the preparation (up to and including
detailed design and preparation of bid documents) of the follow-on Second
Mogadishu Water Supply Project. This work, which was based on the
investigation, was completed on schedule. The second project was appraised
in 1982 and is presently being successfully implemented (Credit 1236-SO).
7.03      The second objective, i.e., strengthening the water sector
through the improvement of MWA's institutiGoal and financial performance,
was only partially met. The introduction o;: a commercial accounting sys:em
(designed by accounting consultants under the project) and the revaluation
of MWA's fixed assets did not take place, and were deferred to the
follow-on project. However, the formation of the Project Management and
Planning Unit proved to be very useful. This is specifically reflected by
the trouble-free implementation of the physical components of the ongoing
second project. The participation of the Water Development Agency (WDA) in
the exploratory drillings and in the construction of the production wells
helped to improve their abIlity in well drilling operations.  The
assessment of the training needs in the sector is followed up with the
preparation of a concrete training program under the second project.
Rate of Return
7.04      In order to assess the economic value of the actual project, the
economic rate of return on the investment was recalculated. On the basis
of the actual costs and revenues through 1983 (full commissioning of the
extension) and those projected through 2001, the economic rate of return
was found to be 12.7%. The rate of return calculated at appraisal was
14.6%. The decrease in the return can be attributed to the combined effect
of the higher project cost and to the delay in project completion. These
effectswere partially offset by the significant tariff increase 15 months
after commissioning of the works. In spite of the reduced rate of return,
the project was justified, even without taking into account the
unquantifiable benefits.
7.05      It is worth noting that the rate of return on average current net
assets (though the present accounting system does not provide the necessary
basis for precise calculation) has been recently estimated (June 1984) at
about 2%, meeting the covenanted requirements under the second project.
However, a tariff increase of about 35% would be required in 1985 to
continue to meet this requirement.



- 24 -
Bank Performance
7.06      The project was the first Bank operation in the country's water
supply sector and as such was expected to be difficult. Some of the
difficulties were foreseen at appraisal and measures were taken, such as
appointment of accounting and tariff consultants and the formation of the
Project Management and Planning Unit. In retrospect, some of the
conditions, specifically the introduction of a commercial accounting system
were not fully realistic, considering MWA's staffing problems.
7.07      In order to minimize Government subsidy, the water tariff was
raised twice in the project cycle. Although the increases were necessary
to maintain NWA's financial position, under the present uniform tariff rate
system the poorest segment of the population pay actually the highest rate
for the water. The introduction of a progressive tariff rate was declined
by the Government in December 1982. Further consideration should be given
to this issue under the on-going second project.
7.08      The average interval of about seven months between supervision
missions was less than adequate to follow-up the problem issues MWA was and
has been facing, and more weight should have been given to the
implementation of the non-physical components. The training component of
the project did not result in any direct benefit during the project cycle.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The project was successful in ae;;ieving the physical targets,
although the two year delay in completion caused increasingly serious water
shortages in Mogadishu. The delay was caused by the necessary revision of
the project (development of the new Afgoi wellfield instead of the
extension of the Balad wellfield as originally envisaged). The substantial
cost overrun, due mainly to the project revision, was financed fully by the
Somali Government.
8.02      The institutional performance and development of the Mogadishu
Water Agency (MWA) was less successful than anticipated. In retrospect,
this has been partially due to the fact that MWA had no previous experience
in the implementation of Bank financed projects, and not enough weight was
given to the non-physical components. Some of the conditions, specifically
the introduction of a commercial accounting system, were not fully
realistic, considering MWA's staffing problems. The training component of
the project did not result in any direct benefit during the project cycle.
The activities of the supervisors though unquestionably useful, did not
prc.uce the full expected benefit, especially in the field of financial
administration. However, the formation of the Project Management and
Planning Unit proved to be increasingly efficient during the execution of
the project and in the preparation and implementation of the follow-on
second project.

8.03      The tariff increases during the project cycle in May 1981
(50%)and in August 1983 (120%) helped to maintain MWA's financial position
(on a cash-accounting basis). MWA's cash position has been adversely
affected by the amount of receivables which has varied widely depending
umainly on the payments by governmental institutions which account for about
half of MWA's water sale revenues.
8.04      In short, the project was instrumental in increasing potable
water production as an interim phase of Mogadishu's water supply expansion
and, in spite of the shortcomings, in promoting the operational and
financial performance of the Mogadishu Water Agency.
8.05      As summarized in the Highlights of this report and further
indicated in paragraph 2.11 this project provided a major contribution to
the preparation of the Second Mogadishu Water Supply Project for which
Credit 1236-SO was approved by the Board on 4/27/1982. The lessons and
shortcomings which surfaced during the implementation of this project were
taken into account with the direct result of highly efficient, timely and
"under-estimates- physical implementation of the Second Project. The
limited capacity of the sector institutions to absorb organizational and
technical improvements (such as commercial accounting) were acknowledged
and a more realistic approach could be built into the Second Project in
these areas as well as in the area of training and technical assistance.

Mogadishu
Ref. : MWA/11/2/411/85
Date : May 22, 1985
Incoming letter from MWA to Mr. J. B. Buky, Division Chief.
June 5, 1985
Reference is made to letter dated April
9, 1985 from the Director, Operations
Evaluation Department and MWA's comments are
as follows:
1-   Para. 3.38                                     EAPWU Division Note:
The 33 kV stepdown transformer which is        Para. 3.38 of PCR revised.
required for when the permanent supply
line to Afgoi is energized, arrived in
Mogadishu damaged and had to be returned
to the manufacturer for repair.
Unfortunately, the replacement
transformer arrived in similar condition
and it too was returned. A third
transformer arrived on site in January
1984 and was subsequently installed.
The final bill was certified by the
consultant and processed by MWA for
payment through the Central Bank of
Somalia.
2-   Para. 3.39                                     EAPWU Division Note:

PCR.
3-   Annex 3 Page 28                                EAPWU Division Note:
The table shows that there is surplus          Annex 3, page 28 partially
water available from 1985/1986.  MWA           revised, using latest water demand
feels that this table should be revised        projections.
in accordance with table 1.4 of Final
Report, Volume I - Engineering (Second
Water Resources Investigation - Sir
Alexander Gibb and Partners - February
1985). This table should be read in
conjunction with table 1.2 of the same
report (for Average per Capital Demand)
and population (table 4.1, page 15,
preliminary Design Report, Stage 2B,
Vol. 1. Gibb's Report 1983).

The maximum output from Afgoy Wellfield
(Stage 1+2A) is 12.00 million cum and Balad
Wellfield could produce about 5.0 million cum
giving a total output of around 17 million.
The water demand at source is given
below:
Year         Million cum per Year
1985               17.706
1986               19.240
1987               20.907
1988               22.718
1989               24.688
1990               26.824
If water shortages are to be avoided a
new source must be developed lmmediately.
