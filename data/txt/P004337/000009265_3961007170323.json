reduce the\n            shortage of teachers; upgrade atoll primary teachers; focus\n            on greater female participation; reduce skill shortages;\n            upgrade staff at the health, vocational, management and\n            teacher training institutions; increase fellowship training\n            opportunities by allocating training to both public and\n            private sector recipients; and strengthen financial\n            management of the education sector. To achieve these\n            objectives the project will: 1) establish an in-country\n            lower secondary teacher training program and strengthen pre-\n            and in-service primary teacher training programs; 2) improve\n            access to secondary education in the atolls through\n            building, equipping and staffing five lower secondary\n            schools in the atolls; 3) develop in-country fee-paying\n            skill training programs accessible to both public and\n            private trainees, and support staff development in health,\n            vocational and management education; 4) support overseas\n            post-secondary fellowship training for qualified Maldivian\n            students to fill critical skills gaps in the public sector\n            and provide a pool of trained personnel to meet private\n            sector labor market requirements; 5) establish more\n            effective financial procedures and assist with management\n            and policy support in the education sector; and 6) undertake\n            priority studies in the education sector."}, "docdt": "1995-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
