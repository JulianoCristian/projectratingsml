outcome was satisfactory. This\n            project demonstrates that projects in small countries with\n            limited resources can be successfully implemented where\n            there is strong stakeholder commitment to reform, and where\n            there is political and administrative commitment to setting\n            and achieving high quality standards. In this instance the\n            level of parental commitment to education manifested itself\n            in the much larger than expected enrollment in the new\n            junior secondary institutions, and in post-secondary\n            courses, and improving equitable access to school. For\n            effective project implementation, an efficient and\n            autonomous Project Implementation Unit (PIU) is a necessary\n            condition. Investment in developing PIU capacity can have\n            wider benefit to contribute to an increase in public sector\n            management efficiency. The fellowship scheme has proved\n            successful in developing much-needed expertise and\n            knowledge. Fellowship placements should commerce early\n            during project implementation to allow for completion of\n            studies within the project period. Cost-recovery mechanisms\n            should be implemented as soon as beneficiaries return from\n            overseas study. Community commitment to education can have a\n            strong positive impact. Improving the internal efficiency of\n            an education system by increasing student-teacher ratios\n            requires strong government commitment."}, "docdt": "2001-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
