The project achieved\n            most of its objectives, institutional development targets\n            were only partly met, sustainability is likely, and both the\n            Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, as businesses, tree\n            crop plantations should be managed by independent,\n            autonomous private sector agents who have either full\n            ownership rights or long-term leases. Second, the policy,\n            institutional, and regulatory environment governing the tree\n            crops sub-sector should be as free as possible of export\n            taxes, political interference, restrictive labor policies,\n            practices, and marketing regulations. Third, there is a need\n            to ensure a firm commitment by donors to finance specific\n            components and establish appropriate implementation and\n            monitoring procedures. Fourth, investment in social welfare\n            development is valuable even in the context of a\n            commercially based program. Lastly, Sri Lanka needs to\n            ensure that research programs reflect the existing knowledge\n            base and adequately address the evolving commercial\n            requirements of the international industry and do not remain\n            confined to investigations of academic or insular interest."}, "docdt": "1993-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
