       improving transportation.  The project would strengthen\n            management and financial control of the corporations,\n            stabilize lands through soil conservation, and improve the\n            health and social welfare of estate workers and their\n            families.  The project would also improve institutional\n            capacity by providing training, technical assistance, and\n            facilities for planning and monitoring operations.
