INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNION OF BURMA
FOR AN
INLAND WATER TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Union of Burma for the equivalent of US$16.3
million on standard IDA terms to he:Lp finance a project for the rehabilita-
tion of the fleet of the Inland Water Transport Corporation (IWTC). The
major part of the proceeds of the credit (US$15.82 million) would be relent
to the IWTC for 15 years, including 4 years grace, with interest at 6 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report entitled "The Economy of the Union of
Burma" (R72-257) was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 28,
1972.  The following paragraphs reflect the Summary and Conclusions of that
economic report, updated with information obtained by a mission which visited
Burma in January/February, 1973. Country data are provided in Annex I.
3.        Burma is the largest country in the south-east Asian mainland and
the country is rich in natural resources. However, most of this wealth is
yet to be developed and Burma, with a per capita income of well below $100,
is among the least developed countries.
4.        Burma came out of the second World War and the struggle for inde-
pendence in 1948 economically devastated and politically divided. The fifties
were a period of turbulence, both political and economic. When the present
government came to power in 1962, its major objectives were to unify the
country and complete the social transformation of the economy which had begun
in the forties. The government is acutely sensitive to foreign influence
and, over the past decade, Burma isolated itself from external pressures by
maintaining a policy of strict neutrality, limited use of external assistance
and restrictions on travel.
5.        By and large, the government has made notable progress in the
attainment of its social and political objectives. Insurgency is still a
problem particularly in the hill and border areas but there is probably
greater stability now than at any time since independence. Nationalization
of all the major sectors with the exception of agriculture has been accom-
plished. (Reasonable efforts have been made to settle compensation claims
and progress is evident.) Agrarian reform has given the peasants virtual
ownership of the land and eliminated major inequalities in the pattern of
land-holdings. In the effort to attain self-sufficiency, most of what little
investment there has been has gone into the development of the industrial



sector. This transformation has been accomplished at the cost of some
economic disruption and its benefits are yet to be reaped.
6.        The government's major success has been in the provision of ad-
vanced social services 'or a population of about 30 million.    Efforts were
made to raise the standard of living by reducing inequalities in the distri-
bution of income, keeping the prices of basic commodities stable and widen-
tng the scope of education and health services.   The uniform pricing policy
for thne domestic consumption of rice ensured the improvement in nutrition,
particularly in the hill areas. Disparities exist but incomes are more or
less equally distributed and, in the fields of health and education, Burma
has achieved successes surpassing those of much richer countries.    It
Tiust be pointed out, however, that these successes have been accomplished
at the expense of dynamic economic growth. Over the past decade, the rate
of growth barely kept pace with the population which is growing at around
3 percent per annum.
7.        The performance of the major sectors has been disappointing.    Agri-
culture directly provides about one-third of GDP and much of secondary and
tertiary activity is also based on agricultural products. Over the past
decade, the real rate of growth of agriculture (after allowing for fluctua--
tions due to weather) was less than two percent per annum. The government's
policy towards agriculture has been mainly dictated b-Y equlity and welfare
considerations. Very little investment has gone into agriculture and the
programs recently introduced to increase agricultural productivity have met
with 1limited success.
8.        Over the decade, industry received the lion's share of public sector
investment and in recent years several new factories came on stream includ-
ing paper, cement, textiles and fertilizer.   However, most of industrial pro-
duction, which accounts for 12 percent of GDP, consists of the processing
of agricultural products, and the growth of industrial output is only
around 4 percent per annum. The poor performance of the sector is partly
due to the slow growth of agriculture and the decline in imports of pro-
ducer goods. However it is also a consequence of inadequate policies
governing the operation of the sector. Inadequate attention to replacement
aand maintenance has led to decapitalization trends in many branches of in-
dustry. The lack of financial and managerial autonomy also contribute to
poor capacity utilization and low labor productivity.
9.        The functioning of the nationalized trade sector is highly in-
efficient.  This has created artificial scarcities and given rise to a
flourishing black market. Inadequate transportation and power shortages
are also factors adversely affecting production.
10.       Price stability has been an important objective of the government
and a reasonable degree of price stability was achieved over the decade.
The cost of living index for Rangoon shows an average rate of increase
of 4 percent per annum between 1962 and 1972.   Careful management of monetary
and fiscal policies was an important instrument in containing inflation. For
the first half of the decade, the budget was more or less balanced and



- 3 -
expenditures have been invariably cut back to avoid excessive reliance on
deficit financing. However, over the past five years, the budget has been
showing widening deficits. The overall deficit in 1972 was 32 percent higher
than in the previous year. Until 1971, the government had been able to hold
monetary expansion to a modest two percent per annum. This was possible by
rapidly drawing down net external reserves. In the early part of the sixties,
gross reserves were at the comfortable level of nearly 8 months of imports. By
1972 gross reserves were equal to about 3 months of a much reduced level of
imports and net reserves were zero. Consequently, although the level of
deficit financing last year was not much higher than the average of the past
three years, its inflationary impact could no longer be cushioned by a fall
in reserves.
11.       The foreign trade and balance of payments position provide the
most striking illustration of the continued deterioration of the economy.
Rice is the major export and the most serious consequence of the stagnation
in rice production coupled with an expanding population has been the drying
up of the export surplus. In the early sixties, Burma exported a million
and a half tons of rice a year. Since then exports fell steadily to less
than 400,000 tons in 1968 and 1969 which were poor crop years. In recent
years, there was a recovery to about 700,000 tons but this is well below
the pre-war average of 3 million tons. Exports of teak and minerals which
have good market prospects have dwindled; mineral production is one-tenth the
pre-war level and teak production stagnates at the pre-war level. As a
result, the dollar value of Burma's exports is below the pre-war level and
its purchasing power for imports is but a fraction of what it was before
the war.
12.       The decline in imports was less pronounced than in exports but
the policy has been to restrict imports to basic essentials. In 1971, the
value of imports of goods amounted to $177 million compared to $228 million
in 1963. Consumer good imports (mainly of milk products, wheat and textiles)
accounted for 15 percent of the total. Raw materials, spare parts and equip-
ment accounted for the rest. The balance of payments in 1972 showed an over-
all surplus of $8 million compared to a deficit of $33 million in 1971. Un-
fortunately, this did not result from improvement in the external sector.
Imports were reduced by 10 percent while exports had increased by 4 percent.
The current account deficit of $45 million was largely financed by a substan-
tial increase in foreign loan disbursements.
13.       The conclusion that economic performance has been poor is inescap-
able. At the same time, it must be realized that achievement of a higher
growth rate has not been a major objective of the government. The level of
investment and savings has been and still is low, accounting for 12 percent
and 8.6 percent of GNP respectively. Mtoreover, resources were mobilized
primarily for the accomplishment of the government's social and political
objectives. The fact remains, however, that policies dictated by other
priorities have had depressing effects on economic growth. More importantly,
the time has come when the lack of economic growth is endangering the social
progress which has been made.



-4-
14.       The lKajor econoIlmic problems are the acute shortage of foreign
exchange anda domestic savings, the inefficiency of state enterprises and
the slow growtl of production.   The government is aware of these problems
and during the course of last year there was furthler evidence of the im-
portance which tlLe government now attaches to economic development.     hlus,
acting upon the recommendations of price and wage committees, the govern-
ment has substantially increased the prices of paddy and other major crops,
the structure and level of wages has been revised and there is now much
treater flexibility in the use of piece rates, bonus schemes and other
producti-vity incentives.  Interest rates on savings deposits have been
increased anid the governmlent hopes that this measure together with the
expansion of thie banking netwiork will induce more privrate savings. The
cooDceratives are taking over retail distribution and it is hoped that this
will bring about same improvements through the redluction in stocks and
wTastage.  The uniform selling price of rice has been abolished.    Coopera-
Lives arc to sell rice at a price covering cost providing the price does not
exceed the ceilings set by the government.    In the industrial and mining
sectors several schemes hiave been introduced, and others are under considera-
tion for improving efficiency.   Taken together, all of these measures may
not be ernough to reverse present trends.   lost of them represent steps in
the right direction. They also represent radical deFartures from previous
policies and as suchs, they warrant support.
15.       There are also other signs of change, as Burma emerges from its
self-enforced isolation. Burna has greatly increased its diplomatic and
trade representations abroad and its contact with international institutions,
particularly the LrTIDP.  Bunrma's approachi to the Banlc Group after a lapse of
10 years and its recent admission to membership of the Asian Development
Bank are further indications of a renewed preoccupation with growth and of
a willingness to accept foreign assistance to promote it.
16.       lligher rates of economic growth will require improved policies and
substantial increase in capital investment.    In view of the present constraints
to mobilizing greater resources for investment, reliance will have to be
mna:e on long-term concessionary finance from abroad. There is no question
about Burma's need for TIDA assistance nor of the country's ability to absorb
Foreign aid in certain sectors effectively.    Burma has never come anywhere
near to exploiting its enormous resource potential; and, if the country is
now (as it seenms to be) at a turning point, assistance at this time would be
both timely and far-reaching in its effect.
PART II - BANK GROUT OPEPATIONS
17.       Burma became a merber of the Bank in 1952 and of IDA in 1962.
Between 1956 and 1961, tthe Bank made three loans for transportation projects
totalling $33.i miillion.  A loan for the Port of Rangoon (Loan 140-BA) helped
finance thie reconstruction of cargo Derths and storage facilities, and the



- 5 -
purchase of cargo-handling and port equipment for harbor operations. Two
loans (Loan 139-BA and Loan 274-BA) helped finance the post-war reconstruc-
tion and dieselization of the railways. All three projects were satisfactorily
completed and the loans were fully disbursed by FY68. As of April 30, 1973,
the amount outstanding was US$8.6 million (Annex II). If approved, the proposed
credit, together with the proposed credit for the Third Railway Project,
would be the first Bank Group operations in Burma since 1961.
18.       The proposed Bank Group strategy is aimed at directly easing the
most immediate constraints to growth and placing major emphasis on the
development of the agriculture, forestry and mining sectors. Projects in these
sectors will help to diversify production for export and thereby alleviate
the critical shortage of foreign exchange. The rehabilitation of the trans-
portation infrastructure also has high priority because inadequate trans-
portation a:Lready forms an increasingly constraining bottleneck. The two
projects presently proposed, have the added advantage that preparation work
was far advanced and few institutional obstacles are anticipated. Both the
Burma Railways Corporation and the Inland Water Transport Corporation are
long-established institutions.
19.       In preparing projects, priority will be given to projects
which will be quick-yielding and quick to disburse. In addition to the
two projects under consideration, three projects are currently being prepared
in irrigation, forestry and mining. The irrigation project is likely to
consist of the provision of pumps and the construction of minor flood pro-
tection and embankment works in the delta area. This project is being
prepared with the assistance of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. The
forestry project is likely to consist of the procurement of logging, handling
and transportation equipment, the construction of access roads and the ex-
pansion of storage facilities. The objective of the project is to speed up
the flow of logs from the forest to the export market and local mills. This
project is also being prepared with the assistance of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative
Program. The mining project which is being prepared by the government is
likely to consist of the procurement of equipment for small-scale tin mining
and the establishment of collection and preparation facilities for tin and
tungsten concentrates. These projects are likely to be appraised in the
first half of FY74 and to be ready for presentation to the Executive Directors
duiring the second half of FY74.
20.       Looking further ahead, missions have recently been in Burma
to identify projects suitable for Bank Group financing in the livestock and
fislheries sector. Proposals for a possible airport and a telecommunications
project have also been submitted by the government for consideration by the
Bank Group. In addition, the Bank is expected to act as the Executing Agency
for a UNDP-financed study of the feasibility of dredging an access channel
to the Port of Rangoon.

PART III - TPE TRANSPORT SECTOR
21.       Rail, air and sea transport are entirely nationalized.   Some
private sector activity is allowed in inland water transport and trucking
and it is estimated that the private sector accounts for 80 percent of
total trucking and about 50 percent of inland water transport. The private
sector fleets are generally quite old and in poor condition, since the owners
are not allowed to purchase replacement equipment and have great difficulty
in obtaining spare parts. The stated Government policy is ultimately to bring
all forms of mechanized transport in the public sector.   The major public
sector transport agencies are the Burmla Railways Corporation (BRC), the Inland
Water Transport Corporation (IWTC), the Road Transport Corporation (RTC), the
Burma Airways Corporation (BAC) and the Burma Ports Corporation (BPC). As
far as the public sector agencies are concerned, BRC carries about 43 percent,
UT rC about 32 percent and RTC about 25 percent of inland surface transport
in terms of tons loaded. In terms of ton miles these figures are 48 percent
for BRC, 44 percent for IWTC anid 8 percent for RTC.
22^.      The largest cities are located on or close to the three main
rivers which traverse the country in a north-south direction, and the
estimated 5,000 miles of the inland waterways network are the most important
mode of transportation. Before the war, the transport network also con-
sisted of 2,100 miles of railways and 8,000 miles of roads, half of whiich
were paved. After the. war, it was estimated that as much a.s 60 percent of
the infrastructure and equipment were either destroyed or needed repair.
By 1960, most of the prewar capacity had been restored but the sector still
showed two main weaknesses.   Firstly, the infrastructure had been rebuilt
to pre-war standards and was not suitable for modern transportation and
secondly, the equipment was over-aged.   The situation called for major
investments both in replacement equipment and in infrastructure improvement
and expansion.
79w.      Over the past decade, public investment in transportation doubled
and accounited for 10 percent of total investment in 1971.  In the first half
of the decade, ean!)asis w.as given to rehabilitation projects.  MIore recently,
priority has beeni given to projects that enable the agencies to maintain andl
cxpand their capncity.  The distribution of investment appears to have been
realistic, writh the three  major modes of transport (rail, road and inland
water *ransport) receiving about 90 percent of the total. T-owever, the level
of investment has not Iheen sufficient to maintain capacity.  As a result,
eqtuipment has been kept in use beyond its normal economic life andI the fleet
is considerably over-aped. The Lqclc of forign exchange has curtailed the
procurement of necessary sparc parts and maintenance pro,'rarns hlave been cut
back puttinll incrcasin,- numbers of vehicles out of use. Visible evidence of
thie condition of t-le infrastruicture and equipment lends credibility to the
view of the transport agencies th)at thie actual level of investment was half
of what was actually needed.
24.       By 1971, railway route-miles had reachad about 95 percent of the
pre-war level. The railways have also undertaken a modernization program
and1 diesel locomotives not. account for 30 percent of the total.  The IWTC



- 7 -
provides regular passenger/cargo and cargo services on the major navigable
rivers. No significant developments have taken place in inland water
transport although some river marking and dredging is required and many of
the vessels are over-aged and in a state of disrepair due to lack of spares
and workshop capacity. Over the past decade, very little attention has
been given to roads, most of which are narrow, poorly aligned and incapable
of accommodating modern traffic. The pre-war capacity of the Port of
Rangoon has been restored and no capacity problems are foreseen, since port
traffic is well below pre-war levels. However, the instability and shallow
draft of the access channels have been of concern to the authorities and the
possibility of dredging an access channel through the outer bar is being
considered. The Rangoon International Airport was completed in 1955 and since
then no major improvements have been made in civil aviation infrastructure.
Of the 42 airfields in Burma, 50 percent have gravel runways and can only
accommodate DC3's.
25.       There is little reliable information on traffic flows and transport
demand in terms of ton and passenger miles. Most of the traffic flows along
the valleys of the main rivers. Agriculture, including livestock, forestry
and fishery, accounts for 70 percent of the tonnage moved, with industry and
mining accounting for the remaining 30 percent. According to official
estimates, the total demand for transportation has been growing at 4.7 percent
per annum, but overall the volume of traffic handled by the public transport
agencies has been declining over the past five years. This is mainly due
to the decrease in serviceable capacity. So far major disruption nas only
been avoided because of the slow growth in production but inadequate transport-
ation is a serious obstacle to growth and unless a major rehabilitation program
is undertaken soon, even the modest 4 percent annual growth of output envisaged
over the next four years will be unachievable.
26.       The problem is primarily one of lack of foreign exchange as manage-
ment and technical standards are generally good. However, some improvements
in operational efficiency and transport planning are called for. The three
main agencies (BRC, IWTC and BPC) inherited a sound organizational structure
and, faced with the constraints of insufficient capital and a lack of financial
and managerial autonomy, the agencies have done extremely well in keeping
their equipment running and maintaining the quality of service. Any major
investment in transportation will bring into focus the need for improved
planning and coordination. So far, this has not been much of a problem
because there was so little investment. As an initial step, the proposed
credits make provision for technical assistance in improving both operational
efficiency and investment policy. TJTC will receive assistance in improving
accounting, costing and management information.    In the case of the Railways,
studies will be carried out on the optimum timing for phasing out steam
locomotives, the adequacy of facilities for the maintenance and overhaul of
diesel locomotives, and the necessity for track doubling. BRC will also be
required to improve the preparation of operational and management statistics
and anpoint a working group to recommend operational improvements.

PART IV - ThE PROJECT
27.       In recognition of the urgenicy to undertake the rehabilitation and
modernization of the railwav and inland water transport sectors, the Govern-
ment submitted proposals for consideration by tihe Bank Group in September 1971.
Following, the visit of an economic mission in the spring of 1972 and a
project preparationr mission in September 1972, two missions visited Burma
in January/February 1973 to appraise the projects. A report entitled
"Appraisal of an Inland Water Transport Project" (Clo. 171-BA) is being
circulated separately. A summary of the credit and project is attached as
Annex III.
28.       At the negotiations, held in Washington in April, 1973, the Govern-
nient of the Union of Bu-rma was represented by U Clit Moung (Deputy Minister
of Planning >and Finance), UJ M'aung Maung Illa (Deputy Executive Director, Union
of Burma Bank), U lila Maung (Director General, Planning Department), U Tun
Shein (Managing Director, Burma Railways Corp.), U Lila Vin (Managing Director,
Inland Hater Transport Corp.), U Kyaw Khine (Deputy General Manager, Burma
Railways Corp.) and U Ngwe Nyunt (Deputy General Manager, Inland Water
Transport Corp.) .
29.       The Inland Water Transport Corporation's (IWTC) Investment Plan
for the 1971/72-1974/75 period calls for an outlay of about 11S_25.8 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$17.5 million. The
proposed project consists of the last two fiscal years, from 1974 through
1975 (and spillover to 1976), of the investment plan of the IWTC, and costs
US$24.0 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of about USS16.5
riillion equivalent, of wihich US$15.82 million would be covered by the proposed
credit. The balance of the foreign exchange requirement would be provided
from the Government's own resources for on-going operations.     In addition,
the proposed credit would finance the procurement of essential navigational
aids costing about US$0.48 million for the Waterways Department (WD) of the
Ministrv of Transport and Communications (MOTC). The total proposed credit
would, tlherefore, amount to US$16.3 million equivalent.
30.       The main purpose of the project is to enable IWTC to rehabilitate
its vessels and to provide adequate facilities for repairs and maintenance.
The project includes: rehabilitation of the fleet through procurement of
engines, spare parts and materials; rehabilitation of dockyard facilities
through procurement of equipment, machinery and tools; procurement of six new
passenger vessels to replace vessels that are obsolete or which were lost
in a 1968 cyclone; provision of radio conmunications equipment and
accounting machines, and technical assistance in management accounting ancd
modern welding techniques for the dockyards. The procurement of navigational
aids and equipment for the Waterways Department is designed to improve the
river system. (For details see Annex III.)
31.       The IWTC, which would be responsible for the execution of the
bulk of the project, is a state-owned corporation operating on Burma's major
navigational. waterwvays.  On the Irrawaddy and Chindwin rivers, and in the



- 9 -
agriculturally rich areas of the Delta, the Aralcan and Moulmein, where
inland water transport is virtually the only surface mode, IWTC provides
regular passenger and cargo services.   Like BRC, IWTC functions as a depart-
ment of the government for all practical purposes within the Ministry of
Transport and Communications (ITOTC). The Managing Director exercises his
power through various departments.
32.       The management of Il!TC is generally satisfactory, although there
is some scope for improving operations, particularly t'irough a better man-
agement informiation system.  The proposed credit provides for technical
assistance for this.   While rPTC has a skilled maintenance staff, maintenance
is hampered by insufficient spare parts, materials, and essential equipment.
Technical assistance is also called for to introduce modern welding techniques.
With the technical assistance proposed in the project, the Il!TC will be
competent to carry out the project.
33.       The revenue and expenditure accounts of the IWTC show improving
net results from operations during the years 1967-1972. During this period,
gross revenue increased by 27 percent, while operating costs have increased
by 11 percent.   Cash generation from operations amounted to K 100 million
during this period, but after providing for increased working capital and
debenture interest payment, only K 50 million remained. On the other hand,
capital expenditure during the period amounted to K 98 million. Therefore
the TWTC's own cash generation has been sufficient to meet one half of its
capital expenditure.   The financial prospects of IWTC are satisfactory.   The
forecast revenues are based on an expected growth of passenger and freight
traffic at 5 percent per annum. No provision has been made for an increase
in rates and fares. During negotiations, agreement was reached that during
the period 1973/74 - 1975/76 operating expenses would not exceed 90 percent
of operating revenues, and would not exceed 85 percent thereafter.    It was
also agreed that IWTC would incur further debt only if net revenues were at
least 1.5 times debt service requirements.
34.       All the items to be financed by the proposed credit would be
procured through international competitive bidding except for spare parts
for engines already in service (about US$1.6 million). In estimating the
cost of the six passenger vessels, it has been assumed that they would be
constructed abroad at a cost of US$2.85 million. However, some of these
vessels could be assembled at a Government dockyard which has capacity but
does not qualify for bidding in its own name. In order to encourage foreign
bidders to make use of local dockyard facilities, the Association has agreed
to allow a 15 percent preference margin on the portion of the work done
locally. If as many as three vessels are assembled locally, the credit
proceeds would finance local expenditures of not more than US$0.8 million.
The procurement of navigational aids will be effected by the IWTC which will
hand them over to the Waterways Department for installation.
35.       The rehabilitation of IWTC's fleet would generate savings in the
form of reduced maintenance costs and deferment of the procurement of new
vessels. Rehabilitation of the dockyards will improve fleet maintenance
and availability. The economic rate of return on the project is
estimated at 24 percent.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Union of Burma
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a reso-
lution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. Article VIII of the draft Development Credit Agree-
ment sets out the execution and delivery of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement
between the Government and the IWTC as a condition of effectiveness. The
provisions of the draft agreement conform to the normal pattern for credits
for transport projects.
37.       I an satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOtSE4NDATION
38.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

Procurement
Arrangements:           All items would be procured on the basis of
international competitive bidding, except for
certain spare parts for various engines estimated
to cost about US$1.6 million. With regard to the
evaluation of bids for vessel procurement, foreign
bidders will be allowed a 15 percent preference
margin on that portion of the work proposed to be
performed in Burma to encourage use of a Government-
owned dockyard. The credit could therefore finance
local expenditures of up to US$0.8 million.
Consultants:             Expert services for improvement of processing of
accounting and statistical information, and for
