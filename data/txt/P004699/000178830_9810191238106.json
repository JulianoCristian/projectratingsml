Approximately 21,000 farm families,\n            about 90% of whom have incomes below the poverty line, will\n            benefit, with incomes expected to quadruple by full\n            development in 1991. The project will tap the potential of\n            two existing reservoirs (Lam Pao and Lam Takhong) through\n            the construction or improvement of diversion dams, main,\n            lateral and tertiary canals, drains, and facilities.\n            Consultants will be employed to assist in project\n            implementation, to monitor benefits and to prepare future\n            projects. The project faces no special risks, although\n            realization of expected benefits will depend on the pace\n            with which farmers adopt improved technologies made possible\n            by the reliable water supply.
