   policy reform aimed at reversing the protracted\n            deterioration of Tanzania's economy. The policy areas\n            addressed include: (i) exchange rate, trade regime and\n            foreign exchange allocation; (ii) public expenditures; (iii)\n            parastatals; (iv) agricultural marketing and producer\n            prices; (v) industrial restructuring; and (vi) transport\n            sector efficiency. The foreign exchange to be provided under\n            the Credit would be used to finance priority imports needed\n            for the recovery of economic activity. The Credit is\n            expected to help increase output in agriculture,\n            particularly export crops, through the improvement of\n            agriculture incentives, the reduction of supply bottlenecks\n            and improvements in the efficiency of the marketing\n            organizations and the transport sector. It would also begin\n            a process for the restructuring of the industrial sector."}, "docdt": "1986-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
