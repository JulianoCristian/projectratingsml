It will also assist MWSS to improve\n            its operational efficiency. This will be achieved under the\n            proposed project by improving the water supply in the MWSS\n            service area through several components. They include:  (a)\n            the completion of works commenced under the Second Manila\n            Water Supply Project; and (b) construction of about 8 km of\n            additional bulk water supply mains. They further include;\n            (c) construction of additional water distribution works\n            providing water to about 72 existing subdivisions,\n            comprising some 16,000 households; & (d) infilling the\n            distribution network in about 24 areas covering about 13,500\n            households. The project also intends to finance: (e)\n            provision of yard connections & standpipes; (f)\n            acquisition of about 100,000 water meters; (g) improvement\n            to the distribution system through the installment of\n            control valves; (h) development of about five deep wells;\n            & (i) future project preparation. Finally, this loan\n            provides; (j) institutional support including consulting\n            services, training & provision of motor vehicles &\n            computing facilities."}, "docdt": "1986-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
