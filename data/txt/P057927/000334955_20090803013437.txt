 IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
      The Independent EvaluationGroup assessesthe programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Banks self-evaluationprocess and to verify that the Banks work is producingthe
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
disseminationof lessons drawn from experience.As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Banks lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directorsor Bank management have requestedassessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
       IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Riskto DevelopmentOutcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface



        This is the Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) preparedfor the
IndependentEvaluationGroup (IEG) for two projects inBulgaria: the Environmental
Remediation Pilot Project (ERPP, Loan4321) andthe Environmental andPrivatization
Support Adjustment Loan(EPSAL, Loan4538).

        An International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loanto the
Government of Bulgaria (GOB) for ERPPwas approvedby the Board of Directors on
05/12/1998 inthe amount of US$16.0 million equivalent. At appraisalthe total project
cost was estimatedto be US$25.0million, to be financed by the IBRDloan, US$3.25
million from the National Trust Eco Fund, and US$5.75 million from the Government of
Bulgaria (GOB). For the EPSAL, an IBRDloan of 49.5 millionto GOB was approved
by the Board of Directors on 02/24/2000. The loanamount was equal to estimated
project costs. Bothloans were fully disbursed.

        These projects were selected for assessment because they provide lessonsfor
integrating the remediation ofpast environmental damages into the privatization o f state-
owned enterprises (SOEs). The PPAR also will provide input to IEG's evaluation of the
World Bank Group's (WBG's) experiencewith safeguardand sustainability policy over
the past decade.' The SafeguardsEvaluation is part ofamedium-to long-term IEG
program to systematically explore the WBG role and effectivenessinthe environmental
and social aspects of development work. The PPAR also builds on the conclusions of
IEG's 2008 report, "Environmental Sustainability: AnEvaluation of WBG Support",
which analyzedthe effectivenessof WBG support to the environment from 1990to 2007.

       IEGpreparedthis report basedon anexamination ofthe relevant Project
Appraisal Documents (PADS) and President's Reports (PRs), Implementation
Completion and Results Reports (ICRs), legal agreements, project files and archives, as
well as other relevant reports, memoranda, and working papers. Discussions were held
withBank staff inWashington, D.C. and Sofia. An IEGfield mission visited Bulgaria
February 23-27,2009 to discuss the project and the effectivenessof Bank assistance with
relevant officials andstakeholders. Local environmental knowledge and supportwas
providedby POVVIK-OOS Ltd., a leading Bulgarian consulting and engineering
company specializing inenvironmental assessments, audits, and permitting. The mission
appreciatedthe time and attention given by those interviewed as well as the support of
the World Bankoffice inSofia.

       Following standard IEGprocedures, a copy of the draft PPAR was sent to
government officials and agencies for their review. The Government's comments are
attached inAnnex B.

Summary

        This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for two projects in
Bulgaria: the Environmental Remediation Pilot Project (ERPP, Loan4321) andthe
Environmental and Privatization Support Adjustment Loan (EPSAL, Loan 4538). The
ERPP piloted, and the EPSAL extended, a model for addressing past environmental
damages inthe process o fprivatizing state-owned enterprises. The EPSAL also sought to
reform Bulgarian environmentallegislation and accelerate its harmonization with
European Union requirements andpractices. Bothprojects aimed at improving the
environmental performance o f newly-privatized enterprises.

        The Government recognized that uncertainties about liabilities for past
environmental damage and about standards for future environmental performance could
increase the risk for investors, hinderthe privatization process, reduce privatization
revenues, and leave serious environmental problems unresolved. The projects thus
sought to formalize the process o f estimating the cost o f remediating past damages --
assigning the responsibility for remediationto the State, determining a schedule for
reaching compliance with current environmental regulations, and incorporating
Remediation Plans and Compliance Plans into Sales Purchase Agreements in
privatizations.

        The ERPP pilotedthe process for the MDK Copper Smelter. The remediation
measures were designed to prevent a potential accident threatening the contamination of
the drinking water supply o f a nearby city, improve environmental quality inthe area by
cleaning up critical environmentalhazards, andprevent further contamination o f
groundwater. Although there were delays inphysical works duringthe winter months
andprocurement delays duringthe first year o f implementation, the project achieved
most o f its objectives. The environmental performance o f MDK improved: air and water
emissions fell significantly, although certainpollutants, such as dust and sulfur dioxide in
air emissions and arsenic inliquid effluents, exceeded the temporary allowable
concentrations established inthe Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). According to
a Project Beneficiary Survey conducted inlate 2002, environmental conditions inthe area
have improved significantly.

        The efficiency o f ERPP was only modest, however. Since the EIA was prepared
before a detailed remediation planwas completed, the EIA did not contain detailed
technical information. This work had to be carried out duringproject implementation,
makingthe RemediationPlandifficult andtime-consuming to implement. Combining
the project's highrelevance, highachievement o f two objectives and substantial
achievement o fthe third, with modest efficiency, the outcome o f the ERPP i s rated
satisfactory. The risk to development outcome i s negligible to low.

       Overall, Bank Performance inthe ERPP was satisfactory, with satisfactory quality
at entry and highly satisfactory quality o f supervision. The project was grounded in
analytical work on environmental issues as well as lessons learned from privatization and
environmental remediation projects inother countries. Government officials and MDK
management praised Bank staff for solving problems and keeping the project on track.
However, the independent review o f the EIA for MDK found several weaknesses that
should have been corrected.

       Borrower Performance, both o fthe Government and o f the Implementing Agency,
was satisfactory. The Government remained committed to developing a method for
dealing with environmental liabilities during privatization, and ensuring that the new
owners came into compliance with Bulgarianregulations. There were delays, however,
caused by coordination problems across ministries andimplementing agencies.

       The EPSAL tried to simplify the implementation o f RemediationPlans by usinga
policy support loan, rather than an investment loan, as the Bank's financing instrument.
The benefito fthis instrumentwas its greater flexibility and lower supervisioncost, but
this came at the expense o fless control by Government over the implementationofthe
plans. Completing the remediation activities was also too dependent on the goodwill of
the enterprises themselves. While the choice of apolicy support operationwas
reasonable, it should have been accompanied by better monitoring and enforcement,
perhaps with stronger incentives and/or sanctions, to ensure that the new owners
completed their Remediation and Compliance Plans.

       EPSAL's tranche release conditionality called for "satisfactory progress" on
performance indicators inthe implementation o f Remediation Plans and Compliance
Plans -notjust the completion o f those plans. However, eventhough the EPSAL closed
more than five years ago, only three o f the six enterprises covered under the project have
completed their Remediation Plans, and only two o fthese show improvements inall or
most o f their environmental performance indicators. The policy andregulatory reforms
supported by the EPSAL were largely met, and Bulgarianenvironmental legislationhas
been harmonizedwith EUrequirements. However, as i s the case insome other EU
accession countries, the harmonizationo f environmentalpractices (implementation and
compliance) has laggedbehind the adoption o f legislation. Onbalance, the outcome o f
the EPSAL was satisfactory. The riskto development outcome is moderate. The policy
and institutional reforms supported by the EPSAL are likely to be sustained, but
implementation and enforcement needto be strengthened.

       Bank Performance inthe EPSAL was satisfactory, while Borrower Performance
was rated moderately satisfactory. The Ministry o f Financewas the lead agency

                                              xiii


responsible for overseeing EPSAL implementation andthe Ministry o f Environment and
Water was responsible for technical oversight o f individual projects. According to
mission interviews, incontrast to good performance duringthe ERPP, the performance in
the EPSAL was slower. Itwas also reported that the responsibilitieso fthe Oversight
Committee were unclear, and some members were unqualified. As a result, progress in
implementingthe RemediationPlans and Compliance Plans was mainly dependent onthe
motivation andgoodwill o fthe respective companies rather than on the threat o f serious
sanctions by the Government. This was compounded by the persistent lack o f capacity in
the Regional Environmental Inspectorates. Incontrast to these observations the
interviewees praised the Ministryo f Finance for ensuring that projected amounts needed
for implementation o f the Remediation Plans were appropriated inthe budget.

        The quality o f the monitoring and evaluation systems inbothprojects was
substantial. Performance indicators for the ERPP were adequate to measure the
achievement of the three objectives, although more indicators could have been identified
to measure the concentration o fpollutants insoil and water, and the risks posed to nearby
communities. Similarly, the EPSAL did a goodjob o f designingand implementing a
monitoring system for remediation and compliance plans, but too little attentionwas paid
to measuringenvironmental quality and no effort was made to link environmental quality
to health indicators o f local populations.

        Several findings o fthis PPAR are relevantto IEG's ongoing evaluation o f the
WBG's safeguardand sustainability policies: (i) difficulties encountered inchoosing
                                                     The
anenvironmental assessment(EA)classification for the EPSAL suggest that the EA
classification criteria are not relevantto all types o f projects; (ii) a development
                                                                     While
policy loan (DPL) may be more flexible than an investment loan to support
environmental remediation projects, DPLs need to build inbetter monitoring and
enforcement mechanisms to compensate for less detailed Bank and Government control
over safeguards and environmental compliance; (iii)      The achievement o fenvironmental
outcomes i s more elusive thanthe achievement o f intermediate outcomes such as policy
and institutional reforms. This calls for a stronger focus on environmentalresults, along
withperformance indicatorsto measuretheir achievement.

       The experience ofthe ERPP and EPSAL suggeststhe following lessons for fbture
projects that attempt to addresspast environmental damage and improve environmental
performance inthe process o fprivatization.

       A development policy loan supporting privatizationwith environmental
       remediation should include strong measures by the Government to monitor and
       reward compliance (or punishnon-compliance) to ensure that remediation and
       compliance plans are completed on schedule. Inthe EPSAL, eventhough all o fthe
       policy conditions were met and the remediation and compliance plans were signed,

                                          xiv


   the achievements interms o f implementationo f the plans, along with their
   environmental results, were mixed. Over-reliance on the goodwill o fthe
   enterprises themselves was a risky strategy, as changes inownership, management,
   and financial performance stalled progress on remediation andcompliance.

   Eveninwell-prepared EIAs, it is difficult to include sufficient detail inthe
   technical specifications o f remediation investments. Modifications indesignand
   re-negotiations during implementationshould be anticipated, and possibly reflected
   inalongerproject implementationperiodandhigherthannormal contingency
   funds.

   Evenwhen the State assumesresponsibility for remediatingpast environmental
   damages of state-owned enterprises, setting a cap on the State's liability creates risk
   for potential investors and delays duringre-negotiations. The possibility o f letting
   the State assumemore o fthe risk for additional remediation costs should be
   considered.


0  Harmonizing country environmental legislationwith international best practice i s a
   necessary but not sufficient condition for improved environmental performance. In
   development policy lendingfor environmental protection, more attentionneeds to
  be paid to improving the country's implementationpractices, track record, and
   capacity inenvironmental regulation. This i s likely to require carefully targeted
  technical assistance to buildthe capacity o fnational and sub-national
  environmental authorities. A parallel technical assistance loan, or a well-
  coordinated program of technical assistance fundedby other donors, should be
  considered.

1. Background

Privatization and EnvironmentalLiabilities

1.1      At the time the ERPP and EPSALwere preparedinthe late 1990s, Bulgaria was a
transition economy undergoing rapideconomic, political, and institutional changes. The
country hadjust completed an ambitious macroeconomic stabilization program and had
madeprogresswith the privatization of bothsmall-scale andlarge-scalestate-owned
enterprises (SOEs). The Government's privatization program, which was the
responsibility ofthe Privatization Agency (PA), involvedthe sale of controlling stakes to
strategic investors. The divestitureof SOEs insectors other thanenergy, transport, and
infrastructure was slatedto be completed by March2001.

1.2      There were serious environmental problems inlocalized industrial "hot spots" that
posed significant risks to humanhealth. Itwas recognized that uncertainties about
liabilities for past environmental damage and about standards for future environmental
performance could increase the risk for potential investors, hinder the privatization
process, reduce privatization revenues, and leave serious environmental problems
unresolved.

1.3      Although the State was legally liable for past environmental damages, there was
not enough informationon the magnitude of the damages and requiredmeasures to
address them. Inthe absence of detailed environmental audits, prospective buyers would
require large discounts, and it would be impossible to separate pre- and post-privatization
damages. There was a risk of extensive litigationand claims for compensation to sort out
responsibilities. The mining, metallurgy, chemicals, oil refining, andpetrochemicals
industrieswere particularly at risk.

1.4      The World Bank/OECD Environmental Action Programme for Central and
EasternEurope concluded that uncertainty about responsibility for past environmental
damage was a significant deterrent to foreign investment,especially inheavy industries.
A survey of largeNorthAmerican andEuropeancorporations found that companiesthat
hadmadeor consideredinvestmentsinthe regionrated environmental risks on apar with
exchangerate risks andpoliticalrisks.*The report called for establishing responsibility
for past environmental problems before privatization, when property relationships were
still simple. This would require (i) legal rules defininghow costs would be
                                       clear
allocated; (ii)   technical informationon the extent of pre-existing contamination andthe
potential costs of rectifying the damage; and (iii) administrative decision about what
                                                          an
remedial action was required.

1.5      In1997, the Government soldamajority ownership ofthe MDKCopper Smelter
to the Belgianfirm Union M i ~ ~ i e r At. ~the time of the sale, MDK was violating
                                         e


* "Environmental   Action Programmefor CentralandEasternEurope: SettingPriorities." World Bank and
OECD, May 1998.
  "MDK' became "MDK-Union Miniere" uponprivatization andin2002was renamed"UMICOR'. For
simplicity, the term "MDK" is usedthroughout this report to refer to the enterprise..

                                                        2


environmental standards and had significant environmental liabilities. One o fthese
problems was the so-called "blue lagoon" that had beenused to store semi-liquidwastes
from the acid plant, and thus was heavily contaminated with arsenic and other heavy
metals. The lagoon was both full and leaking, posing a serious threat o f an overflow or
break o f the damwhich would cause the wastes inthe lagoon to discharge into rivers that
flowed directly into the Topolnitsa reservoir, the main source o f drinking water for
Plovdiv and other large towns inthe MaritsaValley. The privatization o f MDK was the
first case inwhich environmentalissues were seen as critically important by both the
buyer and by the Government.

Environmental Policy

1.6      In1991, Bulgaria adopted anEnvironmentalProtectionAct, whichrevisedthe
systemo f standards; introducedthe principleso f pollution prevention andthe integration
o f environmental protectionwith other areas o f nationalpolicy; legalized the "polluter
pays principle"; provided access to the public on ecological information; and mandated
environmental assessment(EA) procedures and requirementsfor all projects with
potentially significant impact onthe environment.

1.7      EAprocedures were further specified by a RegulationNo. 4 of 1995 on
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), and gradually refined and adjusted to adopt
Western practices, especially concerningrequirements for public consultation and
disclosure. The legislationalso established a more efficient division o f responsibilities
betweenthe institutions engaged inenvironmental protection (the Ministryo f
Environment and Water (MOEW), the Regional Environmental Inspectorates (REIs), and
municipal authorities).

1.8      In1993, Bulgaria signedanAssociation Agreement withthe EU, establishing a
framework for economic and political cooperation ina number o f areas including the
environment. Underthe Agreement, the Governmentwas committed to harmonize its
laws, regulations, standards, norms, and methodologies with those ofthe EU. One o f the
most substantial tasks was to implement the provisions o fthe EUIntegrated Pollution
Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive, which shifted from media-based regulation-
covering, for example, specific emissions to air or water               -- toan integrated approach
focusing on the overall impact o f an industrial plant on the en~ironment.~

1.9     A 1998 resolution required SOEs to carry out anEIA, including anassessmento f
environmental damage caused before privatization. Incases where the EIA identifies
significant risks to humanhealthand ecosystems, a FrameworkRemediationPlan for



4EUCouncil Directive 96/61 on IntegratedPollutionPreventionand Control is one ofthe EUDirectives
governing control on industrial emissionsandwaste, and is the key driver for environmentalperformance
inthe industrialsector. The goal ofthe Directive is to achieveintegratedpreventionandcontrol of
pollution arising from awide rangeof activities by means ofmeasuresto prevent, or where not practicable,
to reduce emissions from industrial facilities to air, water, and land, including measuresto achieveahigher
levelof environmentalprotection as awhole. All activities coveredby the Directive require apermit,
which must include emission limits basedon Best Available Techniques(BATS), taking into consideration
the potential for transfer ofpollutionfrom one mediumto another.

Past Environmental Damages ("Remediation Plan", or RP) is prepared. The EIA andRP
are subject to public consultations. The EIA also proposes a planto bringthe enterprise
into compliance with relevant emission standards. This Compliance Plan (CP) implies a
program o f environmental investments for cleaner technologies and waste reduction
measuresthat would gradually bringthe company's environmental performance in
compliance. For a company under privatization that i s out o f compliance, the CP
determines specific temporary norms and standards along with a time-bound program o f
investments to upgrade environmental performance to meet Bulgarianand/or EU
emissionrequirements.

Motivation for the PPAR

1.10    The ERPP piloted a methodo fvaluing environmental liabilities and incorporating
a remediationplaninto privatization contracts, assigning responsibilities for
implementation and monitoring o f compliance with the remediation plansas well as for
compliance with environmental regulations inongoing operations. This
privatizatiodremediation method was then extendedby the EPSALto a larger group o f
firms. The EPSAL was one o f the first and very few policy support loans (or
Development Policy Loans - DPLs) used specifically to support environmental
protection. IEG's recent evaluation o f the Bank Group's environmental assistance5found
that the environmental outcomes (as opposed to intermediate policy and institutional
outcomes) o f environmentally-oriented DPLs have been mixed, so that there is a need to
carefully monitor and evaluate them from this perspective. Finally, this IEGcluster
evaluation o fthe ERPP and EPSAL provides an opportunity to examine how a pilot
investment project and a follow-on DPL can be usedboth individually and in
combination to achieve the same environmental objectives.


2.      Objectives and Design



2.1     The objectives ofthe project as stated inthe Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
were to support the Government of Bulgaria in:

      reducing environmental hazards causedby past pollution andunsafe environmental
      managementpractices at MDK Copper Smelter.


0     facilitating private investments inthe company.

      contributing to improvements inthe environmentalperformance o f the plant.

2.2     The Project's main environmentalbenefits were expected to be (i)        prevention o f
anaccident threatening the contamination ofdrinkingwater supply inthe Plovdiv area;



 IEG, Environmental Sustainability: An Evaluation of WorldBank GroupSupport (2008).

                                                   4


(ii)improved environmental quality and reducedpresent and future health risks of
workers andpopulation inthe neighborhood ofthe plant due to the agreedclean-up of
critical environmental hazards and improvements inthe environment performance of the
plantunderprivate management; and(iii)           prevention of further contamination of
groundwater resources.

2.3      The mainbeneficiaries of the Project were to bethe employees, populations and
future generationsliving inthe vicinity of the plant andthe larger Plovdiv area. The
PAD made it clear that the Project was intendednot only to facilitate privatization, but
also to encourage additional investmentsinMDKthat would improve boththe
environmental andfinancial Performance o fthe company.

2.4      The project was intendedto leadto a follow-up operation, the EPSAL, which
would establisha mechanismto systematically address environmental remediation and
compliance issues inconnection with privatization, without the Bank'sdirect involvement
ineachindividualcase.

2.5      The ERPP hadtwo components:

       A. EmergencyRemediationProgram. This component was designedto respond
       to the criticalproblem of the "blue lagoon" by (i)       stabilizing the dam ofthe lagoon
       to prevent accidents before the lagoon is permanently closed; (ii)       modifyingthe
       effluent treatment mechanismsand solid disposal; and (iii)         establishing temporary
       solid waste storage lagoons. Component A was financed by the National Trust Eco
       Fund(NTEF).6

       B. Remediationof past environmentaldamages. This component was designed
       to address arange of environmental problems causedby past operations ofthe plant
       to mitigate threats to the health of workers andpopulations surrounding the plant,
       andthe contamination of groundwater.It focused on (i)           disposing solid waste, soil,
       andmaterials contaminatedby historic pollution; (ii)        providing a permanent
       solution to the existing sludge settling pond; (iii)    ameliorating the fayalite slag
       tailings storage facility; (iv) reinforcing the residue storage area; and (v)
       rehabilitating the old slag dump.

2.6      The implementing agency ofthe E W P was the company itself, MDK, basedon
an implementationagreement betweenMOEW and MDK. A Project Oversight
Committee (OC), under the leadershipof MOEW, oversawproject implementation and
provided guidance. Representativesofthe Ministries of Industry, Finance, and the
Privatization Agency were regular members ofthe OC. The NTEF was the Project
Coordinating Agent, and among other things was to ensure that agreedtechnical,
procurement, and other requirementswere adheredto by MDK. Disbursementsfrom the

contributesto the implementation ofthe Bulgarian Governmentenvironmental policies and the
enforcement of its international commitmentsinthis field.

Bank loan were to be made against MDK's expenditures to implement its remediation
plan.

2.7    The cost o f the ERPP was estimated at $25 million, o fwhich $16 million would
be financed by the Bank loan. The estimated and actual ERPP cost and financing i s
shown inTable 2.1. Differences betweenestimated and actual costs (especially with
respect to fayalite tailing disposal, slag dump rehabilitation, and backfilling and re-
vegetation) were due to the lack o f some designs, changes inthe sequencing of activities,
changes incosts following more detailed designs and studies, and additional and
unforeseen works,

2.8      The ERPP was classifiedas a Category A project for purposes o fthe Bank's EA
safeguards. Although the project was expected to have net environmental benefits, the A
category was appropriate because remediation activities included moving waste to new
sites, and installing waste water treatment plants. The possible negative environmental
impacts of these activities neededto be assessedina full EIA. Consultations on the EIA
were heldwith the local communities o f Pirdop and Zlatitsa, environmental NGOs,
academic institutions, private investors, and other stakeholders.

2.9      As a condition o feffectiveness, MDK acquired landfrom the State that was
needed for the remediation program (borrowing soil to cover the old slime point, the
fayalite pond, andthe slag tailings pond). No land acquisition fromprivate owners or
resettlement was required.

EPSAL

2.10     According to the PAD, the objective o f the EPSAL was to achieve environmental
improvements and to support the privatization o f highly polluting enterprises by
reforming environmental legislation, establishing a consistent framework for integrating
environmentalissues into privatization, and accelerating harmonizationwith EU
environmentalrequirements andpractices. The Government's approach and medium-
term plan for environmental policy reform were described inits Letter o f Sector Policy,
attached as Annex 1to the PAD.

2.11     The EPSAL aimed to extend the model o f privatization and environmental
remediationthat was beingpiloted under ERPP, as well as to improve the overall
environmentalpolicy framework. The PAD recognized that the environmental policy
reforms supported by the EPSAL were complementary to (and, infact, driven by) the
Government's efforts to harmonizepolicies withthe EUinpreparationfor accession.

2.12     The enterprises to be included inthe privatizatiodremediation programwere
included ina priority list that was sent by the Government to the Bank inJune 1997. A
total o f six o f these enterprises were to be supported by the EPSAL; three were named in
the PAD, andthe other three were to be identified duringproject implementation.

2.13     As was the case withERPP, SOEs inthe process ofprivatization were requiredto
carry out an EIA, including an assessment o f environmentaldamage caused before

                                               7


privatization. The firms prepared RPs, including cost estimates and timetables, to be
includedinExecutionAgreements between the Government andthe investors that
formed part o f the Sales Purchase Agreements. The agreements provided for
implementation as well as funding for the RPs, but specified a cap on the total
remediation cost to be covered by the Government. The Sales Purchase Agreements also
contained CPs, which contained targets and timetables for bringingthe enterprise's
current operations into compliance with relevant emission standards.

2.14    The components (conditions) o fthe EPSAL were:

A.    Policy and regulatory reform

e     Exemption o f investors from liabilities for past environmental damage:
      amendments to the Environmental ProtectionLaw andthe PrivatizationLaw to
      confirm that the State retains legal responsibility for environmental pollution
      resultingfrompast action or non-action.

e     Clarification o fprocedures for addressing State liability amendments to the
      Environmental Protection Law and the Privatization Law clarifying basic principles
      (e.g. the protection o fhealth and ecosystems from unacceptable risks), procedures
      for determiningdamages (e.g. methodologies for assessingthe magnitude o f
      damage, risks, andremedial actions including inareas surrounding industrial
      plants), andfinancial mechanisms inrelationto state liabilities (e.g., financial
      sources for compensating contaminated landowners or re-cultivating agricultural
      land).

e     Subterranean Resources Act: a new act recently approvedby Parliament, and
      subsidiary legislationto be developed, to address ownership rights o f subterranean
      resources and determine responsibilities and arrangements for addressing off-site
      liabilities and liabilities emerging after the sale o f enterprises.

e     Water Act: new legislationapproved by Parliament in 1999, establishing a
      comprehensive legal framework for environmentally and economically sustainable
      use o f water resources based on the river basinmanagement principle.          .


B.    Framework for integrating environmental liabilities into privatization

e     Environmental Impact Assessments: introduction o f systematic auditing and EIA
      requirements for all major industrial enterprises prior to privatization, including
      requirements for public consultation and discussion.

e     Riskassessmentmethodolonv: adoptionbyMOEW o fa methodology to assessthe
      risks o f past environmental damage as part o f the EIAs for enterprises being
      privatized.

                                                8


        Remediation Plans: adoption o f methodologies for preparingRPs and their cost
        estimates, relying on cost-effectiveness principles and considering various
        alternatives such as containment and monitoring as well as clean-up measures.

0       Execution Agreements: the inclusion o f Execution Agreements -legally binding
        arrangements between the new owner andthe State to implement andfund the RPs
        -intheSalesPurchaseAgreementsbetweentheGovernmentandtheinvestors.

C.      Frameworkfor improvingongoingenvironmentalperformanceand
        harmonizingwith EUenvironmentalrequirements

0       IntegratedPollution Preventionand Control: a pilot phase and timetable for
        implementingthe EUIPPC Directive,. The guidelines o fthe IPPC Directive would
        be clearly agreed inthe CompliancePlans (see below), which would also form a
        partofthe privatizationcontract.

        Environmental Compliance Plans: plans specifying temporary norms and standards
        that would apply to privatized enterprises duringthe transition period untilregular
        standards could be achieved.

2.15     Inadditionto the above conditions, satisfactory macroeconomic performance,
including continued compliance under the ExtendedAgreement with the IMF and with
structural reforms supported by other Bank operations (a Programmatic Adjustment
Loan, and the First and Second Financialand Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loans), was a
condition o f all three tranche releases.

2.16     Since the EPSAL was prepared at the same time that ERPP was starting to be
implemented, it was not possible to incorporate lessons learned from the pilot into the
EPSAL design. However, it was clear even when ERPP was prepared that the
management o f environmental issues inprivatization would benefit from development o f
the overall environmentalpolicy framework, procedures, regulations, and institutional
capacity that would apply during and after privatization.

2.17     Incontrastto the ERPP, the EPSALwas designed as a sector policy support loan.
The loan provided budgetarysupport to the Government for (i)       additional expenditures
associated with remediation of and compensation for past environmental damages, and
(ii) potential losses o f privatization revenues brought about by the accelerated
implementationo f stricter environmentalregulations. The loan proceeds were placed in
anescrow account for remediation expenditures, which also gave new owners the
security that the Government would meet its responsibilities.

2.18     The loanwas to be disbursed inthree tranches upon satisfaction o ftranche
conditions (see Annex C). The first two tranches were approximately equal insize: the
first tranche was 14.850 millionplusthe front-end fee o f0.495 million that was paid to
the Bankandthe second tranche was 14.840 million. The thirdtranche was larger, at
19.3 15 million. This backloading o f disbursements acknowledged the fact that all o f the
first-tranche conditions hadalready beenmet before Boardpresentation, and that the
most difficult achievements involving the largest amount o f budgetary resources were

                                                9


conditions o f the final tranche release (satisfactory progress inthe implementationo f RPs
and CPs, issuance of IPPCs to at least 80 percent of large enterprises).

2.19     EPSAL was assigned to Category FIfor EA. According to OP 4.01 dated January
1999, "A proposed project i s classified as Category FIifit involves investment of Bank
funds through a financial intermediary, insub-projects that may result inadverse
environmental impacts", where "financial intermediary" meets the definition inOP 8.30;
i.e., an entity that assumes credit risk. Since the Government does not meet that
definition, the EPSAL would appear to have been mis-classified. Inresponse to an IEG
request to clarify the reasons for this choice, the Region responded that the FIcategory
was appropriate becausethe Government committed to carry out investmentsto deal with
environmental liabilities. However, the decisionto avoid a Category A assignment was
probably drivenby another reason: not all enterprises that would participate inthe
privatizatiodremediationprogram hadbeen identifiedbefore Boardpresentation, so the
required sub-project EIA work for a Category A project could not have been done.


3.       Implementation

ERPP

3.1      The loan was approved on May 12, 1998 and became effective on December 1,
1998. The project closed on December 31,2002 as scheduled, andthe entire $16 million
IBRDloanwas disbursed.

3.2      Preparation o fthe ERPP was initiated inparallelwith the start o fthe privatization
o f MDK and became part o fthe privatization deal. A preliminary site assessment
(environmental audit) was conducted, along with anEIA which included an RP.' The
EIA attempted to determine (i) extent ofenvironmentaldamage ofpast operations;
                                   the
(ii) currentstatusofenvironmentalconditionsandperformanceofMDK;and(iii)
     the
alternative measures and costs o f addressing environmental issues of past, ongoing and
future operations o fthe plant. The work was commissionedbyMDKandcomplied both
withthe requirements of Bulgarian law andthe Bank's environmental assessment (EA)
safeguard policy.

3.3      The EIA was reviewedby an independentconsultant appointed by the Bank.
The review found that the report was generally o f good quality but that detailed
information was lacking, makingit difficult to evaluate the proposed remediation
measures. This had implications for the ERPP's efficiency duringimplementation(see
para. 5.12). For example:




8 HatchAssociates, "Environmental ImpactAssessment ofthe MDK Smelter" (1997)
  Solbu, Eric;POVVIK EPLtd.; andETEcosistem,"Review ofthe PastEnvironmentalDamage
RemediationPlanfor the MDK PirdopCopper Smelter" (1997)

                                              10


      The individual sources o f sulfur dioxide and dust were not stated, makingit
      difficult to assess the improvements achieved by specific measures taken at each
      source.

      The EIA did not contain descriptions o fthe individual uses of cooling and other
      waters, and o f the waste-waters generatedinthese uses.

      The description o fthe small streams through the area and the influents to them
      should have been better. Since the streams passed through contaminated areas,
      they were likely to be polluted.

      The descriptions o f the present situation andexpected improvements in surface and
      rain water should have been more detailed.

      Information on solid waste that would be generated duringdemolition o f
      abandoned buildings and equipmentwas lacking, makingit difficult to evaluate
      remediationplans.

3.4    The reviewalso noted a lack o f quantitative information on expected
improvementson the smelter site and surrounding areas once the EIA's recommendations
were implemented, as well as the lack o f a long-term program for following up on
environmental issues inthe future. However, the review accepted the,proposed plansfor
remediation "to a great extent".

3.5    Based on the estimated cost o fthe RP, part o fthe sale price for MDK was placed
inanescrow account to bewithdrawnto fundthe remediationprogram. The RPwas to
be implemented by MDK according to the requirements set out inthe Sales Purchase
Agreement between the PrivatizationAgency and MDK.

3.6    Implementationdid not start untilabout eight to ten months after effectiveness.
Landacquisition, site access, andpermittingprocedures impededprogress indealing with
the fayalite disposal site rehabilitationprogram. These were compounded byproblems
with institutional coordination early inthe project. Later, further delays were causedby a
change ingovernment in2000 and management changes inthe PrivatizationAgency.

3.7    There also were delays inphysical works and contractor payments. Some ofthe
delays were caused by weather conditions during winter months, although these should
have been anticipated at project appraisal. Inaddition, time was neededto define specific
remediation technologies after in-depthanalysis o f the sludge and soil could be
performed.

3.8    Procurement delays were common duringthe first year o f implementation, not
unexpectedly since the implementing agency (MDK)was a private sector entity and was
not familiar with Bank procurement procedures. Supervisiondocuments noted that the
procurement o f the second component o f the project hadbeen held up largely due to
MDK's failure to prepare technical designs, specifications, bills of quantities etc. By
November 1999, however, the procurement problems seemed to have beensorted out. In
addition, there were complaints that the OC procedures were too lengthy.

                                              11


3.9       Bythe end o fthe year 2000, however, implementationand disbursements were in
line with projections. The environmentalperformance o f MDK had improved: air and
water emissions had decreased significantly, although certainpollutants, such as dust and
sulfur dioxide inair emissions andarsenic inliquideffluents, exceeded the temporary
allowable concentrations establishedinthe EIA.

3.10      According to interviews conducted duringthe IEGmission, steady progress on
the remediation measures was due inlarge part to MDK's full commitment to the project.
NTEFalso playedanimportantrole as anintermediary betweenMDKandthe
Government. This helped get decisions made when problems arose, and contributed to
successful implementation o fthe project.

3.11      By project closing, the supervision document notedthat project activities had
been "largely" and "successfully" completed, and that anafter-care program for
remediated sites was beingfinalized. The after-care program involved continued
maintenance, monitoring, andemergency plans for the remediated sites. Funds for
implementationo f the program were set aside inthe escrow account to be made available
to MDK for up to five years, the period o fthe Government's responsibilitiesfor the
historical pollution.



3.12      Preparation o f the EPSAL began even before ERPP became effective inOctober
1998. The 49.5 million loan was approved on February 24,2000 and became effective
on April 21,2000, and the first tranche was disbursedshortly thereafter. Release o fthe
second andthirdtranches was delayed by ten months and five months, respectively, due
to delayed compliance with the Rps o f two companies. As a result o fthe delayed tranche
releases, the project closed five months later than scheduled (on December 31,2003), and
was fully disbursed.

3.13      All actions required for legal andregulatory conditions, as well as the institutional
mechanisms for managing and overseeing the program, were implemented before Board
presentation. This meantthat the first tranche was largely a recognition o fthe
Government's previous accomplishments inlegislative and policy reforms. This i s a
common characteristic o f policy support lending: DPLs are intended to support programs
that are fully owned by the Government, and Bank financing i s provided after the
program actions have been taken.


3.14      Project implementation began with the approval o f EIAs and Execution
Agreements (including RPs and CPs) for the three enterprises identifiedinthe PAD:
Assarel Medet (copper mine), Lukoil-Neftochim (petroleum refinery/petroleum
products), andKremikovtzi (steel works). The signature o f Sales Purchase Agreements,
including the ExecutionAgreements, was a condition of first tranche release. By
December 2000, three more Sales Purchase Agreements had beensigned for the second
set o f firms: Neochim (chemicals), Agropolychim (fertilizers), and Sopharma
(pharmaceuticals). The signing of Execution Agreements for these firms was a condition
of the second tranche release.

                                               12


3.15     All conditions for second tranche releasewere met, including satisfactory
progress inimplementingthe RPs and CPs for the first set o f enterprises and signature o f
Sales Purchase Agreements with the second set. Nevertheless, the commitment o f the
enterprises to their obligations under the ExecutionAgreementsvaried, and delays began
to accumulate. Other delays were caused by administrativeprocedures for approval o f
access to landor acquisition of landfor waste disposal.

3.16     One enterprise, Agropolychim, refused to manage its RP, andthe Government
turned over responsibility to a thirdparty, a specialized remediation contractor. Third-
party contractingwas allowed, with Government approval, underthe regulations
governing the remediation o fpast environmental damage. Agropolychim's decision to
implementonly its CP arosebecauseitfaced a significant financial burden from assumed
SOE debts, and the company feared that it mightbe heldresponsible for unforeseen
expenses. The implementation o f this arrangement was not altogether smooth, however,
as the new owner o f Agropolychim was said to have impededprogress on remediation
activities during the early part of the implementationperiod.

3.17     The Governmentmet all conditions for thirdtranche release except two:
satisfactory progress inimplementing the Remediation and Compliance Plans for all six
enterprises, and contracting o fthe activities to carry out these plans. The lack o f progress
was mainly due to two firms, Kremikovtzi and Lukoil-Neftochim. The ICR cites the
following reasons for the failure o fthe two companies to fully implement their plans: (i)
lack o f clarity over the applicability o fthe Public Procurement Law for procuring
services for feasibility studies and detailedengineeringdesigns; (ii)   disputes over
advance payments for studies and designs; (iii)    disputesover enterprise liability for
completion o f the agreedRP incases when actual remediation costs significantly
exceeded the cost caps inthe Execution Agreements; (iv) perceived inter-linkages
between the RP and compliance measures; and (v) lack o f corporate commitment to
finance upfront costly elements o fthe CP.

3.18    Although the failure on the part o f some enterprises to fully implement their RPs
and CPs meant that two conditions were only partially met, the Bank decidedto release
the thirdtranche. Thejustification was that the remediation expenditures to date (68.5
percent o f the total for the EPSAL) were close to the thirdtranche target (70 percent), and
that there hadbeensatisfactory progress on meeting the policy conditions.

3.19     Satisfactory macroeconomic performance was maintained throughout EPSAL
implementation. Real GDP growth averaged 4 to 5 percent, fiscal performance was even
better thanexpected, andthe external balance improved substantially. Boththe Bank and
the IMFfoundthe country's structural reforms to be ontrack.

4.2     The design, implementation, and utilization of the M&E systemwere substantial
Performance indicators generally were adequate to measure the achievement o f the three
objectives. However, with respect to the objective o f reducing environmental hazards
caused by past pollution at MDK,more indicators could have beenidentified to measure
the concentration of pollutants insoil andwater, and the risks posed to nearby
communities. During project implementation, the Bank task team recommended that
some evaluation o f hospital records, particularly o f the MDK company clinic, be

                                              14


undertaken to monitor trends inincidence o frespiratory illnesses and complaints.
However, this was not done.

4.3     MDKprovidedmonthly reports onits environmentalperformance to the Regional
Environmental Inspectorate as well as semi-annual reports on its compliance with the
Project ImplementationPlan. According to supervisionaide memoires, these reports
were submitted as required. The communities of Pirdop andZlatitsa were able to access
real time data on air emissions through a public dissemination system.



4.4     According to the PAD, the following indicators were to be applied to monitor
performance:

       Number and cost o f implementing Remediation Plansand Compliance Plans
       agreed between new owners o f the privatized enterprises and the Government
       according to principles and procedures acceptable to the Bank.

       Satisfactory execution o f RPs according to stages o f works agreed intime-bound
       Execution Agreements and agreed environmental performance indicators.

       Compliance with water and air emissions requirements specified for each enterprise
       inthe CPs.

       Agreed measurable improvements inenvironmental quality indicators o fplants
       agreed under the RPs and CPs.

0      The number o f enterprises for which integrated pilot environmental permits were
       issued according to EU 1996 Directive on IPPC.

4.5     The designandimplementation o fthe monitoring system for remediation and
compliance planswere substantial,buttoo little attention was paid to monitoring
environmental quality and no effort was made to link environmental quality to health
indicators o f local populations. Also, since M O E W does not monitor groundwater
quality, these indicators were not included intheir reports. Thus, the utilization o f the
M&Esystemwas only modest. Finally, there was no planfor an impact evaluationto be
conducted at project completion.


5.      Ratings: ERPP

Relevance

5.1     EWP's objectives were highlyrelevant. They were consistent with the 1998
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), inwhich private sector development andprotecting
the environment were main elements o fthe strategy. The CAS called for accelerating the

                                                  15


divestiture o f state-owned enterprises, with an emphasis on sales to strategic investors.
To avoid a deterioration inenvironmental conditions as economic growth accelerated, the
CAS called for measures to ensure that environmental issues were addressed adequately
inprivatizingthe largepolluting enterprises includedinthe privatizationprogram. By
the time the 2008 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was prepared, mostnon-
infrastructure SOEs hadbeen privatized, and environmental issues assumed lower
priority. The 2008 CPS concentrated on raising productivity and employment, improving
fiscal sustainability and absorptionof EUfunds, and social inclusion.loEnvironmental
protection continues to be a Government priority, but it i s to be supported by EUfunds.

5.2      The project was based on previous analytical work that prioritized environmental
problems inBulgaria. An EnvironmentalStrategy Study (FY93) and a Follow-Up Study
(FY95) identified five priority areas for Bank assistance, including reducing emissions o f
lead and other heavy metals from metallurgy plants, and minimizing contamination o f
drinkingwater and food suppliesby heavy metals andtoxic organic compounds. The
Pirdop-Zlatitsa area (the location o f MDK)was identified as a priority region. The
reports also recommended improvements inthe environmental management o f future
operations of industrial enterprises.l1

5.3      The relevance o f ERPP's design also was high. The designo fthe ERPP was to
be a model for handlingenvironmental legacy issues inprivatization -both for future
privatizations inBulgaria, and inother countries. A 2003 study o f environmental
liabilities inprivatizations inCentral Europe seems to validate the ERPP model, at least
interms ofinformationprovisionandremediationplanning.12 The studynotes that
foreign investors understandably are concerned about acquiring environmental liabilities;
half o f a sample o fNorth American and Western European firms surveyed reportedthat
they hadrejected potential investments inCentral Europe partly on environmental
grounds. Yet inthe countries studied(Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and the
Slovak Republic), information on site contamination was not often provided by
governments to potential investors. And although indemnification was often advocated
as a useful risk reduction tool, inonly a few cases didprivatization agencies do anything
butpass 100percent of environmental liabilitiesto new owners. Investors were left on
their own to find out about any site contamination problems and to negotiate with
privatization agencies as best they could.

5.4      The study indicatedthat providing informationto potential investors on past
environmental damage resulted inhigher privatization prices, and the impact was even
greater when the information was combined with site remediation planning. The
combination of environmental information and site remediationplans also was associated
withmore rapidprivatization. Moreover, environmental audits andremediationplanning
dramatically increasedthe chance that remediation actually occurred.

Efficacy

Objective 1: Reduce environmentalhazardscaused by pastpollutionandunsafe
environmentalmanagementpracticesat MDK: highlyachieved

5.5    The single performance target defined inthe PAD for this objective was achieved:
there were no accidental spills from the old slime pond. The slime pond was closed and a
monitoring system o f surface and groundwater i s inplace.

5.6    All elements o fthe emergency remediationprogram were concluded, andthe
clean-up ofpast environmental damage concluded with closure and consolidation of the
slime pond, clean-up o f old toxic waste and debris, andremoval o f contaminated material
from the site.

5.7    There is other evidence showing that environmental hazards have beenreduced:

      Discharges o f toxic metal leachate from the sludge tailings pond have been
      eliminated, resulting ina reduction intoxic metal levels o f adjacent surface waters.
      Water inthe Topolnitza River i s incompliance with Class 3 surface water
      standards.

      Sources o f groundwater contaminationwith heavy toxic metals and other inorganic
      pollutants have been reduced or eliminated.

      Soil contamination at the MDK site has been reduced or eliminated, resultingina
      reduction o f the heavy metal content of soils.

0     Toxic residue from the waste water treatment plant was safely stored.

0     The encapsulation and re-vegetation o fthe "blue lagoon" was completed.

Objective2: Facilitatingprivateinvestmentsinthe company: substantially
achieved

5.8    According to interviews with MDK management, over $100 million has been
invested since privatization to bringthe plant into environmental compliance and to
improve productivity. No information was available on the share o f investmentdedicated
to environmentalmanagement versus productivity enhancement, although it i s not always
possible to separate the two. While not all of the investments are attributable to the
ERPP, it is likely that the RPs and CPs contributedto MDK's decisions to invest.

Objective3: Contributingto improvementsinthe environmentalperformanceof
the plant: highlyachieved

5.9    Evidence collected duringthe PPARmission indicates that MDK i s currently in
compliance with Bulgarianenvironmental legislation.

                                                       17


       With respect to air pollution, the maximum ambient concentrations ofparticulates
       andsulfur dioxide are equal to or better than 1996 values andincompliance with
       Bulgarianstandards. Emissions from the 120-meter and 326-meter stacks are in
       full compliance.

       With respect to water pollution, discharges o fheavy metals and other pollutants
       into surface water are incompliance with Bulgarian standards.

5.10    According to a Project Beneficiary Survey conducted inlate 2002, environmental
conditions inPirdop and Zlatitsa improved duringthe project period. The majority o f
respondents said that air quality inparticular had improved significantly since 1998.
Local populations were better informed about environmental conditions as a result o f the
on-line environmental monitoring boards installed by MDK inthe two municipalities.
However, respondents complainedthat local people had limitedvoice over municipal
decisions about environmental issues.

Efficiency

5.11    Project efficiency was modest. On the positive side, interviews conducted during
the mission suggested that the remediation measures inthe EIA were cost effective, and
represented best practice even by today's standards. More extensive measures to
remediate contaminated soils, for example by excavating andmoving them to other sites
or incineratingthem, were not practical even for smaller sites.

5.12    Onthe negative side, the fact that the RP was not sufficiently detailed caused
implementationproblems later on. Quantities o f some pollutants turned out to be greater
than expected. For example, the area and depth o f contaminated soil were much larger
than estimated inthe EIA, so MDK and the coordinating agency (NTEF) had to re-
negotiate some o fthe technical specifications o f remediation measures. This ledto
implementationdelays as well as higher costs for some sub-components.                   l3

5.13    There were delays caused by the need to amend legislation and comply with new
procedures. The ERPP's implementation schedule had been based only on the estimated
time neededfor physical works. Extratime also was neededfor coordination with other
Ministries (e.g., the Ministryo f Forestry for activities on forested lands), and this hadnot
beenanticipatedinthe schedule. Finally, it was difficult for MDKto deal with the
Bank's procurement requirements, andthis also addedto implementationdelays. With
NTEF's assistance, procurement became less of a problem as implementationproceeded,

5.14    Mission interviews indicatedthat both M O E W and MDK considered the
implementationof ERPP to be "clumsy'y, and this ledto the decisionto simplify the
designo fthe EPSAL.




13Operational staff pointed out that it is unlikely that an EIA preparedbefore adetailedsite remediation
planis completedcould capture all possible impactsof construction,andthat weaknesses inthe EMwere
addressedduring project implementation.

                                            18


Outcome

5.15    Based on highrelevance, highachievement o f two objectives and substantial
achievement o fthe third, and modest efficiency, the outcome o f the ERPP i s rated
satisfactory.

Riskto Development Outcome

5.16    The risk that the ERPP's outcome will not be sustained is aegligibleAow. The
remediation measureshave beencompleted, and an after-care program was established
and continues to be implemented. MDKis incompliancewith Bulgarianenvironmental
regulations, and the company consistently has shown interest inmaintaining its
compliance record.

BankPerformance

5.17    The ERPP was not subjected to a QAG Quality at Entry (QAE) Assessment. This
PPAR finds that QAE was satisfactory. On the positive side, the ERPP was grounded in
analytical work and lessons learned from privatization and environmental remediation
projects inother countries. The institutional arrangementsfor implementation and
monitoring o f the ERPP were well planned. The monitoring and evaluation system
included relevant performance indicators as well as a system for monitoring
implementation o fthe remediation plan. However, the independent review o f the EIA for
MDKfound several weaknessesthat shouldhave beencorrected. Moredetailed
information inthe EIA, and more realistic estimates o fthe time needed to complete
remediation activities, could have reduced delays during implementation. For this
reason, the PPAR rating on QAE i s lower thanthe ICR Review's rating o f highly
satisfactory.

5.18    The quality o fsupervisionwas highlysatisfactory. Bank supervisionmissions
visited Bulgaria at least every six months and sometimes more frequently, and staff inthe
country office followed up betweenmissions. Bank procurement procedures caused
delays, but no more so than inmany other projects. Those interviewed duringthe
mission, including MDK management as well as government officials, praised Bank staff
for solving problems and keepingthe project on track.

5.19    Overall Bank Performance was satisfactory

Borrower Performance

5.20    Government performance was satisfctory. The Government was committed to
developing a method for dealing with environmental liabilities duringprivatization, and
ensuring that the environmental management o f new owners came into compliance with
Bulgarianregulations. Interviews conducted during the mission found some complaints
about communication between the Government and MDK, especially duringthe early
partof implementation.

                                             19


5.21      Implementing Agency Performancealso was satisfactory. Ittook some time for
working relationships to develop betweenthe MOEW, the Project Coordination Team at
NTEF, and MDK,but these improved over time. By the endof 2000, NTEF's
performancehad improved significantly, and coordination with MOEW had improved.
Mission interviewees praisedNTEF for its role innegotiating amendments to the
remediationplanwhenneeded.

5.22      Overall Borrower Performancewas satisfactov, The ICR Review rated
Borrower Performancehighly satisfactory, basedon the high level of competence and
commitment of boththe Government andthe implementing agency. However, as noted
above, the PPAR mission found evidence of problems with communication and
coordination thatjustify a satisfactory rating instead.


6.        Ratings: EPSAL

Relevance

6.1       The EPSAL's objectives were highlyrelevant. As withthe ERPP, the EPSAL
benefitedfrom strong analytical work prior to project preparation. Appropriately, it
reachedbeyondthe goal of addressingenvironmental issues inprivatization to address
the broader policy and institutional framework for environmental regulation and
compliance, consistent with EUaccessionrequirementsthat Bulgaria neededto meet. It
sought to improve and mainstreamthe methodology pilotedinERPP for resolving
environmental liabilities inprivatization and improvingpost-privatization environmental
performance.

6.2       The relevanceofproject designwas substantial. The policy conditionality in
EPSAL was appropriateto support the harmonization of Bulgarian environmental
legislation with EUrequirements. However, the EPSAL aimed to acceleratethe
harmonizationof both laws andpractices. Comparedto the project's support for the
adoption of new laws andprocedures, too little emphasiswas placedon strengthening
implementation and compliance. EPSAL's designmight have benefitedby a
complementary technical assistance operationto buildMOEW's capacity for monitoring
and enforcement.

The EPSAL triedto simplify the implementation of RPs by using a sector policy support
loanrather thanan investmentloan as the Bank financing instrument. The choice of this
lending instrumentwas drivenby the Bank's desire to increaseflexibility, reduce
supervision time and costs, and avoid procurementproblems that plagued ERPP during
its first year. Insteadof disbursing against specific remediation expenditures, the loan
disbursedagainst achievement ofpolicy reforms, the signing of ExecutionAgreements,
and satisfactory progress on RPs andCPs. The problemwith this designwas that,
comparedto the ERPP, the Government lost some control over the RPs and CPs, making
it less likely that they would be completed. The Regionnotedthat regular monitoring of
the RPs underEPSAL was carried out during implementationandcontinuedafter release

                                              20


o f the thirdtranche. CPs were linkedto the issuance o f IPPCs, and sanctioning o f
enterprises for non-compliance followed the law o f the land.

6.3      While the rationale for choosing a more flexible designwas understandable, the
achievement of EPSAL's environmentalobjectives would have been more likely if
project designhad included strongermonitoring along with firmer enforcement to ensure
that new owners completedtheir RPs and CPs. The designalso would have been
strengthened by a greater focus on improving efficiency inMOEW. A parallel technical
assistance loan might have addressedthese institutional issues.

Efficacy

Objective 1: Achieve environmentalimprovementsand supportthe privatizationof
highlypollutingenterprises: modestly achieved.

6.4      The performance indicators defined inthe P A D included(i) satisfactory execution
o fthe RPs for privatized enterprises, (ii)compliance with water and air emissions
requirementsspecified for each enterprise inthe CPs, and (iii)  improvements inthe
environmental quality indicators specified inthese Plans.

6.5      Table 6.1 shows the status o f implementation o f RPs and CPs for each o fthe six
enterprises financed under the EPSAL, based on information provided by MOEW during
the IEGmission. Bearinginmindthat the EPSALclosedmore thanfive years ago, the
RPs for only three o fthe six enterprises (Assarel Medet, Sopharma, and Neochim) have
been completed. O fthese three, two (Assarel Medet and Sopharma) show improvements
inall or most o fthe environmentalperformance indicators intheir CPs; the
improvements inperformance o fNeochim are mixed.

6.6      The other three companies (Lukoil-Neftochim, Agropolychim, and Kremikovtzi)
have not completedtheir RPs:

       Agropolychim has made the most progress o f the three, completing three o f its six
       planned tasks and spending 84 percent o f the planned costs. During
       implementation, however, Agropolychim refused to implementits RP, so the
       Government appointed a contractor and is managing the implementation o f the
       Plan.

       Lukoil has spent only 23 percent o f its budgetedamount for remediation for seven
       o fthe fourteen tasks inthe RP, and data on environmental performance i s
       unavailable.

      Kremikovtzi has implementedonly one o f its six tasks, and spent less than 0.5
      percent o fthe budgeted amount for remediation. At present, Kremikovtzi i s in
      bankruptcy proceedings, has ceasedproduction, and continues to operate at only a
      minimumlevel while a sale is pursued.

Objective2: Reformingenvironmentallegislation: highJy achieved

6.7     Annex C shows the policy andregulatory reforms supported by the EPSAL.
Some o f these changes were necessary to clarify responsibilities for past environmental
damage inprivatization, while others (the Water Act and the Subterranean Resources
Act) had wider application. The policy reforms supported by EPSAL were:

      Amendmentsto the PrivatizationLaw andthe EnvironmentalProtectionLawto
      clearly exempt the buyers o f SOEs from liability for past environmental damage.

      Clarification o fprocedures and financing mechanisms for addressing State liability
      inprivatizations.

      Parliamentary approval o fthe Water Act: The new Water Act established a
      comprehensive legal framework for environmentally and economically sustainable
      use o f water resources based on river basinmanagement principles.

      Parliamentary approval o fthe Subterranean Resources Act. Previous legislationo f
      subterranean resources did not properly regulate the way past contamination was
      addressed at disposal sites and tailing ponds. The new law addresses ownership
      rightsfor extraction o f subsurface waters and sets up administrativeroutines, and a
      permit process for exploration and miningor extraction includingan assessmentof
      the impact o fthese activities on the environment.

6.8     The Government's program o f environmental policy andregulatory reforms was
substantially drivenby the requirements o f EUaccession. Under the association
agreement with the EUsigned in 1995,Bulgaria committed to bringits legislationinto
compliance with EUenvironmental laws and to establish a modern environmental
management system.l4The Bank supported and accelerated the reform process by
contributing analytical work and engaging inpolicy dialogue, as well as providing
financial support through the EPSAL.

Objective3: Establishinga consistentframeworkfor integratingenvironmental
issuesintoprivatization: substantiahyachieved

6.9     Most o fthe EPSAL conditions relatingto this objective were met, but one was
only partially met. The conditions were:




14Magda Lovei andBradford S. Gentry, "The Environmental Implications of Privatization: Lessons for
Developing Countries." World Bank DiscussionPaper No. 426 (2002), p. 55

                                               24


       Adopt guidelines for the scope and content o f past contamination damages (adopted
       before Boardpresentation, thus meetingthe condition for first tranche release).

       Prepare and approve RPs and CPs for the first set o f firms to be privatized (met as a
       condition o f first tranche release) and the second set o f firms to be privatized (met
       as a condition o f second tranche release).

0      Achieve satisfactory progress on the implementationo fthese RPs and CPs
       (partially met, see Objective 1 above).

6.10     Duringthe mission, the MOEW reportedthat the Governmentconsiders EPSAL
to have catalyzed the environmental remediation program beyond the scope o fthe
EPSAL itself. Including MDK and the six enterprises assisted under the EPSAL, a total
o f 22 enterprises have usedthe project's model o f environmentalremediation during
privatization.

6.11     However, the fact that three o fthe RPs supported by EPSAL have not yet been
completed suggests that some modifications o fthe procedures are inorder. Ina sense,
preparing and approving RPs and CPs is relatively easy as long as the required technical
work has beendone and all parties are inagreement. Incontrast, the experience o fthe
EPSAL suggests that achieving satisfactory progress on the implementationof the plans
i s more difficult. Interviews conducted during the IEG mission indicated that completion
o f the RPs was very dependent on the "goodwill" o f the enterprises. Better monitoring
andcompliance enforcement, along with incentives or sanctions to motivate completion
o f the RPs, might have resulted inbetter environmental outcomes.

Objective4: AcceleratingharmonizationwithEUenvironmentalrequirementsand
practices: modesflyachieved

6.12     The measures supported by the EPSAL included:

0      Develop (met for the first tranche) and pilot (met for the second tranche) IPPCs.
       and extendthemto at least 80 percent of all large enterprises (met for the third
       tranche). Infact, the Government exceeded the target by extendingIPPC
       implementation to other enterprises as well.

0      Increase institutional capacity for post-privatization compliance by establishing and
       maintaining an inter-agency coordinating body (IMEC) to oversee implementation
       o fthe environmental andprivatization program, including public consultation (met
       for first, second, and third tranche releases).

6.13     Although environmental laws and regulations have beenlargely harmonized with
EUrequirements, theharmonization o fpractices (implementation andcompliance) has
laggedbehind. At the institutional level, IEG's 2002 Country Assistance Evaluation
(CAE) for Bulgaria noted the fragmentation o f environmental responsibilitiesamong
government agencies, and IEGmissioninterviews suggest that the situation has not
changed significantly since the CAE was written. While water supply and sewerage are
under the Ministry o f Public Works, water resource management i s under MOEW. And

                                                   25


eventhough agriculture i s the biggest user of water, and water pollution levels remain
high, the Ministry of Agriculture does not appear to coordinatewith MOEW or other
ministries. Within MOEW, although the capacity to formulate environmental policy and
enforce legislation andtaxation has improved since 1995, its capacity to analyze and
evaluateresults remainsweak.l5

6.14     Recently, aproject inBulgaria was considered as apilot for the use of country
systems (UCS) for environmental and social safeguards. Preliminary analysis.by Bank
staff of the equivalence and acceptability16of Bulgarian environmental assessment
systems found severalimportant gaps betweenthe Bulgarian system andthe Bank's,
whichalso are relevant for assessingthe degree ofharmonizationwith EUstandards.
The Bank's team found that current requirementslack clarity or provide insufficient
detail inkey areas such as public consultation and disclosure, andthat there are
inconsistenciesbetweenthe Environmental ProtectionAct and the ordinance guiding
preparation of EIAs on requirementsfor analysis of alternatives. For the Bulgarian EA
systemto be considered acceptable, gap-fillingmeasures would be neededinseveralkey
areas: (i) consultation anddisclosure requirements,(ii) EIA decision making process,
                                                                 the
including review and clearance, and (iii)       minimummandatory guidelines for preparation
of quality EIA reports. Inaddition, the Bank team hadconcerns regarding Bulgaria's
implementation track record. Becausethe gaps identifiedwere so significant, the ideaof
pilotingUCS inBulgaria was dropped.

Efficiency

6.15     Not applicable to policy support loans.

Outcome

6.16     Basedon highhubstantial relevance, and on balance substantial achievement of
project objectives, the outcome of the EPSAL is rated satisfactory.

Riskto Development Outcome

6.17     The risk to development outcome is moderate. Continuation ofthe reforms has
been supportedby several successivegovernments, and the institutional changes made
underthe EPSAL havebeenmaintained. Maintenanceofthe policy framework also has
beensupportedby subsequent Bankpolicy support operations (PALSandFESALs), and
more importantly, by the need to remain harmonizedwith EUrequirements. IPPC
permits have beenextendedto enterprises beyond those covered under EPSAL.
However, as noted above, progress inimplementation and enforcement have lagged

16According to OP 4.00 (Piloting the Use of Borrower Systemsto Address Environmental and Social
SafeguardIssues inBank-SupportedProjects"), the Bankconsiders a country's environmental and social
safeguard systemto be equivalentto the Bank's ifthe borrower's system is designedto achievethe same
objectives and adhere to the same operationalprinciples as the Bank's, as set out inTable A 1 o f OP 4.00.

behindthe improvements inenvironmental legislation. For this reason, the PPAR rating
on Riskto Development Outcome is lower than the lowhegligible rating (highly likely
rating on Sustainability) inthe ICR Review.

BankPerformance

6.18    Quality at Entry was satisfactory. The choice of policy and regulatory reforms
neededfor privatization andremediationwere basedon analytical work andthe final
preparation and early implementation of the ERPP. Support for pilotingthe IPPC
addressedone of the key issues for harmonization of environmental policy with EU
requirements.

6.19    The choice of a sector policy support loan rather than an investment loan was
intendedto increaseflexibility and efficiency, but implementation actually was slower
than it was for the ERPP. The loan also meantthat the Government lost control over
remediation investments. Itwouldhave beenpreferable to strengthenenforcementor
introduce incentives for enterprises to completetheir RPs, as well as givingmore
attentionto monitoringandenforcementof CPs. Better monitoringand evaluation of
environmental and health outcomes would have improved project design.

6.20    The quality of Bank supervision was highlysatisfictory. The Bank's
involvement provided an independentvalidation ofthe estimatedcosts of remediation
which helpedinthe negotiation of privatization agreements. Feedback from anNGO
during the PPAR mission indicated that the Bank's involvement increasedtransparency
during preparation and to some extent during supervision. The MOEW reported that it
was pleasedwith the Bank's supervision, pointingto the Bank's constant dialogue, direct
contact with firms, site visits, and frequent supervision missions. The Bank's
involvement helpedclarify expectations on the part of boththe Government andthe
owners ofnewlyprivatized firms.

6.21    Overall Bank Performancewas satisfactory.

Borrower Performance

6.22    Government Performancewas satisfactory. The Government remained
supportive of the privatization andremediationprogram, met all of its commitments in
terms ofpolicy and regulatory reform and institutional arrangements, and budgetary
resources for implementing RPs.

6.23    Implementing Agency Performancewas moderatelysatisfactory. The Ministry
of Finance (MOF) was the lead agency responsiblefor overseeing EPSAL
implementation and the MOEW was responsiblefor technical oversight of individual
cleanup projects intandemwith MOF. Those interviewedduring the PPARmission
notedthat, incontrast to good performanceduring the ERPP, the performanceinthe
EPSAL was slower. They also reportedthat the responsibilities of the OC were unclear,
and some memberswere unqualified. As aresult, progress inimplementing the RPs and
CPs was mainly dependent on the motivation and goodwill of the companiesrather than
on the threat of serious sanctionsby the Government. This was compoundedby the

                                            27


persistent lack o f capacity inthe Regional Environmental Inspectorates. Incontrast to
these observations the interviewees praisedthe M O F for ensuringthat projected amounts
needed for implementation o f the RPs were appropriated inthe budget.

6.24   Overall Borrower Performance was moderatelysatisfactom



7.     Lessons

7.1    The experience o fthe ERPP andEPSAL suggests the following lessons for future
projects that attempt to address past environmental damage and improve environmental
performance inthe process o fprivatization.

e     A development policy loan supportingprivatizationwith environmental
      remediation should include strong measures by the Government to monitor and
      rewardcompliance (or punishnon-compliance) to ensurethat remediationand
      compliance plans are completed on schedule. Inthe EPSAL, eventhough all o fthe
      policy conditions were met and the RPs and CPs were signed, the achievements in
      terms of implementation o fthe plans, along with their environmental results, were
      mixed. Over-reliance onthe goodwill o fthe enterprises themselves was a risky
      strategy, as changes inownership, management, and financial performance stalled
      progress on remediation and compliance.

e     Eveninwell-prepared EIAs,it is difficult to include sufficient detail inthe
      technical specifications o fremediation investments. Modifications indesign and
      re-negotiations duringimplementation should be anticipated, and possibly reflected
      inalongerproject implementationperiodandhigher thannormal contingency
      funds.

e     Evenwhenthe State assumes responsibility for remediatingpast environmental
      damages o f SOEs, setting a cap on the State's liability creates risk for potential
      investors and delays during re-negotiations. The possibility o f letting the State
      assume more o f the risk for additional remediation costs shouldbe considered.

e     Harmonizing country environmental legislationwith international best practice i s a
      necessary but not sufficient condition for improved environmental performance. In
      development policy lending for environmental protection, more attention needs to
      bepaidto improving the country's implementation practices, track record, and
      capacity inenvironmental regulation. This i s likely to require carefully targeted
      technical assistanceto buildthe capacity o f national and sub-national
      environmental authorities. A parallel technical assistance loan, or a well-

      considered.

7.2    Several findings o fthis PPAR are relevant to IEG's ongoing evaluation o fthe
WBG's safeguard andsustainability policies. First, there were-difficultiesencountered in

                                             28


choosing an environmental classification for the EPSAL. Funds were not channeled
through financial intermediaries, butthe fact that not all o f the participating firms had
been identified at appraisal meant that the EIA requirements o f an "A" classification
could not be met. A modification o fthe classification criteria may be inorder.

7.3      Second, the PPAR was able to compare two projects with similar objectives but
different financing instruments: aninvestment loan (ERPP) and a DPL (EPSAL). Both
projects supported the process o fremediating past environmental damage inthe process
o fprivatization. While the DPL provided more flexibility thanthe investment loan in
terms o fthe selection o fparticipating enterprises andthe preparationand implementation
o f remediation and compliance plans, this flexibility came at the cost o f less control on
the part o fthe Government and the Bank over the completion o fthese plans. Future
DPLs inthis area needto build inbetter monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to
compensate for less detailed Bank and Government control over safeguards and
environmental compliance.

7.4      Finally, the EPSAL placedtoo little emphasis on the enforcement o f
environmentalregulations compared to its focus on the passage o f legislation. A greater
focus on institutional capacity, compliance monitoring, and sanctions for non-compliance
would have improvedthe likelihood o f achieving environmental outcomes. This finding
i s similar to one of the conclusions of IEG's 2008 evaluation of environmental
sustainability, namelythat the achievement o f environmental outcomes i s more elusive
thanthe achievement o fintermediate outcomes such as policyandinstitutionalreforms.
This calls for a greater focus on environmentaloutcomes, along with a more diligent
effort to develop andmonitor indicators to measure these results.

To your letter from May 20,2009

Regarding:Draft report from the Mission ofthe IndependentEvaluationGroup ofthe World
Bank (Independent EvaluationGroup) for evaluationof"Pilot Projectfor Remediationofthe
Environment inthe regionofMDK-Pridop" (EnvironmentalRemediationPilot Project, ERPP-

Dear M r s . Georgieva:

With regardto the above-mentionedand inview ofthe deadlinesspecified inyour letter (June 08,
2009) for submissionofremarks and comments relatedto the draft reportand inview of
reflecting them inthe final reportofthe missionas well as in compliance with the issues
discussedwith the representativesofthe Ministry of Environment andWater duringthe meetings
heldwithin the framework ofthe missionof the IndependentEvaluationGroup of the World
Bank(23-27 February2009), we would liketo expressthe following remarksandsuggestions:

    1. Intable 6.1, first line ("Assarel Medet" AD), the text "The company is currently ina
        procedure for issuanceof IPPCpermit" shall be replaced with the following text to read:
        "The Company is not liable to obtainan IPPC permit".

Motive:for the activity ofthe company ("Assarel Medet" AD) -Panagjurishte,an IPPC permit
issuance is not requiredon the grounds of chapter seven"Prevention of industrial pollution" ,
section11, IPPC permits, ofthe EnvironmentProtectionAct (promulgatedin State Gazette, issue
91/2002).
    2. We do not accept the statement reflectedinpoint 6.23. ``...Thoseinterviewedduring
        PPAR missionnotedthat, incontrastto its good performanceduring the ERPP, the

                                              37


       MOEW's performance inthe EPSALwas slower andless transparent.They also
       reportedthat the responsibilitiesofthe OC were unclear, and some memberswere
       unqualified...',.

Motives:

    0  The statements are rather serious andhave notbeendiscussedwith the representativesof
       the MOEWduringthe meetingsheldwith the IndependentEvaluationGroup ofthe
       World Bank atthe time ofthe mission organizedinthe period23-27 February,2009 and
       for that reasonthe MOEWdidnot havethe chanceto expressits opiniononthese
       statements.
    0  The responsibility/ staffofthe Supervisory Committee related to the implementationof
       the commitments undertakenunderthe agreement for the loan(EPSAL)have been
       regulatedwith a Decisionno.26/ 25 January, 2000 ofthe CouncilofMinistersfor the
       establishment of the Supervisory Committeeto ensure the technical supervision and the
       approval of eachstage of theprogramsfor remediation ofpast ecological damages of
       enterprises andprovision of supervision on the implementation of theprogram
       implementing the Loan Agreement (Environment andPrivatizationSupportAdjustment
       Loan) between the Republic of Bulgaria and the InternationalBankfor Reconstruction
       andDevelopment,a copy of which hasbeensubmittedto the WorldBank inan annexto
       the first report onthe implementationofthe loan conditions(for the perioduntil30
       September, 2000).
       After the closure ofthe loanin2004, the supervisionfunctions relatedto the continued
       implementationofthe programs for pastecologicaldamages,have beenundertakenby
       the staffofthe InterministerialExpertEcological Council(IEEC) ofthe MOEW,which
       hasbeenregulatedwith the Regulationsrelatedto the functions, the tasks andthe staffof
       the HigherExpertEcological Councilto the MOEW;
   0   As for the implementationofthe assumedcommitments underthe Loan Agreement for
       the support ofthe environment andthe privatization(EPSAL), in2008 was heldan audit
       from the Chamber ofAccounts ofthe Republic ofBulgariarelatedto the establishment,
       services andmanagementandutilizationofthe funds ofthe loan for the periodfrom
       March01,2000 till December31,2004. Duringthe audit (February 01,2008 - June 30,
       2008) as well as inthe report of the auditteam (No. 0700000308, acceptedwith a
       DecisionNo.212/ September25,2008 at a meetingofthe ChamberofAccounts) no
       inconsistencies, lack oftransparencyas well as not sufficientcompetency ofthe
       Supervisory Committeememberswas ascertained.

Consideringthe above-mentioned, we think that it is necessary, inthe text ofthe final reportto
take inmindthe above-mentionedstatement ofthe MOEW so that the maderemarks, suggestions
andspecifications are reflected.
