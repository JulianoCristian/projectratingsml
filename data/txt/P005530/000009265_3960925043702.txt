FIRST TURMLEONUICATIONS PROJCT
LOAN 1884 ON
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RIORLIGRTS
1l        The Government of Oman requested Bank assistance in financing Its
telecommunications sector development In February 1977.  The Bank's Initial
review of the sector saw an urgent need for immediate assistance in
preparing a development program for the sector. Funds from an ongoing
Technical Assistance Loan 985-OM were used for employing consultants for
this purpose.
2.        The Bank loan 1884-0K to General Telecommunications Organization
(GTO) of Oman supported the First Telecommunications Project which formed
part of the Sultanate's Second five-year plan 1980-1985, which was a slice
of the 1979-1990 Master Plan. The project aimed to expand services to meet
demand and to provide good quality domestic and international
commiuncations, The project also provided institutional aeasures to
establish appropriate technical and financial management systeus.
3.        The original estimated cost of the project ($97.2) was exceeded
by over 2001 due to a change in scope following the review of traffic and
demand. The additional cost was absorbed by GTO and loans from the
government, Arab Fund and Kuwait Fund. The actual cost overrun was only
24Z above the revised project cost.
4.        The project was completed in time, achieved all the physical
targets and mest of the operational targets. Thirty thousand new telephone
subscribers were connected, an increase of 91X over the original appraisal
target of 16,000. However, telex subscribers increased only by 1,000
against an appraisal figure of 1,800 subscribers. This shortfall of 60X
has been attributed to improper tariff structure and levels for this
service (para 4.03).
5.        During the project implementation the financial performance of
GTO was satisfactory with a rate of return higher than appraisal
estimates. At the end of 1985, the financial rate of return was 281
compared to an appraisal estimate of 11%. This performance, achieved
without a change in tariffs, Wad ma4nly due to higher telephone revenue per
subscriber connection than was estimated at appraisal (para. 5.03). The
financial position of GTO was also sound.



- vi. -
6.        Performance on accounts receivable improved modestly In the first
four years of the project, but took a turn for the worse in the last year.
This remains as one of the main weaknesses of OTO (para. 5.05).
7.        The Institutional performance targets set at appraisal have been
achieved. The sectoral objective of establishing a fully government owned
telecommunications organisation was met. Appropriate management systems
have been Installed and a commercial accounting system Is in place. There
has been considerable effort in training of Omanis for technical and
managerial positions. The dependence on expatriate staff has decreased at
the top management level. All senior managers except the Finance Manager
are Omanis. However, dependence on expatriates at the middle management
and technical levels has not improved.
8.        One lesson to be learned from this project is that with judicious
use of consultants and execution of turnkey contracts, project
Implementation can be achieved in tiue even when the manpower capacity of
the Borrower is insufficient. However, turnkey projects are on the average
25-50% higher in costs than supply only contracts.

GENERAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ORGANIZATION
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATION PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Ia INTRODUCTION
101      The General Telecommunications Organization (GTO) was established
on June 30, 1980 under Royal Decree 43/80. It was vested with the
responsibility of developing and operating all public telecommunications
services in Oman including international telephone and telegraph services.
The Civil Aviation and Defence departments as well as the National Oil
Company, Petroleum Development of Oman Ltd., operate their own
telecommunications facilities but also lease some circuits from GTO. The
Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones (MPTT) regulates the
telecommunications services within the country, allocates radio frequencies
for all services and licenses private radio installations. Until 1975,
public telecomunications services in Oman were operated by the British
company, Cable and Wireless (C&W). Between 1975 and 1980, the Oman
Telecommunications Company SAO, owned by the government and C&W, operated
and maintained the national and international telecommunications services.
1.02      The GTO is organized as a government owned commercial enterprise
under the overall direction of the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and
Telephones. It has an adequate administrative and financial autonomye GTO
is managed by the President who is the Chief Executive, and an ex-officio
sember of the Board of Directors, He is responsible for carrying out the
directives of the Board whose ex-officio Chairman is the Minister of Posts,
Telegraphs and Telephones.
1.03      The Bank has been associated with the telecommunications sector
in Oman since 1977 through an extension of an ongoing Technical Assistance
Project, Loan 985-OM granted to the Government of Omane Consultants were
employed at a cost of $75,000 for preparing the development program that
formed the basis for the first telecommunications loan 1884-ON, for $22
million. The terms of the loan included an interest rate of 8,25%, 4.5
years grace and repayment period of 5.5 years.
II, PROJECT PREPARATION ANY APPRAISAL
Preparation Appraisal and Negotiations
2.01      The Bank was approached by the Oman Government in February 1977
to finance the development of the telecommunications sector. A Bank
reconnaissance mission in Mew 1977 identified the need for technical



- 2 -
assistance to prepare a long-term (10-15 years) expansion program within
which a five-year medium term slice would be considered for Bank
financing. On Bank's suggestion, the Government of Oman agreed to deploy
undisbursed funds available in an ongoing Technical Assistance Loan 985-OM
granted to Oman for the Ministries of Agriculture, Transport and Economic
Planning* The Telecommunications component was Incorporated under
category 1: Specialists' Services - Economic Planning and Management. The
Bank assisted in preparing the terms of reference for the consultants who
started work in October 1977. They finalized preparation of a 12 year
development program 1979-1990, in March 1979.
2.02      The appraisal mission visited Oman in June 1979, reviewed the
overall 1979-1990 telecommunications development program and recommended a
loan of $15.0 million for the 1980-1985 slice to finance 252 of the
prQjectts foreign exchange cost.
2.03      Prenegotiations were held in Muscat, Oman, during the period of
February 17 to February 24, 1980 mainly to discuss Government's decision on
full ownership of OMANTEL and the new charter establishing the new
corporation. Negotiations were held in Washington on March 24 and 25,
1980. The proposed loan amount was raised to $22.0 million, 36% of the
project's foreign cost of $61.0 million. (Total project cost was $97
million). It was agreed that as a condition for Board presentation, the
charter establishing the new Corporation should have been published by the
Government.  The loan was approved on June 26, 1980, signed on
October 22, 1980 and became effective on May 1, 1981 (pars 3.01).
Eroject Objectives
2,04      The project had the following objectives:

(a) when there is cause to believe that funds available to the
Borrower will be inadequate to meet the estimated project
expenditures make arrangements to provide such funds; and
(b) cause all of its public agencies to settle promptly existing
arrears and to pay bills for telecommunications services
rendered by the Borrower within two months of the billing
dates (para 2.06 (b)).

The Government complied with all the covenants except it could not
effectively cause all pusblic agencies to settle their bills within two
months (para 5.05).
IIIo PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01      The loan effectiveness date was originally set for January 22,
1981, but this had to be extended to March 31, 1981 and then to May 31,
1981, basically due to delays in receiving: (a) legal opinion; and (b)
confirmation that the Board of Directors of GTO had approved the loan,
There were no special conditions set for effectiveness of the loan.
3.02      The loan became effective on May 1, 19819  By then GTO had
already employed the financial management consultant required in the loan
agreement and was evaluating bids for consultancy services required for
implementing the project.
Project Revision
3.03      The project was substantially revised based on recommendations of
the project implementation consultants. The scope of work was expanded due
to Increased demand following revision of population estimates and economic
activity particularly for the capital area. The revised project was
approved by the Bank on January 22, 1982. The major changes included an
increase in:
(a) the number of exchange lines from 19,600 to 56,000 (185%);
(b) external line plant to meet the increase in exchange lines
in (a) above;
(c) telephone terminal equipment from 14,000 to 54,000 (286Z);
(d) the number of PC0s from 350 to 370;
(e)  telex terminals from 1,800 to 3,800; and
(f) consultancy services, construction of buildings, motor
vehicles, test equipment, furniture and fittings to
correspond with the increase in (a)-(e) above;
Details of the revised project are given in Annex 2.
Implementation Schedule
3.04      The original implementation schedule was fiscal years 1980-1985.
The implementation schedule showing planned and actual dates is given in
Annex 3. The project was completed in time despite start-up delays caused
by:



- 5 -
(a) OTOIs decision to defer calling for bids until they had
appointed consultants who would finalize the bidding
doceumnts as well as assist in the bid evaluation and
supervision of contracts;
(b) ongoing changes in OTO's organization structure and charter;
(c) absence of one of the key managers (manager for planning and
projects) who had left the country for 12 months training;
and
(d) OTO's impending decision to chang from crossbar to
electronic telephone ewitching.
Other causes of delay were:
(c) incrse in the scope of work; and
(b) delays In construction of buildings and in the completion of
outside plant due to changes in design to comply with
governmat regulationse
eporting
3.05     GTO submitted quarterly progress reports regularly, financial
statements and audited accounts were also submitted within the period
allowed for in the loan agreement.
Procuremnt
3.06     Only two mjor problems were enountered during the procurement
of equipment and material for the project. The first problem wae on the
criterion ued to.aard contracts. The bLd was issued in five packages
with bidders having the option to quote for an or all the packages. The
packages were:
(1) switching plus junction network for the capital area;
(il)  outside plant cables and conduits;
(iii)  FDM microwave radio and multiplexing equipmnt;
(iv)  telephone instrumnts;
(v) digital coaxial cable systems.
The bids were evaluated by consultants who reco_uded combination of
package I and V and for each of the resultant four packages they gave a
sbort lst of suppliers whom GTO could conduct discussions with to seek
furtber clarifications on technical and price issues, The lBak reviewed
the consult a  s' evaluation report and indicated that if OTO decided to
place contracts with the lowest evaluated bid for each package, then the



-6-
procurement would conform with the Bank's procurement guidelineso  Out of
the short lists, two offers for each package were presented to the GTO
Board for approval. The Board decided that a complete package offer be
obtained from four of the short listed bidders and award be made to the
bidder with lowest evaluated complete package. The GTO proceeded with
restricted tendering from the four bidders without seeking Bank
concurrence. The quotations were evaluated again by the same consultants
and based on their recommendations the Board decided to award the total
package to the successful bidder. GTO issued a letter of intent to the
successful bidder without prior consultation with the Bank. GTO then
sought Bank clearance for the contract with the sele^ted bidder. The Bank
rejected GTO's contract on the grounds that the rebidding was inconsistent
with Bank's procurement guidelines mainly because it called for proposals
from only four suppliers excluding all others who had bid in response to
the original bid invitation. Instead the Bank proposed to GTO that it
would be prepared to finance a contract to the extent of the Bank loan for
any of the original five packages if awarded to the lowest evaluated
bidder, selected with the Bank's concurrence, on the basis of the initial
bids. Since the finally selected bidder for the total package was in fact
the lowest evaluated bidder for package I, on the basis of the initial
bids, GTO agreed to split the contract and the Bank agreed to finance the
foreign portion of package 1 - switching and junction equipment for the
capital area, awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder in the original bids.
3.07      The second problem was regarding currency of the bid.  The
contract was signed in Deutsch marks (DM), currency of the bid, with
payments to be made in dollars at fixed rates agreed during contract
negotiations. The Bank rejected this arrangement with the reason that the
bidder had to exercise the option between his own currency and the dollar
at the time of submission of the bid and not Pt any later date. GTO argued
that payment in dollars at the agreed rate would lead to mejor savings to
GTO because the DM was appreciating relative to the dollar. Following
protracted correspondence and visit by Bank's procurement advisor to Oman,
the Bank agreed after being convinced that GTO would gain financially by
such an agreement.
Project Costs
3.08      A detailed comparison of the appraisal estimates, the revised
estimates and the actual costs are shown in Annex 5 and summarized in Table

The scope of the project was substantially increased leading to a cost
increase of 1731. The actual costs were 24% above the finally revised
estimates, This cost overrun was due to underestimation in the revised
estimates. The additional costs were absorbed by GTO and loans from the
Government, Arab Fund and Kuwait Fund.
Disbursements
3.09      The estimated and actual disbursements on cumulative basis for
the loan were as in Table 3.2 below.

Performance of Consultants. Contractors and Suppliers
3011      In the loan agreement GTO was required to employ consultants to
assist in the design, specifications and implementation of appropriate
management systems. Two consultants were mployed; a financial expert for
three years and a technical expert for two years.
3.12      GTO also decided to employ consultants for review and
implementation of the project including finalizing bld documents, bid
evaluation, and supervision of contractse One consultant was engaged to
Implement the works on the capital and -ral areas. Another was engaged to
implement works in the Salalah area.
3.13      The project was executed on turikey basis with suppliers
installing and commissioning the equipment. Civil works for external cable
network and buildings was done using local consultants.
3.14      The performance of consultants, suppliers and contractors was
satisfactory.

IV* OPERATING PERFORMANICE
4.01      Physically, all equipment in the project was installed as planned
and is operating satisfactorily; details of physlcal achievements are shown
in Annex 2. The actual additional DELS connected during 1982-84 were less
than appraisal estimates due to over estimation of plant that would be
available during these years. Connection rate substantially exceeded
appraisal estimates after plant installation at the end of 1984, as
indicated in the performance indicators in Table 4.1 below and detailed in
Annex 8.

4.02      The project aimed at satisfying expressed demand at the end of
the project. The appraisal demand figures at the end of the project were
revised from 38,600 lines to 69,000 lines. At the end of 1985, the
number of DELs had increased from 15,000 lines at the time of appraisal, to
41,000. Enough exchange capacity (74,000) has been installed to meet all
expressed demand now. The exchange fill at the end of 1985 was low, 55%,
but this is expected to rise to 80% by the end of 1987.
4.03      Telex demand was expected to grow at 25% during implementation of
the project and at the end of the project the number of telex subscribers
was expected to be 1,800. A figure of 1,500 subscribers was achieved which
is about 17% below appraisal target. The demand for this service has
fallen below expectation due to improper tariffs (levels and structure)
which have made prospective subscribers opt for cheaper facsimile service.
The GTO is currently studying recommendations from consultants on revised
tariff levels and structure for this service.

Quality of Service
4e04      The overall quality of service for domestic and international
service is good. Although the appraisal report did not set performance
indicators for the quality of service, the performance improved
substantially during the implementation of the project.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

5.02      GTO's financial performance was satisfactory.  The actual
operating revenue figures were much higher than appraisal estimates due to
the large increase in the scope of the project and the subsequent increase
in revenue generating assets. Despite an expanded scope of work, the rate
of return on average net fixed assets has been well above the covenanted
rate of 101 after 1981.  This has been achieved without an increase of
tariffs. Although actual operating expenses were higher than appraisal



- 12 -
estimates, mainly due to a much higher rate of expansion than estimated,
the actual operating ratio has been lower than estimated at appraisal. In
1985 the operating ratio was 59% against an appraisal estimate of 73Z.
5.03      The actual revenue per DEL was substantially higher than
estimated at appraisal mainly due to an increase in the economic activity
of Oman due to oil, and expansion of the network which generated more
traffic for each DELe The appraisal report underestimated the impact of
oil on the economic activities in Omano During this period the GNP per
capita rose from $4,930 in 1980 to $6,230 in 1985.
Financial Position
5.04      Other than accounts receivable, GTO's financial position has been
satisfactory. The estimated and actual balance sheets (FY1980-1985) are in
Annex 10. As of December 31, 1985, GTO's total net fixed assets amounted
to RO 104 million, some 320% higher than at December 31, 1980. The total
net fixed assets were higher than appraisal estimates (by 651) due to the
increase in the scope of project (para 3.03).
5.05      Performance on accounts receivable improved steadily during
1980-1983, but took a turn for the worse during 1984-1985. The covenanted
target of 60 days at the end of 1985 could not be realized. The accounts
receivable at the end of 1985 were 124 days and this remains GTO's weakest
area. More than half of the accounts receivable are due from the
government and its agencies. During appraisal for the second
telecommunications project this issue was thoroughly discussed and
assurances were obtained from the government that it will undertake to
cause all of its agencies, no later than December 1987, to pay bills for
telecommunications services rendered within two months of the billing
dates. GTO also intends to improve the accounts receivable by cutting its
billing cycle from quarterly to monthly by more computerization of its
billing process.
5.06      The current ratio remained within estimated value of three in
four years of the project (1980-1983). In 1984 and 1985 the ratio fell to
one (against an appraisal estimate of two), with liquid resources rundown
to finance the expanded works program. This will need to be closely
watched under the second project. There was also a significant increase in
the debt/debt + equity ratio in the last two years of the project due to an
increase in long-term debt secured to finance the expanded program. The
debt/debt + equity ratios in the two years were 23/77 and 30/70
respectively against appraisal figures of 19/81 and 16/84 respectively.
5.07      Despite a more than twofold increase in borrowings, the debt
service coverage was only marginally lower than appraisal estimates mainly
due to substantial increase in internally generated funds. The actual
figure for the debt service coverage at the end of 1985 was five compared
to an appraisal figure of six. The statements of sources and applications
of funds are given in Annex 11 and summarized below in Table 5.2. The
working capital was much lower than appraisal estimates due to increased
investment program and overreliance on internally generated funds to
finance the expanded program.

VI.  INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
6.O1      During appraisal in July 1979, public telecommunications services
were operated and maintained by Oman Telecommunications Company, SAO
(ONANTEL SAO) formed in 1975. The Government, through MPTT, owned 60% of
OMANTEL SAO shares, the remaining 402 were owned by Cable & Wireless Ltd.,
a British private company.
6.02      The Government took full ownership of OMANTEL SAO and established
General Telecommunications Organization (GTO) by Royal Decree of
May 6, 1980, effective from July '.. 1980. GTO was created as a fully
government owned entity under the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and
Telephones (MPTT), It is directed by a seven member Board of Directors,
directors whose chairman is the Minister of NPTT. The President of GTO is
an ex-officio member of the Board. GTO enjoys considerable autonomy. It
hae the authority, in coordination with the Ministry of Finance on fiscal
matters, to determine GTO's development policy, investment program, annual



- 14 -
budget, borrowings, organization and staffing. Tariffs are subject to
cabinet approval. OTO's day-to-day affairs are administered by the
executive president, assisted by three general managers and three
managers. This structure has remained basically the eams during the
implementation of the project save for one change made in 1984 to bring it
into line with the rapidly expanding network; the functions of the
manager, transmission and manager, telephones, were merged under the
functions of the new manager of operations and maintenance.
6.03      The management and control of GTO has improved remarkably during
the implementation of the project. The Bank recommended the employment of
two consultants, one with technical, and the other with financtal
background. These consultants were employed ant through these budgeting
and control systeme have been established, management information has been
structured, and as a result the Information provided to management is now
relevant, systematic and regular.
6.04      While GTO's management is presently capable of efficiently
administering the present organization, the decision making structure is
highly centralized and GTO together with the Bank are addressing this issue
in the second project. Consultants have already been appointed to propose
a suitable organization structure and their report is being reviewed by
GTO. Nevertheless, GTO has a strong and stable management team which has
contributed to the continuity and effectiveness of the organization.
Staff Recruitment and Training
6.05      The number of staff grew at an average of 10% during the project
(from 1,200 at the end of 1980 to 1,900 at the end of 1985) with the number
of staff per 1,000 DELa falling from 80 at the start of the project to 46
by the end of December 1985, which was better than appraisal estimates of
53. This was a commendable achievement.
6.06      Although one of the Government's objectives of telecomunications
development was to implement a training program to achieve as rapidly as
possible total "Omanization' of the staff of GTO this has not been possible
mainly because:
(a) the requirement for qualified staff has grown due to rapid
expansion of the network; and sech staff are not available
locally.
(b)  the shortage of Omanis with the basic qualification for
training limits the potential for upgrading lower c.adre
staff to technical status. Training with the objective of
"Omanization" remains the single most important issue in the
GTO. This issue is also being pursued wtder the second
project.
6.07      Despite the above problems GTO has made commendeble effort to
train Omanis for technical and managerial positions. Intensive training
was conducted both within the Sultanate and overseas. Except for the



- 15 -
manager finance, all top level management positions are filled by Omanis,
In the middle management and technical levels there is still a high
proportion of expatriate (about 60-70 Z) staff.
Accounting
6.08   '  OTO changed over from cash accounting to commercial, accrual
accounting in January 1981, GTO has maintained records adequately to
ref j.p¢t the ,perations and financial condition as stipulated in the project
agreement. Remarkable improvements have been made in budget preparation
processes and control procedurese Improvements in cash management and
stores control have also been affected. GTO produces its annual accounts
In time; within three months after the end of the fiscal'year compared to
four months stipulatedin the loan agreement. The quality of the accounts
is satisfactory. Computerization of accounts as part of an integrated
financial system is currently under implementation under the second
, telecommunications project.
Audit
6.09      GTO has been employing independent external auditors throughout
the project as required by the project. Audited accounts are issued on
time. The accounts for 1984 and 1985 were issued within six months as
covenanted.
Tariffs
6.10      There were no changes in tariff levels and structure during the
implementation of the projecto However, a tariff study was agreed to under
the second project aimed mainly at addressing the structure.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The project achieved and in most cases exceeded the objectives
set at appraisal, The targets for expanding and improving service were
exceeded (para 3LIN). Annex 13 compares performance indicators
anticipated at appraisal with actuals. Organizationally the OTO performed
satisfactorily. The GTO has established a sound financial and accounting
system and laid the base for an appropriate management information system.
Project Spin-off
7002      There was no special spin-off from the project.
Least Cost Solution
7.03      GTO adopted the design of systems and components which provide
least cost solutions as determined during the project preparation and also
during project implementation. Specific actions include adoption of
digital technology for the switching systems and application of modern
practices for the outside plant.

Rate of Return
7e04      The rate of return for the project (investment program 1980-1985)
was 17% (Annex 14)o The rate estimated at appraisal was 181. The rate of
return, though a fair estiUate of measureable economic benefits does not
capture all project externalities and understates the overall economic
benefits of the project such as the consumer surplus. It also does not
capture the effect of network deterioration that would have resulted if the
project was not implemented. The rate of return Is ,therefore, actually
better than 17%.
nIIf.  BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01      The overall Bank performance in this project has been good.
Right at the onset the Bank identified basic problems in the
telecommunications entity including lack of plans, lack of engineering and
commercial accounting systems, overdependance on expatriate personnel and
financial operating losses. The Bank embarked on solving some of these
problems even before appraisal. Through an ongoing TA project to the
Government, consultants were hired to prepare a long-term plan (10-15
years) for OMANTEL (now GTO), which formed the basis of the appraisal
report. There was serious underestimation of demand in this plan which, on
hindsight could have been reduced with closer coordination with Government
planners. The Bank assleted in preparing terms of reference, recruitment
of the consultants and quality control of their work. After appraisal the
Bank played a similar role in the emploryent of consultants to set up
engineering and commercial accounting aystems and to implement the
project. GTO leaned heavily on the Bank in identifying suitable
consultants. The Bank also rendered nich needed technical and financial
advice required in the formative years of GTO and continues to do so.
8.02      The Bank dealt with the processing of bid documents promptly; bid
documents and bid evaluation reports were in fact reviewed in Oman to speed
up the process. Some implementation delays were caused due to GTO's
nonfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement guidelines (para 3.06), but
these delays were not significant. Nevertheless, the issue on currency of
payment could have been resolved much faster than it was, (it took four
months, para 3.07).
Supervision
8.03      The Bank performed well in supervision.  A total of 13
supervision missions were conducted during the implementation of the
project.  These missions were adequate. Through regular supervision
missions, the Bank monitored project implementation very closely and took
appropriate actions when the need arose. GTO sent regular quarterly
reports which helped supervision.



- 17 -
Working Relationship
8.04      The working relationship between GTO and the Bank was good.  The
procurement issues strained relations slightly mainly because GTO was not
familiar with the rationale behind the Bank's procurement guidelines.
The present working relationship (on the Second Telecommunications Project)
is excellent.
IXo CONCLUSIONS
9.01      There were no major problems encountered in this project.
Project start-off was delayed mainly due to lack of sufficient staff within
GTO to prepare and implement the project. After employment of consultants
project implementation proceeded smoothly except for minor procurement
delays caused by GTO's nonfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement
guidelineso The project has been implemented within the time estimated
during appraisal.
9.02      The objectives of the project were substantially fulfilled.
Through the project the telecommunications facilities have increased from a
density of 1.0 DELs per 100 people at the end of 1978 to 2.7 DELs per 100
people at the end of 1985 which was better than appraisal estimates. The
newly formed entit- (GTO) has developed into a well managed institution
following the installation of requisite management, technical and financial
systems through the project. The GTO has, as a result of the project,
become one of the most viable public institudions in Oman.
9.03      The problem of overdependance on expatriate staff still remains.
The proportion of expatriate staff at middle management and technical
levels still remains high. This problem, although being addressed in the
second project, is going to exist for some years to come because GTO's rate
of expansion of physical facilities far outstrips the rate at which local
trainable staff are being turned out from academic and training
institutions in Oman and outside Oman.
9.04      One lesson to be learned from this project is that with Judicious
use of consultants and execution of turnkey contracts, project
implementation can be achieved economically within time. Although this may
appear costly in the short run, the long-term benefits far outweigh the
disadvantages. There is, therefore, a need to instill this fact to our
borrowers especially those with inadequate trained staff,

Return on Investments
1.        The benefit period of the program extends from 1980-2005 when on
average the equipment provided under the prograt is expected to have
substantially completed its useful life,
2.        All costs and benefit streams have been expressed in 1979 prices0
3.        Actual capital cost streams are based on the project as actually
implemented 1980-1985.
4,        Actual operating cost streams are calculated by multiplying
Incremental subscribers due to the project by average cost per connected
subscriber connections were projected over the period 1980-1985 at appraisal,
but actually occured/will occur during 1980-1987.
5.        Actual benefits are calculated as follows:
(a)   the revenues derived from additional subscribers only measured
by tbhe number of such subscribers multiplied by the average
revenue per subscriber,
(b) with the additional revenue earned from existing subscribers
which could not have been obtained in the absence of the
project.
6.        The cost-benefit streams at appraisal were summarized as follows:

Sensitivity Analysis
1) Assuming 10% increase in operating cost IRR - 14.3%
2) Assuming 10% decrease in operating revenues IRR -12.47
3) Assuming (1) and (2) together IRR - 9.1%
C. The assumptions made in the sensitivity analysis are unlikely to happen
unless there is severe depression in the economy which could be
triggered by a slump in oil prices.
