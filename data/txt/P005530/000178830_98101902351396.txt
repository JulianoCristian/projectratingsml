Project
Description:        The proposed project consists mainly of the works included
in the first three years of the first phase (1980-1985) of
OMANTEL's 1979-1990 development program and includes the
installation of: (a) 15,700 new direct exchange lines
(DELs) and the replacement of 3,900 lines of obsolescent
equipment; (b) ducts and main cables to provide for about
16,000 new DELs and capacity for future growth; (c) tele-
phones for about 14,000 new subscribers and about 5,500
new private automatic branch exchange (PABX) extensions;
(d) about 350 public call offices to be located in both
urban and rural areas; (e) about 6,000 lines of switch-
ing capacity in new private branch exchanges; (f) inter-
national and national switching and transmission systems;
(g) switching and miscellaneous equipment to increase
the automatic telex network to about 1,800 subscribers;
(h) construction of buildings, provision of motor vehicles,
training and testing equipment, and furniture and fittings,
and (i) consultants' services and technical assistance to
strengthen the management, training and engineering
capabilities of OMANTEL. For this purpose two experts
(one with technical and one with financial background)
would be retained by OMANTEL for about 2-1/2 years, at an
average man/month cost of $8,500, including international
travel and subsistence. Benefits resulting from the
proposed project are expected to be felt, directly or
indirectly by all segments of the Omani society. The
proposed project presents no special risks.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO OMAN TELECOMMUNICATION CORPORATION (OMANTEL) WITH THE GUARANTEE
OF THE SULTANATE OF OMAN FOR A FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Oman Telecommunication Corporation (OMANTEL) with the guarantee of the
Sultanate of Oman for the equivalent of US$22 million, to help finance a First
Telecommunications Project. The loan would have a term of 10 years including
4-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8.25 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Oman:  Current Economic Position and Prospects"
(2528-OM) based on the findings of a mission which visited Oman in January
1979 was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 16, 1979. An
updating mission visited Oman in April 1980. The main findings of both
missions are given in the following paragraphs. Country data sheets are
attached in Annex I.
3.        Prior to 1970, Oman was a traditional society which had not been
exposed to the impact of the modern world. Since July 1970 when Sultan Qaboos
bin Said came to power, Oman has been undergoing major structural changes; in
the short span of eight years, economic infrastructure has been built up from
a very rudimentary stage and Oman has made impressive gains in education,
health and housing. Unprecedented increases in personal incomes and the rapid
expansion of public services have substantially improved the living conditions
of the Omanis, particularly those in the urban centers. These improvements in
the material welfare of the Omanis have been accompanied by a visible change
in the social structure and values. The pace of social change is, however,
much slower than that of the economic change, and century-old traits of a
traditional society persist. Income distribution in Oman remains highly
skewed. Oil revenue, the major source of income, accrues to the Government
and is channelled to the economy through public expenditures, mainly on
construction and purchases of goods. Thus, benefits from economic development
have, so far, gone mainly to a minority of the population in the urban centers,
with little impact in rural areas. During the same period, a modern government
comprising various technical ministries and executive agencies was created.
While no representative bodies exist in the country, the traditional tribal
and social structure is represented in the Government and allows a measure of
consultation. However, the Southern province of Dhofar was subjected since
1963 to a long period of guerilla warfare which was not ended until 1975.
4.        Prior to the commercial exploitation of oil in 1967, the Omani
economy was at a subsistence level based largely on agriculture and fisheries.
Although oil exports began in 1967, government expenditures remained at low
levels until 1970 and foreign exchange reserves accumulated. With the launch-
ing of major investment projects and increased civil and military spending,
the government expenditures rose by more than fivefold between 1969 and 1973.



- 2 -
The balance of payments and the Government budget turned into a deficit in
1972. There was a significant liquidity crisis in 1974 because of the rapid
growth of expenditure despite the sharp increase in the oil prices at the end
of 1973. Efforts to control rising budgetary deficits included introduction
of various administrative measures such as establishment of a planning organi-
zation and a tender board. The need for a rational long term approach to
development led to the preparation of the Five Year Development Plan, 1976-1980.
5.        The main objectives of the Five Year Development Plan, 1976-1980,
are to:
(i)  shift the concentration of investment from infrastructure
to income-generating projects, particularly in the sectors
of manufacturing, mining, agriculture and fisheries, in
order to supplement and eventually replace oil revenues;
(ii)  effect a wider geographical distribution of investment in
order to improve regional income distribution and reduce the
rate of migration to major urban centers;
(iii)  develop local human resources to increase Omani participa-
tion in the economic activity;
(iv)  achieve the basic requirements of a free market economy
with the private sector playing a leading role through
the provision of an appropriate legal and incentives
framework;
(v)  pay more attention to the development of water resources; and
(vi)  improve the efficiency of the government administration.
6.        The Plan projected an annual average GDP growth rate of 1.6 percent
and a GNP growth rate of 3.1 percent in real terms during the 1976-1980 period.
Higher GNP growth is due to the projected decline in factor service payments.
Fast growth in non-oil sectors, i.e. mainly agriculture and manufacturing, was
expected to more than offset the projected decline in oil production. In line
with declining oil revenue, government investment was projected to decline by
19 percent annually along with a sharp cutback in defense expenditures. With
a projected annual average decline in imports of 11 percent, the Plan projected
that current account of the balance of payments would be in surplus in 1980.
7.        During the first four years of the Plan, the Omani economy did not
attain several of the targets. Public investment declined faster than
forecast in the Plan mainly because of constraints in project preparation and
implementation in the productive non-oil sectors; the projected cutback in
defense expenditure was not achieved although it has decreased slightly in
real terms since 1976. Major projects highlighted in the Plan such as a
cement and a copper plant and an industrial estate suffered delays of up to
five years.



- 3 -
8.        Oil was the leading growth sector until 1977.  Oil output started
to decline in 1977; the annual average rate of decline was about 3.7 percent
during the 1976-79 period. While agriculture is the major source of income
for the majority of the population, its value-added accounts for less than 3
percent of the GDP. After two years of strong expansion in 1975 and 1976, the
construction sector has reflected the drastic slowdown in the development
expenditure begun in 1977. Oman's manufacturing sector is still small; it
accounted for only 1.5 percent of the GDP in 1979. Government services
continued to increase rapidly throughout the Plan period. Overall, there may
have been an annual average increase of 1-2 percent in the GDP in real terms
during the 1976-79 period.
9.        Oil revenue accounts for more than 90 percent of Government revenue.
Non-oil revenues, composed mainly of corporate income tax, customs duties and
income from public utilities have shown modest increases since 1976. Defense
expenditure accounted for about 60 percent of current expenditure during this
period. Civil recurrent expenditure rose by an average of 23 percent since
1976 while public investment declined rapidly. In 1977, in sharp contrast
to the previous years, an overall surplus of RO 72 million was registered.
It was caused by a substantial rise in grant receipts and shortfall in devel-
opment expenditures. In 1978, a deficit of only RO 45 million was incurred
compared with the budget estimate of RO 223 million; this largely reflects
lower expenditures than budgeted. Reflecting a 54 percent oil price hike over
1978 and a shortfall in budgeted development expenditures, the budget surplus
was RO 121 million in 1979. This has helped the Government to improve its
position vis-a-vis the monetary system by repaying almost all of the domestic
debt and increasing further its deposits with the banks. Similarly, Oman was
able to repay in advance a large part of external loans with relatively
hard terms. Oman's balance-of-payments reflects the performance of the oil
sector and public expenditure policy. The balance-of-payments showed deficits
between 1972 and 1976. Following a surplus which resulted mainly from a
record level of grant receipts in 1977, a deficit of $97 million was incurred
in 1978 as grant receipts fell sharply and capital account showed net payments
on external loans. In 1979, oil price increases brought an additional oil
export revenue of about $730 million. Furthermore, inflow of previously
conmmitted grants was at $150 million. Overall, the balance-of-payments
showed a surplus of $330 million in 1979. Consequently, net foreign assets
rose to $543 million at the end of 1979 (equivalent to 4.4 months imports).
10.       In 1980, the decline in oil output can be arrested as the technical
problems for the decline in the northern fields are solved and some of the new
southern fields are expected to come into production. The rest of the economy
particularly the construction sector is also expected to benefit from increased
oil revenue and Government expenditures. The 1980 budget provides for a 43
percent increase in overall Government expenditure. Because of absorptive
capacity, it may be difficult to reach the budgeted investment level in 1980
(RO 245 million compared with 1979 actual investments of RO 130 million).
Government oil revenue is expected to reach RO 1.05 billion in 1980. A
Reserve Fund has been recently created to which 15 percent of the oil revenue
and budget surpluses will be deposited. In 1980, in addition to 15 percent of
the oil revenue which will automatically go to the Reserve Fund, a budget



- 4 -
surplus of RO 200 million is anticipated. The Reserve Fund account thus, is
expected to reach RO 345 million (nearly $1 billion) by the end of 1980.
11.       Oman's long-term development objectives are basically those of the
Five-Year Development Plan. These objectives are expected to be reemphasized
in the next Five-Year Development Plan (1981-85) which is now under prepara-
tion. In view of the expected further decline in oil production after 1981,
the long-term prospects of the Omani economy depend on the country's capacity
to diversify its productive base in non-oil sectors, to shift the concentra-
tion of investment from infrastructure to productive sectors (i.e. agricul-
ture, fisheries, manufacturing) and to eliminate the two key constraints
which, so far, have hampered such diversification.  First, skilled manpower is
the most critical constraint: its scarcity at technical and professional
levels, and the limited effectiveness of expatriates in an administration
environment which cannot fully use them, is behind the lack of project prep-
aration, evaluation and implementation capacity which has been a principal
cause of the drastic decline in public investment since 1976. Alleviation of
this constraint would reduce the growing dependence on expatriate labor at
all levels. Second, the lack of clearly defined sector policies in agriculture,
fisheries and industry has severely hampered realization of the Plan's growth
targets.
12.       Although the limited natural resource base such as water and
minerals and the small size of the domestic market are further constraints
to diversification in agriculture and manufacturing, the growth potential in
these sectors needs to be exploited to the maximum. In agriculture, given the
present low crop yields in Oman, relatively large increases in yields appear
technically feasible through timely application of fertilizers, improved plant
spacing, weeding, pest and disease controls. In manufacturing, selected
import substitution industries for non-durable consumer goods and down-stream
copper products (from the copper mine expected to enter into production in
1984) would not only be feasible but would have a significant impact on the
balance of payments. In fisheries, the prospects are extremely good as the
fish resources off the country's 2,000 kilometers of coast are rich.
13.       Prospects for the oil sector are better than forecast previously.
Official estimates of Oman's proven oil reserves stood at 2.2 billion barrels
at the beginning of 1980; this would last about 21 years at the 1979 rate of
extraction. With the improved reservoir performance and the use of secondary
recovery techniques in the northern fields and the development of southern
fields, it is possible to maintain an output level of 350,000 bbl/d throughout
the 1980's (average output was 295,000 bbl/day in 1979).
14.       Bank projections given in Annex I which are based on the recent
developments and orientations of the Development Plan are intended to provide
an illustrative scenario. One of the important elements behind the projections
is the level of investment. Given the absorptive capacity constraints and
initial investment allocations for the 1981-85 Plan, non-oil investment is
assumed to grow at an annual average rate of 13.5 percent in real terms during
the next Plan period with emphasis given to productive sectors. Furthermore,



-5 -
a 7 percent growth in real terms is assumed for public recurrent expenditures.
With the assumption that the 1979 level of oil extraction would be maintained
until 1985, the projections show a real GDP growth of 4.2 percent during the
1981-85 period. The projections are based on a crude oil price of $32/bbl in
1980 and contingent on the oil price projections which assume an average
increase of 2.8 percent p.a. in real terms. The balance-of-payments based on
the foregoing assumptions show that the current account would produce increasing
surpluses until 1985 and possibly thereafter, despite rapid increase forecast
for factor service income outflows (workers' remittances and profit transfers)
in response to increasing investment levels. Rapid accumulation of reserves
would take place by 1985 in line with the "Reserve Fund" policy.
15.       In the case of a higher international inflation than assumed here,
accumulation of reserves would be less than projected. Similarly, higher
investment levels than assumed here would absorb some of the projected surpluses.
The above projections, therefore, point to the need that Oman could pursue a
balanced oil extraction policy which takes the country's absorptive capacity
into account, and should, at the same time, make all efforts to increase its
absorptive capacity for productive investments. As mentioned above, the
projections are merely illustrative; the actual pattern of oil production will
be determined, among other factors, by the public expenditure and development
policies to be adopted for the next five year Plan, 1981-85.
16.       In addition to the large but erratic inflow of grants, Oman has
borrowed since 1974 $904 million on a commitment basis (outstanding and
disbursed debt at the end of 1979 was $486 million) in order to finance its
defense and development expenditures. Loans from commercial banks accounted
for the major part of borrowing in 1974 and 1975 with relatively hard terms.
Concessionary borrowing in the recent years has softened the average terms
of Oman's external debt as the share of bilateral and multilateral loans
increased. In view of the economic prospects described above, the projected
external assistance requirements would be small. Oman's debt service was
16 percent of exports of goods in 1979 as a result of advance repayment on
most of the commercial loans.  The ratio of debt service payments to exports
of goods and non-factor services is expected to decline from 6 percent in 1980
to 2 percent in 1981, and remain around 1-2 percent thereafter. However,
unlike its borrowing needs, Oman's technical assistance and training require-
ments in the next decade will be significant. Scarcity of technical and
managerial manpower necessitates external technical assistance in economic
planning, project preparation, evaluation, and implementation as well as in
improving the organizational capabilities. Oman remains creditworthy for
continued Bank lending.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN OMAN
17.       Oman joined the Bank in December 1971, and has since received four
Bank loans totalling $24.95 million. Two were approved by the Executive
Directors in FY1974 (Education and Technical Assistance) and two in FY1977
(Highways Maintenance, and, Power and Water Engineering Studies). Annex II
contains a summary statement of these loans as of February 29, 1980 and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects. No loans were processed in FY1978
and FY1979 mainly because projects contemplated for these years were either
delayed or alternative sources of financing were obtained. In FY1979, IFC
approved a $2.0 million equity participation (representing 7 percent of the
shares) in the newly created Oman Development Bank (ODB).
18.       Although 1-1/2 years behind schedule, implementation of the Educa-
tion project proceeded satisfactorily and all schools financed under the
project became operational in September 1979. This project was part of
an integrated program of assistance by the Bank, UNDP and the United Kingdom.
The latter and UNDP/UNESCO financed technical assistance and overseas fellow-
ships.
19.       The second Bank loan, made in FY1974, provided $2.75 million for a
Technical Assistance Project to help finance three specialist teams fo? (i)
economic planning and management, (ii) agriculture and fisheries, and (iii)
transport. The work of these teams has been of considerable value to the
Government. The planning team prepared the country's first Five-Year Develop-
ment Plan, 1976-1980. The team continues to play a central role in economic
analysis and management of the country. In addition to introducing an aware-
ness of the financial constraints likely to be faced and shaping many of the
budgetary and fiscal procedures being followed by the Government, the team is
currently preparing the second Five-Year Plan (1981-85). The transport team
has provided advice to the Ministry of Communications in road transport and
development, and prepared feasibility studies which formed the basis of the
first highway maintenance project. The agriculture team, after a slow start,
assisted the Government in carrying out a program of tubewell drilling and
testing to determine water availability for developing larger farms near
Sohar and Saham. With the exception of the economic planning and management
team which continues its activities, the other two components have been
completed. At Government request, $75,000 was reallocated under this loan
for the preparation by consultants of a Master Plan for the development of
Telecommunications up to 1990, from which the proposed project is derived.
20.       Implementation of the Highways Maintenance and Training project is
proceeding satisfactorily, and its institution building impact is well recog-
nized by the Government. Under the Power and Water Engineering Studies,
consultants have completed their final reports covering electricity and water
supply development needs for the capital area in the near and long term, and
the water supply needs in a number of other towns and villages in northern
Oman. The consultants have also submitted their report on the organization of
the electricity and water sectors.

21.       All Bank financed projects have had important technical assistance
components and the Government has come to value increasingly the Bank's
technical advice. The recent increase in the oil prices has considerably
improved Oman's financial outlook and reduced the need for external financing.
The need remains strong, however, for strengthening of economic institutions
and for technical assistance in project implementation as well as in sectoral
policies. Further assistance is expected to be provided through the second
highways maintenance and training, and possibly through the proposed water
supply projects currently under preparation. In these projects, important
institution building and technical assistance would be involved.
PART III - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
22.       The Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones (PTT), which until
1978 was a Department within the former Ministry of Communications, is cur-
rently responsible for the regulation of telecommunications services. From
1939 until 1975, public telecommunications services in Oman were operated by
the British company, Cable and Wireless Ltd. (C&W), which was granted an
exclusive license to provide international telecommunications into and out
of Oman. In 1975, the Government of Oman acquired C&W's telecommunications
assets in the country and set up the Oman Telecommunications Company (OMANTEL
S.A.O) to operate and maintain all public national and international tele-
communications services.  C&W has provided limited management assistance to
OMANTEL S.A.O. and holds 40 percent of its shares; the Government holds
59.9 percent and the Central Bank of Oman 0.1 percent. On June 17, 1979,
under an agreement between the Government and C&W, the Government notified C&W
that it intended to acquire all C&W shares in OMANTEL S.A.O. and fixed July 1,
1980 as the termination date for the required twelve months notice. The
Government has also decided that on that date a new Government-owned company,
OMANTEL Corporation (OMANTEL), will be created to own and operate all tele-
communications facilities presently owned by the Government and operated by
OMANTEL S.A.O. The management, staff and net assets of OMANTEL S.A.O. will be
transferred to the new corporation. A Royal Decree providing for the creation
of OMANTEL on the basis of a specific charter has been signed. The charter
provides for a management structure which is substantially the same as that of
OMANTEL S.A.O. The corporation will be managed under the supervision and
control of a Board of Directors, chaired by the Minister of Posts and Tele-
communications, and composed of representatives of relevant ministries and the
President of OMANTEL who is its chief operating officer. The corporation is
authorized to borrow locally or abroad. The Government is held liable for the
corporation's net liabilities up to four times its capital.
23.       Responsibility for radio broadcasting and television services is
with the Ministry of Information and Culture which leases relay transmission
facilities from OMANTEL S.A.O. The Civil Aviation Department, the Defense
Department, and Petroleum Development Oman Ltd (PDO) maintain and operate
private telecommunication systems required to meet their specialized needs.



- 8 -
OMANTEL S.A.O. provides some leased circuits to these three entities and is
supposed to meet the telecommunications needs of all other government agencies.
Oman has no local telecommunications manufacturing industry and nearly all the
material requirements for the sector are imported. Most of the installation
work is contracted to foreigners. Operation and maintenance activities, as
well as telephone instrument installations, are covered by the staff of OMANTEL
S.A.O.
Telecommunications Services-Availability and Demand
24.       Because it is only recently that significant levels of telephone
service were introduced in Oman, access to telephone service is inadequate,
particularly in the rural areas. On May 31, 1979, there were about 10,700
direct exchange lines (DELs) in Oman of which, 67 percent were in the capital
area of Muscat, 15 percent were in the southern city of Salalah, and only 18
percent in smaller rural settlements. Oman's density of 1.9 telephones per
100 population coincides with the average for Middle East countries, and is
slightly above that for Africa and Asia, excluding Japan. Due to strong
demand and insufficient investment in the sector, there is a long list of
registered waiting applicants in the capital area and Salalah. Unsatisfied
demand is higher, however, since the number of potential subscribers remains
unknown in other cities and in rural areas where the network has not yet
penetrated.
25.       Of the existing telephones, 55 percent are residential and 45 per-
cent business. However, numerous residential telephones are used primarily
for business, due to past and current difficulties of obtaining connections in
the business districts. There are virtually no public call offices (PCOs) in
Oman and there is no domestic telegraph service in the country. The telex
network is currently manual and has about 350 subscribers. The recorded wait-
ing list is 150, but the unsatisfied demand is estimated to be considerably
higher. An automatic electronic telex exchange is being installed in Muscat.
The quality of the existing telecommunications service and the maintenance
standards are generally acceptable. There are, however, shortages of junction
circuits in parts of the capital area, and of national trunk circuits. This
situation causes congestion during working hours in local, long distance and
international calls.
26.       The registered demand for telephone service largely exceeds the
current supply. Based on the demand study that has been undertaken by the
team of Bank-financed consultants who prepared OMANTEL's Master Develop-
ment Plan for 1979-1990 (see paragraphs 28 and 29), overall demand for tele-
phones is expected to grow from 1979 to 1990 at an average annual rate of
about 14 percent. During the same period (1979-1990), the long distance
telephone traffic is estimated to grow at a rate of 35 percent from 1980 to
1981 and at 20 percent per year thereafter. The annual telex growth rate is
estimated at 25 percent over the next decade, declining to 15 percent per
year, in the late 1980s. Experience in similar countries regarding the growth
of demand for telecommunication services, and forecast changes in economic
activity and income level support the demand forecasts for Oman.

Sector Goals and Constraints, and the Bank's Role
27.       Telecommunications sector goals are in harmony with those of
national development plans which, by resolution of the Development Council,
are required to give priority to income generating projects in non-oil sectors
to supplement oil receipts, and to effect a wider geographical distribution of
investments in order that the benefits may be shared by different regions of
the country. There are two main thrusts in the objectives of the Government
for the sector. The first is to provide an effective national telecommunica-
tions service as a prerequisite to economic diversification. The second is to
establish OMANTEL as an efficient organization, with effective and competent
technical and financial management. This includes working towards Omanization
of management and operational staff as quickly as possible, becoming finan-
cially self sufficient within the next decade, raising necessary capital
through its own borrowings, improving the budgeting and control systems and,
training of its technical and middle management staff with the view to improv-
ing efficiency and enabling it to carry out installation works. The major
sector constraint in developing telecommunications services has been OMANTEL
S.A.O. which has had inadequate capacity to formulate technical and financial
development programs. This is mainly due to the short time OMANTEL S.A.O.
has been in existence and to its limited responsibilities under its past
Charter. The Bank's role in the sector started by assisting OMANTEL S.A.O.
through the preparation of terms of reference for consultants to prepare a
national telecommunications plan (see paragraph 29). The proposed project, by
helping the Government to strengthen OMANTEL is primarily focused on institu-
tion building and on providing independent technical and economic advice.
With the technical assistance proposed, OMANTEL is expected to have the
capacity to implement the project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The proposed loan of $22 million would be the Bank's first tele-
communications operation in the country. The proposed project was prepared by
OMANTEL S.A.O. with the assistance of consultants partly financed by the Bank
under the Technical Assistance Loan No. 985-OM of 1974, as amended in June
1978. The project was appraised in June 1979. Negotiations were held in
Washington in March 1980. The Omani delegation was headed by Mr. Noor
Mohammed, President, OMANTEL S.A.O. The main features of the project are
described in the Loan and Project Summary and in Annex III of this report.
The staff Appraisal Report entitled "Oman-First Telecommunications Project"
dated April 8, 1980 is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
Project Objectives
29.       The proposed project is part of the 1980-85 phase of OMANTEL's
twelve-year (1979-1990) Master Development Plan, which was accepted by the
Development Council and the Finance Ministry in Oman and which was prepared to
support economic development. The proposed project would help to: (i) improve
the quality of service to existing subscribers and provide access to new



- 10 -
subscribers; (ii) extend telecommunications services to other small urban
centers and rural areas through establishment of Public Call Offices (PCOs)
which are virtually non-existent in Oman; (iii) improve OMANTEL's training
capabilities by providing training equipment and annually reviewing its
training program; and (iv) strengthen OMANTEL's financial, engineering and
management capability through provision of technical assistance.
Project Description
30.       The proposed project provides for:
(a) 15,700 new lines of subscribers' local telephone switching
equipment and the replacement of 3,900 lines of obsolescent
equipment;
(b) ducts and main subscribers' cables to provide for about
16,000 new DELs and provide capacity for future growth;
(c) telephone terminal equipment for about 14,000 new sub-
scriber services and about 5,500 new PABX extensions;
(d) about 350 public call offices (PCOs) to be located in
both urban and rural areas;
(e) about 6,000 lines of switching capacity in new private
branch exchanges (PBXs);
(f) international and national trunk switching and trans-
mission systems to carry the projected traffic loads
with acceptable congestion standards;
(g) switching and miscellaneous equipment to assist in
increasing the automatic telex network to about 1,800
subscribers, in starting the public telegraph service in
1981-1982, and in catering for any data transmission
requirements;
(h) construction of buildings, provision of motor vehicles,
training and test equipment, and furniture and fittings;
and
(i) consultants' services and technical assistance in areas
including finance, management,training and engineering.
31.       Up to the limit of the loan amount, the proposed Bank financing
would cover the foreign exchange cost of items (a) through (d) above, the
transmission systems included in item (g), the training and test equipment,
and the consultants' services and technical assistance. These components
constitute the critical items in the early stages of OMANTEL's development
plan.



- 11 -
Project Cost and Financing
32.       Total project cost is estimated at about $97 million equivalent.
The foreign exchange cost is estimated at about $61 million equivalent and
the local cost at about $36 million. A detailed cost table appears in the
Loan and Project Summary. An allowance of 4 percent has been added to the
base cost estimates for physical contingencies to cover possible increases in
plant requirements, which might be found necessary on completion of detailed
designs. Annual price contingencies have been used on differing escalation
rates for local (10 percent per year) and foreign costs (7.5 percent per
year). Physical and price contingencies represent about 25 percent of the
estimated total project cost. Consultants' fees are estimated on the basis of
about 60 man-months, at an average man/month cost of $8,500, including inter-
national travel and subsistence.
33.       The proposed Bank loan of $22 million would be made to OMANTEL with
the guarantee of the Government, and would finance about 36 percent of the
foreign exchange cost of the project. The balance of $39.2 million foreign
exchange would be financed by OMANTEL's internal resources ($31.2 million),
and by the Government from its budget ($8.0 million). The local cost of $36
million would be financed by OMANTEL's own resources. OMANTEL's net internal
cash generation is expected to contribute about 74 percent of total financing
requirements during the period 1980-1985. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that the Government would fund from its own resources, on terms in
accordance with Government policy and satisfactory to the Bank, any required
foreign or local expenditure necessary to complete the project (Guarantee
Agreement, Section 2.02).
Procurement and Disbursements
34.       All material or equipment items to be financed from the Bank's loan
would be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's guidelines. This form of procurement would apply to all equipment
and materials used for the proposed project except for equipment to increase
the capacity of the national trunk switching center and that for the growth of
the telex system. These exceptions are justified on standardization grounds
and it is not proposed that these items be financed by the Bank. Up to the
limit of the loan amount disbursements would be made against the foreign
exchange cost of the items listed in paragraph 30. The estimated schedule of
disbursements is given in the Loan and Project Summary. The closing date for
the loan would be December 31, 1985.
Project Implementation
35.       OMANTEL will be responsible for the execution of the proposed
project. The management, training and engineering capabilities in the present
organization need strengthening. OMANTEL S.A.0. and the Finance Ministry
recognize the managerial shortcomings within OMANTEL S.A.O., and have proposed
that they be defined in more detail, and that remedial actions be specified
and implemented by experts retained by OMANTEL. Job descriptions for two
internationally recruited experts, one with technical and the other with



- 12 -
financial background, were discussed, and agreed upon, during negotiations.
These experts are expected to assist OMANTEL's management to design and
introduce effective management, training and technical planning systems over a
period of about two and one half years. During negotiations assurances were
obtained from OMANTEL that these experts, or consultants who shall include
such experts, would be appointed, in consultation with the Bank, not later
than September 30, 1980 (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02).
36.       In December 1978, OMANTEL S.A.O.'s staff of 952 represented a ratio
of about 45 per 1,000 telephones, or 85 per 1,000 DELs. Both ratios, which
are high, result from two factors: first, the network is very small at
present and diseconomies of scale are incurred, and second, there is over-
staffing because of the need to employ untrained and partly trained people.
In the course of project execution, improvement in operating efficiency can be
expected, due to a growth of operations and to staff training; during negotia-
tions, an understanding was reached on the performance indicators to be used
to measure improved efficiency. A staff training plan has been developed by
OMANTEL S.A.O. for implementation under the project, through the construction
of a new training centre and the acquisition of appropriate training equipment.
37.       The accounting system in OMANTEL S.A.O. is on a cash basis and
its finances are part of the Government budget. OMANTEL S.A.O. has begun
preparatory work to convert from present cash accounts to accrual accounts.
The financial expert, proposed to be retained by OMANTEL (see paragraph 35)
would assist in the implementation of the commercial accounting system. The
expert is also expected to set up appropriate budgeting and management informa-
tion systems, and will be responsible for the development of a training
program for the accounting and finance staff. OMANTEL S.A.O.'s accounts are
audited internally by its internal auditor's office, and externally by a local
accounting firm. In order to improve the efficiency of the internal auditing,
it is proposed that the financial expert review the internal audit and control
procedures. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that OMANTEL would
engage an independent external auditor, acceptable to the Bank (Loan Agreement,
Section 5.02(ii)). Assurances were also obtained that, for FY80 through FY82,
OMANTEL would submit its unaudited financial statements to the Bank within six
months of the close of each fiscal year, and its audited financial statements
with auditor's report within eight months of the same fiscal year, and that
from FY83 and onward, OMANTEL would submit its unaudited and audited financial
statements with auditor's report within four and six months of the fiscal
year, respectively (Loan Agreement, Section 5.02(iii)).
Economic and Financial Justification
38.       One of the major thrusts of the second Five-Year Economic Develop-
ment Plan (1981-85) is expected to be the establishment of a broader base for
the national economy than at present. It is the Government's objective to
distribute the benefits resulting from the country's oil reserves over a wide
geographical area, so as to narrow the gap in the standard of living between
different regions, and between different groups of population. The Master
Plan for the development of telecommunications in Oman has been prepared



- 13 -
against this background, and its implementation program provides for a signif-
icant expansion of telecommunications services in all its forms and throughout
the country as a whole. Without improved and extended telecommunications
services, improvements in other sectors of the national plan would be diffi-
cult and more costly. The telephone network design has been based on standard
engineering and economic techniques for minimizing capital and recurring costs
and represents the least cost solution.
39.       The internal financial rate of return on the investment for the
*         1980-85 program is 18 percent.  This rate has been calculated as the discount
rate, which equalizes the present value (in 1979 prices) of the stream of
revenue based on existing tariffs with the stream of capital and operating
*        costs attributable to the program over the life of the installed equipment.
Sensitivity analysis shows that, on the most unfavorable combination of the
iain parameters considered, the rate of return would be not less than 12
:krcent.  The use of conversion factors is not required in deriving an esti-
mate of the economic rate of return from the internal financial rate of
return. This is because, in Oman (i) the Omani currency is freely convertible;
(ii) import tariffs are negligible or nil for most goods; (iii) trade restric-
tions do not exist; (iv) there is no major distortion in terms of pricing
structure; and (v) there is no restriction on labor mobility, and wages
reflect international market prices. The internal rate of return of 18
percent, however, understates the real efficiency and social equity benefits
to be derived from the proposed project, partly because this rate is based on
the existing tariff for services. Hence, it does not reflect part of the
consumer surplus which new subscribers, and other customers receive, nor does
it reflect a portion of the indirect benefits received by the total community
through better, faster and more far-reaching communication.
40.       With the expansion of its services, OMANTEL S.A.O's operating
results have been improving steadily; preliminary figures for 1978 show a cash
surplus of about $5.2 million. The Government objective for tariff policy
is that OMANTEL should become financially self-sufficient. Telecommunications
tariffs have increased twice since 1976, and financial projections indicate
that the Government's objective can be achieved during the next decade. Con-
sequently, no tariff increase is required during the project period. OMANTEL's
financial situation over the project period is satisfactory; the operating
ratio would be about 70 percent, the current ratio above 2.0 and the debt
coverage ratio will be above 6.0. Current forecasts show that a 10 percent
rate of return on revalued assets would be adequate to meet OMANTEL's future
financial requirements. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
OMANTEL would take all necessary action to provide revenues sufficient to
maintain such an annual rate of return (Loan Agreement, Section 5.04(a)).
This was guaranteed by the Government (Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.01).
For the purpose of calculating the rate of return, OMANTEL agreed during
negotiations that it would review and determine the value of its fixed assets
annually, starting as from FY81 and, if necessary, revalue its fixed assets in
accordance with methods acceptable to the Bank; the latter would be notified
of the results not later than June 30 of each fiscal year (Loan Agreement,
Section 5.04(b)(iii)).



- 14 -
41.       OMANTEL S.A.O is curren-ly evaluating its fixed assets and stores
associated with its telecommunications operations. The final result will be
used to determine the amount of the Government's equity in OMANTEL. Any
modification in OMANTEL's future capital structure would be made in consul-
tation with the Bank (Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.04). In addition an
understanding was reached during negotiations that due allowance would be made
for OMANTEL's requirements for debt service, contributions to investment
programs, working capital and any statutory requirements before transferring
net profits to the Government.
42.       In 1979, the overdue portion of OMANTEL S.A.O.'s subscribers'
accounts receivable was estimated at about three months of the year's revenues.
This situation would be eased by the introduction of the expected computerized
monthly billing process. Regarding the overdue accounts by government sub-
scribers, the Government has requested OMANTEL S.A.0 to identify the accounts
that should be paid, and has made the necessary budgetary provision. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government would cause all
public agencies to settle their future accounts within two months of the
billing dates (Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.03), and that OMANTEL would
maintain the overall level of its accounts receivable at about three months'
billings from FY81 through FY83, and at about two months' billings from FY84
and thereafter (Loan Agreement, Section 4.01(b)).
Benefits and Risks
43.       Benefits resulting from the proposed investment program are expected
to be felt, directly or indirectly, by all segments of Omani society. The
upgrading of health services, and greater efficiency in business, transporta-
tion and in the building industry, are some of the benefits which would flow
from improved communications. The proposed investment would also increase the
efficiency of government administration and public sector corporations. In
addition, it would make a significant impact on the access to telecommunica-
tions service in currently unserved provincial areas and rural communities.
The establishment, for the first time in Oman, of about 350 PCOs in both urban
and rural areas, will extend public access to telephone facilities to a broad
spectrum of the population, both in geographic and economic terms. In Oman
the rural settlements are tightly clustered units of population and one
telephone in the center provides immediate access to all inhabitants. The
sites for PCOs will be selected taking into account population size, geo-
graphical distribution and maintenance requirements. Furthermore, the expan-
sion of the long distance network will provide television relay to several
rural areas, and the establishment and upgrading of microwave radio long
distance links will provide the skeleton structure, from which small capacity
single channel radio links may be subsequently extended to many more isolated
villages and settlements.
44.       There are no major risks associated with the project.  The risk
involved is inherent in any project of this type, where the implementing orga-
nization needs strengthening, where virtually all materials and most of the
labor have to be imported, and where there is little past growth and develop-
ment to provide data for economic and demand projections. The development



- 15 -
program and the project have been designed in a manner which allows periodic
checks on assumptions and forecasts against actual events. The experience of
OMANTEL S.A.0. in its operations to date indicates that, with the technical
assistance proposed, OMANTEL will be able to implement the project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Oman Telecommunication Cor-
poration (OMANTEL) and the Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
Sultanate of Oman and the Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article 3, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distri-
buted to the Executive Directors separately.  Special features of the Loan and
Guarantee Agreements are referred to in the text and listed in Section III of
Annex III.
46.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
47.       1 recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Ln. No. 980 Education Project: US$5.7 million Loan of April 25, 1974;
Effective Date: March 31, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The project consists of construction, furnishing and equipping of
one primary teacher training institute/national education center, two prep-
aratory schools including basic skill vocational training, one agricultural
training institute; and, related technical assistance. After initial delays,
overall implementation has substantially improved and all institutions have
become operational in September 1979.  A completion mission is tentatively
scheduled for Fall 1980.
Ln. No. 985 Technical Assistance Project: US$2.75 million Loan of May 15,
1974. Effective Date: December 11, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
This project provided Technical Assistance through consultants
and experts for the formulation of three teams of specialists to deal with
(i) Economic Planning and Management; (ii) Agriculture and Fisheries; and
(iii) Transport. The transport component was satisfactorily completed and
the Government is expected to send soon the final withdrawal application.
Following some difficulties faced by the agricultural advisory team, it was
agreed to use part of the agricultural component to carry out a program of
tubewell drilling and testing to determine water availability for developing
farms in Sohar and Saham. The program was completed last year. Upon Govern-
ment's request the unused balance under this component (US$270,000) was
allocated to the Unallocated category of Schedule I of the Loan Agreement.
The Economic Planning and Management team has been very successful in prepar-
ing Oman's First Economic Development Plan for 1976-80. It is currently
preparing the second five year Plan. The closing date was extended to enable
continuation of the team's work.
Ln. No. 1441 Highway Maintenance Project: US$15 million Loan of June 20, 1977;
Effective Date: September 30, 1977; Closing Date: September 30, 1981.
This project consists of two parts. Part A has three components:
(i) procurement of highway maintenance equipment and spares; (ii) construc-
tion of six highwey maintenance workshops and a training center; and (iii) the
operation of seven workshops.  Part B has two components:  (i) consultants
services for maintenance management and training; and (ii) general technical
assistance to the Ministry of Communications. Implementation of this project
is proceeding satisfactorily.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 1442 Engineering-Power/Water Studies: US$1.5 million Loan of
June 20, 1977; Effective Date: September 14, 1977; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
While disbursements have been lagging owing to delays in the submis-
sion of disbursement requests, overall execution of the studies is nearly
complete. The studies are in three phases designed to identify power/water
supply needs in the short term (through 1980) and medium term (through 1985)
and to propose institutional reforms. The consultants have produced the final
report covering short-term and medium term water supply for the capital area
and are in the process of finalizing their report on water supply for 22 other
towns and villages. Their report is expected to be completed shortly. The
consultants have also produced an interim report on institutional recommenda-
tions. For power, the consultants have completed their power planning report
on short and medium term demand. Further work on the organizational proposals
is postponed at Government's request until the objectives and needs of the
Ministry of Electricity and Water are better defined. The closing date was
extended to permit finalization of the consultants' work.
