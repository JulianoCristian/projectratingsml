development\n            program and includes the installation of: (a) 15,700 new\n            direct exchange lines (DELs) and the replacement of 3,900\n            lines of obsolescent equipment; (b) ducts and main cables to\n            provide for about 16,000 new DELs and capacity for future\n            growth; (c) telephones for about 14,000 new subscribers and\n            about 5,500 new private automatic branch exchange (PABX)\n            extensions; (d) about 350 public call offices to be located\n            in both urban and rural areas; (e) about 6,000 lines of\n            switching capacity in new private exchanges; (f)\n            international and national switching and transmission\n            systems; (g) switching and miscellaneous equipment to\n            increase the automatic telex network to about 1,800\n            subscribers; (h) construction of buildings; provision of\n            motor vehicles; training and testing equipment, and\n            furniture and fittings; and (i) consultants' services\n            and technical assistance to strengthen the management,\n            training and engineering capabilities of OMANTEL. For this\n            purpose two experts (one with technical and one with\n            financial background) would be retained by OMANTEL for about\n            2-1/2 years, at an average man/month cost of $8,500."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
