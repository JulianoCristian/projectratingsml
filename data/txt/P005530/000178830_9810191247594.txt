I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
1.01      Until 1975, public telecommunications services in Oman were operated
by the British company, Cable and Wireless Ltd. (C&W). This company was
granted an exclusive license in 1939 to provide international telecommunica-
tions into and out of Oman, and in 1950 it obtained a license to install
and operate local telephone systems in Muscat and Mutrah. It was not until
1971, however, that telephone service was introduced into Salalah, the second
most important city in Oman, and about 1,000 km south of Muscat.
1.02      During 1974, the Government of Oman decided to take over the opera-
tion of the telecommunications services from C&W and in 1975 the Government
bought C&W's telecommunications assets in Oman, and the Oman Telecommunica-
tions Company, SAO (OMANTEL SAO) was formed for the purpose of operating and
maintaining the public national and international telecommunications services.
The company was established with shareholdings as follows:
The Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones   17,999
(on behalf of the Government)
The Central Bank of Oman                                   1
Cable and Wireless Ltd.                               12,000
Total                                      30,000
The shares have a face value of RO 10. From July 1, 1980 OMANTEL, SAO will
change over to a new public corporation, Oman Telecommunication Corporation
(OMANTEL), which will be 100% owned by the Government of Oman (paragraph
4.03).
1.03      The Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones (PTT) which, until
1978 was a Department within the Ministry of Communications, is currently
responsible for the regulation of telecommunications services within the
country, allocates radio frequencies for all services, and licenses private
radio installations. The Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones is to
be Chairman of OMANTEL.
1.04      Responsibility for radio broadcasting and television services is
with the Ministry of Information and Culture, which provides and maintains
broadcast transmitters but leases relay transmission facilities from OMANTEL
SAO. The Civil Aviation and Defense Departments both maintain and operate
their specialized telecommunications services, and the country's oil company,
Petroleum Development Oman Ltd. (PDO), has installed and operates a fairly
extensive private telecommunications network. OMANTEL SAO provides some
leased circuits to these three entities and meets the telecommunications needs
of all other government agencies.



-2-
1.05      Oman has no local telecommunications manufacturing industry and
nearly all the material requirements for the sector must be imported. Most
of the installation works are also contracted to foreigners leaving OMANTEL
SAO staff with operation and maintenance activities, and subscribers' lead in
and telephone instrument installation.
Access to Service
1.06      Access to telephone service in Oman is inadequate, particularly in
the rural areas. At May 31, 1979, there were 10,692 direct exchange lines
(DELs) in Oman of which 7,169, or 67%, were in the capital area of Muscat 1/,
1,602 (15%) were in the southern city of Salalah and 1,921 (18%) were in
smaller settlements in rural areas. Of the 27 existing telephone exchanges
in Oman, 18 are in smaller communities in rural areas but much of the country
remains without telephone access. Registered waiting applicants are mainly in
the capital area (where some applications for service have been unsatisfied
for as long as five years) and in Salalah. There is an unknown number of
potential subscribers in areas where the network has not yet penetrated.
1.07      The estimated present and future DEL and telephone densities 2/ for
the capital area around Muscat and the rest of the country are shown in the
following table:
LA
December 1978        December 1985-
DELs  Telephones    DELs   Telephones
Capital Area                 5.2      12.3        10.3       20.4
Rest of Country              0.4       0.5         0.9        0.9
Oman Total                   1.0        1.9        2.3        3.9
/1   The estimates for 1985 are based on implementation of the
1981-1985 Five Year Plan and program of which the proposed
Bank financed project is an integral part.
1/   The capital area is defined as the coastal strip about 50 km in length
stretching from Al Bustan, a little south east of Muscat, to Seeb on the
west of the capital city.
2/   The density is defined as the number of DELs or telephones per 100 of
population and is based on population estimates and projections assessed
by the consultants (financed under TA Loan 980-OM) who assisted OMANTEL
SAO in the preparation of their national telecommunications development
plan (paragraph 1.22). In Oman the DEL density is a better measure of
telephone access because telephones include a large number of private
branch exchange (PBX) extensions.



-3-
The telephone density for the country as a whole (1.9) is about average for
Middle East countries and is generally above that for Africa and Asia exclud-
ing Japan (Annex 2). The DEL density in the capital area at 5.2 is also
about the same as in other Middle East capital cities, e.g., Damascus - 7.0;
Tehran - 8.2; Baghdad - 4.9; Riyadh - 6.5; and Amman - 4.7.
Usage of the Service
1.08      Existing telephones are classified according to their location in
residences or offices. At present, about 55% are residential and 45% busi-
ness.  An unknown percentage of residential telephones are used primarily for
business due to the past and current difficulty of obtaining connections in
the business districts.
1.09      At the present time there are virtually no Public Call Offices
(PCOs) in Oman which provide non-subscribers with telephone access. Inter-
national calls may be made only by those subscribers who have a special
account number for charging purposes or by using the "pay station" telephones
at OMANTEL headquarters in Muscat. The average telephone revenue per DEL in
1978 was approximately RO 352 (US$1,019) which is among the highest in the
world. About 75% of this is call revenue. Existing tariffs are discussed
in paragraphs 3.06 and 3.07.
1.10      The telex network is presently manual with about 350 subscribers.
The recorded waiting list is 150 but the real unsatisfied demand is consider-
ably higher than this figure. An automatic electronic telex exchange is
currently being installed in Muscat and all telex subscribers in the country
will be transferred to it when it is completed in mid-1980. It will have
an initial capacity of 1,200 lines. There is no domestic telegraph service
in the country.
Quality of Service and Existing Facilities
1.11      The quality of the existing service is generally acceptable outside
of the busy hour period. The maintenance standards are reasonable, exchange
buildings housing switching and transmission equipment are airconditioned, and
outside plant is of fair quality. The hot dry climate of Oman during most of
the year, and particularly in the capital and inland areas, provides a good
environment for outside telephone plant as moisture is normally the main
source of performance degradation.
1.12      There are shortages of junction circuits in parts of the capital
area and this causes some call congestion during busy hours. There is also
a shortage of national trunk circuits in general and insufficient circuits
on the subscriber dialing route to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
1.13      The majority of existing switching equipment is of the crossbar
type and has been installed within the last six years. The long distance
network comprises coaxial cable, microwave radio and some satellite circuits.
The latter operate between Muscat and Salalah where there is a satellite
television relay facility. Satellite television relay facilities are also
provided between Muscat and several inland centers to enable programs to be
rebroadcast by regional transmitters. The existing technical facilities are
described in more detail in Annex 3.



-4-
Demand for Service
1.14      The demand for telephone service in Oman has exceeded the supply,
at least in the capital area and Salalah, since the provision of telephone
service in these areas began.
1.15      The only comprehensive study of existing and potential demand that
has been undertaken to date is that made by a team of Bank-financed telecom-
munications consultants (paragraph 1.22), with the help of OMANTEL SAO staff,
during 1978. This study was made difficult by among other things the absence
of reliable demographic data and the existing inadequate telephone penetration.
Based on best available estimates of existing population and growth rates for
the capital area, Dhofar, the interior, Musandam, offshore Islands, and desert
areas 1/, on limited historical telephone data, and on assumptions relating to
forecast changes in economic activity and income level, future demand for DEL's
in Oman was projected as shown in the following table:

the large bulk of Oman where there is currently no telephone access.



- 5 -
1.16      Long distance telephone traffic has been substantially depressed
in the past due to congestion. Hence, a future growth rate of initially 35%
followed by 20% per annum has been assumed. This is in line with growth
rates experienced in other similar countries.
1.17      The telex network is rudimentary at present but a new electronic
national and international telex switching center is now being installed
and modern electronic teleprinters are being purchased. The telex growth
rate has been estimated at 25% per annum over the next several years, falling
to 15% per annum, in the late 1980s. These projections are also based on
growth rates experienced in other similar countries.
Sector Goals
1.18      Telecommunications sector goals are in harmony with those of
national development plans which, by resolution of the Development Council,
are required to give priority to income generating projects in non-oil sectors
to supplement oil receipts and to effect a wider geographical distribution of
investments in order that the benefits may be shared by different regions of
the country. It is envisaged that such wider distribution would narrow the gap
in the standards of living in different regions with special emphasis on the
least developed regions thereby maintaining and developing existing areas of
population and protecting them against the danger of mass migration to those
already densely populated. Equally important are those national goals to
develop local human resources to increase Omani participation in economic
activities and to improve the efficiency of government administration.
1.19      There are two main thrusts in the objectives of the Government
of Oman for the telecommunications sector. One is to provide an effective
national telecommunications service satisfying all areas of the country's
business and community needs and providing the essential support necessary for
continuing national economic development. The other is to establish a fully
government owned telecommunications organization with effective and competent
technical and financial management. This includes moving towards Omanization
of management and operational staff as quickly as possible, becoming finan-
cially selfsufficient within the next decade, and raising necessary capital
through its own borrowings.
Sector Constraints
1.20      To date, the major sector constraint in developing the telecommunica-
tions sector has been the inadequate capacity of OMANTEL SAO to formulate an
integrated technical and financial development plan, which complements national
investment programs and goals in other priority sectors. This has been due in
part to the short time OMANTEL SAO has been in existence, its limited charter,
and to some lack of national planning guidelines. The establishment of a
Development Council in November 1974 (with the Bank's assistance) provided the
basic national guidelines for telecommunications planning, and two consultants,
employed by OMANTEL SAO and funded by the Bank under a technical assistance
loan, have put together the national telecommunications master plan (paragraph
1.22).
1.21      Despite the limited life of OMANTEL SAO and the constraints men-
tioned above, the management has coped with reasonable success with its first



- 6 -
network development Venture, increasing the DELs from about 3,000 at the end
of 1974 to over 11,000 at the end of 1978, and is currently further extending
the network capacity. Based on its past performance and with the assistance
proposed as discussed in Chapter IV, the management of OMANTEL SAO will be
able to execute new telecommunications projects, including the proposed Bank
financed project, in an efficient and timely manner, after the new corporation
is established.
The Bank's Role
1.22      The Bank first became associated with the telecommunications sector
in Oman through a project identification mission carried out in May 1977.
Following this mission, the Bank assisted OMANTEL SAO by preparing terms of
reference to secure consultants to prepare a national telecommunications
master plan, and to help design a project which might be suitable for Bank
financing. Part of the cost of the consultancy was financed by the Bank under
Technical Assistance Loan No. 980-OM as amended on June 27, 1978, following a
request by the Government. Several subsequent visits were made by Bank staff
to advise the consultants and OMANTEL SAO staff. The Bank's role in the
telecommunications sector in Oman is primarily focused on promoting institu-
tion building, and providing independent technical and economic advice. The
funding proposed allows for this, and in addition will assist the new OMANTEL
in gaining the expertise necessary to take advantage of the international
competitive bidding process, and in becoming familiar with the lower prices
which such a process can bring.
II. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Plan and the Program
2.01      The telecommunications development program derives from the Master
Plan prepared by consultants during the period August 1978 through March
1979 (para 1.22). This plan deals with a twelve-year period from 1979 through
1990. The consultants recommended an implementation program divided into
three overlapping phases, each phase covering approximately five years and
containing a package of inter-related works. This was designed to allow
reviews of plan assumptions and progress of works to be made at appropriate
intervals and, if necessary, enable timely variations in investment to be
made to keep it closely matching the needs and objectives.
2.02      The program presented in the Master Plan has been accepted by the
management of OMANTEL SAO and by the Development Council and the Finance
Ministry in Oman. The 1980-85 phase of the program, however, was modified
slightly with the assistance of Bank staff at the time of project appraisal.
The modifications, which are not substantial, relate to the early years of
the program and have been agreed with OMANTEL SAO management.



2.03      The total construction program costs, including contingencies, over
the period including 1980 and up to 1985 are as follows:
/1
Cos ts
Item                                       RO Millions        US$ Millions
Ongoing Works                                      1.704                4.933
Bank Project                                     33.582                97.220
Future Works                                      17.690               51.212
Total                                       52.976               153.365
/1   These costs represent the value of the construction over the period
from 1980 through 1985. The figures will differ slightly from figures
quoted in paragraph 5.07 and Annex 17 because these latter figures
represent funds flow. A portion of the funds will be expended prior
to receipt of material and a portion will be retained after completion
of construction thus leading to minor differences in the timing of
the construction program and the funds flow accounts.
More details of the program are shown in Annex 5, page 1 of which shows
details of the construction program while page 2 shows in addition to the
construction program the year by year value of the contracts to be placed,
the amounts estimated to be transferred to fixed assets each year and the
consequential cash requirements each year.
Project Concept
2.04      The proposed project has been selected from the program based on
the following criteria:
(a) it should comprise a time slice of the development program
somewhat less than the initial five year phase proposed in
the consultants' Master Plan.  The critical "take off" period
of approximately three years has been selected cQmprising in
the main 1981, 1982 and 1983 but picking up some earlier 1980
costs and some tapering off costs in 1984 and 1985;
(b) it should pick up as its commencing point all of the construc-
tion program investment in the initial years that is not already
included in the ongoing works which are committed; and
(c) it should be designed around items which require longer lead
time--the core elements of the program--which will be put to
contract in 1980 and 1981. These items comprise mainly the
switching equipment for local and transit purposes and the
long distance transmission systems. In addition to these,
it would include some items such as subscribers' telephone
and telex terminal equipment which could be ordered and
brought into service within the same time frame.



-8-
The Project
2.05      The proposed project, designed on these concepts, provides for the
following network additions:
(a)  15,700 new lines of subscribers' local telephone switching
equipment and the replacement of 3,900 lines of obsolescent
equipment;
(b)  ducts and main subscribers' cables to provide for about
16,000 new DELs and provide capacity for future growth;
(c)  telephone terminal equipment for about 14,000 new
subscriber services and about 5,500 new PABX extensions;
(d)  about 350 public call offices (PCOs) to be located in both
urban and rural areas;
(e)  6,000 lines of switching capacity in new private branch
exchanges;
(f)  international and national trunk switching and transmission
systems to carry the projected traffic loads with acceptable
congestion standards; and
(g)  switching and miscellaneous equipment to increase the auto-
matic telex network to about 1,800 subscribers, commence the
public telegraph service in 1981 or 1982, and cater for any
data transmission requirements.
2.06      In addition, the project includes:
(a)  construction of buildings, provision of motor vehicles, training
and test equipment and furniture and fittings; and
(b)  consultants' services and technical assistance in management,
training and engineering.
2.07      A more detailed description of the project's composition is included
in Annex 6.
Project Costs
2.08      The total cost of the project is RO 33.6 million (US$97.2 million)
which includes a foreign exchange component of RO 21.2 million (US$61.3 mil-
lion). The cost details are shown in Annex 5 and are summarized in the
following:

2.09      The project cost estimates are based on OMANTEL SAO recent experi-
ence with international competitive bids and analysis by the consultants during
their six months study while defining the Master Plan. The consultants' fees
under technical assistance are estimated at an average man/month cost of about
US$8,500, including travel, subsistence and other costs. Details of the bases
for the costs of the more important items are included in Annex 7.  Costs do
not include duty or other excise taxes as OMANTEL SAO is not required to pay
such charges, and the new OMANTEL will also be exempted from these charges.
2.10      Telecommunication construction costs in Oman must allow for the fact
that OMANTEL will not reach the stage where it can carry out its own installa-
tion work in the near future (Chapter IV). The costs of expatriate labor used
*         by installation contractors is high because of some difficult enviromental
conditions. External plant construction costs are also significantly in-
creased by the rocky ground conditions, especially in the capital area.
Virtually all construction materials have to be imported.  Project costs as
estimated make allowance for all these factors.
Contingencies
2.11      An allowance of 4% has been added to the base cost estimates for
physical contingencies to cover possible increases in plant requirements which
might be found necessary on completion of detailed designs. Price contingen-
cies have been added based on differing escalation rates for local and foreign
costs. For local costs, an annual escalation rate of 10% has been adopted and
for foreign costs, an annual escalation rate of about 7.5% has been used.

Project Financing
2.12      The financing plan for the project and the program is given in
Annex 17 and is summarized in paragraph 5.08. This plan indicates that, based
on projections of revenues and operating costs, OMANTEL will fund from its net
internal resources RO 43.6 million (US$126 million) of its requirements for
the years 1980 through 1985. The estimated total cost of the construction
program through those years, and including the increase required in working
capital, is RO 56.7 million (US$164 million).  The RO 13.1 million (US$38.0
million) gap will be covered by external borrowings (US$33.7 million) and
by funds already committed by the Government to cover ongoing works (US$4.3
million). Based on this financing plan, OMANTEL will finance from its own
resources about US$67.2 million of the total estimated cost of the proposed
project (US$97.2 million); the remaining US$30 million will be financed
by the proposed Bank loan (US$22 million) and by funds from the Oman Govern-
ment (US$8 million).
Items for Bank Financing
2.13      The items proposed for Bank financing are as follows:
% of Total Foreign Cost
Financed by the
RO      US$          Bank for Each Item
---in millions--
(a)  Local switching equipment        2.1       6.1                 100%
(b)  External plant                   1.2       3.4                 100%
(c)  Subscribers' plant               0.7       2.1                 100%
(d) Long distance terrestrial
systems                          2.8       8.2                 100%
(e) Testing equipment, and other
equipment for training center  0.2         0.6                 100%
(f) Consultants' services and
technical assistance             0.2       0.5                 100%
(g)  Unallocated                      0.4       1.1
Total                       7.6     22.0



Disbursement
2.14      The proposed loan would be disbursed against 100% of foreign ex-
change expenditures for imported equipment under items (a) to (f) in paragraph
2.13. The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Annex 8. The
closing date for the loan would be June 30, 1985.
Procurement
2.15      All items of material or equipment to be financed from the Bank's
loan would be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines. This form of procurement would apply to most
other equipment and materials with possible exceptions of increasing the
capacity of the national trunk switching center where it may prove to be
justified on standardization grounds to expand with the same type of equip-
ment, and for growth of the telex system, in which area there would be similar
compatibility and standardization considerations. It is not proposed that
these items be financed by the Bank.
2.16      It is envisaged that the technical assistance covered by 2.13(f)
will be provided by persons working under contract with OMANTEL rather than
by employing a consultancy organization, although the latter possibility is
not excluded. The terms of reference or job descriptions for these people
would be drawn up with the assistance of the Bank and would be agreed upon
between OMANTEL and the Bank. The Bank would have an opportunity to comment
on the proposed selections (paragraphs 4.07 and 4.13).
Project Implementation
2.17      The implementing agency will be OMANTEL with most of the installa-
tion work being carried out by contract. The critical step in meeting the
scheduled implementation plan contained in Annex 6 is the preparation and
issue of tender documents for subscribers' telephone switching, external
plant, subscribers' plant and transmission equipment. Draft specifications
are already available for switching equipment. Most of the cable and duct
reticulation planning and design, which is necessary for the external plant
bidding documents, has been completed and there should be no undue delays
in the remainder. Tender documents for these should be ready for issue by
March, 1980.
2.18      It will be necessary for some survey work to be carried out before
tenders can be invited for the microwave radio systems and it is envisaged
that this would be carried out by ITU consultants. Buildings, which are on
the critical path of most projects, can be constructed quickly in Oman.
Architectural and engineering designs can also be arranged expeditiously.
OMANTEL will be responsible for the execution of the project and will have the
necessary authority and autonomy to carry out this task (paragraph 4.04).

Performance Indicators
2.19      Performance indicators to help monitor OMANTEL's project implemen-
tation and operational and financial performance are given in Annex 9. These
were discussed during negotiations and confirmed for inclusion in OMANTEL's
project progress reports to be sent to the Bank.
III.  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.01      The economic analysis discussed in this chapter relates to the
1980-1985 development program for OMANTEL of which the project forms an
integral part. The program is designed towards achieving the objectives
for the telecommunications sector, which are in turn derived from the
national development plan (paragraphs 1.18 and 1.19).
Telecommunications and Development
3.02      One of the major thrusts of the national development plan is to
establish a wider base for the national economy than at present. It is also
the Government's objective to direct the benefits resulting from the country's
oil reserves over a wide geographical area and to narrow the gap in the
standard of living between different regions and between different groups of
people. The national plan attempts to strike a balance between investment
expenditure on income generating projects on the one hand and on infrastruc-
ture projects on the other.
3.03      The "Master Plan" for the development of telecommunications in Oman
has been framed against this background and its implementation program pro-
vides for a significant expansion of telecommunications services in all forms
and in all areas of the country. In the early stages of implementation, the
major part of investment in local networks will take place in the two impor-
tant developing areas--one along the 50 km coastal strip known as the capital
area and the second around Salalah in the south. Without such improved and
extended telecommunications services, the implementation programs in other
sectors of the national plan would be difficult and more costly. In fact,
achievement of some of the most important national goals such as increasing
social, educational and administrational bonds between the central capital
area and regions like Salalah and, more importantly, the Musandam peninsula
area, the offshore islands, and numerous rural settlements is very much
dependent on the efficient least cost development of the telecommunications
network.
Distribution of Benefits
3.04      The distribution of the benefits resulting from the proposed invest-
ment program will either directly or indirectly be felt by all segments,of the
Omani society. The upgrading of health and educational facilities, greater
efficiency in business, transportation, building industry, etc., which will
flow from improved communications should impact throughout the nation.



- 13 -
3.05      The establishment for the first time in Oman of about 350 PCOs in
both urban and rural areas will extend public access to telephone facilities
to a broad spectrum of the population, both in geographic and economic terms.
In the rural areas PCOs will be installed first in the larger and more eco-
nomically viable settlements. In Oman these rural settlements are tightly
clustered units of population and one telephone in the center provides immedi-
ate communication access to all inhabitants. Furthermore, the expansion of
the long distance network will provide television relay to several rural
areas, and the establishment and upgrading of microwave radio long distance
links will provide the skeleton structure from which small capacity single
channel radio links may be subsequently extended to many more isolated vil-
lages and settlements.
Tariff Policies
3.06      Overall, the Government's objective for tariff policy is to convert
OMANTEL, SAO present position of drawing funds from the government budget
to a position of breaking even or contributing funds to the budget in the
future after the new OMANTEL is established. Financial projections indicate
that Government's objective can be achieved during the next decade. OMANTEL's
operations during the 1980-1985 period are expected to require a net cash
outflow from the Government of about RO 7 million (US$16 million). However,
increased earnings from the new investment should eliminate the net outflows
in the late 1980s and produce net inflows from the sector thereafter.
3.07      The telephone tariff structure is framed in such a way that business
firms in urban areas pay higher installation charges than do urban residential
users, and all users in the smaller towns and communities. Since 1976, instal-
lation charges in the capital area and Salalah have been RO 100 (US$290) for
business connections and RO 10 (US$29) for residential connections. In all
other areas of the country, the installation charge is RO 10 (US$29) for all
connections. The tariff structure has other favorable facets such as lower
nighttime rates for long distance calls. However, during the present period
of acute shortage in the urban areas, price is not being used to effectively
ration subscriber demand for connections--normally service is provided in the
order of applications, but at present the few additional DELs which become
available are allocated by the President of OMANTEL SAO. By the time the
project is completed, it is expected that the unsatisfied demand for connec-
tions will be reduced to the level where waiting times in those areas which
have access to service would be less than 12 months. As a result, it is
expected that price will then begin to serve to allocate supply more effec-
tively. Telecommunication tariffs have been increased twice since 1976. In
January 1976, annual telephone rental was increased from RO 16 to RO 56 (350%
increase) and unit charge for national calls was increased from RO 0.009 to
RO 0.03 (333% increase). In January 1977, annual telex rental was increased
from RO 288 to RO 480 (167% increase), followed by increases in charges for
international services in June 1977. A summary of telecommunications tariffs
is given in Annex 10.
Least Cost Solution
3.08      The telephone network design has been based on standard engineering/
economic techniques for minimizing capital and recurring costs. Expatriate



- 14 -
engineers have carried out most of the planning and design for the network
expansion. The current technologies adopted are acceptable and effective in
providing low maintenance costs for the future. Appropriate provisioning
periods for the various types of plant have been adopted and international
competitive bidding will be used in procurement. Contractor installation,
which is proposed for the major plant items should assure the earliest pos-
sible utilization of plant for revenue earning purposes.
3.09      The automatic telex network will be implemented with modern elec-
tronic switching and teleprinters. The long distance and international
networks will comprise a mix of coaxial cable, microwave radio and satellite
circuits which should provide an efficient and reliable network. Satellite
circuits will be utilized on those connections where cost-effective technical
alternatives are not available. The extension of the local switching system
will be either crossbar or electronic switching, depending on the prices
offered to an open international tender, so ensuring that the most cost-
effective technology is adopted. The continuation of subscriber dialing in
the long distance network and the extension of it to international operations
will minimize expenditure on manual switchboards and operator training. The
new international switching center nearing completion is an electronic system
which will provide efficient manual assistance positions with visual display
units and keying of charging information. All these individual elements of
the program have been or will be engineered in detail to provide a sound
telecommunications network capable eventually of meeting most of the demands
of the country in a cost effective manner.
Return on Investment
3.10      The internal financial rate of return on the investment for the
1980-85 program is 18% (Annex 11). This rate has been calculated as the
discount rate which equalizes the present worth (in 1979 prices) of the stream
of revenues based on existing tariffs with the streams of capital and operating
costs attributable to the program over the life of the installed equipment.
3.11      The use of conversion factors is not required in deriving an esti-
mate of the economic rate of return from the above internal financial rate of
return. This is because, in Oman, (a) the Omani currency is freely convert-
ible; (b) import tariffs are negligible or nil for most goods, (c) trade
restrictions do not exist; (d) there is no major distortion in terms of
pricing structure; and (e) there is no restriction on labor mobility and wages
reflect international market prices. However, the above internal financial
rate of return does understate the real economic benefits to be derived from
the investment program. Benefits are understated partly because the internal
financial rate of return is based on the existing tariff for telecommunica-
tions services. Hence it does not reflect part of the consumer surplus which
new subscribers and other callers receive, nor does it reflect a portion of the
indirect benefits received by the total community through better and faster
communication, e.g., increased business and government efficiency and improved
service and administration in other sectors such as health, transportation,
agriculture, etc.
3.12      Benefits are also understated because the calculation of the internal
rate of return includes costs for extending the network and providing facilities



- 15 -
in the newly served areas, while the full benefits of the extension are
not included. This is because the available capacity of various components of
equipment will not be fully utilized until additional incremental investment
is made and additional lines are connected at some future time.
Risk
3.13      There are no unusual risks associated with the project, although
some risk is inherent in any project such as this, involving as it does a
relatively immature organization operating in a high cost country where
virtually all materials and most of the labor has to be imported, and where
there is little past growth and development to provide data for economic
and demand projections. The development program and the project have been
designed in a manner which allows periodic checks of assumptions and forecasts
against actual happenings, and adjustments may be made if necessary. The
experience of OMANTEL SAO management in its operations to date indicates that
with the help of foreign technical assistance it will be able to implement the
project. Sensitivity analysis on the internal rate of return calculation
shows that on the most unfavorable combination of main parameters considered
(increase of 10% each in capital and operating costs and 10% decrease in
revenues), the rate of return on the 1980-85 investment program would be not
less than 12%.
Environmental and Health Aspects
3.14      Telecommunications projects have very little direct impact on
the environment. The plant is mostly unseen and it consumes little energy.
Through its use as an alternative to communications involving physical move-
ments, however, telecommunications has the potential to conserve energy,
reduce environmental pollution, and facilitate such items as health delivery
and emergency care.
IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Organization
4.01      At present, OMANTEL SAO is a joint management company owned 60% by
the Oman Government and 40% by C&W. It has the sole license to operate and
maintain the public national and international telecommunications services in
Oman. It does not, however, presently own the plant and assets over which the
telecommunications systems operate--these are owned by the Oman Government
through the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones (paragraph 1.02).
4.02      Under the 1975 agreement between the Government and C&W, the Govern-
ment has the right to "not earlier than the third anniversary of the date of
formation of the (OMANTEL SAO managment) Company and at any time during the
currency of this Agreement from such day ... to serve twelve-months notice on
C&W of its desire either:
(a) to acquire all C&W's shares in the Company ...; or



- 16 -
(b) to require C&W to enter into negotiations ... for the
variation of this Agreement." 1/
4.03      On June 17, 1979, the Government informed C&W of its intention to
exercise its option to purchase OMANTEL SAO and nominated July 1, 1980, as
the terminating date of the twelve months' notice. In addition, the Govern-
ment has decided that, from July 1, 1980, OMANTEL SAO will cease to exist and
that a new public corporation, Oman Telecommunication Corporation (OMANTEL)
will be established to take over all telecommunications operations from
OMANTEL SAO. The management, staff and net assets of OMANTEL SAO will be
transferred to the new OMANTEL, which will be 100% government owned. OMANTEL
will be the borrower for the proposed Bank loan and the implementing agency
of the Bank financed project.
4.04      Under the new arrangements, OMANTEL will become an autonomous entity
taking over the ownership of the telecommunications assets under a new charter
which has been promulgated by Royal Decree. The new charter will enable
OMANTEL to continue its present ability to borrow foreign exchange, and
empower OMANTEL to own telecommunications facilities including those to be
built under the proposed project.
4.05      The present organizational structure of OMANTEL is shown in Annex 12.
The Managers of Finance and Transmission are at present expatriates while the
other top level managers are Omani. The Telecommunciations advisor is also an
expatriate and he reports directly to the President.
Management and Control
4.06      The management, budgeting and control systems operating in the
present organization need considerable strengthening. There is no internal
budgeting system, and the flow of management control information is erratic
and non-structured. There is a need for a disciplined management information
system to provide condensed and relevant information to the President, the
General Manager and the Departmental Managers.
4.07      OMANTEL SAO and the Finance Ministry recognize the management short-
comings within OMANTEL and propose that they be defined in more detail, and
that remedial actions be specified and implemented by experts retained by
OMANTEL. Job descriptions for two persons, one with technical and the other
with financial background, have been prepared to assist OMANTEL in hiring
appropriate persons for this purpose. These are contained in Annexes 13 and
14 and were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations. Provision for
two experienced experts has been included in the proposed loan to enable them
to design, specify and introduce effective management systems in conformity
with the job descriptions over a period of about two years. Assurance was
obtained during negotiations that the two experts would be appointed in
consultation with the Bank not later than September 1980.

Staff and Training
4.08      Below the top management level, there is a high proportion of
expatriate staff in the middle management and senior technical levels. This
is seen in the following table:
Number (at 12/31/78)           Percentage
Staff Classification                Omani  Expatriate  Total   Omani  Expatriate

asst. engineers, technicians)       66      124        190       35       65
Operators                            126         6       132       95         5

drivers and unskilled              414         6       420       99         1
Total                           701      251        952       74       26
4.09      Although one of the Government's objectives of telecommunications
development is the design and implementation of a training program to achieve
as rapidly as possible the total "Omanization" of the personnel and staff
engaged in the public telecommunications systems in the Sultanate; it will be
a number of years before this can be achieved. Training of local staff of
technical and middle management levels is currently constrained by the lack of
sufficiently pre-qualified local people. To assist in dealing with this
problem a training plan has been devised and a training center and training
equipment, which are necessary to carry out the envisioned training program,
have been included in the project. Currently, several expatriates are employed
as trainers and they are generally competent for the task.
4.10      OMANTEL's maintenance capability and training needs have been con-
sidered in project design; PCO sites will be selected taking into account
geographical distribution and maintenance requirements. No major difficul-
ties are anticipated for OMANTEL to maintain and operate the installed
facilities. However, a disappointing feature of the present organization is
its inability to carry out installation work, apart from the subscriber's lead
in and telephone instrument, with its own labor force. While the capability
to install switching equipment and transmission equipment comes only after



- 18 -
some years of training and experience, and contractor installation generally
does not add unduly to switching costs, the use of contractor installation for
subscriber's cables is expensive. During project supervision, the training
program will be reviewed and continually updated to ensure that adequate
training will take place, including in the area of cable installation. The
annual updates of OMANTEL's total training program will be included in appro-
priate progress reports.
Staff Numbers
4.11      At December 1978, the total staff of 952 represented a ratio of
about 45 per 1,000 telephones or 85 per 1,000 DELs. While this is high,
it is explained by two factors; first, the network is very small at present,
there being only about 11,000 DELs, and diseconomies of scale are incurred,
and secondly, there is overstaffing because of the use of untrained or partly
trained staff. It is proposed that the staff ratio be progressively reduced
with a broad target of halving the ratio of staff to DELs by 1990. The
proposed progress towards the 1990 objective is included as item 3 of the
performance indicators shown in Annex 9, which were discussed and agreed upon
during negotiations.
Accounting and Budgeting System
4.12      The accounting system in OMANTEL SAO is on a cash basis and its
finances form part of the government budget. All payments for capital expendi-
tures have been made directly through government channels. OMANTEL will be
operating as an autonomous entity under a fully commercial practice. Some
progress is being made towards improved procedures but the accounting and
budgeting systems are still in need of substantial improvement.
4.13      OMANTEL SAO has begun preliminary works to convert from present cash
accounts to accrual accounts. To assist in the implementation of the full
commercial accounting system, OMANTEL will employ a qualified financial expert
with experience in telecommunications operations. Provision for the employ-
ment of this expert has been made under technical assistance in the proposed
Bank loan and a draft job description has been prepared to assist OMANTEL
(paragraph 4.07 and Annex 14).
Billing and Collection
4.14      The fixed annual rentals are billed in advance and call charges are
billed after they have been incurred.  All bills are paid at OMANTEL SAO head-
quarters or local branches of commercial banks. The billing for local calls
is presently staggered on a quarterly basis while international telephone and
telex calls are billed on monthly basis. For international calls, subscribers
are required to obtain an international account number (IAN) against which
calls are billed; no deposit is required when opening this account with
OMANTEL SAO. The IAN is individual to the subscriber irrespective of the number
of telephones held. Subscribers and the public can also make international
calls by paying cash at the OMANTEL SAO headquarters in Muscat.



- 19 -
4.15      The separate billing process for local and international calls will
be combined and computerized utilizing the computer service facilities at the
Finance Ministry. OMANTEL SAO expects that the computerization of the whole
billing process will be completed during 1980 and this should reduce the
billing cycle from three months to about one month.
Audit
4.16      OMANTEL SAO cash accounts are pre-audited internally and post-
audited on a continuing basis by its internal auditor's office. However, the
internal audit and control has not been effective in the past. To correct
this situation, the job description for the financial technical assistance
provides for the review of the internal audit and control procedures and
helping OMANTEL implement the necessary changes after the commercial account-
ing system is introduced (Annex 14).
4.17      A local accounting firm, Shair and Company, has been the external
auditor of OMANTEL SAO since its inception. However, no audited report has
yet been published mainly because Shair and Company has been involved in re-
writing OMANTEL SAO past accounts to bring them up-to-date. During negotia-
tions, assurance was obtained that OMANTEL would engage an independent
auditor acceptable to the Bank. It was also agreed that OMANTEL would
submit, for FYs8O to 82 its unaudited annual financial statements to the Bank
within six months of the close of the fiscal year and its audited annual
financial statements with auditor's report within eight months of the close of
the fiscal year, as it is considered unlikely that OMANTEL can do better than
this during the next several years. However, OMANTEL should be able to
improve its accounting practice after its staff becomes familiar with the new
commercial accounting system and thereby reduce the time needed for accounts
preparation and consolidation. During negotiations, OMANTEL agreed to submit,
from FY83 and onward, its unaudited and audited annual financial statements
with auditor's report, respectively within four and six months of the close of
the fiscal year.
Inventories
4.18      Stores inventories and a material management system do not exist.
The specification of a system, and its implementation, will be included in
the job description referred to in paragraph 4.07.
Insurance
4.19      In view of the dispersion of OMANTEL SAO assets, and the consequen-
tial diversification of risks, OMANTEL SAO does not insure against fire and
other loss or damage. This same policy will continue in the future and is in
line with the policy adopted by most telecommunications administrations and is
acceptable.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Financial Performance
5.01      There has been no cash surplus since the inception of OMANTEL SAO
in 1975 and deficits up to 1977 have been financed by the Government. After
the two major tariff increases in 1976 and 1977 (paragraph 3.07) and with the
expansion of its services, OMANTEL SAO operating results have been improving
steadily. Preliminary figures for 1978 show a cash surplus of about RO 1.8
(US$5.2) million. A summary of the cash statements of OMANTEL SAO during the
period FY75-78 is given below:
Fiscal Year Ending                         1975       1976       1977        1978

Present Financial Position
5.02      At present, OMANTEL SAO is a management company and does not own the
telecommunications assets it operates (paragraph 4.01). However, to obtain an
assessment of its financial position when it changes over to a 100% government
owned corporation and takes over the telecommunications assets in the future
(paragraph 4.04), a notional estimation of the financial position of OMANTEL
SAO as of December 31, 1979, has been prepared as follows:
(millions)

Accounts Receivable
5.03      The overall level of subscribers' accounts receivable as of
December 31, 1979 is estimated at RO 3.2 million, which is about five months
of the current year's revenues. However, this amount includes overdue ac-
counts which are about three months of the year's billings; this is not
unreasonable given the present quarterly billing system. The management of
OMANTEL SAO is aware of the need to improve its overall accounts receivable
position and is beginning to pursue a rigorous disconnection policy. The
computerization of the billing process is expected to further improve the
accounts receivable position (paragraph 4.15).
5.04      About half of the overdue accounts as of December 31, 1979 belong
to government subscribers. The Government is aware of this problem and has
provided in the FYs79-80 budget for each department special funds which
are earmarked for the current payments of telecommunications services. As
regards the overdue payments, the Government has instructed OMANTEL SAO to
identify the accounts that should be paid and any that may have been written
off. During negotiations, assurance was obtained that the Government would
settle all existing arrears promptly and cause all public agencies to settle
their future accounts within two months of the billing date and that OMANTEL
would maintain the overall level of its accounts receivable at about three
months' billings from FY81 through FY83, and at about two months' billings
from FY84 and thereafter.
Valuation of Assets
5.05      At the time when OMANTEL SAO was formed, the assets of C&W as
of December 31, 1974 were taken over by the Government under a conveyance
agreement of August 2, 1975 and were subsequently valued at RO 1.6 million
(US$4.6 million). Since then, the Government has been directly providing
funds for capital expenditures, but no plant accounts have been kept. In
preparation for the transfer of the assets after the complete ownership by
the Government, OMANTEL SAO has begun the process of evaluating these fixed
assets and stores, and is expected to advise the Bank by June 30, 1980 of
the result of this evaluation.
5.06      Preliminary estimate of the net fixed asset value by OMANTEL SAO as
of December 31, 1979 is about RO 21.7 million (paragraph 5.02). To reduce
possible distortion in future assets value by price inflation on the one hand
and declining unit costs from improved technologies and economies of scale
on the other, the net fixed assets in operation have been tentatively adjusted
to reflect the current value of the assets and revalued on a trial basis, by
4.5% per annum for the forecast period (Annex 19). During negotiations,
assurance was obtained that, starting from FY81, OMANTEL would review and
determine annually the value of its fixed assets and notify the Bank of
the results not later than June 30 of each fiscal year. The purpose of the
review is to determine whether adjustments to the value of fixed assets are
necessary for calculating the rate of return and to assure that, if necessary,
appropriate revaluation would be made in a manner acceptable to the Bank.

Financing Plan
5.07      The forecast of sources and applications of funds is based on
OMANTEL's capital expenditure program for the period 1980-85 and a summary of
the financing plan is given below. Detailed funds flow statements are
presented in Annex 17.

Total Sources                   56.7    164.1      100.0
5.08      During the period 1980-1985, OMANTEL's net internal cash generation
is expected to contribute about 77% of total financial requirements. This
contribution will be supplemented by external borrowings.  For the proposed
project, in addition to OMANTEL's internally generated funds and the proposed
Bank loan of US$22.0 million, the Government will provide for about US$8.0
million from its own resources. The Bank loan of US$22.0 million would
represent about 73% of the total borrowings needed for the implementation of
the proposed project.



- 23 -
5.09      In the financial forecasts, the Bank loan is assumed to carry an
interest rate of 8.25% per annum with ten years repayment including four and
a half years' grace period. Borrowings from the Government are non-interest
bearing and repayable in ten years including a six year grace period; these
terms and conditions are in line with the current practices in Oman for
government loans to organizations similar to OMANTEL.
5.10      During negotiations an assurance was obtained that the Government
would provide funds, on terms in line with the Government's policy and satis-
factory to the Bank, to meet any required foreign or local expenditure neces-
sary to complete the program.
Future Financial Performance
5.11      Financial statements projected for FYs 80-85 are given in Annex
15 through Annex 18. A summary of OMANTEL's future financial performance
is given below:

5.12      OMANTEL's projected financial performance over the project period
is satisfactory. The operating ratio will be about 70%, the current ratio
will be above 2.0 and the debt coverage ratio will be above 6.0 through the
project period.



- 24 -
5.13      No tariff increase is expected to be required during the project
period. The present forecasts show that a 10% rate of return on revalued
assets would be adequate to meet OMANTEL's future financial requirements.
During negotiations, assurance was obtained that OMANTEL's tariffs would be
maintained at levels sufficient to achieve at least 10% rate of return on
revalued net fixed assets in operation, starting from FY81 (paragraph 5.06).
Future Capital Structure
5.14      The Government has decided that the transfer of telecommunications
assets to OMANTEL will take the form of equity. OMANTEL SAO is presently
evaluating the fixed assets and stores associated with its telecommunications
operations (paragraph 5.05) and the final result will be used as the basis to
determine the amount of government's equity to OMANTEL. OMANTEL would trans-
fer its net profits to the Government only after making due allowance for
OMANTEL's requirements for debt service, investment programs, increase in
working capital and allocation for any statutory requirements. During
negotiations, assurance was be obtained that any modification of OMANTEL's
future capital structure would be made in consultation with the Bank.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, assurance was obtained from the Government
that it will:
(a)  promptly settle existing arrears and introduce procedures to
ensure that all government agencies pay current bills within
two months of the billing date (paragraph 5.04);
(b)  make available appropriate funds to cover any financing gap
for the funding of the project (paragraph 5.10); and
(c)  inform the Bank and seek its comments prior to any future
change in OMANTEL's capital structure (paragraph 5.14).
6.02      During negotiations, assurance was obtained from OMANTEL that it
will:
(a)  employ, not later than September 1980, internationally recruited
personnel with technical and financial background, satisfactory                     9
to the Bank, for assistance in the design, specification and
implementation of appropriate management systems (paragraphs
4.07 and 4.13);



- 25 -
(b) engage an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank
(paragraph 4.17);
(c) provide the Bank with unaudited and audited annual financial
statements with auditor's report, respectively, within six
and eight months of the close of the fiscal years for FY80
through FY82, and within four and six months for FY83 and
onward (paragraph 4.17);
(d) maintain the overall level of its subscriber accounts receiv-
able at about three months' billings from FY81 through FY83,
and at about two months' billings from FY84 and thereafter
(paragraph 5.04); and
(e) starting from FY81, review and determine annually the value of
its fixed assets, and notify the Bank of the results not later
than June 30 of each fiscal year. If necessary, appropriate
revaluation of its fixed assets will be made in accordance
with methods acceptable to the Bank (paragraph 5.06).
6.03      During negotiations, assurance was obtained from the Government
and OMANTEL that they will set and maintain OMANTEL's tariffs at levels suffi-
cient to achieve at least 10% rate of return on revalued average net fixed
assets in operation, starting from FY81 (paragraph 5.13).
6.04      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IBRD loan
to OMANTEL of US$22.0 million equivalent for a term of ten years including a
grace period of four and a half years.

2. Local Telephone Services
2.01      The local telephone service is 100% automatic.  The type of
switching equipment is shown in the following table:
Number of           Number of
Equipment Type         Exchanges         Lines Capacity
C 23                    3                  2,700

2.02      The C 23 crossbar exchanges were supplied by Hitachi and are housed
in containers as are all of the exchanges in the network except those at
Mutrah, Greater Mutrah, Qurrum, Seeb and Salalah. The buildings which
accommodate these exchanges are air conditioned and of good quality.
2.03      The step-by-step exchange does not have automatic number identi-
fication and there is no room for expansion in the existing building. Its
numbering does not conform to the national numbering system and it will not
be able to access the new automatic International Gateway exchange.

2.04      The L. M. Ericsson crossbar exchanges have been provided within
the last five years and are in good condition.
2.05      A large number of PABXs (more than 340) of a variety of types are
in use. Most are within the capital area. There is a total of about 7,300
working PABX extensions and about 2,800 extensions to DELs giving in all
about 10,100 additional telephones compared with DELs. That is a telephone
to DEL ratio of 1.9 (21,222 to 11,122).
2.06      The external plant comprises the following cable types:
(a) polythene insulated and sheathed, moisture barrier;
(b) polythene insulated and sheathed, jelly filled; and
(c) self-supporting aerial, polythene insulated and sheathed,
screened.
Primary cables in the capital area are installed in PVC ducts.
3. Trunk Network
3.01      Trunk circuits are generally of high quality and are provided over
coaxial cable (four tube and single tube, small diameter) and microwave
radio. The existing systems comprise of the following:
Coaxial Cable
Mutrah-Azaiba  : 4 tube, 12 MHz
Azaiba-Sohar   : 4 tube, 4 MHz
Azaiba-Nizwa   : 4 tube, 4 MHz
Nizwa-Bahla    : Single tube, 120 ch.

3.02      A domestic satellite system is operating over a leased transponder
in an Indian Ocean satellite of INTELSAT. The main earth station is at
Al Hajar near Muscat. This is the site of the standard earth station for
international traffic. For the national network nonstandard 30 feet earth
stations are located at Al Hajar and Salalah and are being installed at
Buraimi, Saham, Nizwa and Sur. Between Al Hajar (Muscat) and Salalah, 24
SCPC telephone circuits are provided, and TV relaying is possible in either
direction. The other earth stations have "TV receive only" capability.
3.03      There is currently no public telecommunications service to or
within the Musandam peninsula.
3.04      There is a national trunk switching center at Muscat, located in
the main OMANTEL building at Ruwi. It is an L. M. Ericsson ARM 201/2 type
4 wire exchange equipped for 500 incoming and 500 outgoing trunks. At
present 396 incoming and 354 outgoing circuits are operating with traffic of
130 and 125 erlangs respectively.
4. International Telephony
4.01      International traffic is carried primarily over the Indian Ocean,
INTELSAT satellite. The standard earth station is at Al Hajar, 40 kilometers
from Greater Mutrah to which it is connected by a dedicated 1+1 microwave
radio system. The manual international exchange is located at Greater Mutrah
and an electronic exchange is being installed. International subscriber
dialling with automatic message accounting (AMA) will be possible when this
installation is completed, probably towards the end of 1979.
4.02      Traffic to the United Arab Emirate is subscriber dialled, via the
national ARM exchange and is bulk billed. It is carried over the national
system to Buraimi and hence over 24 channel VHF, coaxial cable and microwave
systems to the UAE Gateway exchange at Abu Dhabi.

5.01      The telex network is presently manual with switchboards at Muscat
and Salalah. An electronic exchange manufactured by Siemens is being
installed and should be ready about mid 1980. International telex
links are provided from both Salalah and Muscat.  Siemens electronic tele-
printers are being standardized for the telex network.
5.02      There is no domestic telegraph service.
6. Other Facilities
6.01      Apart from OMANTEL, other agencies operate telecommunications
facilities in the country. The principal such agencies are The Defense
Department and Petroleum Development Oman Ltd. (PDO). PDO operates some
private exchanges and an extensive microwave radio network for pipeline
control and monitoring purposes.

OMAN
OMAN TELECOMMUNICATION CORPORATION (OMANTEL)
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Cost Bases for Items in Development Program
1. General
1.01      The costs for the development program and for the project have
been based on estimates prepared by the telecommunications consultants
who produced the Master Plan. The bases are described in detail in the
report entitled "A Master Plan for the Development of Telecommunications
in the Sultanate of Oman: 1979-1990."
1.02      There are two major roots for the cost estimates.  One is the
general ruling prices for telecommunications equipment obtained through the
Bank's experience with international competitive bids and the second is the
actual prices bid to OMANTEL in international competitive bids over the
past five years.
2. Local Switching and Main Cables and Ducts
2.01      Costs were estimated for different sizes of individual installa-
tions and are reduced to a "per line" basis. The switching equipment allows
for high traffic which is experienced in the commercial areas and for some
tandem switching.
2.02      The external plant is based on unit prices from previous bids
because detailed design work is not yet possible for cable and duct reticula-
tion due to lack of road alignments, etc. Subscribers' reticulation has
been laid out on an "office plan" basis. Junction cables, ducts, manholes
and cabinets are included in the external plant figure. Plant on the sub'-
scribers' side of the "distribution point" is not included.
2.03      Prices are shown in Rials Omani with US dollars in parentheses.

3. Subscribers' Distribution
3.01      Studies in Oman of past installations give an average of four
poles to three subscribers. The cost of a pole plus its hardware and drop-
wire has averaged about RO 30. Installation costs, including transport,
etc.,. add another RO 30 giving an installed cost of RO 60 and a "per sub-
scriber" cost of RO 80. Installation of the telephone instrument is RO 10
for material and RO 10 for labor, etc., giving a total figure of RO 100 or
US$290 per subscriber.
3.02      Additional cost of approximately RO 400 (US$1,160) has been in-
cluded for the terminal equipment for each PCO to be provided. This is
designed to cover the cost of the multi-coin instruments and appropriate
housing.
4. Telex
4.01      Costs of about RO 525 (US$1,500) per line have been estimated for
the telex exchange capacity and about RO 1,000 or US$3,000 per teleprinter.
The additional miscellaneous telex equipment has not been separately esti-
mated as its cost is covered by the unit cost per teleprinter used.
5. Long Distance Transmission
5.01      Transmission system prices have been determined taking into account
the difficult conditions in Oman. The following average prices have been
adopted:

Benefit Period
1.        The benefit period of the program extends from 1980 to 2005, when
on average the equipment provided under the program is expected to have
substantially completed its useful life.
Capital Expenditures
2.        Capital expenditures are based on the estimated requirements during
the program period (1980-1985) excluding preinvestments for the future pro-
gram; preinvestments in 1978-1979 for the 1980-1985 program are included in
the capital expenditures. Price contingencies are excluded.
Operating Revenues and Costs
3.        Incremental revenues assigned to the program are primarily based
on the expected additional telephone and telex subscribers and the traffic
increase brought about by the program. Incremental costs excluding depre-
ciation and interest are based on the additional assets, traffic and staff
requirements expected from the program. All revenues and costs have been
deflated with expected local price increases of 10% per annum to bring them
to the 1979 price level and make them comparable with the capital expenditures.
Net Benefits
4.        A summary of the program's cost and benefit streams at 1979 price
level is given as follows (in million RO):
Capital           Operating            Net

5.        The internal rate of return for the above net benefits stream is
18.0%. No shadow pricing has been attempted because the RO is freely
convertible and the market prices reasonably reflect the true wages in Oman.
Sensitivity Analysis
6.        A sensitivity analysis has been performed with the following
results:
Rate of
Return (%)
10% increase in capital expenditures         16.2
10% increase in operating costs              16.6

OMAN TELECOMMUNICATION CORPORATION (OMANTEL)
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions on the Financial Statements
1.        The Income Statements for FYs78 and 79 are primarily based on
draft pro forma accounts prepared by the management consultants and
OMANTEL, SAO Finance Department. The following paragraphs relate to the
main items of the accounts shown in Annexes 15 to 18, which include
changes reflecting additional information obtained during appraisal.
2.        The estimated number of Direct Exchange Lines (DELs) and telex
lines for the years 1980-1985 are given as follows:
1980    1981    1982    1983    1984    1985
DELs               16,439  18,447  21,043  24,949  28,553  32,482
- Average DELs    14,686  17,443  19,745  22,996  26,751  30,518

Telex Lines           700   1,000   1,200   1,440   1,728   2,074
- Average lines       592      850   1,100  1,320   1,584   1,901
- Net additons        216      300     200      240     288      346
Income Statements
3. Operating Revenues
(1)  Telephone revenues include the following items
(i) Installation charges are projected on basis of estimated
net additons of DELs (paragraph 2 above), and average
revenue per addition in 1978 as follows:
RO 54.100 in Capital Area
RO 50.500 in Salalah Area
RO 10.100 in Interior Area
(ii) Rentals are projected using the estimated average DELs
during the year and an average revenue of RO 81.763.
(iii) Call charge revenues are projected assuming the following
annual growth rates:

(iv)  Other revenues include charges for shifting, disconnections,
reconnections, etc.  An average of RO 3.097 is used with
the average number of subscribers during the year.
(2) Telex revenues include installation charges (based on an average
charge of RO 100 per addition), rental (based on an average rental
of RO 480 per subscriber) and call charges. The call charges are
projected on the following assumption:
(i) National: based on RO 144.458 per average subscriber in
1978 and expected annual growth rate of 50% in 1980, 30%
in 1981, 20% in 1982 and 10% in 1983 and thereafter.
(ii) International: based on the expected annual growth rate
of 45% in 1980, 60% in 1981, 35% in 1982, 25% in 1983 and
20% in 1984 and thereafter.
(3) Telegraph revenues are assumed to remain constant during the
project period.
(4)  Other operating revenues include income from leased facilities
and miscellaneous revenues, and are projected to increase at
8% per year.
4. Operating Expenses
(1) Salaries and wages are projected on the basis of OMANTEL's
estimated staff requirements and an inflation factor of
10% per year.
(2)  Other operating expenses include maintenance, transportation,
administration, etc., and are projected on the basis of
OMANTEL's requirements during the project period, in addition
to the expected annual increase for each category.
(3) Depreciation is computed by using a composite rate of 6% per
year on the average gross plant in operation during the year.
5. Other non-operating income includes interest and other income, etc.,
and assumes an annual growth of 10%.
6. Taxation: OMANTEL, SAO is presently exempted from income tax and customs
duties (paragraph 2.09). The forecast assumes the exemption would continue
with the fully government-owned OMANTEL.

Balance Sheets
7.        Fixed assets are based on OMANTEL's construction expenditure
program during FYs80-85 and the expected completion of the major items
in the investment program for the purpose of calculating rate of return,
the opening value is based on the preliminary results of OMANTEL, SAO
evaluation of existing assets, adjusted downwards by some RO 2 million to
more accurately reflect current costs of equivalent assets. An average of
8.9% is derived from the foreign (7.5%) and the local (10%) inflation rates
weighted by their corresponding foreign and local components of the program
costs. After taking into account the impact of technology improvement and
economies of scale on reducing the prices of telecommunications equipment,
an annual revaluation factor of 4.5% (about half of the weighted average
inflation rate of 8.9%) is assumed in the projection to be applied to the
gross fixed asset value and the accumulated depreciation from FY80 onward.
This revaluation factor is considered reasonable.
8.        Work in progress is projected according to the estimated construc-
tion schedule.
9.        Cash and bank are projected based on OMANTEL's cash operating
expenses and capital expenditures.
10.       Accounts receivable position is expected to improve over the
project period from presently five months of billing to about two months
by FY85.
11.       Inventories are expected to increase at approximately the same
rate as the gross fixed assets in operation.
12.       Other current assets reflect prepayments in respect of property
rentals and sundry receivables, and are assumed to increase at 20% per year.
13.       Equity is expected to increase through retained earnings and
revaluation reserves after the Government takes over the full ownership
of OMANTEL.  As of January 1, 1980, OMANTEL's equity is estimated at RO 29.0
million.
14.       Long-term debts include the proposed Bank loan of US$22.0 million
at an annual interest of 8.25% with ten years repayment including four and a half years
grace period. Also included are interest free funds to be provided by the
Government with ten years repayment including six years grace period.
15.       Current liabilities largely reflects sums to foreign administra-
tions for international traffic. Sundry payables and accounts are also
included. A 15% per year increase has been assumed
