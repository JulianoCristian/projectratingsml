project sustainability was\n            likely, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: a banking system just completing its successful\n            restructuring (as in Ghana) should be expected to undergo an\n            adequate period of consolidation and internal strengthening,\n            before gradually expanding its activities and seeking\n            meaningful contributions to financial deepening. To do\n            otherwise may jeopardize the outcome of restructuring.\n            Meaningful progress in financial deepening and\n            intermediation depends both on sector specific factors\n            (e.g., efficiency of banking system) and macroeconomic\n            performance. In the best circumstances, progress is likely\n            to be gradual and incremental. The ultimate objective of\n            restructuring distressed state-owned banks should normally\n            be their subsequent privatization. The sustainability of\n            restructured banks is not evident until completion of their\n            privatization. In most circumstances, successful and\n            sustainable financial sector adjustment is likely to require\n            more than a one-shot operation, but rather a series (of two\n            or more) over time. Even once the need for resource transfer\n            (from Bank to country, for recapitalizing insolvent banks,\n            etc.) has been met, the need for selective institutional\n            support and technical assistance is likely to continue."}, "docdt": "1997-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
