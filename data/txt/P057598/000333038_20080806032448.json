development outcome was\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: using a sound wholesale financial\n            institution with a strong accreditation unit to appraise\n            participating financial institutions (PFIs), rather than\n            having the Bank review each one, can work satisfactorily in\n            a system where there are many potential PFIs. This type of\n            project is a suitable mechanism for disbursing a relatively\n            large number of loans quickly to the private sector without\n            placing much burden on government. Strong financial\n            institutions with qualified and experienced management and\n            staff at headquarters, branches and field offices, are\n            crucial to project success."}, "docdt": "2008-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
