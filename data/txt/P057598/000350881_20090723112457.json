Third Rural Finance Project for the\n            Philippines had a satisfactory outcome and a moderate risk\n            to development outcome.  The Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, while the borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory.  The main lessons include: A) A\n            government-owned bank within a generally sound enabling\n            environment can reach out effectively and efficiently to\n            rural areas through wholesale operations when other private\n            players are reluctant to take risks in a challenging sector\n            or at a challenging economic time. B) It is important in a\n            rural finance project involving a government owned bank, to\n            analyze explicit and implicit subsidies for both the\n            institution and the sector to ascertain the levelness of the\n            playing field for non-government entrants. C) When poverty\n            alleviation is stated as a micro-finance objective it is\n            difficult to assess achievement without some form of\n            beneficiary impact assessment. D) There is a need for better\n            coordination between the Bank and IFC and resolution of\n            disputed areas of turf before project preparation work."}, "docdt": "2009-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
