        Management Project is to provide an umbrella framework for\n            addressing the highest priority environmental concerns in\n            Poland, and for moving toward a decentralized system of\n            environmental management. The project aims to help establish\n            the institutional, regulatory, and informational basis for\n            immediate corrective actions and longer-term extensive\n            investments supported through bilateral and multilateral\n            assistance. It also aims to reduce health risks, decrease\n            economic costs from environmental degradation and improve\n            environmental quality. To achieve these objectives, the\n            project focuses on the most polluted areas of  Poland, and\n            are designed to serve as models for industrial, air and\n            water management that could be replicated throughout the\n            country as financial resources become available.\n            Specifically, the project will finance technical assistance,\n            training and equipment in support of the following\n            components: (a) policy, management and program coordination;\n            (b) industrial efficiency and environment reviews; (c) air\n            quality management; and (d) water resources management."}, "docdt": "1990-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
