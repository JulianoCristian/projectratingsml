IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
ECONOMIC REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT LOAN
(LOAN 3947-JOR)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Economic Reform
and Development Loan (ERDL) for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, for which loan 3947-JOR
in the amount of US$80 million was approved on October 24, 1995 and became effective on
November 22, 1995.
This single-tranche loan was disbursed on December 22, 1995. It was closed on
December 31, 1996 according to the original schedule. Parallel financing was provided by the
Governments of Japan and Italy.
The ICR was prepared by Christian Petersen, Country Operations Division of the
Middle East and North Africa Region (MN2CO), and reviewed by Adil Kanaan (Division Chief
MN2CO), Laurens Hoppenbrouwer (Principal Country Officer, MN2CO), Jayanta Roy (Acting
Lead Economist, MN2DR), and Tufan Kolan (Acting Project Advisor, MN2DR). The Borrower
provided comments that are included as an appendix to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission in January 1997. The report is based on field reviews and material in the loan file. The
borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by commenting on the draft.
Mr. Adil Kanaan was the managing Division Chief for ERDL. Task Managers
were Chang-Po Yang through December 1995 (Board approval and disbursement) and Christian
Petersen from January 1996 (supervision and the ICR).

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
ECONOMIC REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT LOAN
(LOAN 3947-JOR)
Evaluation Summary
i.          Background. Fifteen years of economic boom in Jordan ended with the fall in the
mid-eighties of the price of oil and subsequent declines in workers' remittances (primarily from
the Gulf), extemal financial assistance, and exports. Average annual growth during 1983-89 was
under one percent. By 1989, Jordan's inability to meet its external obligations precipitated a
crisis which led to an IMF-supported stabilization program and a major Paris Club rescheduling.
With the advent of the Gulf crisis in 1990, Jordan faced the new challenge of disruptions of aid
and trade, and the return of 300,000 Jordanians from the Gulf area, which pushed unemployment
up to about 25 percent.
ii.         Since 1989 the Government has pursued an ambitious reform agenda in order to
stabilize the economy, improve efficiency, and broaden the role of the private sector. Fueled
primarily by a major inflow of savings from Gulf returnees, in addition to external debt relief and
new concessional aid, real GDP rebounded in 1992 with growth of 16 percent. Growth was
about 7 percent p.a. during the period 1993-95, while inflation declined to less than 4 percent.
iii.        In order to support the Government's medium-term macroeconomic adjustment
and structural reform program, the IMF approved two three-year Extended Fund Facilities
(EFFs) in 1994 and 1996, respectively. The Bank supported the program during 1990-94
through a series of adjustment loans for trade, agriculture, and the energy sector.
iv.         The centerpiece of the Bank's assistance under the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) approved on October 24, 1995, is a program of three adjustment operations to support
rapid introduction of structural reform and broad economic development, as well as to
strengthen international reserves.  The program, of which the Economic Reform  and
Development Loan (ERDL) was the first in the series, was phased to help cover the annual
financing gap of the balance of payments (BOP) during approximately four years of reforms.
ERDL was approved by the Board in the amount of US$80 million in October 1995 with parallel
financing of US$80 million from Japan and US$12 million from Italy. It was followed in
December 1996 by ERDL-II. A proposed ERDL-III is currently under preparation.
v.          Loan Objectives. In 1995 the Government accelerated the implementation of its
reform program with a strong focus on open trade and investment regimes, and on creating an
enabling policy and institutional environment to promote growth through private sector
initiatives. The broad thrust of the reform program is based on: (a) maintaining macroeconomic



iii
stability; (b) promoting economic integration with world markets, starting with exploiting
Jordan's proximity to Europe; (c) reforming the public sector and creating a sound environment
for private sector development; and (d) improving the functioning of the financial sector to
promote more efficient mobilization of savings and better investments. The policy actions
supported by the ERDL focused on further liberalization of the trade and investment regimes.
The loan also laid the groundwork for further reforms in the financial and public enterprise
sectors, as well as privatization.
vi.         Within the framework of the reforms, the program for 1996 aimed at:  (a)
sustaining the growth of real GDP at about 6.5 percent; (b) containing inflation to 3.5 percent,
despite the impact of indirect tax increases and reduction in subsidies; (c) reducing the external
current account deficit further to below 4 percent of GDP; and (d) providing for an additional
foreign exchange reserve build-up of about US$155 million, thus bringing official foreign
exchange reserves to about US$620 million (equivalent to about two months of imports) by end-
1996. The overall fiscal deficit was to be further reduced to 4.1 percent of GDP by end-1996.
vii.        Implementation Experience and Results.  The overall implementation of the
ERDL has been highly satisfactory. Since the loan was designed as a single-tranche operation
with prior actions taken before Board approval, implementation of the major conditions was fully
satisfactory as the large majority of policy actions were indeed taken prior to Board presentation.
In some areas, such as the reduction in tariff rates, for some technical reasons implementation
took place after the loan was approved. In these cases the Government, prior to Board
presentation, pre-announced the dates when these policy actions would implemented, and
subsequently met the agreed schedule.
viii.        The macroeconomic objectives for 1996 were broadly met. However, the external
environment proved more problematic than initially envisioned. GDP growth in 1996 is
estimated at 5.2 percent, lower than the initial projection of 6.5 percent, because of adverse
regional developments and tight monetary conditions. The external current account deficit
(including grants) was 3.0 percent of GDP as targeted. Higher world prices and larger imports
were compensated by increases in workers' remittances. On the fiscal side, the budget deficit
(excluding grants) for 1996 is estimated to be 4.6 percent of GDP against a program target of 4.1
percent of GDP. This worsening was caused mainly by the higher world cereal prices which, due
to the subsidized and fixed price of bread, had a direct impact on expenditures. In August the
Government eliminated the subsidy on wheat and fodder, which resulted in a tripling of the bread
price.
ix.         The new investment regime implemented with the support of the ERDL may
already have had a positive impact. The growth rate of real investment is estimated at 11.5
percent in 1996. Private investment as a share of GDP increasedfrom 24.9 percent in 1995 to
27.2 percent in 1996. Trade openness also improved as exports of goods and non-factor services
grew in real terms by 18.4 and 9.3 percent, while imports grew by 8.4 and 10.1 percent, in 1995
and 1996 respectively.



iv
x.          The loan laid the foundations for support of a multi-year reform program
designed by the Government with assistance from the Fund and the Bank. The reform agenda
was broadened and accelerated during 1996 with the support of the second Economic Reform
and Development Loan (ERDL-II).
xi.         Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned.  The
macroeconomic framework remains sound as repeatedly confirmed by the Fund's EFF and the
Bank supervision missions. Nevertheless, there is a risk that the current reform momentum
could be threatened unless BOP support is continued. The risk stems from factors exogenous to
Jordan and beyond the Government's control. Triggered by the peace agreement, residents of
West Bank and Gaza (WBG) are shifting their JD-denominated savings to US dollars. Large
capital outflows in the order of US$200 million p.a. in 1995 and 1996 have caused periodic
speculative attacks on the JD, the most recent in the latter half of 1995. As a consequence, real
interest rates in Jordan currently stand at more than 400 basis points over comparable rates in the
US. The lending rate is currently in excess of 14 percent while inflation is about 4 percent. A
higher level of usable reserves would decrease the risk of repeated speculative attacks, and
potentially create headroom for a normalization of interest rate levels.
xii.        The ERDL was followed by ERDL-II, the second adjustment operation in the
sequence of three envisioned in the CAS. ERDL-11 was approved by the Board on December 1 1,
1996 and disbursed on December 18, 1996. The policy actions associated with ERDL-II have
been strengthened considerably relative to what was envisioned in the CAS and ERDL:
reorganization and computerization of the capital market, privatization of large infrastructure
entities, drafting of six business laws, and innovative facilities for customs clearance.
Preparation for a proposed ERDL-III is expected to start in early 1997, and would encompass
implementation of the new legal framework, sale of large infrastructure service companies,
establishment of a Securities and Exchange Commission, and implementation of other
fundamental financial sector reforms, as well as measures to further develop exports.
xiii.        The overall success of the program supported with ERDL was due to at least
three factors -- timing, flexible design, and client responsiveness: (a) ERDL came at a time when
the Government's reform program was underway. However, exogenous factors, such as the
redemption of JDs held in WBG, meant that the Government needed breathing space to ensure
macroeconomic stability without sacrificing the rapid pace of reform; (b) the single-tranche
design of the sequence of loans, with all policy conditionalities to be met as prior actions,
provided the flexibility to move fast on reforms for which the political climate was ripe; and
(c) client responsiveness, which included funding and sending consultants to the field on short
notice, was appreciated by the Government and contributed to an excellent partnership.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
ECONOMIC REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT LOAN
(LOAN 3947-JOR)
Background
1.          Fifteen years of economic boom in Jordan ended with the fall in the mid-eighties
of the price of oil and subsequent declines in workers' remittances (primarily from the Gulf),
external financial assistance, and exports. Average annual growth during 1983-89 was under one
percent. To maintain consumption levels, the Government approved ever increasing budget
deficits and took on new commercial debt, leading to unsustainable internal and extemal deficits.
By 1989, Jordan's inability to meet its external obligations precipitated a crisis which led to a
IMF-supported stabilization program and a major Paris Club rescheduling. The adjustment and
economic recession reduced real per capita income to about half its 1987 peak of US$2,100.
With the advent of the Gulf crisis in 1990, Jordan faced the new challenge of disruptions of aid
and trade, and the return of 300,000 Jordanians from the Gulf area, which in turn pushed
unemployment up to about 25 percent.
2.          Since 1989 the Government has pursued an ambitious reform agenda in order to
stabilize the economy, improve efficiency, and broaden the role of the private sector. The reform
program has included measures to reduce the fiscal deficit, maintain a competitive real exchange
rate, and restructure the tariff and trade regimes. Fueled by external debt relief, new concessional
aid, but mainly by a major inflow of savings from Gulf returnees, real GDP rebounded in 1992
with a growth rate of 16 percent. Growth was about 7 percent p.a. during 1993-95, while
inflation declined to less than 4 percent. The rebound in domestic economic activity helped
reduce the unemployment rate from its peak of about 25 percent in 1991, but it still remains high
at about 13-15 percent.
3.          In support of the Government's medium-term adjustment and structural reform
program, IMF approved a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in May 1994 (SDR 127
million). After successful completion of reviews under the EFF, in February 1996 the Fund
replaced this EFF, ahead of schedule, with a new extended arrangement in an amount equivalent
to SDR 200 million, which represents 55 percent of Jordan's annual quota.
4.          The Bank supported the program  through an Industry and Trade Policy
Adjustment Loan (ITPAL) in 1990, an Energy Sector Adjustment Loan (ESAL), approved in
October 1993, and an Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL) in December 1994. The
adjustment efforts have also been supported by successive debt rescheduling (March 1992 and
July 1994) through the Paris Club, by a Debt and Debt Service Reduction (DDSR) operation
with the London Club, and by a debt buy-back arrangement with the former Soviet Union.
Official bilateral debt reductions were granted by several creditor countries (US, UK, Germany,



2
France, Italy, and Switzerland among other) in the order of US$800 million. Substantial donor
assistance has been mobilized through three Consultative Group (CG) meetings (January 1993,
May 1994, and July 1996).
5.          In mid- 1994 the Government began preparing a range of new legislation, much of
which started to be enacted in 1995, in order to improve the business environment and attract
private foreign investment. The agenda for creating this enabling environment was outlined
broadly in the Government's Economic and Social Development Plan 1993-1997. The goal is to
consolidate macroeconomic stabilization, deepen and extend trade liberalization and financial
sector reform, and change the role of the state to promote a better climate for competitive private
investments.
6.          In order to further support the Government's reform efforts, the centerpiece of the
Bank's assistance under the CAS approved on October 24, 1995, is a series of three adjustment
operations to support rapid introduction of broad economic reforms and strengthen international
reserves. This program, of which the Economic Reform and Development Loan (ERDL) was
the first in the series, is phased to help cover the annual financing gap of the balance of payments
(BOP) during approximately four years of reforms. The ERDL was approved by the Board in
the amount of US$80 million in October 1995, with parallel financing of US$80 million from
Japan and US$12 million from Italy. This was followed in December 1996 by ERDL-II, and a
proposed ERDL-III is currently under preparation.
Loan Objectives
7.          The Government's broad Reform Agenda. The Government accelerated the
implementation of its reform program in 1995, with a strong focus on open trade and investment
regimes, and on creating an enabling policy and institutional environment to promote growth
through private sector initiatives. The broad thrust of the reform program is based on the
following elements: (a) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (b) promoting economic
integration with world markets, starting with exploiting Jordan's proximity to Europe; (c)
reforming the public sector and creating a sound environment for private sector development;
and (d) improving the functioning of the financial sector to promote more efficient mobilization
of savings and better investments. The policy actions supported by the ERDL focused on
macroeconomic stabilization, further liberalization of the trade and investment regimes. The
loan also laid the groundwork for further reforms in the financial and public enterprise sectors, as
well as privatization.
8.          Consolidating macroeconomic stability was to provide a solid basis for the
Government to pursue structural and sectoral reforms to improve resource allocation and factor
productivity, enhancing the prospects for sustainable long-run growth. To address the underlying
structural imbalances in the internal and external accounts, the Government implemented a
General Sales Tax with a view to eventually move towards a value added tax, thus consolidating
the bias in favor of savings. The Government has implemented and will continue to adopt strong
fiscal adjustment measures, including containment of military expenditures and reforms of public



3
enterprises to boost public savings. Furthermore, the Government improved indirect monetary
control mechanisms, such as open market operations, to reduce the costs of financial
intermediation and to improve the incentives for financial savings. These measures were
intended to promote sustainable long-run growth by consolidating the macroeconomic gains and
reducing, over time, the reliance on external financing.
9.          An open trade regime and greater integration into world markets was
expected to help Jordan meet the challenges of increased international competition, which would
lead Jordanian firms to improve their efficiency and to realize their export potential. In this
regard, the Government adopted a number of policy actions, including reduction and
rationalization of tariff rates, as well as measures to streamline customs administration.
10.         The Government is convinced that long-run sustainable growth of the economy
rests on a growing role of the private sector and a redefinition of the role of the state in the
economy. To this end, Government policy actions focus on three general areas: (a) privatizing
public enterprises and government shares in public shareholding companies; (b) modernizing the
regulatory framework affecting business entry, operation (including pricing policy), and exit; and
(c) strengthening regulatory oversight of utilities and separating policy, regulatory, and
management functions. In support of these objectives, the Parliament adopted the Investment
Law of 1995, an amendment to the General Sales Tax Law, and an amendment to the Income
Tax Law. These measures were Board presentation conditions for the ERDL.
11.         The financial sector was expected to play two major roles: (a) serving as a
facilitator for real sector growth by mobilizing savings and channeling them to productive uses;
and (b) becoming a growth center in its own right. The financial sector would serve these roles
best if it were capable of efficiently providing a large variety of financial services for investors
and savers to choose from. As a growth center, the financial sector would have ample room to
expand and to provide services to the regional economies. The Government's reform agenda
included measures to improve competition, increase efficiency and effectiveness in this sector
and foster the development of long-term finance, both equity and debt, which were not yet
sufficiently available. To this end, the Government formulated action plans for the next five
years in order to: (a) facilitate the development of money markets; (b) further strengthen bank
supervision and establish a sound deposit insurance scheme; (c) facilitate and induce the
development of secondary markets for long-term financial instruments; (d) facilitate the
development of non-bank financial institutions; (e) liberalize the flow of capital through the
Amman Financial Market and other channels; and (f) facilitate the development of contractual
savings institutions.
12.         The ERDL specifically supported trade and investment policy reforms to: (a)
remove the quota-based preferential treatment of goods originating in or going to specific
countries, or convert it into a full-fledged free trade agreement that satisfies WTO rules; (b)
remove import licensing requirements; (c) reduce and restructure tariffs, including the
elimination of the various import fees and surcharges; (d) remove tariff exemptions; (e) establish
a credible path to achieving full long-term trade liberalization; (f) equalize domestic taxes on
imports and domestically produced goods; (g) establish an enabling investment environment and



4
strengthen investment incentives; (h) streamline and rationalize customs administration; and (i)
improve the operations of export development schemes.
Achievement of Loan Objectives
13.         Consistent with the medium-term macroeconomic objectives, the program for
1996 aimed at: (a) sustaining the growth of real GDP at about 6.5 percent; (b) containing
inflation to 3.5 percent, despite the impact of indirect tax increases and reduction in subsidies;
(c) reducing the external current account deficit further to below 4 percent of GDP; and
(d) providing for an additional foreign exchange reserve build-up of about US$155 million, thus
bringing official foreign exchange reserves to about US$620 million (equivalent to about 2
months of imports) by end-1996. Consistent with the macroeconomic objectives for 1996, the
overall fiscal deficit was to be further reduced to 4.1 percent of GDP by year-end.
14.         The macroeconomic objectives for 1996 were broadly met. However, the external
environment proved more problematic than initially envisioned. GDP growth in 1996 is
estimated at 5.2 percent, lower than originally envisaged, because of adverse regional
developments and tight monetary conditions. Liquidity is estimated to have grown by only 2
percent p.a. by end-1996. The external current account deficit (including grants) is projected at
3.0 percent of GDP as targeted.
15.         Exports of goods are estimated to have grown by 8 percent in 1996, while imports
soared at 16 percent. The deterioration of the trade balance was compensated by an increase of
net remittances of 19 percent and net services of 29 percent. Despite the current account deficit
and a large negative errors and omissions term on the capital account, gross official foreign
exchange reserves reached US$697 million by end-1996, better than the programmed level of
US$620 million.
16.         On the fiscal side, the budget deficit (excluding grants) for 1996 is estimated to be
4.6 percent of GDP against a program level of 4.1 percent of GDP. This was caused mainly by
the higher world cereal prices which, due to the subsidized and fixed price on bread, had a direct
impact on expenditures. In August 1996, the Government eliminated the subsidy on wheat and
fodder, which resulted in a tripling of the bread price. The removal of the subsidy was fully
compensated by a cash transfer in the order of JD 1.2 per month per citizen.
17.         CPI inflation (year over year) in October 1996 was 5.3 percent, and is projected to
reach about 6.5 percent (average) by year-end. Developments in prices reflect increases in world
prices of foodstuff, the delayed impact of increases in the general sales tax, and increases in
administered prices following the overhaul of the subsidy system. However, underlying inflation
has remained low at 4 percent, as programmed.
18.         As a result of the reforms the transparency of the trade regime has been greatly
enhanced. Currently, the only instrument of protection is the tariff; import quotas, bans and
licensing have all been eliminated. The average level of protection and the dispersion of tariffs was



5
reduced significantly in 1996 through the partial removal of exemptions and a reduction of the
maximum tariff to 50 percent. Nevertheless, some anti-export bias continues to prevail. To correct
this bias, the Government is continuing to reduce import tariffs and open the economy to foreign
trade. Ongoing negotiations with the EU to establish a reciprocal free trade agreement for
manufactured goods are expected to be concluded this year, and efforts are being made to accede to
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
19.         Trade openness has improved as exports of goods and non-factor services grew in
real terms by 18.4 and 9.3 percent, while imports grew by 8.4 and 10.1 percent in 1995 and 1996
respectively. Thus, despite the slower than initially expected progress in regional trade relations,
trade has increased at a much faster rate than GDP, which grew on average by 6 percent p.a. in
1995-96.
20.         The new investment regime implemented With the support of the ERDL may
already have had a positive impact. Real investment is estimated to have grown at 11.5 percent
p.a. in 1996. Private investment as a share of GDP increased from 24.9 percent in 1995 to 27.2
percent in 1996. Preliminary data for net foreign direct investment show an increase of 50
percent in 1996, although these flows are still at a very low level ($60 million or less than one
percent of GDP).
21.         It is still early to assess the full impact of the reforms specifically associated with
the first ERDL. The loan laid the foundations for support of a multi-year reform program
designed by the Government with assistance of the Fund and the Bank. The reform agenda was
broadened and accelerated during 1996, in connection with the second phase of the Bank's
planned adjustment operations. A full impact analysis will be undertaken once the sequence of
operations is completed, probably in 1998.
Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Loan
22.         Since the loan was designed as a single-tranche operation with prior actions taken
before Board presentation, implementation of the major conditions was fully satisfactory. Due to
technical reasons some policy actions could not be implemented prior to Board presentation.
First, the reduction in tariff rates could be announced only prior to approval of the loan, while
actual implementation was scheduled for January 1, 1996, at the start of the new fiscal year. The
Government did indeed reduce tariff rates according to the agreed schedule.
23.         Second, as part of the policy conditionalities, the Government announced that by
July 1, 1996, it would: (a) adopt "a reference-based price list for import valuation;" and (b) revise
the customs employee incentive bonus system. Both these actions have taken place. Third, in
connection with the implementation of the new Investment Law, the Government completed in
February 1996 the new regulations and by-laws for foreign direct investment, which provides,
essentially, national treatment for foreign investors, except in a few selected sectors.



6
24.         In sum, the Government has complied with the conditionalities specified, and the
implementation record is as fully satisfactory. The Government's commitment to its reform
program and its timely implementation was the most important factor for achieving this result.
The design of the loan as the first in a series of three single-tranche adjustment operations also
provided encouragement and flexibility. Furthermore, the close coordination with the IMF EFF
program ensured consistent and shared program objectives among the Government, the Fund,
and the Bank.
Sustainability
25.         The ERDL was followed by ERDL-II, the second adjustment operation in the
sequence of three envisioned in the CAS. ERDL-II was approved by the Board on December 11
and disbursed on December 18, 1996. The policy actions associated with ERDL-II have been
strengthened considerably relative to what was envisioned in the CAS and ERDL:
.  Privatization.    The privatization program  has been completely re-developed.  A
Privatization Implementation Unit has been established under the direct supervision of a
Higher Committee for Privatization chaired by the Prime Minister. The program now
includes private sector participation in infrastructure investments.   Shares in the
Telecommunication Corporation and Jordan Cement Factories will be sold to foreign
strategic investors. The Jordan Electricity Authority has been incorporated and its two
subsidiaries divested. Private sector concessions and BOO/BOT schemes are planned for the
transport sector.
.  Regulatory Framework.    The new Securities Law will create a Security Exchange
Commission with authority to regulate the securities market, and two private sector bodies:
the Amman Securities Exchange and the Amman Depository Company, both to be fully
computerized. Additional legal reforms include: (a) a complete re-drafting of the Companies
Law; (b) the drafting of a Secured Financing and Leasing Law; and (c) the drafting of a
Competition Law.
* Trade Liberalization. In addition to continued tariff reduction and rationalization, the
Government has undertaken two important steps toward facilitating trade:  a "Green-
Channel" for imports used for export production, and a voluntary pre-shipment valuation
scheme.
26.         Bank projections show that the current financing gap could be closed by 1999.
In the interim, Jordan will need the support of the Bank, the Fund, and the international donor
community. It should be emphasized, though, that provided that the structural reforms stay on
track and are fully implemented, Bank projections show that no exceptional financing gap will
prevail in the medium term. ERDL-III, the third and last adjustment operation proposed in the
CAS, would support the Government to secure timely and full implementation of the reforms.



7
27.         The macroeconomic framework remains sound as repeatedly confirmed by the
IMF EFF and by the Bank's own supervision missions. Nevertheless, there is a risk that current
reform momentum could be threatened unless BOP support is continued. The risk stems from
factors exogenous to Jordan and beyond the Government's control. As a result of the Oslo peace
agreement, residents of West Bank and Gaza (WBG) are shifting their JD-denominated savings
into US dollars. Large capital outflows in the order of US$200 million p.a. in 1995 and 1996
have caused the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) to increase interest rates. There have been
periodic speculative attacks on the JD, the most recent in the latter half of 1995, which forced the
CBJ to raise interest rates by 125 basis points in December 1995/January 1996. At present, real
interest rates in Jordan stand at more than 400 basis points over comparable rates in the US. The
lending rate is currently in excess of 14 percent, while inflation is about 4 percent. The stock
market index has fallen as funds have been moved from productive investments to CDs, and the
excellent investment performance exceeding 33 percent of GDP may slow down, with
consequences for growth and employment. A higher level of usable reserves would decrease the
risk of repeated speculative attacks, and could potentially create headroom for normalization of
interest rate levels.
28.         Jordan has managed its external debt well. Throughout the most financially
difficult period in the wake of the Gulf Crisis, Jordan maintained timely servicing of its Bank
debt. By limiting new borrowing and pursuing debt buy-backs at substantial discounts, and with
bilateral debt relief, the Government has reduced the debt/GDP ratio from 164 percent in 1991 to
105 percent in 1995. With a strong adjustment and structural reform program in place, Jordan is
now entering the ranks of moderately indebted countries according to World Debt Tables
definitions. The ratio of net present value (NPV) of debt to GDP (at 77 percent in 1995) has
fallen below the 80 percent benchmark, the NPV of debt to exports ratio is about 100 percent,
and the debt service to exports ratio would be 13 percent (cash basis), well below the 25 percent
mark at which liquidity concerns arise. Despite a projected slight increase in the debt stock,
which incorporates the increase in lending allocation, Jordan is expected to grow out of its debt
situation. In terms of the NPV of debt to exports ratio Jordan can already be classified as a less
indebted country, while the NPV to GDP ratio would enter the less indebted zone by year 2001,
according to Bank projections.
Bank Performance
29.         A broad multi-year reform program was conceptualized and adopted as an integral
part of the CAS. The Bank assisted the Government in providing the necessary ingredients to
ensure the successful implementation of the first phase of this program. Substantial technical
assistance was provided to estimate the economic impact of the trade liberalization component.
The assistance was coordinated with the work on the subsequent Export Development Project.
The Bank helped mobilize donor support to parallel finance the ERDL in the order of US$80
million equivalent from Japan, and US$12 million equivalent from Italy. Trust funds from IDF
and PHRD were obtained for institutional development and technical assistance. Studies on
banking competition, micro-finance, insurance institutional development and legislation,
portfolio management of pension funds, as well as drafting of new Customs and Safeguard Laws



8
were all completed in 1996. This TA provided essential input for reforms undertaken in
connection with ERDL-II, and will provide the background for further reform initiatives
currently being discussed with relation to the proposed ERDL-III.
Borrower Performance
30.         The collaboration between the Jordanian authorities and the Bank has been
excellent. Technical consultations between the two took place on a continuous basis. The
Government itself proposed the design of the loan as single-tranche with prior actions in order in
have the flexibility to move opportunistically on reform for which the political climate was ripe.
The Government's outstanding commitment to its reform program and its action-oriented
approach to implementation were the most important factors for the successful outcome.
Assessment of Outcome
31.         Achievement of measures  supported  by  the  ERDL  has consolidated
macroeconomic stability, firmly initiated major structural reforms that are transforming the basic
ftunctioning of the economy, and unambiguously laid the framework for further reforms over the
next couple of years. Risks remain, but have been minimized by improving environment and
financial support for resources, see para. 27 above.
Future Operations
32.         ERDL was followed in 1996 by ERDL-II. Preparation is underway for ERDL-III,
the third adjustment operation proposed in the CAS. ERDL-III would support further reform as
well as completion of the reform initiatives currently set in motion.
33.         In parallel with the reforms, the Bank and IFC are working with the Government
to formulate a strategy to directly target poverty alleviation. The Government has embarked
upon a broad program to extend an adequate social safety net to all poor citizens. Furthermore,
the incentives are being improved for Jordanians to take jobs now occupied by foreign workers.
The support system for micro-entrepreneurs is also being strengthened, and a major infrastructure
improvement program for low-income communities is in the making. This program is actively
supported by the Bank and IFC.
Key Lessons Learned
34.         The ERDL was successfully implemented. The following factors contributed to
the success of the program:
* Timing. The ERDL came at a time when the Government was underway with its reform
program, but due to exogenous factors, such as the redemption of JDs held in WBG, needed
breathing space to ensure macroeconomic stability without sacrificing the rapid pace of
reform.



9
Flexibility.  The single-tranche design of the sequence of loans, with all policy
conditionalities to be met as prior actions, provided the flexibility to move fast on reform for
which the political climate was ripe. This design made it possible to broaden and accelerate
the reform pace during the ERDL-II. Given the inherent political uncertainty of the region,
the vulnerability to shifts in portfolio management behavior of holders of JDs abroad, and
world commodity prices, the alternative of using a multi-tranche adjustment instrument
would have been less suitable.
* Responsiveness. The Bank was able to respond very quickly to the Government's needs in
terms of expert assistance and financial support. The responsiveness, which included funding
and sending consultants to the field on short notice, was appreciated by the Government and
contributed to the excellent partnership that currently exist between the Bank and the
Government.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
ECONOMIC REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT LOAN
(LOAN 3947-JOR)
Borrower's Assessment
Background
1.    We endorse fully the World Bank's draft Implementation Completion Report for the
above loan. We believe that all the loan objectives set forth by the government were met in a
timely and efficient manner. We particularly credit the mechanism of single tranche operation
used for this operation which provided the necessary support for completing all necessary actions
in a timely manner.
2.    The excellent cooperation between the concerned government officials and the World
Bank staff that was maintained during the loan preparation and appraisal phases was also
instrumental in developing the reform program which was most optimal in terms of its
implementability as well as beneficial to the economy. The reform program developed under the
ERDL was medium-term in its scope. This design provided us with the required spring-board to
launch the reforms that were subsequently supported by ERDL-II, and the conceptualization of
the proposed ERDL-lII.
Achievement of Major Loan Objectives
3.    Some of the most pertinent loan objectives dealt with trade regime, financial sector
improvement, and private sector growth.  Actions taken under the second phase of the
government reform program and financed by ERDL-II contributed significantly in achieving
these objectives. As a result, the government's economic reform program remained on course
and continued to receive IMF's endorsement through an Extended Fund Facility (EFF)
Arrangement. The fundamentals of this program were continued through ERDL-II in 1996 and
are now well into the implementation phase.
Assessment of Outcome
4.    The success of measures taken under Economic Reform & Development Program is
demonstrated by the fact that the program was sustained with assistance from the follow-up
operation, ERDL-II. A tentative blueprint, of ERDL-II activities was devised at the same time as



12                             Appendix
ERDL-I was designed. The speed and ease of preparation for ERDL-II clearly signify the strong
success achieved under ERDL-1. It was also helpful in building a clear understanding and
appreciation of the social issues and in building a national consensus on the future economic
development program.
5.    Since the direction of reforms supported by ERDL has been formally institutionalized in
the government's economic reform strategy, the risks of a derailment or a pause are really very
minimal. The speed of the reforms, of course, will continue to depend on the availability of
resources during the next two to three years.
Key Lessons learned
6.    The most important factor for the success of this program has been a free and frank
interaction during its inception stage between the government, the private sector and the World
Bank. It clearly shows that the time spent during the preparation stage was extremely useful in
avoiding conflicts and in enhancing the program's sustainability.

Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits
Benefits
The ERDL-II supported the deepening and acceleration of the Government's ongoing economic reform
and development program: (a) strengthened the incentives for export production through reducing the
import costs of capital goods and intermediate goods; (b) benefited domestic consumers by lowering the
costs of imported consumption goods; (c) made GDP and national income growth more resilient to
exogenous shocks; (d) improved resource efficiency and raised factor productivity; (e) helped Jordan to
attract direct foreign and domestic investment; (f) facilitated Jordan's move toward closer trade relations
with the EU and regional economies; and (g) supported Jordan's balance of payments financing
requirements.
An important secondary benefit of the ERDL was its catalytic role in mobilizing other foreign
resources.
Costs: Social Impact
Even though poverty was not directly targeted, the overall impact on poverty of the supported
reform program, and the breathing space the loan provided, is expected to have been favorable as
higher growth in the private sector would create new jobs and expand employment. Movements within
the labor market may however be accentuated in the short term as public sector companies are
privatized. Subsidies, be it for food or housing, have been better targeted. Concurrent with the
Economic Reform and Development Program the Government is pursuing a program to enhance
l"social productivity", which is targeting the alleviation of poverty directly. Program components
include: (a) improving infrastructure in poor areas; (b) strengthening of education; (c) better targeting
of cash transfers; and (d) broader availability of credit to small and micro-enterprises and farmers.
Costs: Budge
The ERDL did not support the Government budget directly, but was a loan directed to strengthen
international reserves of the Central Bank. As such, the funds have not been used for Government
expenditures, but to cover the foreign exchange costs of large capital outflows associated with the shift
in portfolio preferences of citizens of the West Bank. The benefits of exchange rate stability and
averting a BOP crisis dictated by factors exogenous to Jordan are estimated to greatly outweigh the
financing cost of the loan.
