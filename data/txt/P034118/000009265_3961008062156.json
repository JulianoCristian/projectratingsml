The project supports\n            trade and investment policy reforms to: 1) remove the\n            quota-based preferential treatment of goods originating in\n            or going to specific countries, or convert it into a\n            full-fledged free trade agreement that satisfies the World\n            Trade Organization rules; 2) remove import licensing\n            requirements; 3) reduce and restructure tariffs, including\n            the elimination of the various import fees and surcharges;\n            4) remove tariff exemptions; 5) establish a credible path to\n            achieving full long-term trade liberalization; 6) equalize\n            domestic taxes on imports and domestically produced goods;\n            7) establish a business-enabling investment environment and\n            strengthen investment incentives; 8) streamline and\n            rationalize customs administration; and 9) improve the\n            operations of export development schemes."}, "docdt": "1995-09-15T00:00:00Z"}
