Decentralization Project in the State of Monagas\n            was unsatisfactory, the sustainability was unlikely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory and the borrower performance\n            was unsatisfactory. The lessons learned indicated that the\n            absence of coherent sector policies, a supportive legal\n            framework, and an effective institutional structure makes it\n            very difficult to implement a well-designed and fairly\n            limited pilot project. Since private participation in water\n            services is usually politically sensitive, it is important\n            that it is associated explicitly with service improvements\n            for the poor. In an environment of political turmoil in\n            which government officials and staff changed frequently, the\n            management contract provided some stability for the water\n            services in Monagas and produced significant improvements in\n            commercial/financial performance, and service. The failure\n            of political authorities to support a tariff policy in\n            secondary cities of Monagas, undermined the financial\n            viability of Monagas Water and Sewerage. The project team\n            and regional management made adequate concessions and\n            provided an appropriate level of assistance to the\n            government in light of the difficulties it was facing during implementation."}, "docdt": "2002-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
