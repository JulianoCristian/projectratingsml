Decentralization Project in the State of\n            Monagas is to increase the efficiency and quality of the\n            water supply and sanitation (WS&S) services in Venezuela\n            through the development of a model for decentralization,\n            institutional strengthening, and expanded private sector\n            participation. The project has three specific objectives: 1)\n            to assist in the strengthening of Monagas Water and Sewerage\n            Company (AdM), develop its financial self-sufficiency, and\n            involve the private sector in the management and operation\n            of the company; 2) to rehabilitate and improve the quality\n            of WS&S services in Monagas; and 3) to support sector\n            development and decentralization at the national level,\n            including water resources management. The project will\n            include two components to finance: 1) regional institutional\n            strengthening and investment in rehabilitating the existing\n            WS&S systems in the State of Monagas to improve quality\n            and efficiency of service delivery. This component will\n            consist of: (a) institutional strengthening and support to\n            AdM; (b) rehabilitation in urban areas; and (c)\n            institutional development and rehabilitation of rural water\n            systems; and 2) national institutional strengthening, which\n            will include: (a) a technical assistance program; (b) a\n            national training program; (c) a sector decentralization\n            program; and (d) consulting services."}, "docdt": "1996-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
