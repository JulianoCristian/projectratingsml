The key\n            lessons drawn from this project implementation experience\n            include: 1) Coordinating agencies responsible for\n            implementing key activities need to be established and\n            detailed terms of reference developed prior to negotiations.\n            Early establishment of agencies responsible for\n            implementation is recommended. 2) Technical assistance\n            support should include adequate consensus building and\n            knowledge transfer. 3) To avoid delays in the implementation\n            of civil works, special attention should be paid to the\n            timely selection of sites, early preparation and review of\n            architectural designs, especially if the contracts are large\n            in value such as the Faculty of Education contracts under\n            the project. 4) In the early phase of the project, Project\n            Management Unit's performance was not satisfactory,\n            large due to inadequately selected or trained staff. 5)\n            Log-frame and monitoring and evaluation systems must be\n            developed early in the project to assess both project\n            progress as well as achievement of development objectives."}, "docdt": "2000-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
