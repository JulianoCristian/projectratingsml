At\n            the state level, the project will:  (a) streamline state\n            education bureaucracies and help them achieve more efficient\n            use of human resources and a more efficient allocation of\n            spending; (b) increase state and municipal materials; (c)\n            improve state and municipal teachers' skills and\n            classroom effectiveness and the leadership skills of school\n            directors; (d) finance a time slice of the states'\n            school rehabilitation and construction programs, conditional\n            upon states' progress in implementing agreed management\n            reforms; and (e) support promising state and municipal\n            education initiatives through matching grants from a small\n            innovations fund.  The project will also have a component at\n            the federal level to strengthen the Ministry of\n            Education's capacity for key oversight and support\n            functions, such as national standardized student testing;\n            planning, policy and norm-setting; and financial transfers\n            to equalize education spending across states.  Finally, the\n            project will support reform of the centralized national\n            textbook and school lunch distribution systems, in order to\n            assure the timely and adequate availability of learning\n            materials in Brazilian primary schools."}, "docdt": "1993-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
