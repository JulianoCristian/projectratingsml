satisfactory. While\n            overall learning levels in the Northeast still lag behind\n            those of much of the country, some progress has been made in\n            closing the achievement gap between Northeast students and\n            their counterparts in other regions. The lessons drawn from\n            this project include: a) Targets and goals in project design\n            that are operational and relevant to components, objectives,\n            and outputs are important. b) Delays in implementation can\n            partially be attributed on the lack of a unified, coherent,\n            and detailed implementation plan. c) There is the need for\n            bottom-up policies to get directly at improving schools and\n            reaching schools and municipalities. Coordinating a package\n            of improvements, including teacher training, school\n            rehabilitation, or textbooks, is important to improving\n            student learning. d) The project paid substantial attention\n            to including input from the users in developing and\n            designing the management information system. Political will,\n            product \"marketing\", and incentives for use are\n            necessary for a system to be adopted. e) Full knowledge of\n            Bank processes and practice could make product people more\n            aware of the steps necessary to complete the Bank's\n            complex procedures and encourage them to turn in necessary\n            documentation on time. f) Strong monitoring and evaluation\n            systems are important to project success."}, "docdt": "2000-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
