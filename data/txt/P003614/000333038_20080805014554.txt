1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. The Guangzhou project was the Bank's third stand-alone urban transport investment
in China following two loans in Shanghai. The strategic framework for the project was
the Guangzhou Urban Transport Studies begun in 1994. The project was designed to
support three goals of the Country Assistance Strategy (February 25, 1997) by promoting
growth with economic stability, alleviating infrastructure constraints, and safeguarding
the environment. While the CAS evolved over the period of implementation, essentially
the same goals are relevant at the time of completion. The rationale for Bank
involvement was and remains the concern for the negative impacts of rapid urbanization
and preserving the livability of China's third largest city. The Bank offered experience in
five key areas: (i) strategic planning of multi-modal urban transport systems, (ii) impacts
of motorization, (iii) public transport operations, (iv) traffic management, and (v)
transport environmental issues.

2. In 1997, Guangzhou's city-proper population was 4.6 million and growing rapidly
due to a continuing influx of unregistered workers from rural areas. The population
density was extremely high, exceeding 20,000 inhabitants per square km. The vehicle
fleet in 1997 was under 200,000, but growing at over 20% per year, with the number of
motorcycles growing at 30% per year. The decline of the walk mode share was a source
of concern for transport planners. Use of the bicycle, the traditional mode of transport in
Chinese cities, was becoming increasingly restricted and dangerous due to the
progressive expansion of road space for motor vehicles.

3. By the mid 1990s, traffic congestion was becoming an important constraint to
Guangzhou's productivity, as evidenced by increased travel times and higher vehicle
operating costs. Guangzhou lacked a functional hierarchy of streets, which complicated
the task of separating fast-moving from slow-moving traffic. Although the City's first
underground metro line started operating in July 1997 and two other lines were planned
or under construction, road-based public transport (a potentially efficient mode of
passenger transport) was hindered by lack of capacity, slow operating speeds and
outdated equipment and practices. Air pollution from vehicle emissions was a concern
for the health of the urban population. The road accident rate was high with pedestrians
and cyclists especially at risk. The accident rate per million inhabitants was growing at
10 percent per year.

4. The project attempted to address these challenges by promoting a cost-effective and
environmentally-balanced framework for urban transport development. The project was
to add needed infrastructure, promote safer and more efficient use of existing road
capacity via traffic management and improved public transport, and mitigate the
environmental impact. In addition, the project included the strengthening of the capacity
of local institutions to better manage the sector. The project was fully consistent to the
Bank's sector strategy ("Sustainable Transport," 1996), which emphasized the integrity of



                                              1

economic, social, and environmental dimensions of a sustainable transport policy. These
priorities were also consistent with the Bank's urban transport strategy for China
articulated at a major national symposium in Beijing in 1995.1

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5. The principal PDO was to improve the accessibility of the city center of Guangzhou
by promoting the efficient use of the urban transport system in an environmentally
sustainable way. The following outcomes and key performance indicators were included
in the PAD:
    1) Improved level of service and reduced congestion on the City Center road
        network as a result of:
        · Completion of the Guangzhou Inner Ring Road
        · Traffic management.
    2) Increased throughput (in terms of passengers) of public transport corridors within
        the City Center as a result of:
        · Improved management of bus priority lanes; and
        · Development of (new) bus priority lanes.
    3) Reduction in relative levels of air pollution as a result of:
        · The introduction of unleaded gasoline; and
        · A vehicle emissions control program.
    4) Reduction in the relative levels of accidents per capita as a result of:
        · Traffic management measures; and
        · Improved coordination amongst responsible agencies.
    5) Improved effectiveness and efficiency of road maintenance as a result of:
        · Introduction of modernized road maintenance equipment; and
        · Development of a road maintenance system.
    6) Strengthened management capacity of municipal agencies responsible for urban
        transport as a result of:
        · Technical assistance (TA) support and on-the-job training during project
            implementation; and
        · Classroom training and study tours.

6. Under Outcome 1, the completion of the Guangfo Radial Road was added as a key
indicator when the project was amended in April 2003. Specific baseline and targets for
each indicator were not included in the PAD, but were qualitatively described relative to
a "no project" scenario. The definition of the indicators, along with baseline and target
values (presented in Section F of the Data Sheet), were established or refined during
negotiations as follows:
    a. "Increased passenger and freight throughput" was monitored by traffic flows
        (cordon counts) to the city center as bounded by the RR.

                                                2

    b. "Reduced journey times" was monitored using cross-town speeds on a major
       north-south and a major east-west corridor in the p.m. peak period
    c. "Reduced per capital accident rates" was measured by accidents and fatalities per
       10,000 people. An additional indicator for the percentage of accidents involving
       pedestrians or bicyclists was contemplated but never monitored.
    d. "Increased average bus speeds" was measured along a major north-south and a
       major east-west corridor. Public transport "modal share" was originally
       monitored in 8 districts and then 10 districts after 2001. No target was set for
       public transport "ridership" and therefore it is not reported.
    e. "Reduced tailpipe emissions" was altered to measure annual average "ambient air
       quality" in milligrams per cubic meter of NOx and CO, at first in 6 and then 9
       monitoring sites.
    f. "Increased sales of unleaded gasoline" was never monitored despite being
       included in the PAD.
    g. "Reduced unit costs of road maintenance" was never monitored despite being
       included in the PAD.
    h. "Increased percentage of roads in good condition" was refined to distinguish
       between high-speed, primary, secondary and access roads and the methodology
       was changed after appraisal to better conform to local practices.
    i. "Project agencies' satisfaction with training and services received" and "improved
       efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery" were not monitored
       quantitatively.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7. The project was proposed to benefit all residents of Guangzhou to some degree, but
especially those who lived and worked in the city center. Those who traveled into or out
of the city each day would benefit most from the reduction in travel times compared to
what they would have been without the project. About 60% of the Project's economic
benefits were expected to come from travel time savings. The PAD also outlined:
    · The main beneficiary of the Guangzhou Inner Ring Road (RR) were private
       vehicle users
    · The beneficiaries for the traffic management component were private vehicle
       users, bus passengers, bus operators, cyclists and pedestrians
    · Air quality improvements would benefit especially those who lived and worked
       on the most heavily congested streets

1.6 Revised Components

Project Restructuring
9. In November 2002, the MoF formally requested: (i) the allocation of the loan savings
of US$40 million for a new Project component (Guangfo Road); (ii) the further
reallocation of US$12 million of loan proceeds for expanding the traffic management
component to include channelization at major road intersections and installation of the
Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS); (iii) cancellation of US$20
million of the loan due to unused funds (see cost variations in Section 2.2), and (iv)
extension of the loan closing date from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004. The
size of the cancelled loan and the scope of these other changes in relation to thresholds at
the time required the project team to seek World Bank Board approval, which it received
on a no-objection basis allowing the loan and project agreements to be amended in April
2003.

10. The new component consisted of the first section of the Guangfo (Guangzhou-Foshan
Road) Radial Road (5.5 km), connecting the city center of Guangzhou with the nearby
city of Foshan. It formed part of the proposed urban highway network recommended in
the 1994 Guangzhou Urban Transport Strategy study (GUTS) and supported the PDO. It
was fully appraised and found to be economically justified and technically,
environmentally and socially sound. Preparation of the proposal required a full
environmental assessment in accordance with Bank safeguard policies.




                                              4

11. The vehicle pollution control component had the objective to introduce unleaded
gasoline in Guangzhou but was overtaken by a decision of the central government in
1999 to begin phasing out leaded gasoline. As a result, TA funds for this component
were reallocated to purchase of equipment for automatic noise monitoring along the Ring
Road. The final decision to delete the vehicle emissions research function in 2006
reflected the national government's new role in emissions research and standards
development in Beijing. When the project was designed a decade earlier, the national
government's role in setting emission standards had not yet been clearly established.

1.7 Other significant changes

12. There were four approved extensions (the second extension being provisional),
moving the project's closing date a total of four years: (i) from 12/31/03 to 12/31/04,
approved by the Board in April 2003; (ii) from 12/31/04 to 6/30/05, approved by CD on
12/29/04; (iii) from 6/30/05 to 12/31/06, approved by VP on 6/27/05; and (iv) from
12/31/06 to 12/31/07, approved by VP on 12/15/06.

13. First extension: The first extension for one year (from December 2003 to December
2004) was approved to allow the use of the loan savings to help finance construction of
the Guangfo Road and complete the third phase of the traffic management program and
the information technology-based systems for bus management, ring road monitoring and
road maintenance. While amending the project agreement, the Bank emphasized to the
City the full scope of the resettlement and environmental requirements triggered by the
addition of Guangfo Road.

14. Second extension: By September 2004, three months before the closing date
corresponding to the first extension, all procurement was complete except the double-
glazing of windows to reduce noise from the Ring Road, traffic signals, three important
computer-based management systems (traffic control, bus dispatching and tracking, and
road maintenance), and the latest urban transport strategy study (GUTS4). As
disbursement was still very slow, the mission urged the construction commission and the
municipal finance bureau to speed up their review of withdrawal applications. An audit
report for 2003 by the Guangdong Province Audit Office (GPAO) qualified its opinion
for lack of sufficient financial documentation of the Ring Road resettlement activities,
which were financed by the city using counterpart funds (see Section 2.4 under fiduciary
issues). As a result, the Bank granted a provisional 6-month extension to June 2005.

15. Third extension: The Bank approved the one-year extension to December 2006 after
the delivery of an "unqualified" (clean) audit report for 2004. The second and third
extensions were motivated by the disruptions caused by the SARS epidemic in 2003,
which restricted activities in Guangzhou for half a year, and to allow more time to
finalize design of the three management systems. Neither side had foreseen the technical
complexities and delays involving system design and procurement (further described in
Section 2.2).

16. Fourth extension: A final extension of one year was requested and approved in
December 2006, which moved the closing date to December 31, 2007. This extension


                                              5

was requested to allow the client to fully utilize the loan and complete four remaining
components deemed important to the achievement of the development objective: (i)
provision and installation of air quality inspection equipment (US$2.8 million), (ii)
construction of a noise barrier adjacent to the Guangzhou City Zoo (US$0.9 million), (iii)
consultants services for the second phase of the Guangzhou Urban Transport Strategy
(US$2.0 million), and (iv) provision and installation of the traffic control and surveillance,
bus dispatching and monitoring, and road asset (maintenance) management systems
(US$7.2 million). The Bank also agreed in August 2006 to increase civil works
disbursement percentages from 43% to 85% at the client's request, although the
remaining amount of civil works was small.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

17. The quality of the project at entry was satisfactory. This was also the conclusion of
QAG's overall assessment of quality at entry in 1999 (QEA2), although it rated the "lack
of any assessment of executing agencies' capacity" as unsatisfactory. Lessons from
earlier operations (notably the two urban transport projects in Shanghai) and early
preparation activities (e.g. GUTS) were taken into account in designing a comprehensive
package of urban transport components. Risks associated with GMG's limited
experience with public transport reforms, emissions testing, and traffic management were
noted in project documents. The project design attempted to address the required
capacity building by including an institutional development component and various
studies under each of the other components (see Annex 2). An adequate participatory
process involving project affected people, road users, neighborhood and working groups
was used to mitigate risks.

18. It took nearly four years from the first mission to loan negotiations in 1998. Project
preparation was suspended when senior officials in the national government questioned
whether it was appropriate for Guangzhou to take on an international loan for urban
transport, which would not directly generate revenue for repaying the loan. During this
time the City prepared its first urban transport strategy (GUTS), followed by a more
detailed strategy (GUTS2), with substantial help from an international consultant and
extensive Bank supervision.

19. The executive project summary (i.e., project concept note), and later the PAD, made a
cogent case for a comprehensive approach to addressing Guangzhou's transport problems
and the national government eventually approved the approach. The project documents
also stressed that a sustainable coordination mechanism across the many City agencies
would be essential to the success of the project. It gave traffic management and road
safety pride of place in the project composition. The implementation of the first phase of
the traffic management improvements was covered by a dated covenant (18 months from
the date of loan signing to completion).




                                              6

2.2 Implementation

20. The implementation of the project was generally very successful, but it is important to
note the significant delays with non-road components and cost variations. The Ring
Road (representing over 80% of the investment) was largely complete and open to traffic
in January 2000, less than 2 years after construction began. The last ramps were opened
by mid-2000. The original schedule allowed five years for project implementation, but
soon after construction started the City decided that faster implementation would reduce
the exposure of residents to construction noise and traffic disruptions and offered the
contractors substantial financial bonuses as incentives for early completion (including
sizeable overtime). Bank supervision specialists were initially concerned by the
accelerated implementation plan because (i) it was decided upon without prior
consultation with the public or the Bank (per agreement), (ii) it could negatively affect
the quality, cost, and environmental impact of construction, and (iii) it could affect the
progress of the other project components. Nevertheless, later supervision missions rated
the overall construction quality as "commendably high" and the project was responsive to
requests for noise mitigation measures and detailed cost documentation.

21. On the other hand, the construction of Guangfo Road experienced initial delays
because of (i) funding eligibility and (ii) late possession of site due to resettlement issues,
which were eventually resolved (see Section 2.4 for more detail), and (iii) technical
complications with bridge construction and geological conditions. Guangfo Road
included the construction of four large bridges across the Zhu (Pearl) River, a viaduct
across an island in the middle of the river, bus priority lanes, and lanes and intersection
arrangements for cyclists. Guangfo Road was completed in 2005, about one year behind
the original schedule.

22. The Ring Road experienced significant cost variations from appraisal to completion.
The total bid price was less than 50% of the engineering estimate used in the project
appraisal. This difference was due to the use of Chinese Government unit costs for civil
works (rather than actual market prices) and the Bank's suggested method of
incorporating contingencies for price and physical quantities. Until 2005, inflation had
been less than expected so contracts awarded in the later years of project implementation
were at lower prices than had been expected at appraisal. However, the final construction
cost was about 50% higher than the bid price primarily because of: (i) major design
changes including two additional lanes of traffic and structural redesign; (ii) low-noise
porous asphalt concrete was used throughout instead of only at sensitive locations as
originally planned; (iii) additional geotechnical work; (iv) additional payments to
contractors for overtime work; and (v) incentives to contractors for quality and advanced
completion. Nevertheless, the cost overrun from bid price to completion did not affect
the EIRR of the project as it was still less than the estimate at appraisal.

23. There were significant schedule delays with most non-road infrastructure components
because of technical problems and an initial lack of capacity. A Quality of Supervision
Assessment in 2006 (QSA7) also concluded that a lack of ownership by the borrower
"turned out to be a shortcoming that was later to affect implementation of the non-civil
works components of the project." The mid-term review in April 2001 focused on the


                                               7

progress and challenges to the traffic management, public transport, vehicle pollution
control, road maintenance, and institutional components. The SARS epidemic in 2003
affected the planned supervision of these components, justifying two extensions. The
repeated delay of most of these "soft" components was the justification for a reduction in
the implementation progress rating to "moderately satisfactory" in December 2006. The
most important factors influencing the implementation of the non-road components are
described below.

a) Unexpected technical issues or challenges
    (i) Traffic Management -- the Ring Road traffic control system went through an
    extended decision-making period of over one year to define an implementation
    approach that would reconcile the proprietary technology of the existing traffic light
    system with open bidding for its expansion. The project considered the adoption of
    North American or United Kingdom interface standards, which would affect the
    eligible suppliers and the technical compatibility with the current system and future
    generations of traffic signals, but in the end, adopted no international standard for its
    two centers.
    (ii) Bus Depot - Technical problems, clearances, and new building codes for a waste
    water treatment facility and refueling station at the Longxi Bus Depot caused repeated
    delays.
    (iii) Geological conditions-- Construction of the bridges for Guangfo Road was
    complicated by the discovery, during detailed geotechnical investigations, of a
    number of karst caves in the river bed beneath the intended bridge foundations.

b) Contractual and procurement issues
    (i) Traffic Management and Surveillance -- The design was initially delayed by
    performance problems with the local consultant hired to prepare the technical
    specifications. The systems were also delayed by a discussion of the procurement
    approach that lasted well over one year. The City's consultant recommended a
    design-build contract, whereas the Bank team questioned whether bids for
    construction could be feasible and effective before the design was finalized.
    (ii) Maintenance Management Systems ­ After a prolonged discussion period of over
    one year, the City decided to package the road, bridge and drainage maintenance into
    a single integrated system but procurement was split into three contracts: (1)
    equipment for the initial development phase, (2) design consulting services, and (3)
    equipment for long-term system use. In the end, the Bank provided an experienced
    international consultant to assist with procurement.
    (iii) Pollution Control -- Although not financed by the Bank loan, the construction of
    the motor vehicle emissions control building affected the installation of the Bank-
    financed monitoring equipment due to repeated delays in site preparation and the
    bidding of design and consulting services. It was eventually completed in March 2005.
    Bank missions identified a lack of PO staff for this component as one reason for the
    delay.




                                               8

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

24. The M&E program was designed on a comprehensive set of indicators corresponding
to six outcomes (summarized in Section 1.2). The loan and project documents specified
the following M&E activities in addition to regular supervision missions by the Bank,
which were generally observed by the PO:
    · Annual project reports with performance indicators (see Section F of Data Sheet)
    · Joint review of progress annually and near project mid-term (2001)
    · Submittal of monthly progress and disbursement reports, and quarterly reports of
         planned and actual progress for each component (cost and physical works)

25. The project was being implemented in a city undergoing unprecedented levels of
change (annual growth of 12% from 2000 to 2005 resulting in a doubling of the GDP per
capita to US$8,500). The administrative boundaries of the urban area were changed in
2001 resulting in a 35 percent net increase in population. In the case of the Inner Ring
Road, the performance indicators were structured to measure the impact of the road in
reducing traffic in the city center. In reality, economic development patterns in
Guangzhou eclipsed all expectations and by 2001, traffic volumes into the City Center
were above projections. In fact, the Bank and PO agreed to stop monitoring the indicators
for improved level of service and reduced congestion (#1, 2 and 3) after 2001 because of
their limited usefulness in the context of overwhelming growth and high cost. Though the
Ring Road diverted some through traffic, economic development generated additional
traffic into the center. It is safe to say that the Ring Road played a role in facilitating the
continued economic development and congestion today would have been much worse
without the project. In hindsight, a performance indicator that focused on the amount of
traffic diverted to the Ring Road from the city center (rather than the absolute levels of
traffic into the city center) may have been a better proxy for capturing the facilitating
impact of the Ring Road.

26. Utilization of the M&E data was somewhat limited because of: (1) problems with
realism or reliability of the data and (2) the reports were sometimes submitted late or
incomplete. A Quality of Supervision Assessment in 2006 called for "a more critical
examination of the realism of the indicators and interpretation of data."

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

27. The project was classified as a Category "A" because of substantial new construction
and involuntary resettlement. Environmental Assessments (EA) were carried out for the
RR, Guangfo Road, and the Longxi Bus Depot, and were reviewed by both the Chinese
State Environmental Protection Agency and the World Bank.

Environmental Impacts
28. Although there were initial concerns about the environmental impact of the
accelerated construction of the Ring Road, the Project has met all requirements and
greatly expanded the scope of the mitigation measures from appraisal. The widening of
the RR design from 4 lanes to 6 lanes in some segments caused noise levels for nearby



                                                  9

residents in excess of design standards, requiring installation of additional noise barriers.
This took several years to complete, partly because the City wanted to investigate
alternative designs. Noise barriers are now widely used in China but were new at that
time and, as such, these investigations were not unreasonable. The noise barriers
recommended in the original EAP totaled 1,860m, but were expanded many times over
using local funds to accommodate design changes during construction and requests from
those affected. In early 2002, the City, in response to continued complaints, adopted the
policy to pay for double-glazing windows and improved ventilation in the remaining
residential units where the noise standards were not met, eventually installing these in
about 5,000 housing units. New trees, shrubs, flowers and grass were planted at ground
level below the Ring Road to improve the aesthetics. Air quality monitoring showed
marked decreases in the ambient levels of NOx and CO concentrations. Residents have
expressed full satisfaction with these measures.

Resettlement
29. The mid-term review praised the high quality of the resettlement actions taken and
satisfactory indicators. It achieved the basic objectives of: (i) compensating Project
Affected People (PAPs) for their losses at replacement cost prior to the actual move; (ii)
assisting with the move and providing rehabilitation during the transition period in the
resettlement site; and (iii) assisting PAPs in their efforts to restore their former living.
The key factors supporting the favorable outcome were:
    · Good institutional arrangements and capacity of staff
    · Supportive leadership and availability of funds
    · Effective coordination with major agencies and stakeholders
    · Systematic program of consultation with PAPs and their participation
    · An innovative computer program that facilitated implementation

30. On the other hand, the financial and internal management of the resettlement program
was inadequate. The original plans expected construction of the Ring Road to take four
years, but it was actually built in less than two years. Resettlement activities had to be
completed in 1999 before the civil works could start, but internal processes and financial
controls were not in place. Fifteen thousand households, shops and businesses were
moved in less than one year. Though the vast majority of displaced persons were satisfied
with the outcome, audits found that financial controls were lacking as a consequence of
the expedited schedule (see fiduciary section below).

31. The total cost of implementing the RAP reached US$525 million-- more than three
times larger than the US$161 million estimated at appraisal. It is important to note that
all resettlement work was funded by the client. One reason for the cost increase was a
rapid rise in land costs, but a 2003 financial management audit of the resettlement
program also pointed to the following reasons, which have been largely addressed in the
City's current resettlement practices:
    · Initial differences between the compensation policies of the World Bank and the
        local government, which were appropriately reconciled
    · Lack of appropriate resettlement management and supporting systematic
        regulations and procedures


                                               10

    · Lack of effective internal controls, communications, and training for the multi-
        layer organizational set-up
    · Lack of proper financial management structure and disbursement arrangements,
        or effective internal and external monitoring mechanisms

Fiduciary
32. While there were no issues with the financial management of Bank-financed works,
the audit for 2003 conducted by GPAO flagged serious shortcomings in the financial
management of resettlement activities financed by the borrower. These shortcomings,
which have since been resolved, included:
    · Lack of land certifications for certain areas to which the households were moved
    · Lack of housing certifications and supporting evidence
    · Discrepancies between the reported size of land areas paid for and what actually
        changed hands
    · Lack of supporting documents for the resettlement contracts with affected people
        and the compensation amounts paid

33. The audit for 2004, although unqualified, pointed out that the Guangzhou Road
Expansion and Engineering Office (GREEO) had acquired new housing (apartment
buildings) to receive the displaced people but not all units had been occupied by
households displaced by this project. The Bank's financial management review
(including the 2004 audit) concluded that record keeping was adequate and financial
management of the loan was satisfactory. By the time that the Bank was reviewing the
request for the final loan extension in 2006, an unqualified audit for 2005 had been
accepted by the Bank's financial management specialists and the issue was closed.

Procurement
34. Procurement was generally successful and fully compliant with Bank rules. However,
there were significant issues and contract variations (described in Section 2.2), due in part
to the client's unfamiliarity with the implementation of new and complex technologies
(including for road maintenance, traffic management and public transport) and the Banks'
procurement guidelines. There were several unsuccessful procurements or contracts for
consulting services that did not meet or deliver on the requirements, including a road user
education program, air monitoring equipment (eventually replaced by noise monitoring
equipment), and hybrid buses for a demonstration project (eventually scrapped). The
difficulties in designing and procuring three computer-based management systems were
only resolved with the involvement of Bank-hired specialists with international
experience with such complex systems.

35. Guangzhou made the Bank aware of one particular case of fraudulent procurement
practice for a small sub-component during a supervision mission in February 2007. The
case involved the use of sub-standard materials by the contractor for a pedestrian
information system. The client cancelled the contract as part of a zero-tolerance policy
on fraud and corruption (valued at about US$2.7 million) and barred the contractor from
participating in future bids for contracts financed by Guangzhou Construction
Commission. By the time the contract was cancelled, the closing date was imminent and



                                              11

the contract was ultimately not financed by the Bank. The Bank's task team supported
the client's investigation by (i) hiring a consultant to provide evidence and (ii) reporting
the case internally on October 25, 2007, although no subsequent Bank action has been
taken.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

36. The important road network investments financed by the project (including the Ring
Road and Guangfo Road) are being successfully operated and maintained. The budget
for operations and maintenance is adequate. However, several contracts remained open
after the project closing date including (i) the GUTS4 implementation study, (ii) traffic
management equipment, and (iii) the road and bridge management system. GMG agreed
to take responsibility for completing these contracts and for contract payments related to
activities undertaken after the closing date.

37. Well before the original completion date, the City expressed interest in a second
Bank-supported urban transport project. It would require an update of the City's urban
transport strategy, analysis of the new demand for urban transport reflecting the shift in
modal shares (more cars, less biking and walking), and review of the strengths and
weaknesses of current practices. In April 2005 the head of the PO formally conveyed to
the Bank its interest in securing a second loan to support Guangzhou's urban transport
development plans, but no formal decision by the central government was made. The
Bank has agreed to review the GUTS4 study once completed (expected by end of 2008).

38. In 2007, Guangzhou entered into dialogue with the Bank's GEF-supported program
for urban transport development in China and qualified as one of the demonstration cities.
Given that the amount of the GEF grant is relatively limited, the program is intended to
carry out key studies and pilots that can help demonstrate the positive impacts of
innovative practices in mitigating GHG emissions and help pave the way for scaling up
those initiatives through major investments.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

39. The project was and remains fully consistent with the country's development
priorities to relieve infrastructure bottlenecks and foster economic growth. It was also
consistent with the Bank's urban transport strategy ("Cities on the Move," 2001) and,
later, with the most recent China urban transport strategy ("China: Building Institutions
for Sustainable Urban Transport," 2006). Both of these Bank documents emphasized that
the impacts of rapid motorization can be dealt with on a sustainable basis only by a
comprehensive set of actions, going beyond new road infrastructure, all of which were
included in the design and implementation of the project:
    · Improvement of public transport services,
    · Facilities for pedestrians and cyclists (particularly the poor and other vulnerable
        groups),



                                              12

    · Non-physical ways to derive greater flow capacity from existing streets (traffic
        management),
    · Restraints on car use (such as paid parking), and
    · Institutional development.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

40. The project is rated satisfactory because it was generally successful in delivering the
anticipated objective of promoting the efficient use of the urban transport system in an
environmentally sustainable way, as detailed below.

    a) Improved level of service and reduced congestion on the City Center road
        network-- Satisfactory
41. The project has successfully achieved this objective by implementing an elevated
Ring Road within schedule and under budget, without sacrificing quality or environment
for nearby residents. Guangfo Radial Road was also successfully implemented. The level
of service in the city center has improved as measured by indicators of cross-town speeds
in north-south and east-west corridors during the p.m. peak (33-49% increase from 1998
to 2001). Congestion however does not appear to have been reduced as traffic volumes
in the city center bound by the Ring Road were already above forecast in 2001. The
performance indicator for congestion was undermined by higher than expected economic
growth resulting in faster than expected motorization.

42. Traffic management measures are working satisfactorily. Observers report a distinct
improvement in the general discipline among Guangzhou's road users, due in part to the
channelized intersections and coordinated traffic light systems. Left turns (the most
disruptive of traffic movements) are appropriately restricted by median dividers or
controlled at intersections by having their own green phase in the traffic light cycle, with
left-turn bays so that vehicles waiting to turn do not obstruct other vehicles. The
channelization at intersections carried out under the first phase of the Traffic
Management component was one of the first demonstrations of such low-cost and
effective techniques in China.

    b) Increased throughput (in terms of passengers) of public transport corridors
        within the City Center-- Satisfactory
43. Public transport mode share of total trips has grown from 16% to 23%, meeting the
target. Average speeds in bus corridors have increased by 63%, greatly surpassing the
targets. This was due to improved management of existing bus lanes and development of
new bus lanes. The adoption of the fleet management system in Guangzhou has been
exemplary. The implementation included revisions to business practices and institutional
arrangements, and has achieved outstanding results in terms of the reliability and
sustainability of operations. The system is currently owned and managed by the city,
which gets information from it to help monitor operations. All the operators use the
system for planning and monitoring, and passengers have benefited from the improved
performance. This kind of "win-win" situation requires very careful structuring, and the
Bank's role in nurturing it reflects real value-added.



                                              13

    c) Reduction in relative levels of air pollution-- Satisfactory
44. Measured ambient concentrations of nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide have been
reduced well beyond the original target reduction of 10%. Observers have also noted that
the exposure of people to air pollution from the traffic in the city center has probably
been reduced because vehicles on the elevated ring road are farther away from the people.
One can also deduce that vehicles are traveling at closer to ideal speeds and steady flow
conditions (i.e., less `stop-and-go' traffic) thus emitting fewer pollutants. These outputs
can be attributed in part to the additional infrastructure and traffic management measures
(including better road maintenance practices) implemented by the project that helped
enhance traffic flows and efficiency (such as channelization and signalization) and
general driving conditions.

    d) Reduction in the rate of accidents per capita-- Satisfactory
45. Provisions for cyclists and pedestrians required some fine-tuning but have been
successful. Pedestrians are safer at intersections due to dedicated traffic lights and signal
phases, raised `islands', and footbridges. The benefits are confirmed by the reduction in
the number of per capita traffic accidents by 25% and fatalities by 55%, which have
surpassed their targets.

    e) Improved effectiveness and efficiency of road maintenance-- Satisfactory
46. The shares of primary and secondary city roads in `good' or better condition have
both increased to 91%, although the measurement methodology changed during
implementation. The share of primary roads in particular has surpassed its target as a
result of the introduction of modernized road maintenance equipment and the
development of a road asset (maintenance) management system.

    f) Strengthened management capacity of municipal agencies responsible for urban
        transport--Satisfactory
47. The institutional rationale for the project to help the City coordinate the many
agencies implementing different parts of this comprehensive project has been largely
achieved despite delays early on (see also Section 3.5(b)). A Project Leading Group
(PLG), chaired by a vice-mayor, initially performed the coordination role though it lost
momentum and focus with time. The Construction Commission eventually drove much
of the project implementation, which was dominated by the Ring Road. While this
arrangement was not initially effective in advancing non-road components, the
Construction Commission eventually formed productive relationships with line authority
agencies including the traffic police, managers of bus services, environmental protection,
and resettlement. For example, missions noted that working relations with the
Guangzhou traffic police, the lead agency for the traffic management component, were
excellent.

48. The project also financed extensive amounts of training (both on-the-job and
classroom) and study tours (domestic and international) that had the desired effect of
strengthening the capacity of the personnel and agencies involved. In all, this project
component financed 28 technical assistance contracts, 15 investigations, and 191 training



                                               14

events (including to Curitiba, Brazil and Bogotá, Colombia). Hundreds of senior and
mid-level officials have directly benefited from Bank training.

3.3 Efficiency

49. A traditional cost-benefit analysis was used by the Bank at appraisal to evaluate the
two largest components of the project investment, the Guangzhou Inner Ring Road and
the Traffic Management Component. The economic efficiency measures for both are
shown in the table below. The decrease in the net present value and economic rate of
return for the RR is attributed to the large increases in the scope and costs of civil works
(widening of Ring Road and addition of Guangfo Road), resettlement program, and
environmental mitigation (see Sections 2.2 and 2.4 for additional details). Annex 3
provides more detail on the economic analysis.

                                                 PAD                  ICR
            Guangzhou Inner Ring Road
            NPV (12% discount)             US$351 million       US$147.9 million
            ERR                                 34.1%                 14.3%
            Traffic Management Component
            NPV (12% discount)             US$49 million         US$15.2 million
            ERR                                  35%                  18.3%

50. The economic evaluation in the PAD and at completion used traffic forecasts from a
typical four-stage urban transport model with fixed trip matrices developed by
consultants for a "do-nothing" and "with project" scenarios. The PAD also described the
sensitivity analyses carried out separately for the Traffic Management and Inner Ring
Road components with respect to the some key variables: (i) the level of motorization;
(ii) rate of economic growth for the city; (iii) delays in completion of construction; (iv)
cost overruns; and (v) alternative design standards (4 lanes or 6 lanes of traffic
throughout). No values of these key variables were found to produce a negative NPV or
an economic rate of return of less than 12%.

51. The analysis of the fiscal impact of the project found GMG's financial capacity
adequate to meet implementation cost (including debt finance and ongoing maintenance
costs) and it continues to be the case with ongoing operations and maintenance costs.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

52. The combination of the project relevance, achievement of PDOs and efficiency
described above justify an overall outcome rating of satisfactory. The project has
substantially achieved its main objective of promoting the efficient use of the urban
transport system in an environmentally sustainable way despite considerable delays.
Though their utility is limited by the unprecedented changes in context during the
extended project period, the performance indicators for traffic safety, air pollution, public




                                              15

transport generally confirm the project's success. The projects institutional objectives
were also substantially achieved.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

53. Nearly 10,000 households and 4,800 shops and enterprises were relocated as part of
the resettlement of the project. This was the biggest resettlement project in the history of
urban construction in Guangzhou. Almost all PAPs were pleased with their new and
larger apartments, which, for the first time for many households, had their own kitchen
and bathroom. The new dwellings were on average 20-35% larger than the old homes
(16 m2 more floor space). The new communities had better environmental conditions (air
quality and vegetation, etc.) as well. Restoration of livelihood was at least as good as the
control group, except initially for a small number of unskilled workers and small
shopkeepers. The financial management issues were eventually resolved to the Bank's
satisfaction. The scale and quality of the standard of living improvements as a result of
the resettlement program have been substantial.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

54. The institutional capacity of Guangzhou to successfully implement a large and
complex project was also greatly improved by the following developments:
a. GUTS was the foundation of the investment and urban development strategy for
    Guangzhou for nearly a decade and a model many other Chinese cities have emulated.
    The follow-on efforts (GUTS2, 3 and 4) demonstrate a great deal of city ownership
    and the sustainability of the strategy. The current GUTS is expected to be completed
    in 2008 and will embody three principles fully consistent with the Bank's
    development partnership strategy for China.: (1) comprehensive urban planning, (2)
    demand management to help solve transportation problems, and (3) `putting people
    first' (the title of the current Chinese government policy on urban transport).
b. The discussions with the Bank team during preparation laid the foundation for
    Guangzhou's public transport reform. The adoption of a franchised model regulated
    and controlled by the city is more or less what the Bank had envisioned and reflects
    international best practice.
c. The traffic management component reflected the first time in China that the police
    and construction personnel worked out solutions to traffic problems in a coordinated
    manner. This was a model not just for Guangzhou, but other Chinese cities as well.
d. The resettlement management software was a major innovation, which has been used
    elsewhere in Guangzhou in other projects.
e. Guangzhou greatly values the capacity built in the PMO with respect to project
    management, financial management (particularly for resettlement), and procurement.
    The office is now in charge of special projects and is seen by the Bureau for
    Municipal Management (where it is now housed) as an important asset.
f. The project showed the need to plan for dealing with environmental impacts not just
    during the construction phase of infrastructure but on a continuing basis during
    operation. As late as June 2005, five years after the Inner Ring Road was opened to
    traffic, new noise mitigation cases were still being reported by residents and a health


                                               16

    care facility. As a result, the City needed to retain the capacity to respond
    appropriately many years after the RR had opened to traffic.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Not applicable.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

55. Guangzhou is becoming an international city of great importance, but it faces some
uncertainties with regard to the project's objectives as it continues to grow. First, traffic
volumes will continue to increase as more people and cars crowd the roads. Growing
congestion in the ring road is almost certain, but would have been far worse without the
project. The indicators suggest that the project struck an appropriate balance of
increasing the supply of roads with public transport and traffic management investments.
Further capacity building and balanced urban transport investments will be required to
ensure that the mobility and accessibility in the city center are not degraded over time.
Second, the impact of motorization on the supply and safety of facilities for non-
motorized and public transport modes is also an issue that requires the continued
attention of the public authorities.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

56. The quality of the Bank performance at entry was satisfactory. The project's
objectives and design were closely aligned with both the government and World Bank
strategies for urban transport. The Bank facilitated the planning and preparation of a
balanced and comprehensive project. The project's technical assistance components have
brought about great progress in terms of institutional capacity and plans. A few minor
deficiencies are also noted in the following:
· The PAD correctly recognized but perhaps could have better mitigated the risk of
    delays in implementing non-road investments in a complex project in light of the
    experience in Shanghai where, " ... supporting traffic management and public
    transport facilities have so far seen only limited implementation. Weak
    implementation of these components is partly due to lack of ownership of designs
    produced largely by foreign consultant assistance and partly due to the fragmentation
    of responsibility across agencies." Other critical risks identified in the PAD, while
    appropriate, were not thoroughly described. For example, the risk for "local
    government support for any project activity erodes" is vague and went unrated.
· A Quality at Entry report from 1999 observed that there had been "no assessment of
    executing agencies' capacity." The complexity of the project design required 13


                                              17

    different agencies to implement the project. Given the tendency in China for
    effective vertical interaction but poor horizontal cooperation, this arrangement ran the
    risk of inertia after project preparation as the interest of the various stakeholders
    waned and the PLG did not sustain the necessary commitment, coordination and
    momentum.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

57. The Bank's supervision was deemed moderately satisfactory given the overall success
of the project with moderate shortcomings. The Bank approved the project in May 1998
and was declared effective in September 1998. The frequency of supervision missions
was appropriate and specialists with relevant skills were brought in as needed, although
the outbreak of SARS in 2003 hindered supervision for a period of time. Back-to-office
reports and management letters were generally comprehensive, and usually action-
oriented.

58. While the project's implementation was rated satisfactory on all ISRs from 1998
(project start) until 2005, a Quality of Supervision Assessment in 2006 (QSA7) had an
overall rating of "moderately satisfactory" and concluded that the Bank could have been
more proactive in finding solutions to the problems that delayed implementation, perhaps
with more effective use of field office staff for supervision. For example, disbursements
early on were slow because staff were unfamiliar with the Bank's procedures and rules,
and contractors were slow in filing invoices. Even after the original loan closing date had
passed, less than US$80 million had been disbursed from the loan out of the US$180
million remaining after the restructuring. This is a common problem for a new borrower
and could have been dealt with sooner through: (1) a targeted workshop at project launch
focusing on financial management and disbursement issues, and (2) more proactive
interventions when it became clear that the Guangzhou Finance Bureau was contributing
to the delays of withdrawal applications. In retrospect, the Bank's supervision should
also have identified the value of certain indicators that appeared overly optimistic,
particularly those with impact areas beyond the project.

59. Though the financial management shortcomings of the borrower's resettlement
program were significant (see Section 2.4), the audit process complemented by the
Bank's supervision effectively addressed the problems. The Bank found shortcomings in
the financial control structure, but no evidence of fraud or wrong-doing.

60. The Bank also showed due flexibility in discussing alternative approaches to allow
Guangzhou to use the savings, both as regards additional components consistent with the
original project developmental objective and in raising the disbursement percentage for
the final loan extension.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory




                                              18

61. The Bank's overall performance was satisfactory based on the quality of the project at
entry and during supervision. There has been substantial completion of the project
without compromising environmental, social, or financial safeguards. The design and
implementation also ensured the delivery of a majority of the project development
objectives.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

62. The performance of the government was satisfactory considering the complexity of
the project design and novelty of some interventions. The primary investment, the Ring
Road, was completed in record time (18 months opposed to scheduled 5 years) with high
quality, within budget, and featuring state-of-the-practice environmental mitigation
measures (noise-dampening pavement, over 22 one-way km of noise barriers and double
glazed windows for 5000 households).

63. The resettlement program epitomizes the unprecedented complexity of the
development challenges in China. Fifteen thousand households, shops and businesses
were moved in less than one year to minimize the disruption from the construction and to
deal with a very rapidly growing congestion problem. It is unlikely that there are many
projects in the history of development (Bank-financed or otherwise) of this dimension
and speed. In the end, the program was considered very successful and the Bank's
review concluded that the issues raised were not so much with the substance of the
resettlement actions, but the regulation, management and internal control systems needed
to govern such a financially large undertaking. From all accounts, Guangzhou has taken
on this lesson and moved to address the gaps.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64. The performance of the implementing agencies was moderately satisfactory. Nearly
all components were completed as planned, but the project was very slow to disburse, had
to be restructured (including the cancelling of US$20 million), and the loan was extended
by four years. Progress on the smaller components in particular was considerably
delayed and four extensions of the closing date were required for substantial completion.

65. Project governance, including the PLG, was often inconsistent on non-road
investments, which greatly contributed to delays. However, institutional development
and implementation improvements have been continuous. For example, the third phase
of the traffic management program was a considerable improvement over the first two
phases, reflecting continuous learning by the City. It recommended incorporation of the
latest international thinking on bus lanes and bus rapid transit, channelization and
pedestrian safety islands, and physical separation through curbs and `green islands'. The
extended duration of the project coupled with regular turnover necessitated additional
institutional strengthening and training.



                                             19

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

66. The satisfactory rating is justified by performance of the government and
implementing agencies, including the adoption of institutions, policies and programs in
support of the project objectives described above.

6. Lessons Learned

67. Project design and governance should carefully consider the institutional capacity for
each component and recognize that progress may not occur in parallel. Major
challenges were experienced with the "softer" components due to weaker institutional
capacity. The role of a project leading group is essential to ensure that the various
components are implemented in a coordinated fashion, but sustaining their interest and
effective functioning is difficult to achieve. Moreover, setting up institutional capacity
for what may be a short but intensive resettlement or a prolonged environmental
mitigation program demands special care. For example, the Project showed the need to
deal with noise mitigation not just during the construction but on a continuing basis
during operation.

68. Computer-based management systems require exceptional inter-disciplinary
coordination and specialized experience for procurement.2 The technical complexity of
these systems, which often involve intellectual property rights embodied in proprietary
software, is complicated by the procurement policies that aim to promote competition.
Close coordination is needed between specialists who understand the business processes
being computerized, technology options, and procurement. A technical and functional
architecture encompassing the project is also needed to ensure current and future system
interoperability. Guangzhou's GPS-based bus dispatching and monitoring system, which
also provides real-time passenger information, was eventually scaled up to the entire bus
fleet and is a model for other cities.

69. Formulating a comprehensive strategy with government ownership is crucial to
institutional reform and implementation of innovative urban transport initiatives. A
lengthy but very successful urban transport strategy effort and project preparation period
anchored transport investments in Guangzhou for over a decade. Guangzhou is a model
for other cities in the effective demonstration of low-cost traffic management investments,
representing the first instance in China where the traffic police collaborated with planning
and municipal engineering bureaus to design and implement such schemes. Furthermore,
the Project initiated important institutional reform in the structure and operation of bus
services. Discussions during preparation resulted in a successful, state-of-the-practice
model of publicly-controlled (but franchised) and privately-operated bus operations.



2The Bank's task team is distilling this lesson and additional experiences from the technology
implementation and related institutional issues in a technical note (to be published) entitled "Bus Fleet
Management Systems: Improving Public Transport in China."

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Tables A and B are the economic analyses for the Ring Road and Traffic Management
components, respectively, using the benefits and costs presented in the borrower's ICR
from May 2008. The remaining components under the project were smaller in cost and
less amenable to a quantitative cost-benefit analysis, but international experience has
shown that these types of investments are cost-effective.

The main assumptions used in the economic analysis were:
· The local economy would continue to grow at about 8 percent per year over the
   evaluation period and motorized vehicle ownership would grow at about the same
   rate.
· The value of time for passengers was assumed to be equal to the wage rate and
   vehicle operating costs were consistent with those used recently in other highway
   projects in China.
· The traffic management component of the project was assumed to result in a
   suppression of 20 percent of the motorized trips that would otherwise be made to the
   central area. The associated metro and outer area highway developments would take
   place as planned.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Excerpt from Borrower's ICR dated June 4, 2008:

"Through ten years joint efforts of World Bank and Guangzhou, the predetermined target,
was fulfilled, which are as follow:

1. To improve center road network service level and reduce congestions. The
evaluation indicators of this objective are shown in Annex 1 table1 and table 2. Screen-
line surveys in 1999 and 2000 showed that traffic volume decreased by 14% and 6%
respectively. But in 2001, traffic volume was 13% above the base year and was predicted
that the rising would continue. Considering ever-increasing trend of traffic volume and
limitation of charges, GCCTPO and World Bank codetermined not to carry out screen-
line surveys. Compared with base year, the speed of through traffic in central district on
N-S corridor increased by 33% in 2001 while on E-W corridor the speed increased by
49% .

2. To improve capacity of public transport corridors in city center. The evaluation
indicators of this objective are bus speed and percentage share of bus trips, as shown in
Annex 1 table4. Compared with base year's 11.2km/h, the bus speed increased by 63% in
2006, while the percentage share of bus increased from 16% to 22.3%. The
predetermined target has been achieved.

3. To reduce air pollution relatively. The indicators of this objective are shown in
Annex 1 table 6. Compared with base year, NOX decreased to 0.117mg/m3 in 2006 from
0.151 mg/m3 , dropping by 23%,while CO decreased to 1.55 mg/m3 from 2.89 mg/m3 ,
dropping by 46%.The predetermined target has been achieved and sustained.

4. To reduce per capita traffic accident rate relatively. The indicators of this
objective are shown in appendix 1 table 3. Traffic accidents per 10,000 persons dropped
from 0.85 in base year to 0.67 in 2006, while traffic fatalities per 10,000 persons dropped
from 0.11 in base year to 0.05 in 2006. The predetermined target has been achieved.

5. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of road maintenance. The evaluation
indicators are shown in Annex 1 table 7. The availability rate of major arterial road rose
from 50% in base year to 91% in 2006, while the availability rate of minor arterial road
and collectors rose from 80% to 83.5%. The predetermined target has been achieved.

6. To strengthen management ability of urban transportation institutions. More
than 1000 person times, in 180 groups accumulatively were arranged to take inspection
and training. The ability of management, research and technology of government
institutions which administrate urban transportation were improved greatly.
predetermined target has been achieved.

The project content were carried out according to original items, both sides have adjusted
and increased a batch of sub-projects according to in-depth request during the
implementation. The implementation and evaluation of each sub-project are as follows:

I. Inner Ring Road

7. The inner ring road is an express viaduct belt road, which is built on the original road
of central area. The total length is 26.7km. According to the traffic demand and
implementation conditions, some sections of viaduct are dual 6 lanes; some are dual 4
lanes with emergence stop area, others are on the ground. There are 12 interchanges, 13
ramps and 3 over-river bridges along IRR in total .The running speed of main line is 60
km/h.

8. Land acquisition and resettlement of IRR: on January 5 1998, Guangzhou Urban
Housing Units Management Office announced demolition bulletin of inner ring road first
phase project-Dongshan interchange. In mid-May of the same year, Guangzhou
municipal Party Committee and municipal government proposed to shorten IRR project
period from 5 years to 2 year. Subsequently, they proposed that inner ring road must be
finished within one year. At the beginning of July, the second, third, fourth phase
removal of IRR were at preparatory stage; the whole IRR removal and resettlement
work was fully carried out from October and demolition of civil works was finished
smoothly under the guidance of GMCC and GREEO on March, 1999. At this time, the
total amount of demolition was 14737 households involving 44,000 persons, while area
was 759,700 square meters.

9. Demolition engineering of IRR created four "first" in Guangzhou demolition history.
It was the first project that international financial organization (World Bank) participated
in; it was the first time that independent supervisor was designated by international
institution; it was the first time that computer was introduced to demolition project
management; and it was the first time that detailed public participation and consultation
plan was covered. Meanwhile, it was the largest demolition project with shortest period
and least complaint.

10. On April 8, 1999, the IRR was in full-scale construction. According to geographical
location and construction organization, it was divided into four parts namely west ring
road, north ring road , east ring road and south ring road in which west ring road and
north ring road were built with cooperation of World Bank ( eight sections in all) and the
others were invested by Guangzhou independently (12 sections in all). On December 25,
1999, the main project of IRR was completed. On January 1, 2000 it was open to public
and on January 28 of the same year it was completely open to traffic.

11. The construction management and operation of IRR was implemented by GTPCC.
All sections of IRR project were bid for according to the international common practice.
The civil works design of IRR was undertaken by GMEDRI and Guangdong
Construction Design and Research Institute which are both national designing institutes
of first rate. Construction unit for IRR project was chosen through public competitive
bidding (PCB) and national competitive bidding (NCB), and their procedure was
according to World Bank procurement guidelines. The bid of IRR civil works was got by


                                               36

21 construction enterprises at the national first class including the Guangzhou Municipal
Civil Engineering Group Co., Ltd., CHINA Hong Kong Fourth Flight Operations
Engineering Bureau, Guangzhou Municipal Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. and so on.

12. The construction of IRR was stressed on not only speed but also quality and the
quality were not influenced by the short project period. To ensure project quality,
GCCTPO insisted on testing and inspecting every link, every process and every kind of
material strictly, and invited road and bridge experts to carry out construction technical
guidance. Municipal quality supervisors and municipal engineering supervisors
monitored the quality of IRR project and formed a "three-pronged" which was self-
inspection of construction enterprises, the independent Commissioner recheck and quality
supervision units further, therefore the project quality was under omni-directional
monitoring. Ultimately, through final completion acceptance and verifying check by
Guangzhou Quality Supervision Station, all designs met requirements and quality
conformity rate was 100%.

13. IRR was put into use in January 2000 completely and the social and economic
benefits can be summarized as follows:

a. IRR played a connection role between city center and outlying area. Through
construction of IRR, four lateral and four longitudinal major arterial roads (four lateral
major arterial roads : Huanshi Road, Dongfeng Road, Zhongshan Road, Yanjiang road; 4
longitudinal major arterial roads: Liwan Road, Renmin road, Jiefang Lu, Donghaoyong
Viaduct) have been linked organically and form new layout- square and radiation, so road
network of central area have been optimized.

b. Traffic capacity was improved by implementation of IRR. It provided 210,000 vehicles
-kilometers capacity for central district which accounted for 30% of artery capacity in
2001.

c. IRR alleviated traffic pressure inner and outside area, especially city center. The
saturation of IRR increased seriously. For example: in 2001, saturation of IRR was just
0.48, in 2005, it increased to 0.85. By contrast, the network saturation of central area in
the same period is only 0.8 and 0.88. Because of IRR undertaking a lot of traffic, the road
services of central area remained at acceptable level. So IRR contributed a lot to central
area.

d. Construction of IRR accelerated land development and optimization of surrounding
areas. IRR construction promoted the optimization of land use of central area constantly.
There was stratification and decentralization trend in the central area. For example, coast
of the Pearl River (Ersha Dao, Binjiang Road area) emerged new high living area;
Yuexiu and Dongshan districts also emerged living grade improving and location
concentration. In addition, traditional commercial advantagearea status and
characteristics were enhanced. And there was commercial leisure and tourism
integration trend. For instance, some areas began to concentrate on original commercial
maturity like Shangxia jiu Road, Beijing Road, Nonglin Middle Road and Zhongshan



                                             37

Road and so on. As a result, Hill pattern commercial network was formed and became the
backbone of Guangzhou City. Some office areas like Huanshi Road and Dongfeng Road
were also further strengthened. And Pearl River coastal region will become the new
regional office. As the same time, pedestrian area, in which commerceleisure and
tourism were integrated, also emerged. The combination of modern and custom
recreation areas along Pearl River and large commercial facilities, commercial area (Such
as the Beijing Road, Shangxia jiu Road) in center was a good example.

e. Traffic environmental impact of IRR. IRR construction made certain environmental
impact on alongside, but improved environmental quality of centre area generally. The
residents reflected that the more prominent issues were IRR large capacity, high-speed
and large noise effect. In order to solve the noise problem, soundproof windows were
installed and achieved good effect. Guangzhou's climate is humid, sunshine is very
critical. After the construction of IRR, the duration of sunshine shorted, several residents
reflect a great affect; the majority reflected declining of sunshine but not affecting normal
life. On the other hand, because part of IRR passed through old town, by demolitions, the
old, dirty, and chaotic appearance was changed. On this extent, completion of IRR
improved people's living environment.

f. Economic benefits evaluation of IRR
According to economic assessment indicators in this report: EIRR is 18.49%, ENPV is
9.63272 billion yuan, EBCR is 2.31, EN is 9.02. Under the worst circumstance-
investment increased by 20% and benefits decreased by 20%, EIRR is 12.11%, ENPV is
4.12042 billion yuan, EBCR is 1.40 and EN is 15.4. All indicators meet requirements.
This shows that the project is reasonable.

II. Traffic Management and Safety

14. Traffic Management and Safety included four phases. The former two were originally
planned while the later two were added. The first phase, as a demonstration project,
mainly transformed junctions of old city center; the second phase paid more attention to
junctions of Liwan, West Mountain, Yuexiu districts and so on. Meanwhile, because the
former two phases had achieved good effect on traffic improvement, World Bank and
GCCTPO agreed with adding third and fourth phases to expand implementation effect
continuously. In particular, the third phase implementation range was the built-up areas
around city ring expressway, especially Haizhu, Tianhe, Fangcun district. The fourth
phase-SCATS system was added to further expand sub-project on March, 2006. In a
word, this sub-project contained two parts: Traffic facility improvement and Road user's
safety education.


15. Traffic facility improvement mainly included: civil works, SCATS procurement and
installment project, CCTV procurement and installment project, traffic information
induction variable message board, and GIS procurement.

· Civil works: It contained three phases, including reforms of more than 350 junctions
    and 20 arterial roads. This project has been finished in June, 2006. ( including : Bus
    priority network, Pedestrian facilities improvement, and reform of traffic black spot
    and so on)


                                               38

· SCATS procurement and installment: The purpose was to extend traffic control
    system of Guangzhou. The specific work was operating the latest RTA PC SCATS
    software so as to realize intercommunication between a control center and 5 sub-
    control centers. The finished time was December 2007.

· CCTV procurement and installment: The main work of this project was introducing
    CCTV system. Detailed work was installing 30 videos in city center. Monitoring
    pedestrians and vehicles in real time, it controlled urban traffic on the whole to make
    sure traffic diverging reasonably and traffic violation descending, and further promote
    urban traffic management level. These works have been finished in August, 2006.

· Traffic information induction variable message board and GIS procurement: Main
    work of this part was installing traffic information induction variable message boards
    on main skeleton road network in Guangzhou. Based on real-time traffic data,
    through various variable limit speed device, variable information board, parking
    information inducing card and so on, traffic real time condition and control programs
    could be sent out timely to induce the traffic flow, evacuate blocking, so that people
    could reach their destinations rapidly and safely. These equipments have been
    installed in June, 2006.

· Road user's safety education: The main purpose was improving traffic quality of
    citizens by kings of propaganda methods. Since December 2003, the project has
    carried out 8 TV propagandas, 31 media notices and wall charts, manuals, cards and
    other forms of materials a total of 2.62 million. It has been finished August 2005, and
    achieved good effects.

16. The implementation of World Bank's traffic management and safety promoted road
traffic management level to a new step. The project has improved the relationship
between people and car, especially citizens' quality. The project was building with the
principle of "people-oriented" and concerned about disadvantaged groups in society, and
produced far impact on the harmonious transport, thus prompted harmonious
development of Guangzhou city.

17. The implementation of this project regulated traffic order, improved about 30% of
motor vehicle average speed in centre. Bus lane average speed has reached to 15 km/h
and increased by 20% in comparison with that of 1998. In addition, Number of traffic
fatality also decreased by 336, about 18.2%.The passenger volume of public transport
increased from 10.4million in 1997 to 20.77 million in 2005. Meanwhile, the proportion
of public transport also increased to 22.31%, ranked the first in various auto modes,
which increased by 19.6% in comparison with that of 1998. Social economic evaluation
also shows, until 2007, the project saved passengers' time 80 million hours, which was
equality to 3.51 million Yuan. Benefits of accident loss and public transport operation
reducing were 2.27 million Yuan and 2.30 million Yuan. The total economic benefits
were about 12.25 million Yuan, and this project relieved the traffic congestion in
Guangzhou urban area, ensured the traffic safety. In particular, the implementation of
Road user's safety education changed concepts of traffic participants such as traffic
departments and road users, improved citizen's traffic consciousness, and gradually
promoted traffic management to a new step.

III. Public Transport Improvement

18. Public Transport Improvement Project, as an important composition of Guangzhou
City Center Transport Project, obtained great emphasis of provincial and municipal
governments and World Bank. There were three parts: Bus Automatic Monitoring and
Dispatch System, Longxi Depot, Environmental Protection Demonstration Car. In order
to improve public transport services level, Bus Automatic Monitoring and Dispatch
System could monitor, track and schedule 64 city bus lines and 1424 buses real-timely by
GPS (Global Positioning Satellite) technology, and also provided bus information
timely with 310 electronic stops (200 intermediates stops and 110 Terminus). The
specific work plan was as follow: Contract about system development and installation
was signed on May 22, 2006. This project has finished in October 2007. Now it has been
put into operation.

19. Longxi Depot provided three types of maintenances and parking services for 620
buses from southwest of Guangzhou. It has been finished in October 2007 and transferred
to GTC.

20. A pilot Bus has been purchased by introducing international bus with up-to-date
technology. It provided reference for Guangzhou about vehicle type selection in future.

21. The implementation result of the project is basically satisfactory. Bus Automatic
Monitoring and Dispatch System and Longxi Depot have basically reached the
predetermined target. The intellectual deployment system of public transit has improved
the overall service level and intelligent intensity of urban public transport, and
successfully changed from line dispatch to area dispatch. With the sub-project
implementation, public traffic become attractive, while the private traffic reduced and
traffic jam and environmental pollution were also alleviated. Take the Second
Automobile Company as an example; there were four bus routes such as 283, 297, 527
and 803, which have realized intellectual dispatch. Assumed that travel distance was not
added, comparing with same period of last year, income has increased by 12.98% and the
income per thousand car-kilometers increases by 13.49% in May to July, 2007. The
accomplishment of Longxi Depot has filled the blank field of Fangcun district in
Guangzhou, and reduced the deadhead kilometers. At the same time, as the depot located
out of the centre district, it had great contribution to improve transportation efficiency of
public transit, utilize the land resource effectively, and relieve traffic pressure in city
centre, so that the traffic condition in centre was improved.


IV. Motor Vehicle Emission Control

22. The final implementation contents of MVEC included IRR automated noise
monitoring system and automated motor vehicle pollution monitoring system.


23. GCTP lasted 9 years, under the situation of changes such as the regulation and
standard of motor vehicle in China, the social economic level of Guangzhou,
environmental monitoring ability construction, etc. the contents of project were adjusted,
particularly, the construction of motor vehicle emission centre and the system of motor


                                               40

vehicle monitor and maintenance were cancelled. Although some sub-project contents
were cancelled, World Bank thought some Guangzhou motor vehicle emission control
work had already exceeded the origin contents, and environment protection work had
been forefront among Chinese cities. This sub-project perfected networks of environment
monitoring, improved ability of environment detecting, and could provided reasonable
data for research on reducing pollution.


V. Road Maintenance

24. Guangzhou Municipal Engineering Maintenance Department was responsible for
specific implementation. This project mainly carried out Road and Bridge Facilities
Management Systems and three batches of road maintenance equipments procurements
as well as new addition equipments procurements.

25. Implementation of Road Maintenance promoted road maintenance work of
Guangzhou. It kept road in good condition of arterial road more than 90% from 2001 and
minor arterial more than 83%. These efficiently improved road avail ability rate and
evenness, accelerated efficiency of maintenance work, and further improved road
maintenance quality and scientific and technological innovation ability of Guangzhou. In
addition, purchasing and using road maintenance equipments made Guangzhou road
maintenance equipment level, engineering level and management level reach to domestic
leading level, and realized modernization of equipment and technology maintenance.


VI. Technical Assistance

26. The functions of this project were making the relevant personnel who participated in
project construction trained, improving equipment ability and staff technical and
management level of sub-project and relevant units by providing local and overseas
trainings and consultation so that the whole project could be implemented on planned
schedule.

27. The project has been implemented for about ten years and covered numerous sub-
projects, total including 110 domestic trainings, 81 abroad trainings, 28 local and
international consultant services and 15 science researches.

28. The benefits of Technical assistance were mainly as follows:
a. The popularization of science research achievements overcome technical difficulties
during implementation of GCTP, improved construction methods, reduced number of
staffs and equipment investment, shortened construction time and decreased cost. For
example, the application of external prestressing technology on IRR Bridge did not only
reduce time and cost, but also created domestic construction precedence of reinforced
concrete overlay beam. In addition, incremental launching method and simulation
analysis technology and relevant technological research results were popularized in
Guangfo Road Construction, also became new technology representatives.




                                             41

b. TA project provided technical support for other sub-projects, especially difficulties of
design and implementation so as to promote other sub-projects smoothly.

c. The implementation of trainings and inspections, improved personnel quality and work
efficiency, accelerated implementation progress. In addition, expert consultations reduced
project risks and unnecessary expenses.

29. In short, Technical Assistance provided technical support for other sub-projects.
Regardless of project quality, progress and staff cost, it achieved good social and
economic benefits.

VII. Guangfo Road

30. Guangfo road, as west export of Guangzhou 7 radiation lines, was an important
composition of Guangzhou express way network. Its complementation fundamentally
improved traffic capacity of Guangzhou west export, relieved along traffic congestion
and promoted Fangcun region's socio-economic coordinated development.

31. Guangfo road started from Zhongshan 8th road, passed Zhujiang East Bridge and Da
Tansha district, ended to Fangcun road .Particularly, A and B viaducts were set up along
sides of Sanmao railway. Full range of one direction length was about 2.5km. Line A is
2.598km while line B is 2.459km. There are 4 east and west dual over river bridges and
Fangcun interchange with altogether dual 6 lanes.

32. GCCTPO was responsible for this project. The design unit was Guangdong
Architectural Design and Research Institute. Guangfo first phase civil works and
supervision units were chosen by international competitive bidding and national
competitive bidding respectively. The final construction units were Guangzhou
Municipal Engineering Company, Wuhan Municipal Engineering Company, Anhui Road
and Bridge Company and China 16th Railway Engineering Bureau. Final supervision unit
was Guangzhou Guangda Project Management Limited Company.
On July 1, 2003, the civil engineering started. On February 16, 2005, four over Pearl
River Bridges and main line were open.

33. In 2005, Guangfo Road was open to operation. The average traffic volume of all lanes
would reach to 75819pcu per day. In 2007, the average traffic volume of all lanes would
reach to 92700pcu per day, and average speed was 55km/h, which was in accordance
with the standard design speed. Influenced by various factors, the project failed to finish
constructing on December 31, 2004 according to the original plan, but the total
construction quality was better, and it played have much effect on relieving traffic
pressure of the west export of the city.

34. Through national economic benefits calculation and sensitivity analysis, we can find,
the project EIRR was 24.51%, ENPV was 1444.46 million Yuan, EBCR was 2.17 and
EN was 7.69. Under the worst circumstance-investment increased by 20% and benefits
decreased by 20%, EIRR became 18.68%, ENPV became 9399.93million Yuan, EBCR




                                             42

became 2.07, and EN became 10.6. All indicators meet request and proved that decisions
of this project were correct and implementation was rational.


                      B. Evaluation of project executing agency
Evaluation of World Bank

35. The evaluation result to World Bank's performance is satisfactory. The World Bank
has done massive difficult and effective work, which promoted the preliminary work of
the project progressing powerfully. Since 1995, the World Bank had sent out the World
Bank Investigation Group, which was made up of experts with rich experience in urban
transportation to take preliminary work inspection for four times, and meanwhile, the
World Bank tried their best to make Guangzhou Municipal Government understand the
World Bank's relevant policies. They identified and evaluated the Project on the basis of
experience which was gathering from transportation project implemented in china.

36. On the basis of full consideration of Chinese national situation and Guangzhou real
traffic situation, the World Bank demonstrated and analyzed the optional loan project
carefully to choose the highly efficient project of solving urban transportation problem.
During preparation stage, The World Bank not only provided a loan, but also brought
Guangzhou advanced idea and methods like TMS, the public transport institutional
reform, advanced experience of road maintenance to promote urban transportation
development. Meanwhile, in view of ability training of executing department, technical
assistance project was set up to strengthen relevant departments' ability. During the
project appraisal, the World Bank evaluated management and consultation institution
construction, project funds, load and loan repayment, EIA, resettlement and public
participation, and provided suggestions.

37. The World Bank's inspection team performed its duty carefully and handled various
changes of the project flexibly and responsibly during the project implementation. The
delegation, conducted by project manager visited Guangzhou a total of 27. During the
inspection, the World Bank experts provided many constructive suggestions about TMS,
resettlement, environmental protection and so on, and discussed the design and
construction difficulties of Inner Ring Road and Guangfo Road. At the same time, the
World Bank cared about project progress, required Project Office to provide project
progress report on time and added explanation if the project was delayed. Except for the
delegation's inspection, the World Bank office in China gave a lot of help about project
procurement, payment, financial management and operation to support Project Office's
work. Since SARS took place in 2003, the World Bank's supervision degree over the
project decreased because of the condition limitation.

38. The World Bank fund management surveillance system is also perfect. After signing
contract, the World Bank, according to the contract treaty, paid the loan amount on time.
In contract executing phase, if that the project changed or non-predicative case took place
resulted in increase of loan, a detailed written explanation material should be submitted
according to World Bank stipulated procedure.




                                              43

39. In this cooperation between World Bank and Guangzhou, there were also some
problems. For example, in the examining and approving work, the project usually needs
the World Bank and domestic examination and approval dually, thus examination and
approval time was too long, the enterprise beard bigger risk and pre-payment time was
too long. We suggest the World Bank integrate its procedure with domestic examination
and approval procedure, simplify procedure, and enhance efficiency to reduce the
examination and approval time under the premise of maintaining quality and quantity.
Meanwhile, considering Chinese actual condition, it needs to use more flexible
procurement way rather than the way of minimum price to win a bid only.

Evaluation of Project Implementation Unit

40. The evaluation result of Guangzhou project Implementation unit's performance is
satisfactory. GCTP is the second urban transportation project which World Bank carries
on in China. Guangzhou municipal government pays much attention to this project
first-phase preparation of the project moved forward well, and the preparation was very
perfect and effective. Since March, 1993, Guangzhou municipal government carried out
subject study about "Guangzhou Urban Transport Study (GUTS1)"and "Guangzhou
Urban Central Area Traffic Improvement Execution Scheme (GUTS2)".This was the
foundation of prophase preparation for Guangzhou City Center Transport Project (World
Bank) loan. The research team had made success: the financing and repayment of loan
plan was deeply researched, technical support service system was reasonable. In a word,
the preparation work was totally good, and met the World Bank's requirements.

41. The project concrete implementation organization used three-class management
system, which consisted of leading group, project office and sub-project office.
GCCTPO ,which was in charge of project implementation was a full-time project office,
employed enough staffs, could consult with the leading agency effectively, and did
properly with each sub-project office in the coordination and communication work.
GCCTPO took the World Bank inspection team carefully, feedback their opinions and
questions timely, solved difficulties that sub-project offices were faced with,
simultaneously reported problems founded without delay. In order to assure
communication with the sub-project office and other participation units, GCCTPO with
the sub-project office also launched regular meeting each month to hear parties' reports
about project progresses and difficulties.

42. GCCTPO financial management is satisfactory, it established plan-fund department to
manage project finance. Simultaneously, in Technical Assistance project, GCCTPO also
sent corresponding staffs to participate in inspection and training, and the professional
ability improved gradually. Problems occurred was able to deal with correctly, and the
whole efficiency was improved much.

43. As direct executing agency, the sub-project office complied with procedure strictly,
cooperated with GCCTPO actively, and also promoted personnel's quality continually
through the Technical Assistance and training.




                                             44

44. In sum, during the past ten years of project implementation, World Bank made joint
efforts with related institute in Guangzhou. Good cooperation took place in every respect
including project preparation, identification and implementation and so on. GCTP has
brought Guangzhou advanced international experience and given security for sustainable
development of urban transport.


                           C. Main experiences and lessons

I. Experiences

1) Leaderships' focus and efficient organization are the foundation of project
implementation.

45. GCTP is a large-scale comprehensive traffic improvement project. It involved wide
area, and was urgent, difficult to coordinate. In order to organize the project efficiently,
the project took PLG-GCCTPO- Implementation Units management mode to monitor
project among entire process. Many miracles were created. Take the IRR as example, its
original construction time was 5 years, while it was open to traffic only in 1 year through
adopting some measures such as "green channel", "two-way choice of demolition and
resettlement", "public participation" and so on. It created "high efficient"," high
quality"," comprehension", "struggle" spirits and became a high quality miracle in
Guangzhou municipal engineering history.

2) Being familiar with World Bank Loan policy, coordinating domestic and World
Bank procedure are critical for project progress.

46. The World Bank loan project does not only need to follow policy and procedure of
World Bank, but also regulation and requests of domestic relevant departments. Being
familiar with these procedures and requests; and setting up several important time nodes
could guarantee consistence of progress. Being familiar with loan policy and procedure
of World Bank is helpful for us to make preparation reasonably, maximally reduce
commitment fee and increase quality of fund-use.

3) Introduction of new ideas, new concepts, and raising management level are
important conditions for project promotion.
47. People-oriented and all-round developments are new management ideas. This
project paid attention not only to construction process, but also to management system
establishment, overall benefits and environment sustainable development. From project
plan to implementation process, people-oriented and all-round development concepts
were manifested everywhere. For example, through sub-projects implementation, related
systems were established, bus priority was developed, use ratio of road resources was
improved efficiently, road management level was improved, so goal of environment
improvement was realized. In addition, demolition and resettlement realized society's
prosperous life through guiding idea varying from "resettlement" to "re-housing", and
"two-way choice of material object and currency compensation".




                                             45

48. This project provides platforms of experience exchange and propaganda
promotes innovation idea. From the perspective of management innovation, all projects
implemented by GCCTPO have referred to international advanced contract management
pattern, adopted international general FIDIC articles, introduced contract management,
and established inspection mechanism. From the perspective of project implementation
process , through exchange and cooperation with local and overseas experts, international
advanced management experience and equipments, project cycle and construction cost
were reduced, technical level of correlation departments was impelled to improve, city
competitive power was enhanced. In addition, drawing support from the World Bank is
also helpful for expanding influence power.

49. The project provides strict procedure and management experiences. For World
Bank loan project, there are a set of management procedures adapting with project
determination, appraisal, loan activation, implementation procurement, withdrawals
account and payment, post evaluation and so on. These procedures have intense principle,
policy, standard and pertinence.

50. Establishing good communication and coordination relationship is basis of
project success.
During the implementation, there were variable changes, which the loan agreement and
project agreement cannot include and solve. Therefore, it needs to communicate with and
ask instructions for project manager, officials and experts of World Bank in Chinese
Representative Office. So that they understood project further. World Bank gave
vigorously support on many aspects such as procurement, contract variations and
payment and so on.

51. Comprehensive traffic improvement platform is established successfully.

52. Through project implementation, GCCTPO did not only integrate many fields such as
infrastructure construction, traffic management, environment protection, public transport
and road maintenance, but also established a comprehensive traffic improvement
platform in Guangzhou successfully, which was the immaterial asset of Guangzhou urban
transport. It mainly manifested as follow:

53. It improved field management level. This is an important cooperation target of
municipal government and World Bank. By implementation, advanced management
ideas have been fully absorbed; open bidding, engineering finance management and project
management and so on are developed in local front row.

54. It enhanced Guangzhou traffic technique level. This project is an important platform,
by which Guangzhou urban transport technology development can realize well
connection with international. And Guangzhou municipal government realized the goal
consciously. Project setup is foresighted, practically impels local transportation
technology development.




                                             46

55. It strengthened talent cultivation. Based on talent cultivation mechanism and strategy,
Technical Assistance Sub-project provided 180 batches, more than 1000 people
inspections and trainings for GMCC, GTC, GEPB, TPDGPSBTraffic Planning
Research Institute and so on. GCTP introduced advanced urban traffic management ideas,
and cultivated modern management and technical talented persons who were familiar
with international management procedure and could connect with international.

II. Main lessons

1) Decision-makingmanagementorganization institute for traffic integration
should be guaranteed.
56. PLG was cancelled a period during project implementation. Without its organization,
project work progress was slow-down, and there were some communication problems
between GCCTPO and Sub-Project Office. So suggest enhancing coordination, holding
meeting regularly to improve traffic decision-making and coordinated ability.

2) In order to guarantee the project development smoothly, GCCTPO's construction
should be strengthened.

57. Majority of contents were already implemented but parts of following work need
continue to develop. Moreover, because Guangzhou new-round transport strategy
planning has been carried out, GCCTPO needs to further strengthen its ability
construction to promote sustainable development of Guangzhou transport.

3) Management procedures of World Bank and local should be better coordinated
and simplified.

58. World Bank's payment procedure is extremely strict, its examination and approval
procedure is different from Chinese, and its payment time is longer, so that expected
funds can not be used ultimately. In addition, it is usually complicated and long-term.
With these differences, when a project is urgent to implement, World Bank's loan can't
meet its demands, so some contents cannot obtain World Bank's approval and loan can't
be fully used in project certainly. Thus, when World Bank and Chinese government
choose World Bank Loan project, they should coordinate, simplify procedure and
accelerate payment process together according to Chinese actual conditions World
Bank's requests.


        D. Further actions of Guangzhou urban transportation system
59. Guangzhou will be constructed into a modern metropolis which leads Guangdong
province, radiates southern China, impacts Southeast Asia, and becomes a city suitable
for living and business, and will support 16th Asian Sports Meeting in 2010 and a new
round revision of the urban overall planning. Under these backgrounds, it is crucial to
provide a good transportation system. In 2006, Guangzhou timely launched a new round
"Guangzhou Urban Transport Strategy Planning" (GUTS3). The first-stage study
summarized traffic implementation after 10 years since the first round of traffic
development strategic planning, scientifically diagnosed key points to current urban



                                             47

transportation problems, deeply analyzed situation, opportunities and challenges that
Guangzhou urban traffic faced. Based on resident trip survey in 2005, it also established
traffic strategic model and put forward transport development strategy objectives, tasks,
policies, layout and recent action plan. Its achievements have obtained approvals of local
and abroad experts and have pointed out directions for next urban transport development.

60. In September 2006, Guangzhou Municipal Planning Bureau proposed the city
development goal: "health and safety for all" at "Urban Traffic Forum". In December,
Guangzhou municipal government added "center adjustment" to original urban
development strategy: "South Extension, North optimization, east progress, West Union".
"Center" means Guangzhou city center, and "adjustment" means perfection and
promotion. The new concept shows that gravity of Guangzhou city development began to
change from "development" to "promotion ".

61. Along with the improvement of living standards and promotion of scientific, balanced
and harmonious development, as a city circle system, traffic supports "Center Adjustment
" strategy strongly, and insures realization of city development goal-every person is
healthy and safety. In order to carry out, deepen and carry out achievements of
"Guangzhou Urban Transport Strategy Planning", to alleviate traffic pressure in city
center, to improve road safety, to promote scientific, balanced and coordinated
development of all fields, to ensure Asian Games held smoothly, Guangzhou municipal
government will further cooperate with World Bank about research of a new round
"Guangzhou Urban Central Area Traffic Improvement Execution Scheme" (GUTS4). By
means of travel and network models, this research will get the current and future trends,
and form traffic-related standards used for sorting strategic programs. The specific
improvement programs should be around but not limit to the following aspects:

(1) Road network improvement
        perfect road network structure and external connection, improve traffic nodes,
      adjust layout of connectors
        optimize and adjust traffic function of main corridors
        propose traffic organization optimized programs for key areas or nodes
        make road network planning for Asian Games stadiums
        Analyze future city road sections

(2) Public transport improvement
        propose distribution programs of pedestrian transfer facilities with integration of
      rail transportation and conventional public transit
        Bus priority/ traffic management integration
         · BRT network
         · bus stationoperationdepot
        integration of fare and service
         · passenger information
         · improvement of public transport management and engineering methods




                                              48

(3) Programs of slow traffic improvement
        sidewalkpedestrian crossing facilities and pedestrian street
        bicycle network and parking facilities, especially the transfer between bicycle and
      bus or metro

(4) Road safety management program, including motor and non-motor traffic
guidance

(5) Implementation programs of public parking
        propose public parking development policy and management measures of on-road
      or sidewalk parking according to parking demand management and parking
      industry development
        develop off-road parking facilities, ride-parking public facilities

(6) Implementation plan for improving freight transportation
        make plan for organization and operation
        study the relationship between goods transportation and urban transport
        put forward the planning of goods transportation passages
(7) Study of the external contact of urban passenger and goods

(8) Implementation programs of ITS
        propose method for traffic signal coordinated controlparticularly in critical
      regions
        make programs for ITS
        make ITS application programs to traveler information and traffic management

(9) Implementation programs of traffic demand management
        propose programs and measures of congestion pricing in center and other areas
        conduct parking management by charging

(10) Implementation programs of traffic environmental management
        popularize policy and measures for using clean energy and controlling vehicle
      emission to reduce air pollution

62. `Except for GUST3 and GUST4, in 2007, Guangzhou participated in urban traffic
development plan, which is sponsored by World Bank with Global Environment Funds
(GEF). Guangzhou obtained the qualification of demonstration city. As purpose of this
plan is alleviating loan cost and stimulating traffic policies about reducing greenhouse
gas by using IBRD loans and GEF. Guangzhou will carry out Transport Demand
Management research to balance traffic demand, to save energy and reduce emission, and
finally keep Guangzhou traffic sustainable development.
