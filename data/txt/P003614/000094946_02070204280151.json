Mitigation measures\n            to curb negative environmental impacts resulting from this\n            project include traffic management to prevent congestion and\n            the resulting high motor vehicle emissions. Restrictions on\n            using noisy equipment, temporary enclosures with and without\n            absorption lining, regular vehicle and road inspections and\n            maintenance, and absorptive barriers constructed along road\n            sections are some of the measures to be used to reduce noise\n            during and after construction. Other mitigation options\n            recommended for alleviating noise received by social,\n            health, and educational institutions include using sound\n            absorbing pavement, erecting noise barricades, adding\n            vibration-reducing mounts on viaducts, planting trees and\n            establishing greenbelts as buffers, constructing pedestrian\n            overpasses and building walls, and insulating buildings with\n            double glass windows and ventilation systems. Runoff and\n            water pollutants from domestic sewage and industrial\n            wastewater flowing into the waterways will be alleviated by\n            efficient collection and treatment. Dust and exhaust impacts\n            can be combated by revegetation, reconstructing walls, and\n            installing dust cleaning facilities. Populations will be\n            resettled according to World Bank standards."}, "docdt": "2002-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
