    satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: project design and governance should carefully\n            consider the institutional capacity for each component and\n            recognize that progress may not occur in parallel. Major\n            challenges were experienced with the 'softer'\n            components due to weaker institutional capacity. The role of\n            a project leading group is essential to ensure that the\n            various components are implemented in a coordinated fashion,\n            but sustaining their interest and effective functioning is\n            difficult to achieve. Moreover, setting up institutional\n            capacity for what may be a short but intensive resettlement\n            or a prolonged environmental mitigation program demands\n            special care. Computer-based management systems require\n            exceptional inter-disciplinary coordination and specialized\n            experience for procurement. The technical complexity of\n            these systems, which often involve intellectual property\n            rights embodied in proprietary software, is complicated by\n            the procurement policies that aim to promote competition.\n            Close coordination is needed between specialists who\n            understand the business processes being computerized,\n            technology options, and procurement. A technical and\n            functional architecture encompassing the project is also\n            needed to ensure current and future system interoperability.\n            Guangzhou's Global Positioning Satellite (GPS)-based\n            bus dispatching and monitoring system, which also provides\n            real-time passenger information, was eventually scaled up to\n            the entire bus fleet and is a model for other cities."}, "docdt": "2008-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
