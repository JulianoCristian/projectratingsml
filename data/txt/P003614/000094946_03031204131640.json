The\n            alignment design of the Inner Ring Road will be modified to\n            avoid the densely populated districts or multi-storied\n            buildings, and to reduce the affected range of land\n            acquisition and demolition. Losses will be compensated with\n            replacement costs. Living space will be enlarged, and houses\n            constructed with reinforced concrete. Affected shops,\n            enterprises, and institutions will maintain (or be restored\n            to) their original scale and function, and loses due to\n            temporary closures will be compensated. Losses caused by\n            land acquisition will be compensated reasonably and paid to\n            representative units solely for developing collective\n            economic activities. Non-agricultural jobs and pensions will\n            be arranged for farmers. So that persons can adapt better to\n            resettlement and be self-reliant in a short time, the plan\n            will create for them full employment opportunities. Policies\n            favoring vulnerable groups such as the elderly living\n            independently, widows, single-parents, the disabled, the\n            chronically ill, and the poor, will be instituted. Groups\n            will be displaced so as to preserve the integrity of the\n            original communities. People will be assisted with\n            transportation in moving. Resettlement, rehabilitation, and\n            compensation will be monitored with PAPs participating in\n            the process and a special grievance mechanism set up."}, "docdt": "2002-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
