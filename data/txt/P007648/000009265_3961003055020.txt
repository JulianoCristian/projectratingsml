MEMORANDUM AND RECMNONDATION OF THN ?.ZSIDENT OF THE
INTEMATIONAL BANK FOR RECOTicJCT10W AND DEVELOPMNET
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOV"A OCN A P1WPOSED LOAN TO DANCO
NACIONAL DE ODRAS ' 8ERVCIOC PtUBLICOS S.N.C.
FOR A MEDIUM-SIUE CITIES URBAN-TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.        I oubmit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios
Pilicos S.N.C. (BANOBRAS), with the guarantee of the United Mexican States
for US$200 million equivalent to help finance the Government of Mexico's Urban
Highway and Transport Program. The proposed loan will be repaid over 15
years, including 5 "ears of grace.
2.        Bakgaround. in the past few decades, urban population growth in
Mexico has been high and concentrated in Mexico City, Guadalajara and
Nonterrey. However, the last census shows that growth in Mexico City has
slowed. There are presently 21 medium-size cities with populations ranging
from 400,000 to 1,200,000 with an average annual growth of over 4% per year,
which are expected to absorb the bulk of future urban growth. There are a
further four or five cities, with populations below 400,000 but with the
economic potential to become centers for future urban growth. The growth in
these urban areas, combined with increasing travel demands, expanding use of
private vehicles, insufficient and inadequate investments in infrastructure
and a lack of planning, are contributing to a deterioration in the quality of
transport services, increasing levels of traffic congestion and increasing
vehicle induced air pollution. Institutional responsibility for urban
transport in the medium sized cities is fragmented among federal, state and
local agencies. This, and arsociated interjurisdictional conflicts, have
contributed to inefficient management and poor planning of urban transport,
which is likely to become an increasing problem in the face of projected rapid
urban growth.
3.        Principal sectoral issues include:  (a) institutional weaknesses at
the federal, state and local levels; (b) limited availability of professional
staff with adequate technical skills; (c) lack of a transport policy and
planning framework; (d) an outdated and ineffective public transport
regulatory framework; (e) inadequate maintenance organizations and budgets;
(f) inadequate consideration of environmental issues; (g) lack of recognition
of the effectiveness of low-cost techniques in alleviating urban transport
problems; and (h) inadequate cost recovery, especially by public transport.
In the longer term, the lack of planning and increased dependency on the
private automobile could result in the development of inefficient transport
systems, and in costly remedial environmental actions. These problems have
led to increased demands for federal assistance for urban transport at a time
when fiscal resources are scarce and the Govornment has to address high
priority needs in other sectors.
4.        Proiect Obijctives.  The main objectives of the project are to
improve the quality and efficiency of urban transport systems in medium-size
cities, assist the Wederal Government in decentralizing responsibility for
urban transport management and firance improvements that are economically



- 2 -
justified and control the environmental impacts of urban transport operations.
Specifically, the project aims to: (a) strengthen the local and national
institutions responsible for planning and managing urban transporc systems in
medium-size cities; (b) assist In the development/implementation of
appropriate financial mechanisms which devolve responsibility for planning and.
financing of urban transport from the Federal and state governments to
municipalities; (c) improve the operational efficiency of the existing urban
transpor. networks; (d) improve sector planning, which should result in
improved resource allocation within the sector, better transport to the poor
and enhanced consideration of environmental factors; (e) preserve, through
better maintenance, the urban transport infrastructure; (f) encourage public
transport development and increase private sector participation; (g) improve
access to low income areas through infrastructure improvement; (h) improve
environmental conditions, by strengthening the implementing agencies for
environmental controls and enforcing environmental standards, and reducing
traffic congestion, particularly in inner city areas; and (i) encourage the
development of facilities for non-motorized transport.
S.        Project Description:  The project will include two parts:  Part A -
National (US$7.8 million) will comprise: (a) an institutional strengthening
program for SEDESOL (US$4.3 million); (b) an institutional strengthening
program for BANOBRAS (US$0.5 million); (c) a national training program (NTP)
for urban transport professionals (US$2.2 million); and (d) grants towards the
cost of studies to prepare Integral Transport Plans (ITPs) (US$ 0.8 million);
Part B - Local (US$463.3) will comprise sub-loans to medium-size cities that
meet eligibility criteria to finance: (a) the remaining cost of the studies
for ITPs (US$4 million); (b) urgent infrastructure improvements (US$45.3
million); (c) other urban transport improvements, including planning and
traffic management measures, public transport improvements, road maintenance
and rehabilitation, paving of access routas to low income areas and corridor
improvements (US$363.1 million); (d) the final design of sub-projects,
technical assistance, studies and training for professional staff in the
cities (US$41.6 million); and (e) equipment for traffic management and control
(US$9.3 million). The total project cost inclusive of land costs, physical
and price contingencies and taxes is estimated at US$471.1 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$138.9 million. Retroactive financing
of up to US$4.0 million for eligible expenditures incurred after June 30, 1992
will be provided for the first stage of implementation of the ITPs already
completed and the initial costs of the first studies in the next round of
ITPs. The estimated breakdown of the total costs and proposed financing plan
are provided in Sched'le A. The amounts and methods of procurement and the
proposed allocation of loan proceeds are provided in Schedule B. A timetable
of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Mexico are
presented in Schedules C and D. Also attached is the Staff Appraisal Report
No. 11030-NE, dated January 15, 1993.
6.        Proiect Financina.  At present, the Government does not link the
provision of federal funds for urban transport investments to actions by local
authorities to improve sector planning and financial discipline. Under the
project, the government will begin to implement a National Urban Hiahway and
Transnort Program in Mesaum-Size Cities (the PVT) with which the project will
be integrated. The PVT replaces current 100% grant financing with a mix of



financing resources designed to encourage improved project selection. The
scheme is modelled on similar arrangements now being successfully implemented
in the Mexican water sector, with Bank support. It provides for 35% federal
grants, 42% federal loans and 23% funding from municipal or state sources.
Eligibility criteria for cities to qualify for Program participation include:
(a) confirmation of the city's size eligibility an@ agreement by the municipal
and state governments to abide by the norms of the PVT; (b) a formal
commitment by the municipality to participate in the project to be agreed with
the state; (c) demonstration by the municipality or state, to the satisfaction
of SEDESOL, of their administrative capacity and ability to undertake the sub-
project; (d) agreement to create or strengthen transport planning, traffic
engineering and traffic management units; (e) agreement by the municipality
and state to make adequate budget provision for their share of the sub-project
costs and not to initiate any urban transport investment outside of the agreed
program with a total cost over US$3.0 million; and (f) a commitment to a plan
of action by the municipality to develop a road and signals maintenance
capability. Sub-loans will be made available to finance: (i) studies to
produce the ITP, and tii) up to US$5 million per municipality for immediate
civil works which will be prejudiced through further delay in implementation.
Up to twelve municipalities will be eligible for sub-loans to finance the
implementation of the recommended Action and Investment Plans of the ITP,
including civil works, traffic control equipment and institutional
strengthering activities, once an ITP satisfactory to SEDESOL, BANOBRAS and
the Bank .. L been completed, the above commitments have been satisfied and the
following criteria have been met: (a) completion of economic and environmental
assessmer.ts of all sub-project components; (b) completion of final engineering
and bid documentation for components comprising a minimum of 20% of the sub-
project; and (c) all reasonable alternatives to any sib-project component
which involved the displacement of population have been reviewed and found to
be inferior to that proposed.
7.        Prolect Imnlementation.  SEDESOL will be responsible for its
institutional strengthening program, the national training program,
environmental and technical aspects, the establishment and promotion of the
national urban transport policy and supervision of the technical aspects of
the sub-projects. BANOBRAS will be responsible for its institutional
strengthening program, loan administration and the preparation of reports to
the Bank and ouupervision of the financial aspects of the sub-projects.
Preparation and implementation of sub-projects will be the responsibility of
the municipalities, with SUDESOL's assistance. Bank approval will be required
for deciding on the eligibility of individual cities and sub-projects.
8.        Proiect Sustainability.  Project design stresses institutional
strengthening and training at the notional, state and local levels and
technical assistance to help in the development of transport planning, and the
preparation of a satisfactory ITP. The financing scheme promotes increased
reliance on local contributions and borrowing. This should encourage
financial discipline, as federal funding for urban transport projects under
all alternative arrangements will cease to be available. Maintenance is being
emphasized. Within each subproject, direct beneficiaries will provide a
minimum 40% cost recovery of road/street construction sub-projects, with the



- 4 -
lowest proportion for projects to benefit low income households and public
transport user.
9.        Lessons from nrevious Bank involvement. The main lessons from the
experience of the First Urban Transport Project in Mexico (Loan 2824-NE),
under implementation, and 15 PCRs/PPARs for urban transport projects in other
countries, relate tos (a) institutional weakness, which will be addressed by
requiring the participating municipalities and states to satisfy on-lending
criteria, including having in place viable administrative units for planning
and managing urban transport, and well focused proposals for further
institutional strengthening in the ITP; (b) inadequate maintenance, addressed
by requiring participating cities to put in place a satisfactory maintenance
organization and to assign adequate budgetary resources for maintenance, as
well as including medium-term maintenance plans in their ITPs; (c) lggk of
counterpart funds, addressed by verifying the federal, state and municipal
budget provisions during the annual project reviews and by reducing the scale
of m-wnicipal counterpart funding required  and (d) inadeauate consideration of
environmental .mpags, addressed through environmental assessment and
monitoring and by requiring dpecific environmental factors to be taken into
account in the ITPs. Satisfactory plans for alleviating significant
environmental impacts will be a condition of city participation. As under
Loan 2824-NE the preparation of engineering designs has been slow, the
completion of final designs for at least 20% of works and all equipment
specifications will be a condition of eligibility for the implementation sub-
loan.
10.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. As part of its urban development
strategy, the Government of Mexico (GO) is seeking to strengthen the
institutional, financial and technical capacities of local governments, so as
to enable them to plan, finance, operate and maintain basic public services.
This policy is detailed in the recently announced government plan for urban
development, called "Strengthening of 100 Cities", of which the PVT is one of
the five principal components. The aim is to further decentralize to the
local level and thereby increase the responsibility and accountability of
local officials and improve cost effectiveness and delivery of essential
services, in line with the Bank urban sector strategy. The GON is seeking
Bank assistance towards realization of the PVT. Bank participation will allow
building upon the experience gained and lessons learned from other urban
transport projects in institutional development, and addressing a broad range
of issues in an integrated framework.
11.       Action. Agreed   The program has already been approved by the
government and satisfactory ITPs have been completed for the r%nicipalities of
Ciudad Juarez, Leon, and Toluca. During negotiations the following were
confirmeds (a) SEDISOL's and BAN0RAS' commitment to carry-out their
respactive strengthening programs; (b) the general content of the National
Training Program; (c) the content of the PVT, including the financing scheme
and eligibility criteria; (d) that participating municipalities and states
will comply with the PVT Operating Manual; (e) that the final decision for
Bank financing of any sub-project will lie with the Bank and that not more
than 12 municipalities will participate in Part 83 of the project; (f) the
conditions for on-lending; (g) that the Guarantor shall submit to the Bank for



its review and comment the proposed budget allocations to the project by the
Federal Government; (h) BANOBRAS shall furnish to the Bank for its review and
comment the proposed Annual Transport Investment Plan of each sub-borrower;
(i) the procurement, disbursement and auditing arrangements; (j) BANOBRAS
shall submit a progress report to the Bank for its review and comment at the
end of each quarterp and (k) the timing and agendas of the annual and Mid Term
Reviews. The Federal Government has already provided: (a) an acceptable
draft contract for provision of the intensive course of National Training
programp (b) complete final designs of the civil works included in the first
year of two sub-projects; and (c) the proposed 1993 Federal budget, showing an
allocation greater than US$25 million to cover the Federal counterpart
requirements for 1993. The State of Mexico has initiated an agreed Action Plan
to improve the institutional capacity and capability of its newly created
Transport Planning Division. Conditigns of effectiveness will be: (a) all
counterpart staff of SEDESOL and BANO0RAS to be in place; (b) the contract for
the intensive course of the NTP to have been signed; and (c) the satisfactory
execution of one city sub-loan agreement.
12.       Prolect Benefits.  The main institutional benefits will arise from
improved allocation of resources in the sector, incentives to the cities to
improve their planning and project selectior criteria, from the application of
sound transport policies and from the improvement in human resource skills in
the sector. The main sector benefits will be: (a) lower vehicle operating
costs; (b) reduced user time costs; and (c) improved public transport
operations and improvec accessibility to areas poorly served by public
transport. The ERR's for the project components in the first three
participating cities range from 34% to 72% for particular components of sub-
projects, with an average close to 50%. All sub-projects and sub-project
components will have a minimum ERR of 12%.
13.       Environmental Asaects.  The city subprojects will have the
following environmental benefits: (a) reduced vehicle emissions, dust
emissions, traffic noise and community severance; and (b) improved conditions
for pedestrians and cyclists. Land expropriation requirements should be
small, but in cases where relocation is required, a full resettlement program,
acceptable to the Bank, will be prepared and appropriate consultations with
the affected community will be required prior to the inclusion of the relevant
component in the sub-project. The project has an environmental rating of "B".
14.       Proaram Obiective Cateaories.  While loan proceeds will mostly
finance urban transport infrastructure in selected cities, the project places
a high priority on institutional strengthening and environmental issues.
Also, the paving of accesses to low income residential areas (about 18% of
sub-project investments) will improve public transport especially to the poor.
15.       Risks   Project risks involve weak institutional capacity on
sectoral issues, both at the Federal and local levels and the risk of changes
in the degree of commitment and counterpart funding at local levels when the
elected authorities change. This is mitigated by SEDESOL's decision to
reorganize its urban transport division and commitment to appoint technical
assistance services for its strengthening. In addition, technical assistance
and consultant services to both Federal and local agencies are being provided



and consultant services to bo' :l Federal and local agencies are being provided
in the project. The risk of lack of counterpart funding will be mitigated bys
(i) the application of the up-front sub-project aligibility criteria; (ii) the
incentive provided by the grant element of the federal Program; (iii) the
requirement of a federal budget line item as a condition of effectiveness; and
(iv) the verification of an adequate budget allocations at federal, state and
municipal levels during the annual project reviews. The fleclble line of
credit approach will allow resoucceit to be reallocated from any unsatisfactory
sub-project to a new sub-project in another city.
16.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
