Re: Medium Size Cities Urban Transport Project
                 (Loan 3559-ME): Amendment to the Loan Agreement                   
Dear Sirs:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement: (Medium Size Cities Urban Transport Project) 
between the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and Banco 
Nacional de Obras y Servicios Públicos, S.N.C. (the Borrower) dated June 18, 1993, as 
amended (the Loan Agreement) and the Guarantee Agreement for the same Project between 
the United Mexican States (the Guarantor) and the Bank of even date therewith as 
amended (the Guarantee Agreement). Whenever used in this letter, the several terms 
defined in the Loan Agreement have the respective meanings set forth therein and the 
term “1997 Amendment” means the amendment to the Loan and Guarantee Agreement dated 
December 12, 1997.
Pursuant to discussions between staff of the Borrower, the Guarantor and the 
Bank, the Bank hereby agrees:
1.
To amend Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement by adding a new paragraph 4 to read as 
follows:
“The Bank may require withdrawals from the Loan Account to be made on the basis 
of statements of expenditure for expenditures for:
(a)
services under contracts costing less than: (i) $100,000 equivalent for 
consulting firms; (ii) $50,000 equivalent for individual consultants;
(b)
goods under contracts costing less than $250,000 equivalent; and
(c)
works costing less than $250,000 equivalent
all under such terms and conditions as the Bank shall specify by notice to the 
Borrower.”
2.
To apply the increased disbursement percentages set forth in the attachment to 
the 1997 Amendment, retroactively as of April 1, 1997.
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing the three originals 
of this letter and returning one fully signed original to us.  Upon receipt by the 
Bank of such fully signed original, the amendments set forth in this Amendment Letter 
will become effective as of the date of this letter.
Sincerely,
/s/ Richard Clifford
