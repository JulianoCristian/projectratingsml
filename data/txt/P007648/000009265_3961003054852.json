objectives of the project are\n            to improve the quality and efficiency of urban transport\n            systems in medium-size cities, assist the Federal Government\n            in decentralizing responsibility for urban transport\n            management and finance improvements that are economically\n            justified, and control the environmental impacts of urban\n            transport operations.  The project comprises national and\n            local components.  The national component comprises: (a) an\n            institutional strengthening program for the Ministry of\n            Social Development; (b) an institutional strengthening\n            program for the National Development Bank for Public Works\n            and Services; (c) a national training program for urban\n            transport professionals; and (d) grants towards the cost of\n            studies to prepare Integral Transport Plans (ITPs).  The\n            local component comprises sub-loans to medium-size cities\n            that meet eligibility criteria to finance:  (a) the\n            remaining cost of the studies for ITPs; (b) urgent\n            infrastructure improvements; (c) other urban transport\n            improvements, including planning and rehabilitation, paving\n            of access routes to low income areas and corridor\n            improvements; (d) the final design of sub-projects,\n            technical assistance, studies and training for professional\n            staff in the cities; and (e) equipment for traffic\n            management and control."}, "docdt": "1993-01-15T00:00:00Z"}
