PROJECT CDMPLETION REPORT
CYPRUS: THIRD LOAN TO THE CYPRUS DEVELOPMENT BANK
(LOAN 1744-CY)
PREFACE
This report deals with the third industrial credit loan extended by
the Bank to the Cyprus Development Bank (CDB). Loan 1744-CY was signed on
July 5, 1979, and was disbursed by August 31, 1983. The amount of the credit
loan was $5.0 million, of which $1.0 million was allocated to small scale
industries.
This report follows closely on the issue by the Operations Evaluation
Department of the project evaluation report on the second loan to CDB (Loan
1278-CY), which was issued in April 1983. Consequently, this report is based
on the previous project completion report, updated and augmented to cover the
period 1979 - mid-1983.
The attached Project Completion Report was prepared with full
cooperation of the Cyprus Development Bank. Comments from the Borrower were
received on May 10, 1984, and were limited to one comment which is
incorporated in the text; a copy of the Borrower's Comments is attached as
Annex VI.
The project has not been subjected to an audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CYPRUS: THIRD LOAN TO THE CYPRUS DEVELOPMENT BANK
(LOAN 1744-CY)
HIGHLIGHTS
*                    The World Bank Loan 1744-CY has achieved its main stated objectives.
Projects totalling about S32.9 million were financed with assistance of the
$5.0 million Bank loan, and 850 new jobs were created. CDB, in its
restructured form, financed about 7% of its target group of private sector
manufacturing investments (excluding Government investments, and
self-financing large-scale organizations), participated in nearly all major
hotel projects, and has become active in promotion. IFC cooperated in four
ventures with CDB (two of which in 1983, an investment bank and a tourism
project). CDB has become a leading institution in Cyprus, and has developed a
very capable management and staff. In addition to its traditional function as
a financier of industry and tourism establishments, CDB also provides
technical, financial and managerial advice.
RHwever, CDB has experienced difficulties in controlling arrears, and
has a limited profitability mainly due to the prevailing interest rate
structure in Cyprus; these difficulties are aggrevated by CDB's inability to
charge penalties on overdue interest and principal payments and by legislation
which in many cases prevents CDB to take legal action to recover arrears. The
interest rate question remains the subject of a continuing dialogue between
the Bank and the Government, and proved much more difficult to handle than
anticipated at the time of the appraisal of the loan. The lesson learned is
the importance of interest rate for DFC clients and their inclination to put
themselves in default if this leads to a more profitable opportunity. The
Bank also was not sufficiently aware of the political aspects of interest rate
issues.
No particular difficulties have arisen during the supervision of this
loan, mainly due to the excellent and cordial cooperation received at all
times from CDB and Government authorities. CDB has indicated that further
Bank loans for its normal operations are not essential, as it can now attract
*          funds from commercial banks.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CYPRUS: THIRD LOAN TO THE CYPRUS DEVEIDPNENT BANK
(LOAN 1744-CY)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Cyprus Development Bank Limited (CDB) was founded in 1963, at the
initiative of the Government of Cyprus, as a new type of institution deriving
financial support from both the Government and the private sector, and desig-
nated to provide medium and long-term loans and equity capital for industry
and tourism and other private productive enterprises. CDB also acts as under-
writer for securities of these enterprises, promotes new enterprises, and
assists entrepreneurs in preparing investment proposals. CDB was also to
mobilize domestic and foreign capital for long-term investment purposes by the
sale of shares and debentures locally and by borrowing abroad. CDB's
authorized share capital is C£3 million. In December 1981, its fully paid-up
share capital was increased to CE2.0 million, consisting of 400,000 C£1 Class
"A" non-voting shares held by 910 private investors, and 1,600,000 CE1 Class
"B" voting shares held by the Government.
1.02     The first Bank loan to CDB of $3 million, approved in 1972, helped to
finance the foreign exchange component of 17 projects with a total value of
$20.6 million. The events of 1974 in Cyprus disrupted CDB's operations. Many
of the enterprises financed by CDB in the northern area closed down, and the
enterprises in this area were no longer under CDB's control or supervision.
1.03     The 1974 events had serious consequences for CDB. CDB's portfolio in
the northern area, amounting to half of its outstanding total loans and to
one-third of its equity holdings at the end of 1975, was lost, and CDB was
subsequently saved from insolvency only through a Government rescue opera-
tion. The Government, with the objective of making CDB the major instrument
of development assistance to industry and tourism, ristructured and refinanced
CDB in 1976 with World Bank assistance. The Government took over all the
veting rights from the private shareholders, and agreed to provide CDB with
grants and guarantees of payment to offset past and future non-payments of
principal and interest on the northern area portfolio; CDB also received comn-
pensation for its small equity holding in the north.
1.04     In conjunction with a $4.0 million financing by the Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KFW), the Bank made a second loan to CDB for $6.0 million, which
included an allocation of $0.75 million for small scale industries (SSI).
This second loan was approved by the Executive Directors on May 18, 1976, and
is described in Appraisal Report 1079:r-CY of May 10, and in the President's
Report P-1853-CY of May 11, 1976; these reports also contain a more detailed
description of the Government restructuring and refinancing scheme. A
completion report on this loan, PCR No.4454 was issued on April 21, 1983.
1.05     In 1979, a third loan to CDB, Loan 1744-CY was approved by the Bank.
The amount of the loan was $5.0 million, of which l.O million for SSI. CDB
co-operated fully in the preparation of the following PCR of this loan, and
has provided a substantial amount of the data used in this report.

II.  THE ENVIRONMENT
A. Background
2.01     Cyprus became an independent country in 1960 and now has a total
population of about 650,000. Since independence, the country has been
troubled by political difficulties arising from the intercommunal disputes
between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots communities. In spite of these
difficulties, Cyprus as a whole had an impressive growth record. Economic
growth averaged over 7% p.a. in real terms from 1960-72, but an unprecedented
drought lead to stagnation in 1973. The events of 1974 led to a major
upheaval of the political, economic and social life in Cyprus. A de facto
Turkish-Cypriot administration took control of the northern part, which F
included rich agricultural areas, a quarter of industrial investments, cities
with important tourism investments and infrastructure, and the island's major
port of Famagusta. A massive displacement of population took place as 180,000
Greek Cypriots moved south, and about 45,000 Turkish Cypriots left for the
north; about one-third of each community was thus displaced. Full employment
was replaced by an unemployment rate of about 25X in the southern,
Government-controlled area, although less than half of those unemployed
registered at labor exchanges.
B. Economic Development 1975-1982
2.02     After the 1974 events, the Government set up a relief service for the
refugees which supported almost 140,000 people; embarked on a large housing
program; reduced income in both the public and private sectors on a pro-
gressive scale, and channelled the proceeds into refugee relief; and embarked
on an expansionary monetary and fiscal policy to supplement private demand
which was greatly reduced in 1975. The Government, through Emergency Economic
Action Plans, put emphasis on the promotion of export-oriented light indus-
tries and on tourism; in both sectors, CDB plays an important role.
2.03     After a significant drop in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1975, the
economy recovered rapidly. Continuous growth was recorded, but with a
generally declining rate, as shown below (constant 1973 factor cost):
GDP           Change in                      GDP         Change in

1975      209.3           - 19.0           1979        333.9         + 8.8
1976      248.6           + 18.8           1980        353.0         + 5.7
1977      284.2           + 14.3           1981        3 31.3        + 2.4

* 1982 figures are provisional.
Source: Department of Statistics and Research.
The overall slowing down of the increase in the GDP after 1977 is not
surprising, since much of the fixed assets lost had been rapidly replaced,
unemployment became minimal, and the international economic climate - which



- 3 -
has a direct and immediate effect on the country's export-oriented industries
and tourism - became less favorable. The composition of the GDP has not
changed significantly between 1975 and 1983, with the exception of an increase
in the share of the construction sector and a decline in the share of agricul-
ture.
2.04   Since 1975, Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation (GDFCF) has also
grown continuously, with the exception of 1981 when a decline was recorded,
followed by a recovery in 1982. These are shown below (at constant 1973
market prices):

* 1982 figures are provisional.

Housing continues to be by far the leading sector while investment in
manufacturing after a rapid rise in 1975 - 1978 showed a relative decline in
1979 - 1981, both in real values and in the share of total GDFCF, but improved
marginally in 1982.
2.05   A significant development of the period under review is the change in
the Cyprus employment situation. At the end of 1974, 24.5% of the
economically active population were unemployed, while by 1?78 conditions of
nearly full employment had been achieved; however, unemployment has increased
again as a result of the worldwide recession, and amounted to 2.8% of the
economically active population at the end of 1982, and is creeping upwards.
2.06   After a decline in 1976, the increase in price levels, as measured by
the retail price index, rose steadily to reach 13.5% for 1980, but is pro-
jected to be down to 5.3% for 1983. The development of inflation since 1975
was as follows:
Year    Average Inflation Rate (X)    Year        Average Inflation Rate (X)
1975                 4.6                1979                   9.5

2.07   Manufacturing has become the leading economic activity in the country,
accounting for 17.6Z of GDP in 1982. Exports of industrial products of
manufacturing origin amounted to CE 28.1 million or 58Z of total exports in
the same year. Tourism has become the second largest component of the
economy, accounting for 14.1X of GDP in 1982. 1/
III. CYPRUS DEVELOPMENT BANK (CDB)
A. Position in 1975
3.01   Following the 1974 events, CDB had lost control of and access to loan
and equity investments of CE2.6 million ($7.1 million) in the northern area,
but had retained the liabilities related to borrowings incurred to finance
these projects. As the total 0ook value of the holdings in the north
including arrears amounted to CE2.9 million ($7.9 million) at the end of 1975,
or about 2.4 times CDB's equity at that time, CDB had lost its credit-
worthiness and would have become insolvent without the Government or other
outside assistance. In addition, the C£2.7 million ($7.3 million) portfolio
in the Government controlled, southern part of Cyprus was also seriously
affected by the general economic upheaval following the 1974 events, resulting
in arrears affecting 54X of the portfolio in the south as of end of December
1975.
B. Restructuring Operation
3.02   The Government, recognizing that CDB had an important role to play in
reactivating the economy, undertook special measures to restore CDB's credit-
worthiness. This involved the immediate transfer of all voting rights to the
Government, the gradual acquisition by the latter of all Class "A" Shares,
which became nonvoting 5% preferential dividend shares, and the provision to
CDB of non-liability resources to offset maturities of interest and principal
due on loans made to projects in the northern part of Cyprus. CDB became
essentially a quasi-Government institution, but its operational independence
has been safeguarded in its Charter and in the adopted Statement of Policies
and Procedures. All powers of the CDB are vested in its Board which consists
of seven directors; four, including the Chairman, are selected by the Govern-
ment from among independent and experienced private sector leaders, and three
are appointed by the Government from among senior officials of the Ministry of
Finance, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Planning Bureau. The
details of the rehabilitation scheme, as well as the allocation to reserves to
compensate for possible losses in the portfolio in the south, were finalized
in close cooperation with the World Bank (see Appraisal Report 1079-CY of May
10, 1976).
3.03   At the end of 1975, CDB had no resources other than CE35,000 in local
currency funds in the form of Government loans and self-generated funds; it
had exhausted all its resources in foreign exchange. The Government and CDB,
therefore, approached the Bank and KfW for (second) loans to CDB. In addition

to requesting funds for the normal operations of CDB, which provide financing
to medium and large scale industrial operations and tourist facilities in the
island, the Government asked that part of the new Bank loan would be allocated
to more labor intensive small scale industries (SSI) to alleviate the very
high unemployment rate.
C. Management and Staff
3.04     The CDB management team consists of the General Manager who is the
institution's chief executive and directly responsible to the Board of
Directors, an Assistant General Manager with specific responsibilities for
project promotion and special projects, including projects in difficulties,
and three managers respectively in charge of the Economic, Technical and
Finance Departments.  The fourth manager who was in charge of the Investments
Department has been seconded for a period of five years as General Manager to
the newly formed Cyprus Investment and Securities Corporation Limited. The
Assistant General Manager has assumed the duties of the manager of this
Department.
3.05     A small section under one of the managers deals exclusively with the
SSI Scheme, but can also draw assistance from other staff whenever warranted
by the operations of the Scheme.
3.06     CDB also engages reputable auditors and uses the services of out-
side legal advisers, in addition to the internal services of a solicitor
engaged in 1982.
3.07     CDB professional staff has grown from 7 at end-1975 to 18 in 1983,
while total staff increased from 16 to 33 over the same period. The increase
in staff has been lower than the increase in business volume. CDB's management
and staff are highly qualified; most of the professional staff have studied in
the UK or USA, and have obtained advanced degrees, mainly in engineering,
business administration and economics. The Assistant General Manager and one
Department Manager are EDI Fellows. Five experienced engineers on the staff
are capable of reviewing the technical quality of project proposals. The
quality of appraisal reports and financial statements received from CDB have
been consistently of the highest quality, and World Bank missions judge the
staff and management very competent, responsive to new ideas, and able to cope
with the high workload imposed. CDB designed a new long-range corporate plan,
*         which involved a reorganization implemented in 1984.
D.       Financial Performance 1979 - 1982
3.08     CDB's net profit (expressed as a percentage of average net worth)
declined from 7.9% in 1979 to 4.6% in 1981, and rose to 5.8% in 1982. CDB's
low profitability emanates mainly from its inability to charge rates of
interest on its loan portfolio in excess of 9% p.a., because of legal
restrictions (para 3.16). The resultant financial spread is inadequate to
allow the Bank to finance its other costs as well as enjoy a healthy profit.
3.09     The total assets of CDB including those of the SSI Scheme rose from
CE15.4 million in 1979 to CE24.9 million at the end of 1982. Adminis- tration
expenses remained low in relation to the Bank's level of operations and
averaged 1.9% of total assets in 1982.



3.10     Average income from loans rose to 8.9Z in 1982 from 8.52 in 1979.
Over the same period, the average cost of debt increased from 5.9Z to 6.22
with the resultant financial spread increasing from 2.6Z to 2.7Z. The CDB
though operating in a restrictive environment has thus been successful in
broadening its financial spread towards the targeted 31.
3.11     Approvals increased from CE1.83 million in 1976 to a peak of CE3.22
million in 1981; after a decline to C£2.35 million in 1982, CE2.71 million
have been approved in the period January - September 1983. Comitments
increased from CE1.27 million in 1976 to a peak of CE3.58 million in 1980, and
gradually declined to CE2.80 million in 1982, reflecting the slowdown of 1981
approvals. Disbursements in 1976, still affected by the 1974 events, were
only CEO.99 million, but reached the peak of CE3.57 million in 1980, declining
to CE2.76 million in 1982; up to September 1983, CE1.78 million were disbursed.
3.12     CDB's performance is hampered by an arrears' problem and by low
profitability. Both these problems arise mainly because of Governmnutal
policies, and are beyond the control of CDB CDB has already taken steps to
relieve pressure on the arrears situation, and has ade proposals to both the
Central Bank of Cyprus and the Government for the alleviation of the
profitability constraint. The arrears and profitability situation is
discussed in more detail below.
E. Constraints
3.13     In the years 1979 to 1982, increasing portfolio arrears were a major
operational problem for CDB. Total arrears outstanding for three months and
over in relation to the total portfolio outstanding on CDB's normal operations
averaged 5.7Z at the end of September 1979, and increased to an average of
10.8% at the end of September 1982. The amount of loans affected in relation
to the total loans outstanding (including interest) increased from 17.81 to
29.7Z in the same period. The position has improved since then and in
September 1983 these arrears represented 9.61 of the portfolio outstanding,
and loans affected 22.9Z.
3.14     For the normal operations, however, only 23 projects out of 129 with
arrears, irrespective of the period outstanding, were considered by CDB of a
serious nature as at September 1983; for the SSI, the position vas 19 projects
out of 69. The majority of arrears were due by clients who, for reasons
detailed below (paras 3.16-3.18), were unwilling to pay their contractual
obligations.
3.15     In the case of the SSI Scheme (which comprises loans under agreements
1278 CY and 1744 CY) loan and interest arrears outstanding for three months
and over in relation to the total portfolio increased from 3.3Z in September
1979 to 32X in September 1982, while loans affected increased fLam 20.51 to
60.8% in the same period.  In September 1983, these ratios stood at 37.9% and
55.7% respectively, which is still unsatisfactory.
3.16     The main reasons for the increase in arrears during the period of
disbursement of the loans were the 9% interest ceiling enforced by law, credit
ceilings and restrictions imposed by the Government, and a slow down in
economic growth and entrepreneurial activities. The interest rate charged by
the CDB is already at 9% p.a., which is the maximum permissible by law; the



charging of penalty rates on arrears would exceed the ceiling and is,
therefore, not enforcable.
3.17     In addition, since 1979, debtors who can prove that they were
displaced or afflicted by the events of 1974 cannot be sued in court for
overdue loan or interest payments (and most companies can show some evidence
to that effect). In particular, with regard to SSI clients, it should be
stressed that about half are refugees from the North. There is, therefore, no
direct incentive for CDB clients to be prompt with their repayment obligations
to the Bank.  Many companies and individuals consider CDB's assistance through
the Government as their least pressing repayment obligation.
3.18     Entrepreneurs are thus able to retain CDB's installments and
interest, and utilize the funds so retained to finance their working capital
requirements at the prevailing rate without incurring additional financial
expenses, and thereby overcoming the imposed credit restrictions, or even to
invest in assets or projects which they expect to yield more than 9%. More-
over, commercial banks are able, through the check account system, to exert
pressure an mutual clients with CDB for taking priority in repayment of
obligations to themselves.
3.19     Since the emergence of the problem, the CDB has taken vigorous action
to improve the situation. The follow-up and project monitoring operations
were invigorated and the CDB has taken an increasing number of clients to
court. CDB's efforts are reflected in the improved non-SSI position, as shown
in the 1983 figures.
3.20     CDB has also a persistent profitability problem, mainly stemming from
the 9% interest ceiling. Given that the Bank's average cost of the loan funds
is around 6%, the financial spread of around 3% is increasingly insufficient
to cover provisions for doubtful debts and the Bank's administrative
expenses. Moreover, the Bank's inability to charge commercial rates for the
consultancy services it provides to clients, is a contributing factor.
3.21     CDB was able to reduce its cost of funds to about 6% with Govern-
ment assistance, who in 1981 and 1982 guaranteed the average cost of funds on
both local and foreign borrowings to 6X p.a. The Government has also under-
taken the foreign exchange risk on the Bank's foreign currency borrowings, as
CDB is precluded from passing such risks to its borrowing clients.
3.22     The interest rate problem can only be resolved to the satisfaction of
CDB by a liberalization of interest rates, or raising the current ceiling of
9% p.a., which will allow CDB to charge penalty rates oa arrears. To this end
it has made strong representations to the Cyprus Government with regard to the
interest rate ceiling. The interest rate question has also repeatedly been
raised by the Bank with the Government, but efforts to remove the interest
rate ceiling have not been successful. A complication is the fact that under
Cyprus legislation the control of interest rates at present rests with the
elected House of Representatives, which has been unwilling to consider any
liberalization of interest rates proposed by the Government. In view of the
political implications of the issue, a decision is unlikely to be taken in the
foreseeable future.



-8-
3.23     CDB's financial structure is considered satisfactory despite the
profitability and arrears constraints. As at the end of 1982, reserves for
losses on portfolio investments, which were determined with the participation
of the auditors, averaged 2.7Z on the portfolio (normal operations only) and
were considered adequate.  The Bank debt to equity ratio was reduced to 6.4:1
at the end of 1981, with the conversion of C£1 million obligations to the loan
Commissioners into equity. As at the end of September 1983, this stood at
6.7:1 after taking into account the latest 15 million Eurodollar loan. This
ratio is well below the 7.5:1 ratio permitted by Loan 1744-CY Agreement.
F. Prospects
3.24     The prospects for CDB to continue to play a major role in the
financing of industrial and other commercial ventures are satisfactory.  The
arrears position is expected to improve mainly by CDB's recent action. The
CDB vill then be able to become more financially independent, and could work
to further strengthen its credit rating to secure, in due course, foreign
exchange resource from commercial banks, without requiring Government assis-
tance. In its dealings with the World Bank, in joint ventures with IFC
(asbestos cement pipes, investment bank and beach hotel projects), its
contacts with KFW and other institutions and commercial banks, it has
displayed the sophistication required for such operations.
3.25     In view of recent developments in the economic sectors, CDB has
decided to actively encourage entrepreneurs to invest in new industrial
-!projects. Improvement of productivity and product quality and reduction of
operational costs through the introduction of new technology and industrial
processes, investment in export oriented or import substituting industries and
utilization of local resources, are major objectives of this policy. On the
other hand, CDB has decided to limit its exposure in the tourism sector. It
only now considers applications relating to projects aiming at the enrichment
of the tourism product and the improvement and expansion of existing hotels.
CDB can also consider applications for the financing of new hotel projects
which can shov a significant quantifiable economic benefit. Because of its
participation in the Government Scheme for the reactivation of displaced
hoteliers, CDB has exceeded the targeted limit of one-third exposure in this
sector. On the Scheme's completion, which is nearing, the composition of
CDB's portfolio will begin to improve as a result of tourism project
repayments and the increased share of non-tourist loans.
3.26     Recognizing the reduced demand for SSI financing resulting from the
nearly full re-activation of the displaced population, and reflecting the
Government's and CDB policy for support to modern export oriented industries,
new SSI financing will be limited to the regenerated funds from repayments of
earlier SSI loans.
3.27     Total loan disbursements are expected to increase from CE2.8 million
in 1982 to CE3.8 million in 1985. The share of disbursements for manufactur-
ing is projected to increase from 52% to 69%, and for tourism to decline from
45Z to 23Z; for all other activities an increase is expected from 3% to 8%.



-9 -
3.28     CDB has extended its activities into providing consultancy services
to the public and private sectors, and in this context it provides technical,
economic and financial expertise, including the development and promotion of
new projects. CDB also offers comprehensive management services for the
administration of capital projects, from formulation through the construction
phase to completion. In late 1982, the investment bank project was
implemented through the incorporation of the Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited, as a joint venture of CDB, a local commercial bank, and
the International Finance Corporation.  The establishment of a Stock Exchange
in Cyprus is also actively being promoted.  A law for its establishment,
operation and administration was drafted and presented to the Government for
consideration and appropriate action. It is expected that the relevant Law
will be enacted in the course of 1984.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01     Following directly on, and in line with the previous loan to CDB
(Loan 1278-CY, PCR 4454 of April 21, 1983), Loan 1744-CY had as its main
objectives:
(a)    provide foreign exchange resources to CDB to finance investments in
foreign exchange earning industries and tourism establishments;
Cb)    assist CDB with the continuation of small-scale industries (SSI)
program; and
(c)    support CDB's efforts to raise additional foreign exchange funds from
commercial sources, and continue to provide technical assistance to
CDB.
B. Co-Financing
4.02     During the period under review, 1979 through 1983, CDB contracted
foreign currency loans totalling $25 million of which $5 million under Loan
1744-CY, $5 million from Grindlay Brants Limited, and $15 million from a
syndicated loan by Societe Generale Bank Limited; this was in line with the
projections made at the time of the loan appraisal. The World Bank re3ources
made available are thus 20% of the total foreign exchange contracted during
the period, a sharp reduction (55%) in CDB's foreign exchange requirements
provided during the period 1976 - 1979. The Bank's financing provided about
152 of total CDB resources during the period under review.
C. Use of Loan 1744-CY
4.03     The $5 million loan assisted in the financing of 14 large and of 63
SSI projects, with a total value of $32.9 million 1/, and employing about
850. The average maturity was six years (five years for SSI), including an
average grace period of just over one year.
1/ Assuming an average exchange rate of C£1 = $2.35.



- 10 -
4.04     Projected export and other foreign currency earnings from the
projects under Loan 1744-CY are estimated at $19.4 million per year when the
projects are in full operation; this is in line vith the projections made at
the time of the loan appraisal. However, these estimates are based on
subproject appraisal data, but as many of the projects are in the starting-up
phase, it has not been -ossible to fully verify the original projections.
D. Impact of CDB on Industry and Tourism
4.05     CDB's total disbursements, as measured against the total GDFCF, have
declined in 1982 after increasing steadily over the period of 1979-81, as
shown in the following tables. In the case of manufacturing, figures are
given for total CDFCF, and for CDB's target group of private industries,
excluding two large self-financing industrial organizations on the island.

- 11 -
As shown, CDB has made a substantial contribution to financing private
industry; in addi.ion its technical assistance and catalytic role in
attracting financing should be taken into consideration. It has also been
involved in almost all significant tourism projects established or expanded
since 1974. In this context, it should be noted that CDB operates in
competitive environment, with many banks using relatively low-cost checking
deposits to finance industry and tourism.
4.06     An analysis has been made of the sectoral distribution of the 14
larger projects financed under Loan 1744-CY.  In view of the small amount
involved, and the diversity of projects financed, no such analysis was made
for SSI. Of the total investment facilitated by the 14 CDB/IBRD loans, 84Z
was in the industry sector, 13% in tourism, while the remainder was in poultry
and meat processing (Annex V). About 65% of the actual CDB loan funds went to
industry, 22% to tourism and 13% to poultry. Within industry, the largest
beneficiary was non-metallic minerals with 22%, followed by metal products
(16%), paper products and packaging (14%), textiles (9%) and wood products
(3%) (Annex V). Of IBRD funds, 69% went to industry, 16Z to tourism and 15%
to poultry. Within industry, non-metallic minerals accounted for 29Z, paper
products and packaging 15%, metal products 13%, textiles 9% and wood products
3X (Annex IV).
E. Development of Small Scale Industries (SSI)
4.07     A total of 118 projects have been approved under Loan 1278-CY (55
projects) and Loan 1744-CY (63 projects), involving nearly $1.5 million of
Bank funds, and a matching amount of Government funds.
4.08     The arrangement whereby a unit in the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry was to act as a filter for SSI projects submitted, to reduce the
workload for CDB, has not worked well. It proved politically difficult for a
Government entity to screen out the bad projects, and advise prospective
borrowers that their proposal could no longer be considered. CDB management
also feels that the scope for SSI is now limited as the most likely profitable
opportunities have been taken up already, and recently submitted SSI projects
to CDB are often of poor quality and they have been rejected; in addition, and
most important, the high unemployment rate which precipitated SSI promotion
has diminished. CDB will, therefore, limit SSI to the resources becoming
available through the roll-over of funds previously lent to SSI, and now being
paid back; this will mean about 10 SSI projects per year. CDB will directly
check the viability of the projects submitted. and will no longer rely on
technical assistance provided by the Government; however, the procedures will
otherwise remain unchanged.
V. CONCLUSIONS
5.01     The World Bank Loan 1744-CY has achieved its main stated objectives.
Projects totalling about $32.9 million were financed with assistance of the
$5.0 million Bank loan, and 850 new jobs were created. CDB, in its
restructured form, financed about 7% of its target group of private sector
manufacturing investments (excluding Government investments, and



- 12 -
self-financing large-scale organizations), participated in nearly all major
hotel projects, and has become active in promotion. IFC cooperated in four
ventures with CDB (two of which in 1983, an investment bank and a tourism
project). CDB has become a leading institution in Cyprus, and has developed a
very capable management and staff.  In addition to its traditional function as
a financier of industry and tourism establishments, CDB also provides
technical, financial and managerial advice.
5.02     The financial situation of CDB is sound, in spite of high arrears
which are caused by external conditions and do not primarily relate to the
financial strength of CDB's borrowers. It would be helpful to strengthen
CDB's ability to attract foreign exchange resources based on its own
reputation and performance if present constraints on interest rates could be
removed. 
5.03     The SSI scheme filled a need to reduce the prevailing high unemploy-
ment on the island after the 1974 events, and the enterprises financed are,
with a few exceptions, operating profitably. However, repayment of the SSI
loans has been less than satisfactory. With the unemployment rate now at
lower levels, SSI no longer has priority in Cyprus. CDB's SSI operations are
expected to be smaller than those under loan 1744-CY. These operations will
be financed only from roll-over funds from the repayment of earlier SSI loans
and under full control of CDB..
5.04     The interest structure in Cyprus has remained the same over the
disbursement period of the loan, and continues to be the subject of a dialogue
between the Bank and the Government. The Government recognizes the importance
of this issue, but in spite of numerous attempts has not been able to overcome
it. The absolute interest rate ceiling controlled by the House of
Representatives has had an adverse impact on CDB's arrears position and
profitability, and was aggravated by CDB's inability to charge penalties on
overdue interest and principal payments, and by legislation which in many
cases prevents CDB to take legal action to recover arrears.
5.05     The interest rate question proved much more difficult to handle than
anticipated at the time of the appraisal of the loan. The lesson learned is
the importance of interest rate for DFC clients and their inclination to put
themselves in default if this leads to a more profitable opportunity. The
Bank also was not sufficiently aware of the political aspects of interest rate
issues.
5.06     CDB has indicated that further Bank loans for its normal operations
are not essential, as it can now attract funds from commercial banks.
5.07     No particular difficulties have arisen during the supervision of this
loan, mainly due to the excellent and cordial cooperation received at all
times from CDB and Government authorities.
