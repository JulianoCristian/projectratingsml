cover\n            one-quarter of CDB's total foreign exchange needs\n            between mid-1979 and mid-1981, will be used as follows: (i)\n            relending of $4.0 million to help finance the import content\n            of industrial and tourism sub-projects supporting Government\n            efforts to increase the foreign exchange earning capacity of\n            these subsectors; and (ii) re-lending of $1.0 million, in\n            conjunction with matching Government funds, to continue\n            support for the Small Scale Industries (SSI) program. The\n            SSI component, to cover enterprises employing between 4 to\n            39 persons, will emphasize the strengthening and\n            modernization of existing SSI, including mergers, to make\n            SSI more competitive internationally, while also supporting\n            the establishment of promising new SSI. Major objectives of\n            the Bank loan are also to help CDB mobilize critically\n            needed additional foreign exchange resources from external\n            commercial sources, and support sub-projects having\n            substantial impact on increasing foreign exchange earnings\n            from manufacturing and tourism."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
