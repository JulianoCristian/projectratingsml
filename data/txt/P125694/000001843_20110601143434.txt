I.     Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement

1.     The 2006-2009 World Bank programmatic DPL series in Mauritius effectively
supported a reform program to raise competitiveness. The aim was to transform Mauritius
from a labor intensive economy based on trade preferences to a high value added, knowledge and
services economy, underpinned by strong economic competitiveness. Reform was broadly
successful in achieving its objectives and brought fundamental change to the economy.
Furthermore, the reforms helped build the country’s resilience, consolidating fiscal expenditures
and reversing the upward trend in public debt.

2.      The DPL series also supported a short-term fiscal stimulus package that partially
contained the impact of the global crisis. The world economic crisis led to a deceleration of
GDP growth from 5.9 percent in 2007 to 3 percent in 2009 and 4.4 percent in 2010. Public debt
to GDP interrupted its declining trajectory and increased to 59.9 percent of GDP in 2010
compared to 54 percent of GDP in 2008. The downturn was partially contained thanks to a short-
term fiscal stimulus package made possible because of the Government’s relatively comfortable
fiscal position prior to the onset of the crisis that provided the fiscal space for a counter-fiscal
policy and expansionary monetary policy. Stimulus measures cumulatively accounted for about
7.5 percent of GDP spread over 2009-2011. In 2010, the economy rebounded but has not yet
returned to 2008 levels in many sectors (i.e. tourism sector, or labor intensive exports of goods).
Other areas, such as financial intermediation and real estate, are performing relatively better,
driven by large net capital inflows to the banking sector and record FDI.



                                                                                                  1
3.      Looking forward, the reform agenda remains unfinished and critical constraints to
economic development still need to be addressed. Notably, while there was significant
progress in increasing the competiveness of the private sector, improvements in the performance
of the public sector were much more modest. Public sector performance is emerging as a binding
constraint for further development. Public enterprises and parastatals that provide critical
services such as water and electricity urgently need to enhance their efficiency. Public sector
management, needs further strengthening particularly in management of the civil service and
governance of public enterprises. Competitiveness is still hampered by substantial time
consuming business and trade permits.

4.      A new government came into power in 2010 with a commitment to continuing the
basic direction of structural reforms, but with an increased emphasis on social programs.
The GoM requested to the Bank a new series of programmatic DPLs to continue
supporting public sector efficiency to raise competitiveness and improve support to the
vulnerable. The programmatic approach of four operations over the next four years, running
concurrently with the mandate of the existing administration focuses on the Government’s twin
objectives of increasing competiveness of the economy and addressing exclusion and poverty.

II.    Proposed Objective(s)

5.       The development objective of the programmatic series is to improve the
performance of the public sector in Mauritius so as to more effectively support and
empower the vulnerable and enhance economic competiveness. The proposed operation will
achieve this by supporting reforms articulated around three pillars: (i) strengthening services to
support and empower the most vulnerable; (ii) improving business and trade competiveness, and
(iii) raising the efficiency and effectiveness of the civil service and public enterprises. The
programmatic approach of four operations over the next four years, running concurrently with
the mandate of the existing administration focuses on the Government’s twin objectives of
increasing competiveness of the economy and addressing exclusion and poverty.

III.   Preliminary Description

6.     The proposed DPL, in an amount of US$20 million is the first in a series of four
annual programmatic operations in support of the Government’s medium-term reform
program. The DPL series is aligned with the mandate of the new Government, which began in
2010 and which will come to an end in 2014. The DPL series represents the principle pillar of
the Country Partnership Strategy, which has also recently been extended to 2014 in line with the
Government’s mandate.

7.     The new programmatic DPL series assists the Government in its effort to enhance
public sector performance through a series of second generation reforms. It builds on the
successful previous series of DPL operations implemented between 2006-2010 (which focused
primarily on trade and competiveness), by broadening the agenda to focus on performance of the
public sector, where it has been recognized that additional efforts are needed if Mauritius is to
unlock its full potential to produce inclusive and balanced growth.



                                                                                                2
8.    For each of the three pillars that will be supported by this operation, prior actions
have been identified that create the basic institutions to unlock the reforms. The specific
measures that have been agreed as prior actions for the first DPL are presented in Annex 1.

IV.     Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects

Poverty and Social Impacts

9.       The Government invests significant resources in efforts to support the poor and help
move them out of poverty, leading to relatively good social indicators. At 8.5 percent (about
106,000 persons), poverty is low but nevertheless persistent. The Government implements an
array of social assistance programs, including multiple cash and in-kind programs, active labor
market programs, community interventions, and social care services. Notwithstanding these
significant investments, the Government plans to give more attention to the social integration
agenda so that it can address the widespread concern that the benefits of economic growth have
not been enjoyed by all. This effort should involve not only increasing financing, but also
improving the effectiveness and efficiency of, existing interventions that have suffered from
several shortcomings. Social Aid is not adequately targeted and reaches only around 13 percent
of the poor, and around 36 percent of benefits go to those in the wealthiest two quintiles.
Exclusion is a result of the Social Aid legislation, which is outdated and relies on categories of
eligibility that exclude many of the poor. Government is exploring whether and how to amend
the existing legislation so as to more effectively reach the poorest.

10.     The DPL series is expected to alleviate poverty through the following four channels:
(i) social protection programs will be more effective in protecting the poor; (ii) improved
education access for most vulnerable groups will allow them to move out of poverty; (iii)
streamlining NTBs will help create jobs, as they disproportionally affect more heavily SMEs that
do not have the financial means to deal with them; and (iv) better public services through the
reforms of civil service and public enterprises.

Environment Aspects

11.     Few if any of the reforms supported by the DPL series is likely to have significant direct
effects on the environment, natural resources, and forestry. If supported, reforms in SOEs, such
as water or energy, will be focused on improved management of public companies with no direct
relationship to investment in these areas. Beyond the immediate focus of the DPL, other
Government policies and development objectives such as increasing tourist arrivals by 2015,
expanding the port and airport, relieving traffic congestion, making the business climate more
investor friendly may have environmental impact. Historically, the record of environmental
management, though not perfect, has been relatively good.1 Furthermore, all Development
Partners recognize the strategic importance of environmental protection and AFD, UNDP and
the EC are actively providing technical support in this area.
