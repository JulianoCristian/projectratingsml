I.     Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement

1.      Recent economic reforms in Mauritius have continued a long tradition of economic
growth and development. Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has achieved substantial
economic growth of around 5 percent per annum, which has underpinned an economic transition
from a predominantly agricultural economy based on sugar production toward a diversified
economy structured around textile exports and tourism. However, by the mid-2000s, with the
erosion of its preferential trade status and rising commodity prices, it was evident that reform to
further transition Mauritius from a labor-intensive economy toward a high value-added
knowledge and services economy was needed. As a result, in 2006 the Government implemented
a bold reform program structured around four pillars: (i) strengthening fiscal consolidation and
public sector efficiency; (ii) enhancing trade competiveness; (iii) improving the investment
climate; and (iv) widening opportunities. The reform was broadly successful in restoring
competitiveness, and achieving economic growth and employment creation in higher value
added sectors. Moreover, the reform helped to consolidate government expenditure and reversed
the upward trend in public debt. This provided the necessary space to adopt temporary counter-
cyclical fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the negative impact of the global financial crisis
in 2009-10, and the Euro crisis in 2010.

2.    However, the reform agenda remains unfinished and critical constraints to
economic development, particularly with regard to public sector performance, have
become increasingly evident. There is substantial room for improvement in the performance of

                                                                                                  1
the public sector particularly with regards to parastatals and public companies. This performance
of the public sector significantly impacts the quality of service delivery and undermines overall
economic competitiveness. Reform will be necessary to bring the sector up to the level that
would be necessary for Mauritius to achieve its development goals.

3.      The uncertain status of the global economy and the risks this poses to Mauritius
adds new urgency to reform. Global economic uncertainties pose an increasing threat to a
small open economy such as Mauritius, primarily on two fronts – the fiscal position and the
current account deficit. Slower global economic growth could depress domestic growth and tax
revenues, yet pressure to finance government priorities would likely continue. The fiscal position
remains stretched, with high public debt, which is only projected to decline by a modest amount
in the medium-term. Therefore a counter-cyclical fiscal policy would be difficult to implement if
these external threats materialize. This highlights the need for measures that substantially raise
public sector efficiency. Additionally, current account deficits, although high, have to date been
financed mostly through high Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and inflows to the financial
sector, but this could quickly reverse if international financial markets deteriorate. The
concentration of the country’s exports on a few markets (Europe) and products (tourism and
textiles) could lead to a further deterioration of the current account deficit, which requires an
acceleration of reforms to improve competitiveness and position the economy to access new
markets and develop new products.

4.      The support provided by this proposed DPL is instrumental in helping to overcome
many of the challenges the Government faces. The Government continues to see DPLs as an
important vehicle for supporting policy reform in Mauritius. While financing may be needed, it
is the technical assistance, policy dialogue and additional support to reform champions that the
Government most values in the World Bank engagement through DPLs. The proposed DPL is
being prepared in coordination with the First Private Sector Competitiveness (PSC) DPL. The
two DPL series are designed to be mutually reinforcing and address complementary aspects of
the Government’s reform program. The PSC DPL series will focus primarily on strengthening
the policy and institutional environment for private sector competitiveness, while this DPL will
focus primarily on the performance of the public sector. It is the combination of the reforms
supported by these two DPLs that will help government improve its competitiveness and
resilience; and prepare it for a next phase of rapid and inclusive economic growth.

5.      The proposed DPL and the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (2007-13) are
closely linked to each other and to the Government’s program. The CPS Progress Report
was presented to the World Bank Executive Board in April 2010, and extended the CPS to FY15
to align it with the electoral cycle. The CPS Progress Report emphasized that the proposed DPL
series will be the Bank’s main vehicle for further supporting the Government’s broad reform
program.


II.    Proposed Objective(s)

The development objective of the DPL programmatic series is to support improvement in
the performance of the public sector in Mauritius by assisting the government to implement

                                                                                                2
reforms around the following three pillars: (i) strengthening programs that support and empower
the most vulnerable; (ii) streamlining trade regulation and processes; and (iii) improving human
resource management in the civil service and monitoring of SOE performance.


III.   Preliminary Description

6.      The proposed DPL, in an amount of US$20 million is the first in a series of two
annual programmatic Bank operations in support of the government’s reform program.
The DPL series is aligned with the budget cycle, which is the primary vehicle used by the
government for introducing new policy initiatives. There will be two DPLs in this series, one in
2012 and one in 2013. The DPL series takes a pragmatic approach to support the policy agenda
over a two year period in which realistic results can be defined and achieved. The approach is to
focus on those reforms that can be completed in the short-term while building the necessary
foundations for broader reform over the medium-term. The DPL series is the principal
instrument identified in the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for supporting the
government’s reform program.

7.    For each of the three pillars that will be supported by this operation, prior actions
have been identified that create the basic institutions to unlock reforms. The specific
measures that have been agreed as prior actions for the first DPL are presented in Annex 1.

IV.    Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects

Poverty and Social Impacts

8.     Mauritius has a low rate of poverty, whether measured in relative or absolute terms.
Relative poverty was 8.7 percent of population in 2006/07, equivalent to 106,000 people.
Approximately 1.0 percent of the population or 12,000 people live on less than US$1 per day.
Inequality in Mauritius, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is low at 0.388 compared with other
countries in Africa, reflecting the fact that Mauritius is a country with a well developed social
welfare system that favors equality.

9.      The proposed DPL series is expected to address poverty in the following three ways:
(i) social protection programs will be more effective in protecting the poor and helping them to
rise out of poverty; (ii) widening education access to include the most vulnerable will help them
to find higher-skilled, better paying jobs in the labor market; and (iii) streamlining NTBs will
help to create jobs as NTBs disproportionally affect SMEs (major drivers of employment
creation in Mauritius) that do not have the financial means to mitigate their cost.

Environment Aspects

10.     None of the reforms supported by the DPL series will have direct effects on the
environment, natural resources, and forestry. If supported, the reforms regarding SOEs and
parastatals will be focused on improving transparency and monitoring the management of public
companies with no direct relationship to investment in these areas. Historically, the record of
environmental management, though not perfect, has been relatively good. Furthermore, all

                                                                                               3
development partners recognize the strategic importance of environmental protection, and the
AFD, the UNDP, and the EC are actively providing technical support in this area.
