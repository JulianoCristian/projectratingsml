satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included:  in an environment where the\n            reform agenda was slowing down the team focused on areas\n            that had more consensus to move forward. The DPL focused on\n            achieving feasible reforms in the near term while laying the\n            necessary building blocks to accelerate reforms in the\n            medium term. Because public sector reforms would require\n            consensus between diverse stakeholders and would affect the\n            political equilibrium, the government continued to take a\n            strategically incremental approach.  The balanced approach\n            in the preparation of the operations between Social\n            Protections and Competitiveness translated in positive\n            results as provided the government with a set of reforms\n            that reinforced each other (i.e. impact of some trade\n            reforms might be partially compensated by reforms on the\n            social protection system). The loan was designed to include\n            a certain degree of flexibility to allow the government to\n            adapt the reform program as needed over time."}, "docdt": "2015-06-22T06:12:04Z"}
