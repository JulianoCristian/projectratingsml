                         to implement reforms within the following three pillars: (i) strengthening programs that support and empower the most vulnerable; (ii) streamlining trade regulation and
                         processes; and (iii) improving human resource management in the civil service and monitoring of SOE performance.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         This is an initial ISR for the Project. The Project became effective as of June 20, 2012 and the Government has indicated its intention to request disbursement of the project financing
                         in September 2012. A supervision mission to Mauritius is expected to be undertaken around that time, which will assess progress with implementation of the Program. Current
                         information is that implementation of the reforms in the Social Protection, Education, Civil Service, Trade and SOE sectors remain on track. The mission will present the opportunity
                         for a more in depth assessment of progress including an assessment of progress towards meeting the agreed program results indicators.
