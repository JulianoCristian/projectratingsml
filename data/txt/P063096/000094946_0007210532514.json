is expected that the Land Reform\n            Support Project will not raise major environmental issues,\n            but rather improve environmental conditions, as communities\n            move from congested areas, to better commercial farming\n            areas, and, because of the small-scale and design simplicity\n            of project community subprojects. Nonetheless, potential\n            environmental effects may result from infrastructure\n            subprojects, which may have negative impacts on soil\n            erosion, water quality, deforestation, and environmental\n            health. This environmental analysis include mitigating\n            measures as follows: 1) soil degradation resulting from\n            water-logging, increased soil salinity and acidity, or\n            erosion, will be minimized by regulating appropriate\n            irrigation schedules, and drainage systems, including\n            sub-surface drainage; adjusting crops to salinity tolerance,\n            and, incorporating irrigation water to reduce sodium\n            content, for disposal into unused land; 2) safe disposal of\n            lubricants, and precautions to contain oil spillage will\n            minimize ground, and water contamination, in addition to a\n            vector ecology assessment; 3) establishment of vegetative\n            cover on eroded surfaces, and of retention ponds to reduce\n            sediment load; and 4) forestry protection of unique\n            biological diversity, through increased number of species\n            planted, including rotation length to minimize\n            susceptibility, and, direct pest, or disease control will be provided."}, "docdt": "1999-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
