The termination of\n            the loan was due to amendments made to the Constitution and\n            the Land Acquisition Act in mid 2000, the Government's\n            land reform strategy moved away from land acquisition at\n            market value and the piloting of complementary,\n            community-driven models towards an approach entirely based\n            on compulsory acquisition at below-market value. The\n            Government lost the political will to go through with the\n            community-initiated pilots as the political situation in the\n            country changed drastically due to the emergence of a strong\n            opposition party. The Government argued that it was forced\n            to embark on a more radical approach because while the\n            political pressure to deliver mounted, the donors reneged on\n            the commitments made during the 1998 international donor\n            conference. The weak institutional arrangements, within the\n            Government, for implementing the program were also to blame\n            for the government's failure to meet many of the agreed actions."}, "docdt": "2004-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
