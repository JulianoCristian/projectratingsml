The project\n            directly benefits an estimated 1000 poor rural families from\n            congested communal areas through improved access to land and\n            direct participation in complementary community investment\n            subprojects. The project has four components. It establishes\n            a land acquisition fund for a community-initiated,\n            market-assisted approach. That is, self-identified\n            communities or community groups of poor households purchase\n            farms with resources from the fund. The second and third\n            components support infrastructure investments through\n            funding subprojects on a matching grant basis, a one-time\n            cash start-up grant, and technical assistance to establish\n            the land settlement and improve land productivity. The\n            fourth component provides technical assistance,\n            institutional support, project administration, and\n            monitoring and evaluation, and possibly includes\n            mobilization assistance for beneficiary communities and\n            rural district councils, specialized skills training,\n            publicity campaigns, and specialized studies."}, "docdt": "1999-07-16T00:00:00Z"}
