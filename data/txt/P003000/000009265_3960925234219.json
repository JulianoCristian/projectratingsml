The proposal to convert the existing school\n            into a regional institution was the outcome of a series of\n            meetings between officials of the West African Economic\n            Community Senegalese officials, and International\n            Development Association (IDA) staff. It was based on the\n            well recognized need to improve economic management in CEAO\n            countries; the perceived advantages of economies of scale\n            arising from the provision of management training through a\n            regional institution; the ability of this type of\n            institution to attract higher levels of donor cooperation;\n            and the increased potential such an institution would offer\n            for interaction among managers from different countries. The\n            principal functions of CESAG were to: (a) establish broad\n            based, graduate-level management programs; (b) organize\n            short upgrading programs in specific subjects for senior\n            managers; (c) serve as a resource center for other\n            management training institutions in the region by\n            establishing teacher training programs and providing\n            assistance in the development of training materials; (d)\n            serve as a research center for the development of management\n            systems adapted to the African environment; and (e) provide\n            consulting services to businesses in planning and\n            implementing management and organizational systems."}, "docdt": "1992-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
