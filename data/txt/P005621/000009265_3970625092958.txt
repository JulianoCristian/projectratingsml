PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA
SECOND HrGHWAY PROJECT - LOAN 1188-TUN
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report describes the preparation and
implementation of the Second Highway Project in Tunisia, for which Loan
1188-TUN of US$28.0 million was made in December 1975. The loan was closed on
September 30, 1983.
The present report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North
Africa Regional Office of the Bank on the basis of a review of the Bank files
and the Borrowers' progress and completion reports.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department, but the project was not audited by OED staff. The
draft Project Completion Report was sent to the Borrower for comments;
their comments are reproduced as Annex 3 to the report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA
SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT - LOAN 1188-TUN
HIGHLIGHTS
The objectives of the Second Highway Project were to reduce
transportation costs on a number of roads by improvement of primary and
secondary roads and construction of bypasses of towns totalling 225 km; to
assist in transportation planning by updating the 1968 transport survey; and
to foster rural development through preparation of a rural roads improvement
program (para. 1.04).
Overall, the project achieved well its objectives. 264 km of
highways were rehabilitated (instead of 225 km foreseen) at an average cost
which corresponded well with what estimated at appraisal. Traffic increase on
the project roads was substantially higher than foreseen. The project's
reevaluated IRR is above 33%. Substantial progress in institutional and
operational development was achieved (paras. 6.02-6.03 and 5.02-5.03).
The project was appraised in May 1975 on the basis of feasibility
studies and detailed engineering prepared under the First Highway Project.
The list of possible project components initially identified included
construction of the Tunis-Turki expressway, the Bizerte bridge, highway
modernization, a road maintenance program and consultancy services with a
total estimated cost of about US$137 million. The foreign cost component was
estimated at US$75 million. The Bank lending program allocation for the
project would cover only about a third of this amount. Two issues had to be
clarified: availability of other external financing for part of the foreign
cost and availability of counterpart funds (para. 2.02).
The Government resolved these issues by securing Kuwait Fund (KF)
financing of the expressway and Bizette bridge as a separat-e project and
providing adequate counterpart funds in the investment budget (para. 2.03).
However, the budgeted funds were not released in sufficient amounts
for payments to both the Bank and KF financed projects. The Government gave
priority to construction of the expressway and Bizerte bridge. After the
initial procurement of about 30% of the Second Highway Project civil works,
the start of the remaining works was delayed by three years. The project was
completed in early 1984 while at appraisal the completion was scheduled for
1979. The substantial delays have also contributed to the large undisbursed
loan balance, US$5.9 million. The causes of this balance are (i) US dollar
appreciation and (ii) miscellaneous reasons among which non-payment to
contractors. Both causes are strongly tied to the delays experienced
(paras. 5.04, 3.16 and 4.09).



- v -
The studies included in the project were completed, albeit with some
delays, and contributed to a better understanding of the need for
transportation planning and coordination. The rural roads program was
prepared according to schedule, leading to an early appraisal of the Third
Highway Project (paras. 3.13, 3.14 and 3.15).
Points of particular interest highlighted in the project completion
report are:
(i)    problems in project implementation due to shortage of counterpart
funds (para. 5.04);
(ii)    the importance of timely acquisition of right-of-way and updated
designs, coherent with actual urban development and plans for town
bypasses (para. 3.22); and
(iii)    the advantage of preparing follow-up projects under ongoing projects
(para. 2.01).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA: SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1188-TUN)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The highway network in Tunisia consists of 17,500 km of classified
roads, of which half have bituminous surfacing, and about 30,000 km of
unclassified tracks. Road density is high in the coastal area of the
northeast where more than half the population is concentrated. The railway
system includes 1,900 km of standard and meter gauge lines and carries both
freight and passengers. Roads carry about 90% of passenger traffic and 85% of
freight traffic excluding minerals. Road traffic growth during the 1970s has
been about 15% per year, against rail traffic growth of 6% for passengers and
1% for freight.
1.02     Most of the road network was constructed several decades ago to
accommodate low traffic hours of light vehicles. The standards for alignment,
width of pavement and pavement strength are inadequate for today's higher and
heavier traffic. Of the 9,000 km of paved roads, 60% have pavement of less
than 5 m width, only 7% are surfaced with asphaltic concrete while the
remainder are surface treated, 40% carry over 750 vehicles per day (vpd), and
19% of traffic is composed of heavy vehicles.
1.03     Little if any road improvement work was carried out prior to 1970.
The road system was evaluated in the 1968 Transport Survey carried out by
ITALCONSULT under a UNDP-financed project. The survey was followed by the
highway maintenance study (SCET-BCEOM) under the Highway Engineering Project,
S2-TUN, 19o9, which formed the basis for the First Highway Project, Loan
746-TUN, 1971. This project covered mainly rehabilitation of about 1000 km of
roads and 50 bridges, and was completed in 1978. It also included
preinvestnent studies for 350 km of road improvement and modernization which
were used for preparing the Second Highway Project. The rehabilitation and
maintenance program was resumed subsequently under the Fourth Highway Project,
Loan 1841-TUN, 1980.
1.04     The Second Highway Project included improvement of 225 km of prioriLy
sections identified in the First Project preinvestment studies, updating of
the 1968 transport survey and preparation of a pilot rural roads program. The
last item led to the Third Highway Project, Loan 1601-TUN, 1978, consisting of
improvement of about 1000 km of rural roads and the Fifth Highway Project,
Loan 2108-TUN, 1982, which continued the rural roads construction program. A
Sixth Highway Project for modernization of primary and secondary roads is now
under preparation. It should be noted also that the Second Urban Transport
Project of FY1984 includes construction of the Tunis East bypass.
1.05     The above sequence of projects fina.1cixg the development of the
highway network shows the continuity of the Bank's irterest in the Tunisian
transport sector. Loans were provided also for ..ilways, ports and
pipelines. Tthe First Railway Project, Loan 61.,jCredit 150-TUN, 1964, focussed
on track renewal and purchase of equipment ana was completed. Two port
projects, Loan 380-TUN, 1964 and 573-TUN, 1969, were also completed. A Third
Project, Loan 1797-TUN, is in progress. A gas pipeline project, Loan 724-TUN,
1971, is completed. Total Bank lending for the transportation sector through
FY 1984 is US$238.50 million.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preparation
2.01     The project was prepared through preinvestment studies carried out by
consultants BCEOM (France), SAUTI (Italy) and SETEC (France) under the First
Highway Project. In April 1974 the Tunisian Ministry of Planning and the Bank
agreed that the Second Highway Project would be included in the FY 1976
program. In September 1974 the project scope was broadly identified. The
tentative list of contents included improvement of primary and secondary
roads, deferred road maintenance, rural roads, the Tunis-Turki expressway of
32 km, the 250 m long Bizerte bridge, updating of the 1968 transport survey
and preinvestment studies.
Appraisal
2.02     The project was appraised in April 1975 on the basis of the tentative
list and the available feasibility and engineering studies. The preliminary
estimate of the cost of all identified items was about US$137 million with a
foreign exchange cost oE US$75 million. This raised concerns about
availability of counterpart funds to finance such a large program within the
normal project period of 3 to 4 years. The relative priorities had to be
determined and financing of the foreign cost component secured.
2.03     The discussions on the project contents and complementary studies
took several months. In the meantime the Government secured financing from
the Kuwait Fund for the Tunis-Turki expressway and the Bizerte bridge under a
separate project which was appraised in 1975. The deferred road Ziintenance
was to be financed fully by budgetary allocations. The rural roads program
was limited to a study for preparation of a pilot project for future Bank
financing (Third Highway Project, para 1.04).
2.04     The components of the Second Highway Project were finally agreed in
August 1975 with a cost estimate of US$52 million and foreign cost of US$28
million. In 1976 the Government allocated in the development budget an amount
of DT 40 million (equivalent to about US$100 million) with the following
distribution:
Tunis-Turki expressway                        DT 13.0 million
Bizerte bridge                                DT  8.5 million
Modernization of 225 km of roads              DT 18.0 million
Consulting services                           DT  0.5 million
2.04     The agreed project components were:

B.   Consulting Services
(i)    Updating of 1968 transport survey;
(ii)    Preparation of a pilot rural roads improvement project.
2.05     The project roads' design standards provided for a design speed of
100 km/h, 7 m wide carriageway and 3 m shoulders, maximum single axle weight
of 13 ton and asphaltic concrete surfacing.
2.06     The project cost estimate and loan allocation were as follow:

Contingencies included 102 for quantities and 38? for price
escalation. Price escalation was estimated on the basis of the construction
time schedule (expected completion in 1979) and the prevailing inflation
trends.
2.07     Negotiations took plaLxe in Washington from October 28 through October
31, 1975. The Government agreed to prepare by April 30, 1976, new regulations
on taxation of road users and to put these regulations into effect by December
31, 1976. The Government agreed also to implement by December 31, 1978,
equitable compensation of Public Transport Companies Lor losses due to reduced
tariffs applicable to social services provided at the Government request.
These Loan Agreement covenants were to implement the recommend-tions of
studies carried out under the First Highway Project.
2.08     The loan of US$28 million with an interest rate of 8 1/2Z and
maturity of 24 years including 4 years grace was approved by the Bank's Board
of Executive Directors on December 18, 1975, signed on January 26, 1976 and
declared effective on June 16, 1976. The agreed closing date was December 31,
1979. The executive agency for civil works and the rural roads study was the



-4-
Direction des Ponts et Chauss6es (DPC) of the Ministry of Public Works (MPW),
while executing agency for the transportation study was the Ministry of
Transport and Communications (MTC).
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01     The loan became effective on June 16, 1976, about seven weeks after
the initial April 26, 1976 deadline in the loan documents. This deadline had
been prorogated twice, due to the delay of the ratification of the Loan
Agreement by the Tunisian Parliament.
3.02     The project started slowly.  In 1976, DPC began the prequalification
procedure for contractors, but none of the five scheduled road construction
works was launched that year. The first road to be started was the
Tunis-Bizerte section, in 1977, roughly on schedule, and the second road was
the Hammamet-Korba section, in 1978, two years after the scheduled date. The
two studies also began late, but were completed before the end of 1979. All
the other items were launched only after the closing date agreed upon in the
loan documents.
3.03     Most of the engineering studies for the project roads were completed
by late 1975, at the time of the negotiations. The start-up problems
encountered art therefore attributable to the lack of fui.,s accorded to MPJI by
the Ministry of Finance. As is shown below (paras. 3.18 and 4.08) this
initial delay *ias the main cause of the discrepancy between the appraisal
disbursement schedule and the actual one. The problem of the non-availability
of local funds for agreed upon components was repeatedly discussed between the
Bank and the Ministry of Finance, but the funds were not made available as
foreseen.
B.  Revisioi.. in Civii Works
3.04     During implementation certain revisions were made to the civil
works. They can be divided into three categories: modifications brought to
some operations, deletion of one item foreseen in the project, and addition of
new works.
Modifications Brought to some Operations
3.05     There were changes brought tc four operations: the Sousse bypass, the
El Djem bypass, the GP5 road from Mornaghia to Medjez-el-Bab, and the
Hammamet-Korba road. As regards the Sousse bypass, works could not respect
the alignment proposed in 1975, since at the time foreseen for construction in
1980, this alignment had become a major city street through a built-up area.
Therefore the DPC proposed, and the Bank concurred, to undertake construction
of the alignment farther away from the city center; in fact, this new bypass



surrounds the cities of Sousse and Hammam-Sousse, between GP1 road at North
and MC82 road at South. It is 14 km long and comprises 4 large bridges and
viaducts. The sections to be improved on GP1 have been reduced consequently,
from 26.9 km to 18.3 km.
3.06     In El Djem, the alignment was too close to archaeological sites and
to protect them the bypass has been redesigned farther, thus increasing its
length from 3.2 km to 4.7 km.
3.07     The GP5 section, planned as a two lane 6 m wide road, was widened to
7m, so it could be consistent with the Tunisian design standards established
for primary roads and also correspond better to the expected increasing
traffic; along with this change drainage has been improved on the existing
alignment as well as on the new section of Sidi-Mediene.
3.08     The Haumamet bypass was one element of a series of improvements
planned for the MC28/MC27 road from Hammamet to Korba. It proved impossible
to complete right-of-way acquisition before the new loan closing date: funds
were allocated only in 1981, and some opposition still remained in 1982/83 for
the availability of land. Although that operation was reviewed thoroughly by
the DPC and the Bank missions, it could not be financed under this project.
All the other elements of this item were completed.
Deletion of Item from the Project
3.09     Regarding the Sfax bypass, preliminary enquiries had shown that
right-of-way acquisition might cost about 6DT per mz in 1979, about six
times the value estimated in 1975. The DPC regarded such prices as
excessive. As in Sousse, the close in alignment had beccme a major urban
arterial. The DPC therefore contemplated a future bypass on an alignment
farther from the city center, and proposed the abandonment of the Sfax bypass
under this project. The Bank concurred.
Addition of New Operations
3.10     In September 1981, the Tunisian Government made the two following
proposals to add new operations to the project, in substitution for those that
were deleted: (i) rehabilitation and widening of a key section of the GPI
between Sousse and El Djem (44 kIn); and (ii) construction and rehabilitation
of four bridges as part of the on-going improvements to the GP6 road between
Beja and Jendouba. The proposed improvements were within the general
description of the project to support the Government's program in "reducing
transportation costs on a number of more heavily trafficked routes by
constructing bypasses and upgrading the present facilities to modern two-lanes
highways, thus providing reliable connections between major cities in the
regions concerned."
3.11     Rehabilitation of the GPI section had received high priority and
bidding documents had been prepared as part of the first-year program under
the Fourth Highway Project.
3.12     The four bridges on the GP6 road were studied in 1973 as part of the



feasibility studies conducted during preparatiun of the Second Highway
Project, and at that time the economic viability of constructiotn and
rehabilitation work was found to be marginal. However, with the increase in
traffic and considering the poor physical condition of the existing bridges,
improvements proved to be feasible 8 years later.
C.  Revisions  n       Consulting S_ervices
3.13     The rural roads study began later than foreseen, June 1977 instead of
March 19, 1976, due to delays in finalizing the terms of reference and in the
bidding procedures. But once started, it was carried out normally and quickly
by SECTEC-SOTUETEC, a French-Tunisian company.
3.14     There were some problems with the implementation of the review of the
transport survey. The study was awarded ir. July 1978 instead of August 1976
as foreseen and it got off to a slow start becausc of lergthy procedures
within the Ministry of Transport and Communication. Consultants Louis Berger
International submitted their draft report in May 1979. The Government and
Bank felt it needed revision and expansion, and the consultants were asked to:
(i) develop an investment program for the period up to 1986 for each mode, and
(ii) make clear and specific recommendations on transport system improvements
(road user charges, tariff levels, organization and operation of transport
companies). The final report submitted in December 1979 did not really, for
lack of sufficient data, develop all these points, especially the investment
program. Another reason for the reduced scope of this study was that because
of working conditions and reorganization, the MTC has not been able to retain
or recruit a sufficient number of staff to be assigned to the study. As a
result, the objective of initiating the "updating of the transport survey on a
continuing basis" could not be reached under this project.
3.15     As several transport studies had been completed in 1979 (in
particular the SEMA Master Plan for Land Transport), and as the Government was
beginning preparation of the Sixth Development Plan (1982-86), it requested
Bank assistance in revi-wing studies and in drawing up an investment program.
The Bank concurred and agreed in early 1980 on the appointment of consultants
SETEC-ECONOMIE for a Transport Sector Review Study, aiming at the following:
(i) comparison of basic data and assumptions used in the Louis Berger and SEMA
studies; (ii) recommendations drawn from both studies covering regulatory,
fiscal and tariff matters, as well as transport investment guidelines; and
(iii) procedures to be used in preparing the investment program for the Sixth
Plan. This was to be based largely on a review of investments in the
transport subsectors, being prepared by the relevant modal agencies
themselves. This study was carried out quickly between March and August 1980,
and although the invrestmexnt program still suffered from lack of relevant data,
the study proved to be a good basis for the work program of the Transport
Planning Unit that MTC has now set up under the Fourth Highway Project.

D.  Implementation Schedule
3.16     A detailed implementation schedule was met out in the appraisal
report. On the whole, implementation was expected to take place over four
years, 1975/79. This program implied that the availability of local fuids and
the acquisition of necessary rights-of-way should raisc no problem.
3.17     Table 1 and Annex 1, which give the actual and expected project
implementation data, show that:
(i)    the overall implementation period lasted 8 years, from mid-1976 to
mid-1984;
(ii)    only two sections of civJl works (Hamniamet-Korba and Tunis-Bizerte)
were implemented during thie period set forth in the loan agreement,
and only one section (Tunis-Bizerte) was completed before the initial
closing date (12/31/79); and
(iii)    the two main studies were completcLd witllin the initial period.
In fact, two different periods can be disLinguished in the actual
project implementation. In the first period, which covers the first four
years, implementation of major parts of the project was suspended because of
financial constraints. In December 1979, after the Bank having voiced its
concern at several occasions, the Ministry of Planning gave a financial
planning comnitnient which would permit construction to begin on the remaining
six items. The second period covers the period from this date till the end of
the project.
3.18     Works on GP8 were the first to be undertaken, in early i977.  Two
sub-lots were completed nearly on time: sub-lot 9A (km 14 - Km 25) and sub-lot
10 (km 0 - km 14). The third sub-lot 9B (km 25 - km 57.7) was completed in
December 1980 with a 16 month delay, due essentially to scarcity of local
funds which did not allow to keep a good pace. The second item was road
MC27/MC28 (lot 6) which began only in April 1978 and encountered two kinds of
problems: scarcity of funds, and bypasses alignment (finally the Hammamet
bypass was not included in this contract). The works ended in October 1981
with a delay of 11 months.
3.19     For the first extension of the loan closing date (December 31, 1979
to December 31, 1982), two conditions were agreed upon, viz. the establishment
of a satisfactory financing and physical execution program, agreed upon in
December 1979, and a new official schedule, as shown in Annex 1, which foresaw
the completion date for December 31, 1982. Although some additional delays
still occurred (see below), the revised implementation schedule and financial
plan agreed were substantially followed. The new problems encountered were:
(i)    the contractor on lot 5 (GP5) went bankrupt 17 months after the
beginning of works, and the contract was cancelled in August 1982.
Three subsequent sub-lots were awarded in the beginning of 1983, for



the bridges on the new section (sub-lot 5A), the pavement on the
existing section (sub-lot 5B), and the pavement on the now section
(sub-lot 5C);
(ii)    works on lot 7A (exLsting section of Sousso bypass) and lot 11 (GP6)
had to be partly redesigned, since the engineering studies, carried
out in 1975, were obsolete in some points, poorer conditions than
envisaged entailed an additional length to be improved, and alignment
and drainage to be modified and improved;
(iii)    the SEax and El Djem items were to be undertaken together under lot
B. When the right-of-way issues in Sfax provoked the deletion of
this item, the El Djem bypass was launched in September 1981 under
lot 8A.
3.20     The schedule for the two new items included in late 1981, expected to
be completed before the December 31, 1982 closing date, proved to be too
optimistic:
(i)    the rehabilitation and widening of GPI between the Sousse and El Djem
bypasses, both of which were being constructed under the project,
took place between September 1981 and February 1983;
(ii)    all the four bridges on GP6 took longer than the six-month
construction period allowed. One of the contractors was diverted
from the works for an emergency repair to a bridge on another route
where a pier had been washed out, and additionally encountered a
serious problem with the piles for one of the GP6 bridges due to
insufficient subsurface investigation. This required relocating the
new bridge, and finally overall works ended only in February 1984.
3.21     At the end of 1982, the project was prorogated a second time, for
nine months to September 30, 1983. As demonstrated above, this extension was
still insufficient due to optimistic assumptions. Although all works were
committed by that date, the main works were only all completed in early 1984,
and some outstanding minor works will be completed in June 1984. In view of
the lengthy extensions already accumulated a further closing date extension
beyond September 30, 1983 was not considered. However, the Bank agreed to
continue honor disbursement requests received up to March 31, 1984 related to
commitments made prior to the closing date.
3.22     In summary, the project suffered a time overrun of 100 percent, since
the overall implementation needed eight years instead of four. The main
reason is that counterpart funds to carry out the project were not made
available at the rate agreed at negotiations. We have assumed that this cause
may explain an overall delay of two years (the implementation chart in Annex 1
shows that this is a realistic assumption). The remaining delay of two years
is explained by two other causes: difficulties in right-of-way acquisition and
alignment problems of bypasses:
- The First Highway Project (Loan 746-TUN) had already encountered
right-of-way problems, and had shown that the original time



- 9 -
schedule should have allowed about one supplemental year for
making available the necessary rights-of-way. This had not been
taken into account in the Second Highway Project, since the
appraisal schedule did not mention this point explicitly (see
para. 3.17 above). The consequences of these difficulties are
not only lengthening the time schedule, but also increasing
project cost. Inflation and land speculation caused right-of-way
costs on some sections to greatly exceed estimates, and since
additional local funds were not available to cover these extra
costs, they entailed major implementation difficulties.
- Several alignment corridors were studied for the main city
bypasses. The DPC had a policy whereby the initial alignment of
the national highway .(GP) route through the city center would be
replaced by a circumferential bypass of small radius. This
bypass would in its turn then be abandoned in favour of a larger
radius beltway. This was considered by DPC to be a contribution
towards structuring the cities, which were always short of funds
for major thoroughfare construction. The DPC therefore opted for
rather close in locations for the bypasses, which were in effect
urban arterials, with dual roadways. At the time of
construction, however, these close in alignments had become major
city streets through built-up areas, and construction had to be
undertaken on alignments farther from the city center. To
alleviate such issues in future projects with main cities
bypasses components, their design should take into account the
time between design and implementation and ideally be based on an
up-to-date urban master plan.
Reporting
3.23     The tirst progress report was related to the period July-September
1977 and was sent in February 1978. There were thirteen reports in total, and
the last was received in August 1982, covering the period January-June 1982.
Although some delays occurred, on the whole the reporting was good as long as
it lasted.
Procurement
3.24     Government procedures for bidding and contract award were good and no
difficulty was experienced regarding application of the Bank's I.C.B
guidelines, except on two points. The first one was raised when the DPC, in
connection with the new lot launched in late 1981 for the construction of four
bridges on GP6, used limited local competitive bidding for the separate
fabrication of steel pile casings for the bridge foundations. In view of the
modest amount of the contract and the urgency of passing the contract to meet
the construction schedule of the main contractors, the Bank considered the
procedure reasonable and approved the contract, as an exception,
3.25     The second procurement issue is related to the application of price
variation formula. The Tunisian Government admitted price escalation only on
the dinar payable part of the contract, and the foreign currency labeled part



- 10 -
had to stay fixed. The Bank, though aware of the possible distortions of such
procurement conditions, agreed to permit ongoing projects to continue to use
the existing clauses. A firmer position of the Bank was expected to have led
to substantial delays of the project and was therefore not adopted. A
satisfactory settlement of this issue has not yet been achieved.
3.26     Of the 14 lots for road improvement, 10 were won by Tunisian
contractors, 2 by Italian, 1 by French, and 1 by a French-Tunisian joint
venture. Both lots for major bridge construction were awarded to foreign
contractors (I German and 1 French).
3.27     The consulting services were procured following invitations to a
short list of 10 firms of Tunisian, Italian, French, American and German
nationality. The selected firms were French-Tunisian and American.
Performance of Participants
Consultants
3.28     The preinvestment studies for rural roads were satisfactorily
completed by the joint venture SETEC-SOTUETEC. However, some problems arose
with LBI's (Louis Berger International) study on transport coordination, due
to differing interpretations of the terms of reference. A follow-up study,
aimed at reviewing recent transport surveys and drawing up an investment
program for the transport sector was entrusted by the Government, with Bank's
concurrence, to consultants SETEC-ECONOMIE which successfully completed it.
Contractors
3.29     There were few major problems with contractors on the project, except
for two: (i) EFFERT, in charge of works on GP5 road, went bankrupt in August
1981, thus contributing to the second extension of the loan closing date, and
ii) IMPRESA PESSINA, whose quality of works on some sections of GP8 road was
considered insufficient by DPC.
Government
3.30     Tunisian Highway Department staff carried out construction
supervision throughout the project. Their performance was satisfactory. Had
the necessary funds been made available in a timely fashion to this technical
department, it could have carried out the project at a rate nearer the one
agreed at negotiations.
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01     Details of actual costs, contract amounts and appraisal estimates are
shown in Table 2. The dollar equivalency has been calculated using an
exchange rate of US$1 = DT 0.385 for the appraisal estimate of costs (currency



- 11 -
value as for April 1975), and US$1 * DT 0.555 Eor the actual costs (based on
the actual expenditures and their repay dollar equivalency). In fact the last
figure r*isks a broad spectrum of exchange rate, from 0.400 for the first
withdrawal in August 1978, to 0.740 for the last one in May 1984.
4.02     The actual costs of civil works were 25.4 million dinars.  The base
estimate at appraisal for equivalent road sections (allowing for subsequent
changes, i.e., the cancellation of Sfax and Hammamet bypasses) was 17 million
dinars, thus leading to an overrun of 492.  Of this, about 162 was due to
changes in quantities on initial list of works, and 332 came from additional
works on GPl and GP6.
4.03     For the initial list of works, the actual costs as proportion of
total contract amount is 1.42. This increase is due to physical contingencies
by 112 and price escalation by 31X.  This compares well with the appraisal
assumptions, which were 102 for physical contingencies and 38Z for price
escalation. The major variations concerned three items:
. GP6 : quantities 33X, price 50%
* GP5 : quantities 45S, price 252
* PC   : quantities 23%, price 232
4.04     The total estimate for consulting services at appraisal was 0,650
million dinars, while the actual cost was 0,590 million dinars, thus showing a
decrease of 9%. The main reason is the overestimation of the review of the
transport survey, 254,000 dinars at appraisal, while the LBI study and the
complementary SETEC review amounted to 200,000 dinars actually. The scope of
the rural roads study was unchanged.
4.05     The strong appr'ciation of the US dollar (by an average b4Z over the
project period) led to a general decrease of the actual dollar costs in
comparison to the appraisal estimates in that currency. Thus, although change
in overall scope of project provoked an overrun of 30% in terms of dinar, this
resulted in an underrun of 11X when expressed in dollar.
Disbursements
4.06     The actual and forecast disbursements are shown in the key project
data table and in the graph of Annex 2. This graph shows also what would have
been the actual disbursements in case of a constant exchange rate equal to the
appraisal rate. In total, 21 applications were submitted over 96 months, an
average of 4.5 months between applications. The loan was closed on September
30, 1983.
4.07     The total project costs were US$46.8 million, of which the Bank
financing of US$22.13 million represented 47.3?, compared with the 53.5?
estimated at appraisal. The uncommitted part of the loan, cancelled in June
1984 (effective May 28, 1984 the date of the last disbursement payment),
amounted to US$ 5,872,508.97. Assuming a constant exchange rate, the loan
amount (US$ 28 million) would have been insufficient to cover the total
consequent disbursements (US$ 32.27 million).



- 12 -
4.08     The rate of disbursement forcRecn at appraisal was about US$ 7
million per year. As can be seen from Annex 2, a delay of about two years was
established from the beginning of thc projcet. If one neutralizes these two
years (the causes of which are explained in para. 3.23) then one can observe
that on the remaining period of six years:
-    the actual rate of disbursement Is 3.7 millions per year, about
half of the appraisal rate, integrating both delay in
construction schedule and exchangc rate variation;
-    the currency constant value disbursement rate is 5.4 millT ion per
year, about 75S of the appraisal rate. This reduction
represents the actual delay due to a slower construction
schedulc.
4.09     The unused amount of the loan, US$5,9 million, can be split into two
main parts related to (i) works committed but for which no withdrawal has been
made (ii) appreciation of the US dollar.
-    The first part can be estimated to US$2.9 million (difference between
the actual foreign cost of the project, US$25 million, and the total
amount disbursed, US$22.1 million). This situation is due to (i)
lagging payment to contractors by the borrower; (ii) slow processing
of disbursement requests, resulting in the fact that by the loan
closing date, a lot of commitments eligible for financing under the
loan could not be reimbursed for lack of formal application with the
required documentation. In this respect a more intensive use of
disbursement procedure No. 3, allowing direct payments to suppliers
or contractors, proved to be efficient. It was only in mid-1983 that
this procedure was used for the project and the positive effect of
the acceleration of the disbursements appears clearly in Annex 2;
about one-third of of the total amount disbursed was made following
this procedure.
-    The second part amounts to US$3 million (balance to reach the amount
of the loan, US$28 million). This part is due to the strong dollar
appreciation.
V. INSTITUTIONAL AND OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
5.01     The 1968 Transport Survey identified an absence of effective
administrative structure for intermodal coordination in the transport sector
and an excessive degree of regulation. Following the study recommendations
the Ministry of Transport and Communication (MTC), was created in 1974 and was
subsequently strengthened under the Fourth Highway Project by the
establishment of a Transport Planning Unit. The Second Project Loan Agreement
included covenants requiring review of road user charges and regulations and
improvement of the financial basis of public transport companies through
compensation for subsidized services. While the agreed target dates were not
observed, the MTC did pursue the implementation of the covenants throughout



- 13 -
the project period. The new road user charges regulation was drafted and the
status of transport companies reviewed. The parliament rejected in 1982 the
proposed regulations but work on revised regulations is presently ongoing.
There was also substantial development in the national and regional public
transportation companies, which were allowed to merge and operate nationwide
on a competitive basis. The volume of services which did not cover their
costs was reduced and a limited compensation for the related loss was
provided. Most of the non-competitive preferential tariffs were withdrawn.
5.02     Substantial progress in institutional and operational development was
achieved through updating of the Transport Survey, the separate Land Transport
Coordination Study carried out for MTC by the consultant SEM and the
synthesis of both studies by SETEC. The MTC staff seconded to this work,
although insufficient in number, got on-the-job training, while the review of
reports and discussions with the consultants and Bank staff clarified the
issues related to modal distribution of transport, tariffs, regulations and
investment programs. Implementation of these studies revealed the weakness of
the MTC structure and staffing and eventually led to the establishing of a
Transport Planning ULil Lnder the Fourth Highway Project.
5.03     The present organization of DPC and divisional and subdivisional road
maintenance units was established in 1972/73 following recomendations of the
BCEOM-SCET road maintenance study under the Highway Engineering Project (para.
1.03). The project impact on the DPC development was mainly in the increased
capacity for preparation, procurement, administration and supervision of
highway construction projects, and, through the rural roads program
preparation, in better cooperation with other government agencies.
Cooperation be,ween DPC and the Ministry of Agriculture was excellent
throughout preparation of the rural roads program and subsequent
implementation.
5.04     Construction of the project roads was considerably delayed because of
the shortage of funds. After issuing the first three contracts in 1977 and
1978 the DPC was instructed by the Ministry of Planning to suspend the
procurement of remaining works, because there was a shortage of funds and
priority was given to the Tunis-Turki expressway and Bizerte bridge. The
remaining contracts were let only in mid-1980. The construction of bypasses
was additionally delayed by problems with acquisition of the right-of-way.
Sufficient funds were not available and with the passing of time inflation and
land speculation increased the cost of expropriation beyond acceptable limits,
leading to relocation of bypasses and abandoning of some schemes, like the
Sfax bypass. The DPC management performance was generally good. The
frustration of the DPC staff caused by the lack of funds and the ensuing
delays of construction is expressed in their final report on the project.
VI. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
6.01     The SAR reported the project to be a highly feasible one with



- 14 -
IRR's for the road sections included ranging from 25% to 35X. The aggregate
IRR for all the sections was 33%. A decrease of the benefits by 25X or an
increase of the construction costs by the same percentage would still leave a
healthy IRR of 27%. Since many of the elements needed for a detailed
reconstruction of the economic evaluation are lacking, either from the
appraisal phase or concerning the present situation, the economic reevaluation
assesses the development of the key parameters which allows conclusions to be
drawn about the project and its components. These key parameters are
construction costs, traffic, and vehicle operating costs.
6.02     The table below compares the appraisal estimate and the actual
construction costs, expressed in constant 1975 DT.
Economic Construction Costs in

GP8 Tunis-Bizerte                      1796.0            3303          1.84
GP6 Beja-Jendouba                      1098.0            1382          1.26
Total                             8861.7            9999           1.13
Considering changes in construction costs only, the project as a whole and
all of its components except one remain clearly viable. The 84% cost overrun
for the GP8 makes its viability questionable, if all other factors remain
unchanged.
6.03     Table 3 shows that actual 1982 traffic substantially surpassed the
forecasts by factors ranging from 1.08 to 2.36. The growth rates have been
high, between 9 and 18% p.a. during the 1973-82 period. Since project
benefits are approximately proportional to traffic volumes, the higher than
foreseen traffic growth enhances the viability of the project. With respect
to GP8, which had a cost overrun of 842, it is noted that actual traffic was
136Z higher than forecast. Since the SAR shows that an increase in benefits
more than compensates for a corresponding percentage increase in construction
costs, it is highly likely that for GP8 the 1362 higher than expected traffic,
coupled with the 84% construction cost increase, yields an IRR higher than the
35% reported in the SAR.
6.04     With respect to vehicle operating costs (Table 4), no firm
conclusions can be drawn as to the2 development. In the present context it
has therefore been assumed that there is no significant impact on the rates of
return from the possible changes of the vehicle operating costs.



- 15 -
6.05     It can thus be concluded that although some of the project components
suffered cost overruns, these were more than compensated for by a traffic
growth which was substantially higher than foreseen at appraisal. This
conclusion is valid both for the individual project components as well as for
the project as a whole. The project has thus been a highly justified one.
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01     The Bank's involvement in development of the Tunisian highways
commenced with the UNDP Transport Survey project of 1967 for which the Bank
acted as the executing agency. Since that time five highway projects have
been approved, each prepared under the preceding one, the first including only
preparatory studies, two for rural roads development and three for primary and
secondary roads maintenance, rehabilitation and improvement. Consulting
services for studies and training has helped institutional development.
7.02     The Bank's strong representations in the matter of local funds for
the project's civil works helped to obtain in December 1979 the Government's
firm comitment for financing which allowed substantial completion of the
project within the next three years. Whether the Bank could have exerted more
influence in securing the availability of local funds is uncertain since the
whole issue was intimately tied to political and macroeconomic considerations.
7.03     The Bank participation in preparation, supervision, review and
discussion of the transport survey and transport coordination study helped to
clarify many issues related to methodology of data collection, tariffs, and
regulations and investment programming as well as a heightened interest from
Government agencies for transport planning.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01     Overall, the project achieved well its objectives.  264 km of
highways were rehabilitated (instead of 225 km foreseen) at an average cost
which corresponded well with what estimated at appraisal. Traffic increase on
the project roads was substantially higher than foreseen. The project's
reevaluated IRR is above 33X. Substantial progress in institutional and
operational development was achieved.
8.02     Two problems disturbed the project implementation: shortage of
counterpart funds which delayed project completion by four years, and
non-availability of the right-of-way, which resulted in delays, major changes
in design, extra costs and deletion of some project components. The shortage
of counterpart funds could have been alleviated by better timing of the
project and direct payment to contractors of the loan proceeds, while the
right-of-way problems might have been more manageable, had there been better
coordination between road and urban planning.



- 16 -
8.03     Transport planning capacity of the borrower was improved through the
project studies, on-the-job training, and eventually the establishment of a
separate transportation planning unit in MTC. The rural roads improvement
study had extended the Bank involvement in road transport to the rural
development sector.
8.04     The principal lessons learned through this project are:
(i)    the timing of the project should concord with availability of
counterpart funids; and
(ii)    to alleviate local financing constraints the projects should include
either direct payment of loan proceeds to suppliers and contractors,
or a special account (revolving fund) facility agreed upon;
(iii)    the importance of timely acquisition of right-of-way and updated
designs, coherent with actual urban development and plans for town
bypasses.

Note:   Since the assumptions and methodology underlying the 1975 values are not
available, no meaningful compar-ison of the figures can be made. It can be
suspected however that much of :he differences can be explained by
differing assumptions regarding definition of vehicle types, utilization,
etc.
