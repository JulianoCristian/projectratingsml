APPRAISAL. OF
A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
TUNISIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of Tunisia has asked the Bank to help finance the
improvement of about 225 km of primary and secondary highways in the northern
and central regions of the country, and consulting services.
ii.       The highway improvements consist of bypasses of the towns of Sousse,
El-Djem and Sfax on the primary route GP1 (total 44.5 km), and the improvement
of about 180 km of two-lane roads on the primary routes GP5 (Mornaghia-Medjez-
el-Bab), GP6 (Beja-Jendouba), GP8 (Tunis-Bizerte) and MC 27/28 (Hammamet-
Korba) including the construction of bypasses of the towns of Hammamet,
Nabeul and Beni Khiar. The constilting services comprise assistance to update
the 1968 Transport Survey and to prepare a rural roads program.
iii.      The proposed loan amount would be US$28.0 million or 54% of the
total project cost of US$52.3 million and would cover entirely the foreign
exchange component.
iv.       The Direction des Ponts et Chaussees in the Ministry of Public
Works will be responsible for the execution of the construction works and
preparation of the rural roads program while the Ministry of Transport
and Communications will be responsible for the updating of the 1968 Trans-
port Survey.  Construction contracts on the basis of unit prices will be
awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement.
v.        The project was appraised in March/April 1975.  The beneficiaries
of the project are primarily farmers and manufacturers, consumers and road
transport passengers.
vi.       The project is economically sound and of high priority.  On the
basis of savings in highway user costs, the improvement works are expected
to yield an overall economic return in excess of 33%. Sensitivity analyses
testing the overall economic return gave returns of approximately 28% and
27% assuming a 25% cost overrun and 25% reduction of benefits, respectively.
vii.      Based on expected economic lives of the roads or road sections to be
improved, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$28.0 million for a
term of 24 vears, including a four-year grace period.






APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
TUNISIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Tunisia has asked the Bank to help finance the
improvement of about 225 km of highways in the northern and central regions.
Feasibility studies and detailed engineering for the improvements were fi-
nanced under the First Highway Project carried out by the joint ventures of
foreign and local consultants Bureau Central d'Etudes pour les Equipements
d'Outre-Mer (BCEOM, France)/Societe Tuniîienne d'Ingenierie (STUDI), Renardet
SAUTI (Italy) /Societe Generale d'Etudes et d'Engineering (SGEE), and Societe
d'Etudes Techniques et Economiques (SETEC, France)/Societe Tunisienne d'
Etudes Techniques et Economiques (SOTUETEC). The project further includes
the updating by consultants of a transport survey carried out by consultants
(Italconsult) in 1967-68 (the 1968 Transport Survey), financed by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with the Bank as executing agency, and
technical assistance for the preparation of a rural roads program.
1.02      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$52.3 million equi-
valent with a foreign exchange component of about US$28.0 million or 54%.
The loan of US$28.0 million will cover these foreign exchange costs.
1.03      This report is based on the economic and engineering studies car-
ried out by the above consultants, on information provided by the Government
and on the findings of an appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. G. Ludwig
(Engineer) and H. Beenhakker (Economist) which visited the country in March/
April 1975.
II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Effects of Geography and Economic Growth on Transport
2.01      Tunisia, with an area of 164,000 km2 or about one-quarter that of
France, is bordered by the Mediterranean to the north and east, Algeria to
the west, and Libya to the southeast. Its estimated population of 5.7 mil-
lion is increasing at about 2.4% per annum. Forty-five percent of the popula-
tion lives in the four northeastern coastal provinces of Tunis, Sousse, Sfax
and Bizerte, where population density approaches 100 per km2, as opposed to
fewer than 20 inhabitants per km2 in the southwestern interior. The south is
characterized by large areas of infertile desert.



- 2 -
2.02      Between 1962, the beginning of the first decade of planned develop-
ment, and 1974 per capita Gross National Product (GNP) in constant (1966)
prices increased by 4% annually. From 1964-74 the share of industry, including
mining, petroleum, manufacturing, construction and tourîom increased from 23
to 35% of GDP while that of agriculture remained around 21% and that of serv-
ices correspondingly declined. The principal sources of foreign exchange are
crude oil, phosphates, tourisL: and olive oil.
2.03      Since the "Ten-Year Perspectives" (1962-71) vas published, important
changes in investment policies have been introduced. Untîl the end of that
period, the Government committed itself in agriculture to the cooperative
system as a vehicle for the reform and education of the farmier, and to heavy
public outlays - in irrigation, land conservation and afforestation - vith
little effect on production, at least in the short run. Wit:h the exception
of tourism and petroleum exploration, there was little development of the
private sector while foreign investment was limited. Since 1970, a different
strategy has been initiated, with priority going to directly productive in-
vestments, the development of labor-intensive export industries, and full
utilization of existing capacity; the private sector is assiLgned an essential
role, and foreign investors are encouraged to provide finance, expertise and
access to export markets.  In addition, the Government is aware that an effi-
cient road system is required to promote agricultural and inidustrial develop-
ment and tourism. Largely as a result of the new strategy, the real growth
rate of GDP from 1971 through 1973 has averaged 9.4% per annum, compared with
4.6% during the previous decade. However, this improvement is partly due to
good weather leading to record cereal and olive crops and increased petroleum
and phosphate revenues. The real GDP growth rate for 1974 :ls estimated at
over 10.5%.
B.  The Transport System
2.04      On becoming independent in 1956, Tunisia inherited a relatively well
developed transport system. As a result major improvements were undertaken
only after 1968 and in the light of the 1968 Transport Survey.
2.05      The transportation system comprises 16,850 km of roads (para. 3.0');
about 2,000 km of standard and narrow gauge railways; four major commercial
ports, and five airports, of which three handle international flights.
2.06      The increase in total rail freight traffic from 96S2 million ton km
in 1961 to an estimated 1,522 million ton km in 1974 is primarily due to the
increased transport of phosphates and iron ore (Table 1). Between 1967-74
railroads lost a significant portion of their role in internlal transport to
the roads. While railroads accounted for 46% of freight traffic other than
phosphates and iron ore and 30% of total passenger traffic in 1967, they now
account for 36% and 22%, respectively. Total cargo handled by the afc'emen-
tioned four ports increased from 5,358,000 metric tons in 11961 to 8,871,000
metric tons in 1972 or an average annual growth rate of 4.7% (Table 2). Total



-3
air passenger traffic increased from 188,300 passengers in 1961 to 1,752,600
passengers in 1973, or an average annual growth rate of 20% (Table 3).
2.07      In 1969 the Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Tunisiens (SNCFT),
the Government agency which owns and operates the railways, started a re-
habilitation program which is still under way, and which the Bank is helping
to finance. A Port Master Plan Study financed under the Bank's Second Ports
Project is nearing completion. The Government is aware of the need for ier
provements of domestic airports and is actively seeking sources of finance to
meet it.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
2.08      The 1968 Transport Survey revealed two defects in Tunisian trans-
port policy: namely, (a) the absence of effective administrative machinery
for intermodal coordination in the transport sector, and (b) an excessive
degree of regulation. Since 1968 significant improvements have been intro-
duced. In 1970 a Direction des Transports in the Ministere de l'Economie
Nationale (Ministry of the National Economy) was established, which, upon the
recommendation of the Commission Sectorielle des Transports (CST) became
the Ministere des Transports et Communications (Minîstry of Transport and
Communications-MTC) in January 1974.
Organization
2.09      The CST is a consultative body consisting of representatives of
the administration, of the various transport agencies and of users which
meets on request to study specific problems.  MTC's responsibilities in the
transport sphere include coordination of all modes of transport, improvement
of transport regulations and tariffs, overall development of the transport
sector and the planning of rail, sea-and airport infrastructure.
2.10      The Ministry of Planning has broad overall responsibility for trans-
port development along with all other sectors. The planning, administration,
construction and maintenance of the highway network is the responsibility of
the Direction des Ponts et Chaussees (DPC) in the Ministere de l'Equipement
(Ministry of Public Works-MPW; Chart).
Regulations
2.11      Progress vith simplification of regulations has been slower than
progress with reorganization. The Government still controls the transport
sector by approving tariffs, and licensing operators.  In practice, private
operators are limited to the transport of their own goods, or the transport
of persons in passenger cars, while public transport (freight and passenger)
is controlled by large public companies. Annex A presents the main improvL-
ments proposed by MTC but still to be approved by the Cabinet.
2.12      Despite regulatory measures favoring rail at the expense of road
for transport of products such as cereals and flour, the financial situation



-4-
of SNCFT has remained poor, because of the preferential tariiEfs enjoyed by
certain goods.
User Charges
2.13      Italconsult, as part of the First Highway Project Einanced by the
Bank, carried out a road user taxation study and made related recommendations.
The recommendations, which have been taken up by MTC and aim at a simplifica-
tion and rationalization of the tax system, are expected to Lmprove the allo-
cation of traffic to modes and vehicle types. Section 4.04 of the Loan Agree-
ment for the First Highway Project stipulates that the Government should re-
view with the Bank the above recommendations and implement them where appro-
priate. The Government, at the present time, is reviewing the recommendations
derived from the study. During negotiations, the Government agreed to review
these recommendations with the Bank and to prepare new regulations on road
user taxation prior to April 30, 1976, and put them into effect promptly but
not later than December 31, 1976.
2.14      All transport tariffs are fixed by the Government and cannot be
exceeded. Early in 1974 tariffs for freight transport by trucks were revised
to cover cost increases. Tariffs for passenger transDort have not been in-
creased, which has caused financial difficulties to some of the semi-public
transport companies (Societes Regionales de Transport). These difficulties
are due to the Government requiring transport companies to provide school bus
services at nominal fares below the cost of operation, and t!he imposition of
sales taxes as well as general cost increases. The Government recognizes the
need to provide these companies with the funds required to cover losses in
revenue due to the introduction or maintenance of reduced tariffs.  During
negotiations, the Government agreed to fully implement this strategy prior to
December 31, 1978.
Investments
2.15      Total investments of the Fourth Development Plan (1973-76) amount
to D 1,194.2 million or an average D 298.6 million annually (Table 4). In-
vestments in the communications and transport sector of this Plan amount to
D 195.7 million of which D 87.4 million are allocated to roads (Table 5).
The D 87.4 million, are primarily for road maintenance and improvement and
modernization of the existing network. Low priority is given to the exten-
sion of the road network, which is reasonable except perhaps in the context
of rural roads (see paras. 2.16 and 5.07).
2.16      The need for improved transport planning and coordination together
with a shortage of trained personnel in the MTC are recognized by the Govern-
ment. To improve this situation, the proposed project includes consulting
services for the updating of the 1968 Transport Survey and the preparation of
a rural roads program. During negotiations the Government and the Bank dis-
cussed and agreed on (i) the outline and timetable for the updating of the
Survey; and (ii) the scope and formulation of the rural roads program (paras.
4.04 and 4.05).



D. Previous Projects
2.17      Annex B shows the details of these projects, which include highwav
engineering studies, a highway project, a railway project, a pipeline project
and two port projects. The Bank's participation in these projects amounts
to US$64.0 million.
III. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Network
3.01      The highway network totals 16,850 km, of which about 7,700 km are
paved, about 800 km have a gravel surface, about 4,000 km are of earth con-
struction, and the remaining 4,400 km are tracks (Table 6).  The network is
unevenly distributed over the different regions of the country. It is very
dense in the north and along the coast in the east, thins out gradually
toward the central region and decreases to a minimum in the arid south.
3.02      While the present network is generally adequate in coverage and
length, its design characteristics are in many areas becoming insufficient
to handle the growing traffic. Narrow carriageways, inadequate sight dis-
tances, tortuous alignments and insufficient pavement thickness cause hazards
and high operating costs. Under the First Highway Project certain heavily
travelled trunk roads were modernized and light and aging pavements were
strengthened. The proposed project will continue to assist the Government
in improving and modernizing the network.
B. Traffic
3.03      The Institut National de la Statistique publishes annually the
number of registered vehicles (Table 7). Since vehicles which are no longer
in use apparently are not removed from the records, the annual numbers are
inflated. The proposed project contains provisions to improve the reliability
of the vehicle figures (para. 5.07).
3.04      Consultants' estimates of total vehicle fleet in use (excluding ag-
ricultural trailers) are approximately 43,200, 51,400 and 71,200 for the years
1962, 1966 and 1972, respectively. Thus the annual growth rate amounts to
4.5% for the period 1962-66 and 5.5% between 1966-1972. By the end of 1973
the total fleet was estimated at 77,300 consisting of 63,200 passenger cars,
3,200 trucks, 8,700 vans, 2,000 buses, and 200 tractors. In addition there
are about 700 agricultural trailers.



- 6 -
3.05       In the public sector passenger-knm and ton-kmn road traffic has in-
creased at average annual rates of 8.9% ard 15.47, respectively, during the
period 1966-71 (Table 7). Traffic increase has been particularly heavy on
the access roads to Tunis and the touris:n areas, wher.- rates of 12% to 17.5%
per annum are recorded with an average daily traffic in 1973 of 15,000 to
30,000 vehicles on the links from Tunis to route GP1. Part of this signifi-
cant increase is the result of more liberal vehicle import arid transport
licenses policies.
3.06       Estimates of average annual growth rates of road traffic in terms
of passenger-km amount to 7.6% and 7.1% for the periods 1972-1976 and 1976-
1980, respectivelv. Corresponding estimates in terms of ton-km are 5.3% and
8.0% for 1972-1976 and 1976-1980, respectively (Table 8). Legal restrictions
on vehicle weights (maximum axle-load is 13 tons) and dimensions are satis-
factorv and are being enforced.
C. Administration
3.07       The Direction des Ponts et Chaussees (DPC) in the MPW is responsible
for the maintenance and development of the highway system. DPC has seven
headquarter divisions; administration, organization and methods, design, con-
struction, laboratory, equipment and special studies (Chart). The field
organization of DPC includes six field divisions; Tunis, Bizerte, Sousse,
Sfax, El Kef and Gabes which in turn supervise 18 field subdivisions, one
for each of the "Gouvernorats", the regional political units. A field sub-
division has responsibility for 600 to 1,000 km of the highway network.
3.08      The organization of DPC was established following recommendations by
the French consultants SCET-BCEOM financed under a Highway Engineering Project
(Loan S2-TUN). A major feature of the organization, undertaken in 1972/73
as part of the First Highway Project, was that DPC was given full responsi-
bility for the management of its own equipment fleet. Previously DPC drew
its equipment from the Service d'Entretien de Materiel (SEM), a division of
another directorate in the MPW.
3.09       The divisions and subdivisions are manned by about 50 engineers
and 250 technicians. The engineers in charge are competent, and most have
been trained abroad, mainly in France. Several French expatriate engineers
occupv positions within the DPC and contribute to an efficient operation.
D. Planning and Engineering
3.10      The Design Division in the DPC is responsible for planning and
designing highway projects. A competent Chief Engineer heads the division,



but sufficient staff (especially economists) is lacking. For this reason
DPC employs consultants, both local and foreign, for the preparation of
important highwav projects; smaller projects are designed by the division.
3.11      The design standards (Table 9) used by DPC for highways, which are
satisfactory, are similar to the French standards as described in "Instruction
Francaise sur les Conditions Techniques d'Amenagement des Routes (ICTAR-1969)".
E. Financing
3.12      Between 1966 and 1970, annual expenditures for construction and
maintenance of roads averaged approximately D 4.2 million (Table 10). These
low expenditures reflect the low priority accorded by the Government to high-
way infrastructure investmnent. However, based on the recommendations of the
Transport Survey (see para. 2.04) and the recommendations of the Bank-financed
Highway Maintenance Study carried out by SCET-BCEOM under the First Highway
Project, the Government became aware of the importance of a well maintained
and modern highway network. Highway allocations grew from D 15.4 million in
1972 to D 17.3 million in 1975 (Table 10); the sharp rise from D 4.2 million
in 1971 to D 15.4 million in 1972 was caused by a special budget allocation
of D 8.8 million for repairs of the roads damaged in the 1969 floods.
3.13      The central Government provides all funds (maintenance and con-
struction) for the primary and secondary road network, and the Gouvernorats
for the tertiary roads.
F. Construction
3.14      The DPC as a matter of policy usually undertakes construction of
roads through contractors. This is a complete reversal of an earlier policy
whereby all highwav construction was executed with DPC forces. In order to
make use of the substantial equipment pool built up during the 1960's and to
keep competitive pressure on foreign contracting firms operating in Tunisia,
the Government in 1970 decided to establish the Societe de Materiel et de
Travaux (SOMATRA), utilizing former DPC forces and equipment from SEM (para.
3.08) as a starting base. The Government owns the majority of the company's
shares, but the company is financially independent and free from direct
Government control. It has successfully participated in the bidding, either
alone or in joint ventures with foreign firms, for some of the project elements
of the First Highway Project. SOMATRA receives no beneficial considerations
and does not constrain the activities of private firms. Competing with SOMATRA
and foreign firms are several privately owned local construction firms (Afrique
Travaux, Effert, SABAG), capable of contracts up to US$2.5 million, which are
participating successfully in the construction of elements of the First High-
way Project and other major construction.



-8-
3.15      Supervision of all highway construction is carried out by the con-
struction division of the DPC. The staff of this division is assisted in
their tasks by the Central Laboratory, another division. The well equipped
laboratory executes all soils and materials tests necessary for the super-
vision and also for engineering of highwav projects. Supervision is satis-
factory.
G. Maintenance
3.16      Under the First Highway Project highwav maintenance operations were
successfully reorganized and strengthened based on a review oif the highway
maintenance organization carried out by the French consultants, SCET-BCEOM,
under the Highway Engineering Loan S2-TUN.
3.17      The maintenance operations are carried out or are supervised in the
field by the 18 Field Subdivisions which are located at the Gouvernorats.
These Field Subdivisions in turn are supervised by the six Field Divisions.
At headquarters execution of all maintenance work, including t:he resurfacing
and rehabilitation of paved roads, is monitored by the division for Organiza-
tion and Methods.
3.18      This division, assisted by experts from consultants financed under
the First Highway Project, has introduced improved procedures for planning,
management and cost accounting. It has, together with the Equipment Division,
introduced an equipment depreciation accounting system which is now function-
ing satisfactorily. This system will be an important input for determining
future renewals of each piece of equipment. It also has introduced full cost
accounting of all types of maintenance operations, including the cost of
equipment in each operation.
3.19      Periodic maintenance such as the renewal of the wearing course of
paved roads is carried out by contractors whereas routine maintenance is
carried out by the field subdivisions with their own forces.
3.20      Since DPC gained full control of equipment (para. 3.08), it has
distributed the highway maintenance equipment not allocated to SOMATRA (para.
3.14) to the field divisions.  Repairs of so called 'elst' and "2nd degrees"
(light repairs) are carried out by the mechanics of the field subdivisions,
more serious repairs or overhauls of the equipment ("3rd" and "4th degrees")
are carried out at the Equipment Division (Parc Central de Materiel) in
Tunis. To avoid transport over long distances from the field subdivisions to
the Equipment Division in Tunis, the DPC is contemiplating the creation of two
regional equipment pools at Gabes and Kairouan for maintenance and overhaul
of equipment.
3.21      The Equipment Divisior. employs about 200 mechanics and electricians;
each subdivision has two to three mechanics and electricians according to tile
size of their equipment pool.



-9-
3.22      Maintenance expenditures for 1975 amounted to T) 4.6 million includ-
ing about D 2.0 million administrative cost (Table 10). Tle direct mainte-
nance expenditure represents about US$750 per km of paved road and about
US$250 per km of gravel road which is satisfactory.
H.  Training
3.23      A training program for mechanics and electricians has been sponsored
by the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry for Social Affairs.  This
program which is financed by the Ministry of Social Affairs and held at the
Equipment Division, is expected to train 200 - 300 mechanics and electricians
per year. The program which appears to be adequate started in May 1975 and is
also open for mechanics from the private sector.
3.24      In 1974 the first graduates of civil engineering left the National
Schoo. in Tunis.  DPC expects to meet its need for civil engineers from
among the graduates of this school.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      In line with the Governnent's overall development objectives and
the consequent policy of stressing maintenance and improvement of the high-
way network, the project would:
(a)  give impulse to industrial development in the Bizerte region
by upgrading the primary road GP8 between Tunis and Bizerte;
(b)  reduce transportation costs on a number of more heavily traf-
ficked routes by constructing bypasses and upgrading the
present sub-standard facilities to modern two-lane highways
thus providing reliable connections between major cities in
the regions concerned;
(c)  help to improve future transportation planning by providing
consultants to assist in upgrading the 1968 Transport Survev;
and
(d)  help to foster rural development strategy through a rural
roads program.



- 10 -
B. Description
4.02      The project would consist of:
(a)  the improvement of about 225 km of primary and secondary
roads: and
(b)  consulting services to assist in updating the 1968 Trans-
port Survey and to assist with the preparation of a rural
roads program.
Highways Improvements (Annex C)
4.03      The following road sections would be improved to two-lane paved
standards:
(a) GP1: Tunis-Libyan Border Road
(i) construction of a bypass at Sousse (32.0 km) arnd a
section of MC82 leading from Sousse to Moknine (1.2 km);
(ii) construction of a bypass at El-Djem (3.2 km); and
(iii)  construction of a bypass at Sfax (8.0 km);
(b) GP5: Tunis-MIedjez-el-Bab Road
improvement of the section Mornaghia-Medjez-el--Bab
(38.2 km);
(c) GP6: Beja-Jendouba Road
improvement of the entire road (46.2 km);
(d) GP8: Tunis-Bizerte Road
improvement of the entire road (57.7 km); and
(e) MC 28/MC 27: Hammamet-Korba Road
improvement of the entire road (37.7 km) including
construction of bypasses at the towns of Hammainet,
Nabeul and Beni Khiar.
Consulting Services
1968 Transport Survey
4.C4       The proposed project would provide about 70 man-months of consult-
ing services over a period of two years to the M'C in order to assist MTC
staff in the updating of the 1968 Transport Survev (para. 5.13).



- 11 -
Rural Roads Program
4.05      In many areas, agricultural and rural development bas been con-
strained by lack of adequate transport facilities. The proposed project
would provide also about 110 man-months of consulting services over a period
of two and a half years to assist the MPW in the preparation of a program of
rural road improvement and construction to foster agricultural and rural
development. The main purpose of this program, which will consist of a pilot
program (Phase I) and possibly, a follow-up project (Phase II) is to identify
and prepare rural roads for improvement or construction and, possibly, related
complementary investments. The probable concept and scope of the program is
shown in Annex A.
C. Engineering
4.06      Engineering according to the design standards of Table 9 was carried
out by the joint ventures between foreign and local firms BCEOM-STUDI, Renardet
SAUTI-SCEE and SETEC-SOTUETEC. The standards which are satisfactory are
similar to the French standards described in "Instruction Francaise sur les
Conditions Techniques d'Amenagement des Routes (ICTAR-1969)". The soils and
materials investigations were satisfactorily carried out by the Laboratory
Division of DPC.
D. Cost Estimates
4.07      Details of cost estimates for the various project items are given
in Tables 11 and 12.  The estimated cost of the project is as follows:
------- D'000 ------   ------ US$'000 ------  Foreign

- 12 -
4.08      The cost estimates for improvement works are based on quantities
from the final design and on unit rates pertaining in early 1975. The cost
estimates for consulting services are based on the estimated man-months re-
quired and consultants' rates pertaining in early 1975.
4.09      Contingencies for price escalation for construction and consulting
services have been estimated on expected price increases of 16% in 1975, 14%
in 1976 and 12% in each of the two years following thereafter. Details are
given in Annex D. A 10% physical contingency for improvement works as well
as for consulting services has been included to allow for unforeseen quantity
increase in the improvement items and for man-months in consulting services,
respectively.
4.10      The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$28.0 million,
which is 54% of total project cost. The foreign exchange component for the
highway improvement works would range from 58% to 48% according to whether
construction was carried out by foreign or local firms. Based on the most
likely blend of foreign and local participation the foreign exchange component
is estimated at 53%. Where possible works have been broken down into smaller
contracts to encourage local participation. Foreign firms will be permitted
to bid on groups of contracts. For consulting services the foreign exchange
component is estimated at 70% based on the most likely event that these ser-
vices would be provided by foreign firms with participation of local firms.
All cost estimates have been discussed and agreed with the Borrower during
negotiations.
E. Financing
4.11      The proposed loan of US$28.0 million would finance 54% of the total
cost of US$52.3 million and finance the entire foreign exchange component of
the project. The Government would provide the local component from its con-
cerned budgets.
F. Implementation
Responsibility for Project Execution
4.12      The DPC would be responsible for the lmplementation of the road works.
All road improvement works would be carried out by contract and supervised by
the DPC which is competent for this purpose.  The DPC would also be respons-
ible for the rural roads study, whereas the MTC would be responsible for the
updating of the 1968 Transport Survey. The consulting services would be pro-
vided by qualified and experienced consultants satisfactory to the Bank.



- 13 -
Procurement
4.13      For the improvement works contracts on the basis of unit prices
would be awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance vith
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Works are expected to start about mid-
1976 and be completed about early 1979. Proposals for the consulting serv-
ices would be invited early 1976, after the terms of reference have been
agreed between the Government and the Bank. The services are expected to
be completed in the second half of 1978 for the updating of the Transport
Survey as well as for the Rural Roads Study.
Project Implementation Schedule
4.14      A Project Implementation Schedule is in Annex E.  The schedule has
been discussed and agreed with the Goverrment during loan negotiations.
G. Disbursements
4.15      Disbursements would be made on the basis of 53% of total expendi-
tures (which is the estimated foreign cost component) for the highway improve-
ment works and 70% of total expenditures for consulting services. Based on
this and on the project implementation schedule, an Estimated Schedule of
Disbursements (Annex F) has been prepared. The schedule has been discussed
and agreed with the Government during loan negotiations. Any surplus remaining
in the Loan Account on completion of the project would be cancelled.
H. Environmental Impact
4.16      None of the project elements will adversely affect the enviroument.
The planned bypasses for the towns of Hammamet, Nabeul, Beni Khiar, Sousse,
El-Djem and Sfax vill relieve the urban areas from traffic noise and air
pollution.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
5.01      The highway lengths to be improved represent sections of Tunisia's
highway network most in need of improvement. The present transportation costs
on these lengths are unduly high and the improvements will reduce vehicle
operating costs, journey times, accidents and highway maintenance costs. Ad-
ditionally, a shift to larger (more economic) vehicles will be possible and
increased travel comfort available.



- 14 -
5.02      The routes on which the project sections are locatied are inter-
regional. Benefits will therefore accrue to both long dista13cceàad local
traffic.  The bypass sections on GP1 and MC 27/28 will enabla tthrough traffic
particularly trucks to avoid the towns of Sousse, El-Djem, Sfax, Hammamet,
Nabeul and Beni Khiar.
5.03      The possible effect of the improvement of sections GP1, GP5, GP6
and GP8 on railway transport between Tunis-Sfax, Tunis-Bizerte, and Tunis-
Algiers has been examined. The road improvements are not expected to signi-
ficantly divert traffic from the railways which specialize in long distance
bulk cargo.
5.04      The project roads serve important agricultural areas with small
and medium-sized farms producing olives (GP1), cereals (GP6), oranges (MC 27
and MC 28) and cattle (GP5 and GP6). Other important commodities that would
be affected by the improved facilities are processed agricultural commodities,
fish products, bottled beverages, fuels, chemical and light industrial pro-
ducts, and construction materials.
5.05      The project is well timed to supplement specific ongoing and pro-
posed projects such as the Medjerda and Nebhana Irrigation Projects (LN 1068),
the Tourism Infrastructure Project (CR 329), the Sousse-Nord Tourism Project
<1973 and 1975 IFC Investment), the enlargement of citrus fruit and olive
plantations in Sousse, the Northern Tunisian Water Master Plan, and the devel-
opment of industrial parks in Tunis, Bizerte, Menzel Bourguiba, Nabeul, Sousse
and Sfax.
5.06      The Government controls tariffs and thereby limits profits on
vehicle operations. Since the tariffs are related (amongst other thinge) to
road conditions, transport cost savings from the improved roads will largely
be passed on to small farmers and manufacturers, consumers and passengers.
The project will assist the Government in its objective to stimulate economic
development and regional integration.
Consulting Services
5.07      The project also includes provision of consulting services for
technical assistance for (a) transport planning, and (b) a rural roads pro-
gram. The technical assistance for transport planning would update the 1968
Transport Survey and provide on-the-job training and is expected to help en-
sure that future investments in the transport sector would be made according
to an integrated transport plan based on economic criteria and reliable basic
data, including fleet statistics. The technical assistance for a rural roads
program would provide services to assist the MPW in the preparation of a
program which is expected to foster agricultural development.

B. Economic Evaluation
Highway Improvements
5.08      Based on the most probable estinates of construction costs, vehicle
operating costs, time costs, base year traffic and traffic growth, the pro-
posed investments in the project roads sections produce economic returns
(ER's) ranging from 18.0% to 42.0% (Table 13). These ER's range from 16.5%
to 36.0% if travel time savings are not considered. The ER for the road
improvement program as a whole is 33.2% (26.4% without travel time savings).
Sensitivity analyses testing the ER's of this program gave a return of 28.3%
assuming 25% cost overrun, and a return of 26.7%, assuming a 25% reduction of
benefits (Table 14).
5.09      For the purpose of economic analysis, the road improvements are
divided into sections according to physical characteristics and traffic con-
ditions. Details of these sections on which the 1973 average daily traffic
(ADT) ranged from about 900 to 4,000 are shown in Table 13. The economic
benefits of alternative improvements for each road section (aggregated over
an expected life of 20 years) have been assessed to determine the optimal
treatment in terms of alignment, width, pavement strength and timing.
5.10      Traffic forecasts per type of vehicle are based on past traffic
trends, origin and destination studies, and expected population growth.
Estimated traffic growth during 1973-79 on the various project sections
ranges from 2.3% to 24.0% per annum.  The latter percentage relates to GP8
traffic near Tunis, where traffic diversion from MC 31 is expected. Corres-
ponding annual traffic growth rates during 1979-80 range from 5.4% to 14.5%.
5.11      Traffic forecasts are conservative since they do not include gene-
rated traffic attributable to the ongoing projects referred to in paragraph
5.05, while other generated traffic is negligible. Particularly the improve-
ment of GP8 is expected to play a significant role in the development of in-
dustrial parks in flenzel Bourguiba and Bizerte. It is, however, difficult
to predict the benefits attributed by such road improvements, to industrial
development.
5.12      The average unit saving in vehicle operating costs is approximately
15%. The operating costs for the six vehicle categories considered (passen-
ger cars, vans, trucks with a loading capacity equal to or less than 3.5 tons,
trucks with a loading capacity greater than 3.5 tons, trailers and buses)
are shown in Table 15. They are based on the average characteristics of
typical vehicles in Table 16.  Hourly savings associated with working and
non-working triDs have been estimated at 100%2' and 20% of average hourly earn-
ings in the relevant regions, respectively. The number of commuters on the
proposed project roads is relativelv small: their trins are treated as non-
working ones.



- 16 -
Consulting Services
5.13      Benefits from the consulting services are extremely difficult to
quantify. The assistance for transport planning should helr ensure that
future investments in the sector would maximize socio-economic benefits.
In addition the MTC staff would receive on-the-job training to enable them to
continue the planning process upon departure of the consultants. The main
purpose of the rural roads study is to identify and analyze rural roads for
construction or improvement in areas where their inadequacy is a serious
obstacle to agricultural development.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      Agreement having been reached on the principal issues discussed in
Chapters II and IV, based on the economic lives of the roads or road sections
to be improved, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$28.0 million
to the Government of Tunisia for a 24-year term, including four years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
TUNISIA
Transport Regulations, 1968 Transport Survey and Proposed Rural Roads Program
A.        Main Improvements in Regulations Proposed by MTC
1.        Replacement of the existing five truck categories of public
transport, which limit the type of products transported and
the zone in which trucks can be used, by two categories, i.e.
one category with no zonal restrictions and another one with
zonal restrictions;
abolishment of regulations restricting owners of light trucks
to the transport of their own goods;
abolishment of regulations restricting the use of trailers
by farmers to a distance of 35 km; and
provision of transport of persons by small vehicles in or
to remote areas, which presently lack such a facility (this
provision may require a Government subsidy).
B.        Concept and Scope of the Updating of the 1968 Transport Survey
2.        The main purpose of this updating is to strengthen transport co-
ordination and planning. In addition, important changes of national policies
and strategies affec,ting the transport system since 1970, will be incorporated.
The updating will concentrate on the main issues and include the following:
(i) a coordinated effort on the part of the various Government
agencies concerned with transport matters to collect all avail-
able data and reports on transport in Tunisia;
(ii) the preparation of forecasts of total demand for freight and
passenger transport in Tunisia;
(iii) the preparation of estimates of future movements of freignt
and passengers by mode based on the above item (ii) and a
structure and level of prices and costs for transport services;
(iv) the review of compensation policies and payments by Government
for services of various modes of transport are required to
provide as a result of an imposed public duty;



ANNEX A
Page 2
(v) the establishment of coordination policies and measures to
ensure sound coordination and cooperation among the various
public organizations involved in transport matters including
clearly defined lines of authority;
(vi)  the introduction of a transport investment analysis system,
making available to all levels involved in investment de-
cisions the methods and criteria required for rational al-
location of resources and the determination of investment
priorities in the transport sector;
(vii) the identification of specific problems to be analyzed at a
later date and related technical assistance requireements;
and
(viii) the identification of training requirements in the various
sub-sectors.
3.        The proposed project would provide about 70 man-months of consulting
services over a period of two years to assist MTC staff in the updating of
the 1968 Transport Survey. The MTC staff would consist of a minimum of four
experts to be trained on the job in the areas of transport planning and eco-
nomics and to be assembled as soon as possible after the conmencement of the
proposed project. The staff would be expected to be able te continue their
tasks upon departure of the consultants.
C.        Concept and Scope of the Rural Roads Program
4.        The main purpose of this program, which will consist of a pilot
project (Phase I) and, possibly, a follow-up project (Phase II), is to identify
and prepare rural roads for improvement or construction in areas where their
inadequacy is an obstacle to agricultural development.
5.        The total of about 110 man-months of consulting services provided
for under the proposed highway improvement project is to assist the Ministry
of Public Work. in preparing the pilot project and, upon satisfactory pre-
paration of this project and with the Bank's approval, the follow-up project.
The pilot project would cover six zones, believed to be representative of the
entire country from a climatic, environmental, socio-economic, etc. point of
view.
6.        The satisfactory preparation of the pilot project will depend on
appropriate coordination and cooperation between the Ministry of Public Works
and various other ministries such as the Ministry of Planning, the Ministry
of Agriculture, the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and the
Ministry of Interior. For instance, it will be necessary to examine and
coordinate the rural roads program with national development: plans prepared
'by the Ministry of Planning, sectoral plans prepared by the Ministry of Agri-
culture and, possibly, other plans by other government organizations. To
facilitate this coordination and cooperation. the Government: will organize a
high level Coordination Committee consisting of representatives of the various
concerned ministries.

7.        In addition, in preparing the rural roads program, the Government
shall review nationil aend sectoral policies and strategies relating to:
M()  the distribution of potential benefits for an improved rural
roads infrastructure (e.g., through taxation measures);
(il) the establishment of agro-based industries;
(iii) resettlement ("programme de regroupement de la population");
and
(iv) land tenure.

(iii) improvement of workshops; and
(iv) provision of consultants to assist in general management,
cost accounting, and the management of locomotives and rol-
ling stock, stations and workshops.
The project was delayed by about two years due to the disastrous floods of
1969 and 1971 and shortages of funds resulting from slow payments by the
railway's principal customer (SFAX/GAFSA Phosphate Co.) prior to 1973, when
the Government assumed the debts of the phosphate company. All procurement
for the project is completed and deliveries of remaining rolling stock are
expected shortly. Relaying of track is substantially completed and the proj-
ect should be completed by the end of December 1975.

ANNEX C
APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
TUNISIA
Highway Improvements
1.        Bypasses on GP1.  The primary road GP1 extends from Tunis south-
ward to the Libyan Border and is the main north-south link in the east of
Tunisia. Two-lane bypasses with 7.00 m carriageway and 3.00 m wide shoulders
will be constructed for the urban centers of Sousse (33.3 km) El-Djem (3.2 km)
and Sfax (8.0 km). The design speed is 100 km/h.
2.        GP5:  Mornaghia-Medjez-el-Bab Road (38.2 km).  The road section
from Mornaghia to Medjez-el-Bab on GP5 is the continuation of the section
Tunis-Mornaghia (Exit Tunis West) which is presently constructed to four-lane
standards and financed under the First Highway Project. The road runs through
rolling terrain and is presently geometrically and structurally inadequate
for the traffic it carries. The narrow pavement (5.00-6.00 m) has been
damaged by truck traffic beyond the recourse of normal maintenance. The carri-
ageway will be strengthened and the road will have a width of 6.00 m over its
entire length with 3.00 m wide shoulders. The design speed is 100 km/h.
3.        GP6:  Beja-Jendouba Road (46.2 km).  The existing road runs through
rolling terrain, has a weak and narrow carriageway and sub-standard sight
distances. The road will be improved to a 7.00 m wide facility, with strength-
ened pavement and 3.00 m wide shoulders. Over a length of 4.4 km, the alignment
will be changed to improve sight distances.   The design speed is 100 km/h.
4.        GP8:  Tunis-Bizerte Road (57.7 km).  The road consists of two parts:
a section of 10.1 km from Ariana, north of Tunis, to the junction with MC31
and a 46.6 km long section from this junction to Bizerte. The road traverses
rolling and flat terrain, has two dangerous curves and generally inadequate
sight distances. About 6 km have a carriageway width of 5 m only. The existing
road crosses the Medjerda River by an ancient bridge which is structurally
inadequate for heavy traffic.  The road will be upgraded to a modern two-lane
highway with a 7.00 m wide carriageway, 3.00 m wide shoulders, with improved
geometric characteristics and riding surface and a new Medjerda River bridge
thus providing a reliable link between Tunis and Bizerte. The design speed
is 100 km/h.
5.        MC28/MC27:  Hammamet-Korba Road (37.7 km).  The existing road runs
along the southeastern shore of the Cap Bon peninsula through flat terrain.
It starts at the junction with GP1, west of Hammamet, passes through the tourist
centers of Hammamet, Nabeul and Beni Khiar to Korba.  The widths of the existing
carriageway varies between 5.00 and 6.00 m.  The road will be upgraded to a
modern highway with a 7.00 m carriagevay and 3.00 m wide shoulders and will
bypass Hammamet, Nabeul and Beni Khiar. The design speed is 80 km/h.
