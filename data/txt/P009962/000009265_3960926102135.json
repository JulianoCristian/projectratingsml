aims\n            to finance over a 7-year period and seeks to support the\n            third phase of \"Operation Flood\", India's\n            nation wide program for development of the dairy industry,\n            by creating viable, private sector oriented and farmer owned\n            cooperatives.  The project intends to finance investment\n            costs related to:  (a) expansion in the number of village\n            cooperative societies involved; (b) expansion in dairy\n            processing and marketing infrastructure to handle a further\n            5.2 million mlpd of milk; and (c) development of\n            productivity enhancement measures.  In addition, the project\n            further aims to finance investments in (d) institution\n            strengthening measures.  By completion the project will have\n            increased the number of participating families from 4.7\n            million to 6.7 million and will have substantial impact on\n            incomes and employment for rural poverty groups and women.\n            Also, supply of Operation Flood milk will increase by 60\n            percent helping to meet a rapidly growing urban consumption."}, "docdt": "1987-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
