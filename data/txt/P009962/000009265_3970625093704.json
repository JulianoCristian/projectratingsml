Second National Dairy Project were to\n            promote the establishment of viable cooperative businesses\n            owned and managed by producers, for collecting, processing\n            and marketing milk products in order to expand rural incomes\n            and improve milch animal productivity. These were to be\n            achieved by: (a) expanding and consolidating the integrated\n            cooperative institutional structures; (b) providing the\n            necessary prerequisites for milk productivity enhancement;\n            (c) establishment and expansion of milk collection,\n            processing, storage and distribution activities; and (d)\n            strengthening institutions and training. Some main lesson\n            learnt are:  An understanding of the proper role of\n            government in project implementation is crucial. Project\n            design should explicitly take this role into account.  The\n            AMUL model, a successful experience in milk collection,\n            processing and marketing, controlled and directed by farmers\n            in Gujarat, was considered feasible for replication in other\n            states which had different cooperative traditions and\n            culture. In a sheltered industry, promotion of competition\n            is essential to enhance operating efficiency.  In NDP-II,\n            the quality of management was perceived as a principal risk,\n            thus requiring special attention. However, the Government\n            must also make a contribution to the agency which would be\n            responsible for maintaining quality standards for\n            technically guiding the industry, and for ensuring that good\n            manufacturing practices are applied throughout the dairy\n            industry.  For a project of the size and scope of NDP-II,\n            the Bank should have insisted on the establishment and\n            monitoring of key performance indicators aimed at providing\n            intermediate assessments of project outcomes and likely impacts."}, "docdt": "1997-01-14T00:00:00Z"}
