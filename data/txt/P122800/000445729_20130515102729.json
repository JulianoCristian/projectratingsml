"Ratings for the Postconflict\n            Reconstruction and Recovery Grant Project for Cote\n            d'Ivoire were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; bank\n            performance was satisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            first, a country emerging from a prolonged and severe crisis\n            can still achieve significant progress as long as its\n            government demonstrates ownership and commitment to reform;\n            second, rapid bank support to a country in a post conflict\n            period can be effective in supporting the return to\n            stability; third, the effectiveness of a Bank development\n            policy  operation can be enhanced by its complementarities\n            with other Bank financed operations and the efforts of other\n            active donors in the reform areas; and fourth, when\n            operations are prepared under difficult situations of\n            institutional and/or political fragility, it may be\n            important to limit the number and ambition of intermediate\n            outcomes indicators."}, "docdt": "2013-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
