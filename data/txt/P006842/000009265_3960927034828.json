The\n            project incorporates three components.  First, a primary\n            education development component, to finance: (i) libraries\n            and student/teacher materials; (ii) an in-service training\n            program and the introduction of a new curriculum; and (iii)\n            textbooks. The second component is a policy component which\n            will : (i) introduce a new student promotion policy; (ii)\n            raise the level of investment in primary education; and\n            (iii) promote local financing of civil works in the\n            subsector. The third and final component is a management\n            component, which includes funds for technical assistance,\n            staff training, and studies."}, "docdt": "1988-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
