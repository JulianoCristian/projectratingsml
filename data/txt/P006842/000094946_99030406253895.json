implementation, educational legislative\n            changes were in harmony with proposed educational and\n            regulatory reforms. Results were mixed, though generally\n            satisfactory. The policy component, to improve efficiency in\n            primary education enrollment, as well as resource\n            mobilization, was only slightly improved. The management\n            development component showed results below expectations, due\n            to inadequate staff training and technical support at the\n            central and departmental levels. Even though the supply of\n            textbooks and educational materials component improved\n            somehow the teaching-learning environment, monitoring was\n            insufficient. Key lessons learned suggest that: 1) major\n            institutional and political reforms often delay project\n            implementation, thus project reformulation and timetables\n            revision should be taken into account, as well as\n            flexibility in project design; 2) projects containing\n            educational reform programs should identify measurable\n            objectives; 3) monitoring is crucial for an effective\n            implementation; 4) management information systems is\n            essential for monitoring and supervision; 5) attention\n            should be paid to the political dimensions of change which\n            impact on educational policy; and, 6) project design\n            flexibility would accommodate diversity in educational and\n            socioeconomic conditions."}, "docdt": "1998-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
