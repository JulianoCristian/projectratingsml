extension services to about 32,400\n            small farmers; investment credit for about 10,000 farms\n            including 1,480 irrigated farms; and marketing support\n            services for private traders and small farmers. It also\n            includes funding for community subprojects; project\n            administration and training. There are no environmental\n            issues associated with the project, and improved land use\n            and soil and water conservation will have a favorable\n            environmental impact. Overall, some 40,000 low-income rural\n            families in 49 municipalities of the State of Alagoas will\n            benefit from the project."}, "docdt": "1987-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
