"Category" means any one of them;
(b)
the term "Eligible Expenditures" means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out 
of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the Categories in 
accordance with the provisions of, and in the percentages set forth in, the table in 
paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and
(c)
the term "Initial Deposit" means an amount equivalent to $2,000,000 to be 
withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the Special Account pursuant to 
paragraph 3 of this Schedule.

Withdrawals from the Special Account shall be made exclusively for Eligible 
Expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule. For each such 
withdrawal, the Central Bank shall debit the Special Account with the dollar 
equivalent of the amount in Cruzeiros or any currency other than dollars, determined 
on the basis of the rate of exchange between the dollar and the Cruzeiro or such other 
currency in effect at the date the payment for each Eligible Expenditure shall have 
been made.
3.
The Bank shall, promptly after the Effective Date, withdraw on behalf of the 
Borrower from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account the Initial 
Deposit. Thereafter and on the basis of requests by the Borrower furnished to the Bank 
at such intervals as agreed between the Borrower and the Bank, the Bank shall further 
so withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amounts as 
shall be required to replenish the Special Account with amounts equal to payments made 
out of the Special Account for Eligible Expenditures, but only to the extent that the 
amount of any such deposit, together with any amount remaining on deposit in the 
Special Account as of the date of such request, shall not exceed in the aggregate the 
equivalent of the Initial Deposit. Except as the Bank may otherwise agree, each such 
deposit after the Initial Deposit shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account 
under the respective Category or Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, 
as shall have been justified by the evidence supporting the request for such deposit 
furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule.

the Bank into the Special Account after the Initial Deposit, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank in respect of each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special 
Account such documents and other evidence as the Bank shall reasonably request, 
showing that such payment was made for Eligible Expenditures.

withdrawals can be made directly by the Borrower from the Loan Account in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement, or (b) when 
the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the Categories minus the amount 
of any outstanding qualified agreement to reimburse entered into by the Bank and of

of twice the amount of the Initial Deposit. Withdrawal from the Loan Account of the 
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the Categories shall follow such 
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower and shall, except as

Eligible Expenditures.

(a)
any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for any expenditure 
Page  16

not justified by the evidence furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank and, unless otherwise agreed by the 
Bank, prior to any further deposit into the Special Account by the Bank, deposit into 
the Special Account or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank an amount 
equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or 
justified; or
(b)
any amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 
cover further payments for Eligible Expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon 
notice from the Bank, and unless otherwise agreed by the Bank, refund to the Bank such 
amount then outstanding in the Special Account.
7.
Notwithstanding the provisions regarding the Initial Deposit set forth in 
paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank may, at the request and by notice to the 
Borrower, increase the amount of the Initial Deposit to adjust the level of the 
Special Account to the disbursement requirements of the Project.
