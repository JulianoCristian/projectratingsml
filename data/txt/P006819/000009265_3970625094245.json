investment areas; and (ii)\n            reducing trade and sectoral distortions in agriculture.\n            These efforts are expected to provide a sounder basis for\n            export-oriented growth. The reviews in the context of the\n            loan assist in monitoring the economic program and in\n            promoting the participation of the external financial\n            community in the program. The Trade and Agricultural Policy\n            Loan Project will: (a) support trade liberalization; (b)\n            rationalize trade and price intervention policies in\n            agriculture; and (c) support coffee policy in balancing the\n            incentives between coffee and non-coffee agriculture. It\n            will furthermore; (d) support reforms to improve\n            agricultural credit availability at more realistic interest\n            rates; and (e) review efficiency in public investments in\n            the agricultural and rural sectors, and provide\n            institutional support to the Ministry of Agriculture."}, "docdt": "1986-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
