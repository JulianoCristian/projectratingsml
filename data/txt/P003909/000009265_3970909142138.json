The primary objectives of the project were: (i)\n            to raise the productivity and efficiency of the tree crop\n            subsector; (ii) to safeguard smallholder and estate incomes;\n            (iii) to increase non-oil exports; and (iv) to generate\n            rural employment, and improve smallholder incomes in the\n            Outer Islands. The performance of the Bank in the\n            identification, preparation and supervision of the project\n            has been rated as being satisfactory, and project appraisal\n            as being deficient. The overall performance by the Borrower\n            was satisfactory. The key lessons learned from the\n            implementation of the project were (i) the rationale for\n            public sector investments in enterprises that are commercial\n            in their operations has to be clearly established, and their\n            private sector counterfactual objectively assessed; (ii) the\n            tenderers' financial situation and track record should\n            be given more weight in the selection process; (iii) the\n            government should have in place an effective mechanism for\n            swift resolution of contractual disputes; (iv) realistic\n            crop forecasts are essential for planning of investments in\n            processing facilities; (v) for projects dealing with\n            commercial entities, financial performance indicators should\n            be developed and monitored during project supervision; and\n            (vi) all monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities must\n            start early in the implementation stage to ensure their full\n            usefulness and continuation beyond the implementation stage\n            of the project."}, "docdt": "1997-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
