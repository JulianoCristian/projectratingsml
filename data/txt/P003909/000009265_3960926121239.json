the tree crops subsector, safeguard\n            smallholder and estate incomes, and increase non-oil\n            exports. The project will accomplish this by: (i) building\n            new factory capacity to process the raw material from\n            existing nucleus estate and smallholder projects; and (ii)\n            providing technical assistance and other support to improve\n            processing efficiency. The project will also assist in\n            strengthening the ability of the Directorate General of\n            Estates (DGE) and related Government agencies (including\n            those concerned with environmental protection) to provide\n            technical, institutional, marketing and other support to the\n            tree crop subsector; through technical assistance, training\n            and studies."}, "docdt": "1988-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
