for Uzbekistan are as follows: outcome\n            was moderately satisfactory; risk to the development outcome\n            was significant; Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the projects included:\n            parallel funded operations in which all donors do not share\n            a key objective (privatization in this case) should\n            generally be avoided and preference given to a single donor\n            approach. If operations with divergent aims cannot be\n            avoided, then the project design should ensure each donor\n            has control over the components that are instrumental to the\n            achievement of its own particular objectives. Careful\n            assessments of users' willingness and ability to pay,\n            borrower agencies' institutional and financial\n            performance, the financial impact of a project upon users\n            and providers should always be part of the appraisal of\n            projects that incur significant operating costs over the\n            medium to long term. Cost recovery and project financial\n            performance should be monitored thoroughly during\n            supervision. The World Bank (WB) should bring problems-such\n            as financial shortfalls that imperil project achievements\n            immediately to the attention of a borrower, continually\n            offering high quality hands-on technical advice on solutions\n            as needed. If current revenues are insufficient and repeated\n            requests for strengthening them ignored, then the WB should\n            seek remedies under the legal agreements that might include\n            the suspension of disbursements and/ or cancellation of a project."}, "docdt": "2008-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
