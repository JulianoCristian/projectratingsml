F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's development objectives were to (a) return the existing municipal solid waste
management system to a satisfactory level of service, and (b) improve the technical,
financial, and institutional basis for its future operation and development. The project
would achieve these objectives (called specific development objectives in the project
appraisal document) by:

  ·      Ensuring that adequate collection infrastructure in the form of collection bins and
vehicles exist to provide basic municipal solid waste management services to the
residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial sectors.
  ·      Improving access and sanitation at public and residential collection points.


                                                 ii

  ·     Upgrading infrastructure at the city's long-term landfill including landfill practices
and operations to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact.
  ·     Providing for the closure of two existing landfills within the city.
  ·     Developing four transfer stations to optimize long-term use of the remaining
landfill facility.
  ·     Providing interim capability for the safe handling of biomedical waste.
  ·     Initiating actions to place the system on a stable financial footing in terms of cost
recovery and the ability to finance on-going operations and equipment replacement.
  ·     Upgrading institutional capacity to manage the system as an independent, self-
financing utility suitable for privatization in the medium term.
  ·     Developing a strategic plan for the system's future development, including
identification of major capital facility requirements and business structure options for the
system's financing and operation.
  ·     Providing for comprehensive public consultation in developing and operating the
system.

Neither the Loan Agreement nor the Project Agreement included a set of key indicators.
This was not standard practice at the time the project was approved in 1998. The project
appraisal document, however, contained a set of monitoring indicators and targets in annex
1 that served as the basis for the project's monitoring and evaluation system.

                 TASHKENT SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
                                           Loan No. 43260

1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale
for Bank assistance)

Country and sector background. At the time when preparations for the project began in 1996,
Uzbekistan had been independent from the Soviet Union for only five years. During the
period following independence, the government launched an ambitious program to reform the
housing and municipal services sector, leaving the responsibility for municipal solid waste
management and other urban services largely decentralized. Service provision
responsibilities were transferred in large part to the local governments. Tashkent is
Uzbekistan's largest city with a population of 2.2 million people, nearly 10 percent of the
country's population. It had been an important administrative center for the central Asian
republics during the Soviet period, and remained the home of the central government
administration at independence. However, the city was struggling to provide services at the
levels enjoyed during its years as a Soviet republic due to reductions in the subsidies that it
had been receiving under the former arrangements. As with other services, solid waste
collection and disposal services had declined significantly since independence, leading
residents and businesses to dump and burn solid waste in unauthorized piles throughout the
city. According to a 1997 social assessment the people of Tashkent were growing
increasingly dissatisfied with the solid waste situation.1 More than half of the respondents in
a citywide household survey indicated that they were not satisfied with their solid waste
services and would be willing to pay considerably more for their collection service if it were
improved.

Reflecting the priority the government assigned to improving solid waste conditions in the
capital city, the authorities sought advice and financial assistance from the World Bank and
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in establishing a more
market-oriented approach to delivery of solid waste services, upgrading collection
infrastructure (vehicles, bins, collection points), constructing transfer stations, closing in-city
landfill sites, and improving operations at a landfill outside of city boundaries. The total
estimated cost of the project was US$56.0 million, requiring a World Bank loan of US$24.0
million, EBRD loan of US$19.2 million, and a local contribution of $10.7 million.

Rationale for World Bank involvement. The World Bank's involvement in the project was
important for several reasons. First, the Bank offered unbiased advice on choice of
technologies, and enabled the city authorities to resist pressures by foreign suppliers of
expensive, but inappropriate high technology approaches. Second, it provided assistance to
strengthen the operational and financial management of Spetstrans--the publicly-owned

service provider--with the long-term aim of establishing a financially self-sustaining entity.
Third, it helped in providing for public consultations in designing and operating the system.
Fourth, the World Bank helped to upgrade environmental management at Tashkent's main
landfill. Fifth, the Bank helped to secure resources from a parallel financier, the EBRD.

Contribution to higher-level objectives. The project's objectives were consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 1998­2000, discussed by the World Bank's Board of
Directors on March 10, 1998, particularly the CAS's strategic component calling for the
removal of inefficiencies in resource utilization in municipal services and infrastructure.
The project directly addressed this concern by supporting the rehabilitation and
reorganization of the solid waste management sector of Uzbekistan's largest city, and as
such, increasing the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of providing solid
waste management services.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

The project's development objectives were to (a) return the existing municipal solid waste
management system to a satisfactory level of service, and (b) improve the technical,
financial, and institutional basis for its future operation and development. The project
would achieve these objectives (called specific development objectives in the project
appraisal document) by:

·    Ensuring that adequate collection infrastructure in the form of collection bins and
     vehicles exist to provide basic municipal solid waste management services to the
     residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial sectors.
·    Improving access and sanitation at public and residential collection points.
·    Upgrading infrastructure at the city's long-term landfill including landfill practices
     and operations to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact.
·    Providing for the closure of two existing landfills within the city.
·    Developing four transfer stations to optimize long-term use of the remaining landfill
     facility.
·    Providing interim capability for the safe handling of biomedical waste.
·    Initiating actions to place the system on a stable financial footing in terms of cost
     recovery and the ability to finance on-going operations and equipment replacement.
·    Upgrading institutional capacity to manage the system as an independent, self-
     financing utility suitable for privatization in the medium term.
·    Developing a strategic plan for the system's future development, including
     identification of major capital facility requirements and business structure options for
     the system's financing and operation.
·    Providing for comprehensive public consultation in developing and operating the
     system.

Neither the Loan Agreement nor the Project Agreement included a set of key indicators.
This was not standard practice at the time the project was approved in 1998. The project
appraisal document, however, contained a set of monitoring indicators and targets (see
annex 1) that served as the basis for the project's monitoring and evaluation system. The
key indicators related to the number and availability of each type of waste collection
vehicles and landfill operating equipment, amount of waste collected and delivered to the

                                                 2

landfill, tariff levels for each category of consumer, accounts receivables, and Spetstrans'
operating ratio.

1.3     Revised Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The project's development objectives were not formally revised during implementation.
The loan agreement, however, was amended once to reduce the number of in-city landfills
that would need to be closed in fulfillment of a condition of the loan agreement from two
to one. Under the amendment, the hokimiyat of Tashkent (city administration) would not
be required to close the Zangiota landfill because it is located outside the city's
jurisdiction.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised; briefly describe the "the primary target group" identified in the PAD and as
captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from
the project)

The primary target beneficiaries were the 2.2 million residents of Tashkent and
nonresidents who work in or visit the city. The project specifically targeted: (a) residents
in high-density housing and private single-family homes where limited waste collection
was leading to unsanitary and unsightly conditions, (b) women and children who are in
general responsible for handling household waste disposal, and (c) people living in the
vicinity of the Hasanbay landfill. Other important beneficiaries of the project included the
city administration, which would benefit from strengthened procurement, fiduciary, and
project management practices, and Spetstrans, which would benefit from improved
managerial, operational, financial, and strategic planning systems.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

The project comprised two main components: investment, and institutional support. The
World Bank financed only investment in equipment (bins, waste collection vehicles) and
the transfer stations. The World Bank's financing partner, the EBRD, financed both
investment and, largely on a grant basis, technical assistance. The technical assistance
helped the city administration and the service provider, Spetstrans, to improve financial
and operational management of solid waste services and to develop a strategy for the future
development of the sector. It also assisted the municipality in developing capacity for
project management. The financier for each component is indicated in the description of
the components below.

Investment Component

The investment component was to finance the upgrading of the basic waste collection
capacity of the municipal solid waste management system, modernization of the long-term
landfill facility, closure of the two in-city landfills, and development of four strategically
located transfer stations, in order to bring the system up to a reliable level of service.
Investments covered:



                                                  3

(a)     Collection Infrastructure (IBRD). This subcomponent would finance the
procurement of a variety of types of collection bins to serve residences (both single family
houses and multistory residential buildings owned and maintained by the housing
authorities), business, government offices, and others. These included 750 liter metal
collection bins, suitable for use by both side and rear loading vehicles, and 1,100 liter bins
having wheels for transfer from secure collection points to rear loading vehicles and small
plastic or metal residential bins (100-liter and 240-liter) for use by single family
residences. In addition, the subcomponent was to finance procurement of prefabricated
concrete slabs for the nonsecure collection points, designed to facilitate user access, litter
control, and bin washing.

(b)     Collection Vehicles (IBRD) and Support Equipment (EBRD). The subcomponent
would bring the Spetstrans fleet up to 610 collection and support vehicles from 433 by the
end of 1998, allowing for expansion and improved efficiency of services. Most of the new
vehicles were to be three-ton rear and side loading compactors and five-ton dump trucks,
both of which are suitable for service within the city and for hauling of waste to transfer
stations. A number of ten-ton roll-off type container trucks would be introduced to serve
large commercial and industrial users and haul trash to the landfill. In addition, the project
would supply a number of vacuum trucks, service vehicles, bin washing vehicles, and
tractors. To ensure that newer existing vehicles were able to remain in service, the project
included spares for 100 trucks purchased in 1996.

(c)     Vehicle Park Development (EBRD). The project would finance the upgrading of all
existing district service centers plus the development of a central repair workshop for
major repairs. The district centers would provide running maintenance, while the central
facility would be responsible for major maintenance and overhaul of vehicles and landfill
equipment. The central facility would be located at either an existing district service center
or at the Zangiota waste processing facility.

(d)     Landfill Modernization (EBRD). The project would finance the upgrading of the
Akhangaran highway landfill, the city's long-term disposal facility. This would involve
procurement of new bulldozers, landfill compactors, excavators, and support equipment for
maintenance and transport of staff. The project would also support investments to improve
the operation of the landfill, including construction of site maintenance shops and a service
building, upgrading of access roads and utilities, strengthening of capacity for
environmental monitoring, and closing filled-in areas of the landfill while opening new
sections for disposal of waste. The government would be responsible for improving the
turning access from the main four-lane highway to the landfill.

(e)     Landfill Closure (EBRD). The project would finance the equipment and civil
works required to close the Zangiota and Hasanbay landfills in an environmentally-sound
manner, and the strengthening of capacity for long-term environmental monitoring. The
equipment initially acquired for this work would be assigned to the Akhangaran landfill
operation once the other landfills were closed.

(f)     Transfer Stations (IBRD) and Transfer Vehicles (EBRD). The project would
finance four transfer stations, each handling an equal portion of the estimated 1.1 million
tons per year of waste that would be disposed of at the Akhangaran landfill. Each transfer
station, developed on a turnkey basis, would be designed to handle up to 280 incoming

                                               4

vehicles and 30 outgoing vehicles per day. Each facility would employ two fixed
compaction systems that would fill containers of 30 cubic meters. Two containers per trip
would be transported on a flat bed truck and trailer combination. The transfer stations
would be located on the perimeter of the city, each serving roughly a city quadrant and
would be sited for convenient access to the ring road system leading to the Akhangaran
highway. Selection of the sites to be used would be undertaken by the municipality as a
prerequisite to project initiation.

(g)     Biomedical Waste Facilities (EBRD). The project would support the establishment
of an interim biomedical waste facility to allow the separate collection and disposal of
medical waste until a lasting solution is found (medical waste is currently commingled
with other waste at landfills). It would also finance procurement of dedicated vehicles and
containers to be used to collect the waste from generators, and the construction and
operation of a segregated cell to be developed at the Akhangaran landfill for its disposal.

Institutional Support Component (EBRD)

EBRD was to finance on a grant basis technical assistance for project management and
institutional strengthening aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the services following the
end of the project. This would ensure that implementation of the project proceeded in
concert with longer-term system planning and institutional strengthening.

(a)     Project Management Support. During project preparation, it was envisaged that
this subcomponent would support the establishment and operation of two project
implementation units (PIUs), which, with the support of the project management
consultant, would supervise the project's implementation. The central PIU would be
located within the Ministry of Macroeconomics and build on an existing PIU that had a
proven track record in managing Bank projects, including financial management. The
subsidiary PIU, staffed with two professionals, would be located in the solid waste
management department of the municipality. The project would finance procurement of
computer and office equipment, office upgrading, PIU staff costs, and support related to
procurement and disbursement.

(b)     Institutional Strengthening. This subcomponent would support a range of planning
and other technical assistance activities, including the preparation of a strategic plan for the
medium and long-term development of the system. The plan would cover the longer-term
approaches, initiatives, and investments required to maintain services, modernize waste
processing facilities, improve hazardous waste management, and introduce measures to
minimize and recycle waste. It would also provide for the development and
implementation of a modern financial management system, including the necessary
support equipment and training. It would facilitate the corporatization and the ultimate
privatization of Spetstrans, as appropriate. In addition, the subcomponent would provide
direct technical assistance and training related to collection operations, landfill operation
and closure, and design of future landfill expansion. Finally, the subcomponent would
support periodic beneficiary assessments and preparation and implementation of a public
participation and education plan aimed at facilitating public consultations on landfill
design and closure, promoting public participation in strategic planning, and raising public
awareness of the service improvements.

1.6     Revised Components

The components were not revised.

1.7     Other Significant Changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

In response to new information, several elements of the original project design were
changed during project implementation. First, once the project-financed weighbridge
produced more accurate data on how much waste the city actually generated, the
hokimiyat, Spetstrans, and international experts agreed that three rather than four transfer
stations would be sufficient for handling the city's waste. Moreover, the hokimiyat and
Spetstrans were planning for a carbon finance solid waste composting project, which, if
approved, would further reduce the need for a fourth station by reducing the amount of
waste that would go through the transfer stations. Thus the hokimiyat decided not to build
the fourth transfer station. Second, the Zangiota landfill was discovered to be outside of
the city's jurisdiction, and therefore could not be closed by the city. Third, a decision was
made to involve one, rather than two PIUs, in managing the project because of concerns
that decision-making would be unnecessarily complicated with two PIUs. Instead,
capacity of the PIU in the solid waste management department of the municipality would
be strengthened with EBRD-financed technical assistance to enable it to manage all aspects
of the project. All these changes were widely discussed with Bank and country experts,
but were not formally approved by Bank management because they did not affect the
ability of the project to meet its objectives.

The project closing date was extended twice. The first extension to December 31, 2005
was granted to allow completion of procurement of waste collection equipment,
construction of two transfer stations and remaining local works, and achievement of key
institutional reforms through EBRD-financed technical assistance to the hokimiyat and
Spetstrans. The extension was needed due to the one and a half year delay associated with
EBRD's financing of its four technical assistance packages. The second extension to June
30, 2006 was granted to complete procurement of equipment (value of US$6.5 million, or
27 percent of the total loan) purchased out of project cost savings. The vehicles and
equipment (including 100 five-ton collection trucks and 6,000 waste bins) were needed to
improve system efficiency and viability.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigation
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Quality at entry was satisfactory. The project is rated satisfactory overall in each of the
main areas of quality at entry: relevance, design, government ownership, and
appropriateness in relation to implementation capacity. The project was relevant because it
addressed a priority of the municipality and fit well within the CAS, particularly its goal of
improving public sector efficiency. The project was well designed, covering all aspects of
solid waste management from operations (collection, transfer, and disposal) to financial
management, to planning for future expansion and adoption of modern approaches, such as

                                                 6

recycling. The project was designed in close collaboration with the EBRD, which was a
parallel financier. Drawing on lessons of experience with solid waste management
projects in other countries of the former Soviet Union and in countries with levels of
income similar to those of Uzbekistan, the project team (a) identified a consistent
counterpart team with the authority to make implementation decisions, (b) created
mechanisms for interagency coordination, (c) established an implementation unit early and
trained staff in Bank procurement and disbursement procedures, and (d) involved local
institutes in designing the project. In addition, a Bank-supported social assessment
influenced the design of collection points and the technical specifications of bins
(specifically, their height). The social assessment also revealed that people were willing to
pay substantially higher tariffs for improved solid waste collection. This finding was
decisive in ending an impasse with the hokimiyat, which had thought that raising tariffs to
cover costs of services would be politically unacceptable. Such social assessments are
considered good practice under OECD good practice guidelines for evaluation.2 The
project appraisal document noted alternative approaches, the trade-offs between them, and
the rationale for the final decisions. The project incorporated a monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) framework that facilitated project management and supervision. The project
logframe, however, contained far too many indicators, many of which were not readily
monitorable. To compensate for this deficiency, the project appraisal document included a
table of monitoring indicators, with baselines and targets, which, although mainly focused
on outputs rather than outcomes, provided a reasonable framework for monitoring project
implementation performance. The project was classified appropriately as environmental
category B.

Government commitment to the project was strong. The President of Uzbekistan
personally requested the project when he met with the World Bank vice president in
Tashkent in 1996 to discuss the Bank's lending program in the country. The hokimiyat of
Tashkent subsequently demonstrated its commitment with its investments in works,
including improvements in the access road from the highway to the landfill, improvements
to the landfill, construction of nonsecure and secure collection points, establishment of the
central facility for vehicle maintenance and repair, and the closing of the Hasanbay
landfill.

The hokimiyat increased tariffs for services prior to the start of the project as a first step
towards Spetstrans financial self-sufficiency. This action signaled borrower commitment
and reduced project risk. The design of the project was appropriate in relation to the
implementation capacity of the municipality. Designers chose to rely on conventional
landfill and transfer station-based technology for waste management--a technology with
which the Uzbeks were familiar--which simplified implementation. In addition,
considerable preparation took place prior to project effectiveness. For example, all main
bidding documents for goods packages (bins, vehicles, concrete slabs for nonsecure
collection points) were drafted by the time of loan negotiations.

One weakness in the quality at entry was that IBRD proceeded with loan signing
(November 1998) before the EBRD had agreed its project conditionality with the
authorities. Ultimately, the EBRD's agreement included four triggers for disbursement of
80 percent of its US$19.2 million loan, which were not coordinated with those of the

2   See OECD Best Practice Guidelines, 1998, at http://www.oecd.org.

                                                   7

IBRD. The EBRD eventually revised the triggers, but not until significant delays in
procuring goods and technical assistance had occurred.

The project appraisal document realistically appraised the risks the project would face. In
particular, it identified as a risk the lack of sustained political will to increase tariffs and
enforce payment. The document did, however, underestimate this risk as low to medium.
An assessment of the environmental impact of the project identified potential risks and
specified measures to mitigate any negative impacts that could arise from the project. A
thorough appraisal of procurement and financial management arrangements helped to
ensure that resources were used as intended.

Dated covenants included in the loan agreement were appropriate, although too numerous
and with unrealistic deadlines. The borrower complied with all the covenants, although
with some delays. Loan effectiveness conditions--executing a subsidiary loan agreement
on behalf of the Borrower and the hokimiyat of Tashkent, and executing and delivering
EBRD's loan agreement as well as fulfilling all its conditions of effectiveness--were
appropriate. The inclusion of the cross effectiveness condition related to EBRD's loan
agreement ensured that the resources of both loans would be available simultaneously.

2.2     Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, midterm review, project at risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

Implementation was generally satisfactory. All procurement arrangements for the major
World Bank-financed investments were ready by the time of project effectiveness, allowing
procurement to proceed smoothly. Terms of reference for the technical assistance
assignments were also ready. However, EBRD's disbursement conditions led to delays in
the procurement of investments (such as trucks needed to bring waste from the transfer
stations to the main landfill) needed to ensure that the project met its objectives. To
minimize disruptions arising from these delays, all parties agreed to guidelines that were laid
out in the "Working Document to Guide Joint Efforts in the Implementation and Supervision
of the Tashkent Solid Waste Management Project" (July 1999). The World Bank also
included US$4 million unallocated in the project procurement plan that could be used to
cover the cost of the transfer station vehicles in the event EBRD financing would not be
available. Notwithstanding the delays associated with the EBRD conditionality, the financial
resources and technical assistance it provided to the hokimiyat and Spetstrans proved to be
significant in upgrading the city's solid waste management system.

A midterm review prepared in September 2001 helped in addressing key issues that were
slowing progress towards the project's development objectives. For example, by showing
that Spetstrans was not receiving the full revenues being collected through tariffs, it
encouraged the government to thoroughly reform the process of financing solid waste
services, giving Spetstrans direct responsibility for collecting solid waste tariffs. It also led
to adoption of numerous measures for reducing costs and improving the operational
efficiency of the solid waste management system. Several beneficiary assessments informed
the project team of the extent to which the project was meeting people's expectations for


                                                 8

improved waste management services, providing important feedback for improving project
effectiveness.

Implementation arrangements were satisfactory. Although the project team initially
planned to involve two PIUs in implementation, the decision to involve only one situated
at the hokimiyat proved effective.

Estimates of project costs were reasonable, given assumptions about needed system
capacity that were based on Soviet norms. The project design was flexible enough to
allow the savings from the application of international competitive bidding, and funds that
were not needed for transfer stations or other goods and services to be used instead for
vehicles and equipment to replace stock that had reached the end of its useful life. An
assessment of the environmental impact of the project identified potential risks and
specified measures to mitigate any negative impacts that could arise from the project. A
thorough appraisal of procurement and financial management arrangements helped to
ensure that resources were used as intended.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

As discussed in section 6.2, the project documents did not clearly specify a set of key
outcome indicators. The project appraisal document did, however, contain a logframe with
some outcome indicators that the team did track on a periodic basis. These included:

·       Increased public confidence and reduction in complaints
·       Reversal of trends in ad hoc and illegal dumping
·       Regular adjustment of tariffs according to increases in input cost
·       Operation of effective management and accounting systems.

Early during implementation the team added a key outcome indicator to the project's
monitoring framework: proportion of the population satisfied with solid waste collection
services. The team tracked progress with this indicator through periodic household
surveys that were part of comprehensive beneficiary assessments carried out at the
midpoint and completion of the project. The project team used information from the
beneficiary assessments to justify financing a larger number of 1,100 liter bins than
originally planned to serve the larger number of secure collection points built by the city--
both of which were important improvements in the project design. Many other indicators
in the logframe were not readily monitorable and were ignored.

The project appraisal document also contained a separate table of monitoring indicators
with baseline values and targets, most of which focused on outputs rather than outcomes.
The project team reported on progress with these indicators in its semiannual progress
reports and in the project supervision reports (later called implementation supervision
reports). The team and city authorities used the information to address various
implementation issues. For example, noting that the average days of billing for budget
organizations increased dramatically in the later years of project implementation, the
project team raised the issue with hokimiyat officials to understand the reasons and seek a
solution. Although many of the targets are useful, others are not. For example, the targets
for tariffs were not presented in real terms nor adjusted for inflation over time, so do not


                                              9

provide a useful guide for project implementers. A more useful target would have been the
proportion of costs to be covered through tariffs.

In addition to semiannual progress reports, a midterm review that drew on information
from the M&E system proved instrumental in encouraging policy reforms to improve the
operational and financial performance of Spetstrans. The use of the midterm review is
described in greater detail in sections 7.2 and 8.2.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project complied with all safeguard policies, including fiduciary aspects.

An assessment of supervision by the Quality Assurance Group found supervision to be
satisfactory overall, with some areas of concern that were being addressed by the time of
the midterm review.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by present
operation, operation & maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity,
and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

Transition arrangements to regular operations have been completed. The staff of the PIU,
who are civil servants, have been absorbed into the regular operation of government.
Spetstrans will continue operations under the current arrangements. A proposed
Community Benefit Carbon Finance Tashkent Solid Waste Composting Project, if
approved, is expected to reinforce and build on the achievements of the Tashkent Solid
Waste Management Project. The composting project would reduce the amount of
emissions of methane gas, which would make Tashkent eligible for carbon finance
revenues through the World Bank's carbon finance business. These revenues could be
used to expand the composting operation and make further improvements in the city's
solid waste management system.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The project's overall objectives were, and remain, relevant. They reflect the importance
the government and the population of Tashkent assign to improving Tashkent's solid waste
conditions. At the time the project was conceived and prepared, the country had been
independent from the Soviet Union for only six years and the institutions for delivering
urban services were undergoing dramatic transformation. Both the government of
Uzbekistan and the hokimiyat of Tashkent (city administration) considered improving
municipal solid waste management to be a priority to improve the quality of life in the city.
More than half of the respondents in a citywide household survey indicated that they were not
satisfied with their solid waste services and would be willing to pay considerably more for
their collection service if it were improved.




                                                10

The project's objectives also were clearly in line with the concerns of the inhabitants of
Tashkent. As noted in section 6.1 above, more than half the residents surveyed considered
inadequate solid waste collection to be a priority environmental problem, ahead of air
pollution, sanitation, and unsafe drinking water.3 Moreover, the project's objectives also
were consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 1998­2000.

The overall design of the project was appropriate for the country circumstances. The
project focused on upgrading basic solid waste collection and disposal technologies that
are well established and with which the beneficiary was familiar, rather than introducing
expensive high technology approaches.

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in annex 2)

The project met its two project development objectives. Tashkent's solid waste management
system has been restored to a satisfactory level of service, greatly improving the quality of
life in the city. Prior to the project, waste was accumulating in unauthorized piles around
Tashkent and the solid waste management system was nearing collapse. An initial social
assessment indicated that only 30 percent of households surveyed were satisfied with the
waste collection services. A follow-on survey conducted as part of a beneficiary assessment
at midterm review revealed that 70 percent were satisfied. At the end of the project, the
beneficiary assessment showed that 60 percent of respondents overall were satisfied, while
80 percent of those receiving the highest level of service were satisfied. More than 90
percent of the respondents indicated that they are paying for their collection service. The
same percentage also expressed general satisfaction with the accessibility of the collection
points for household waste.

The technical, financial, and institutional basis for the future operation and development of
solid waste services in Tashkent has been improved. The technical basis of Tashkent's
solid waste management services has been enhanced through the provision and operation
of modern vehicles, bins, and transfer stations and through upgrades in infrastructure and
facilities at the city's main landfill. The institutional and financial basis of the system has
been thoroughly transformed with the support of the project. Under the Decision of the
Tashkent City Hokim 596, on improvement of the solid waste management structure,
issued on December 26, 2001, the hokimiyat:

·     Abolished Tashkent's Sanitary Cleaning Board and its ten ordering departments
      (excluding the ordering department in the Yunusabad district). Spetstrans was made
      responsible for collecting solid waste tariffs and depositing them into one centralized
      bank account.
·     Transferred all equipment procured with IBRD and EBRD funding to the Tashkent
      Territorial Association of Communal Utilities and Spetstrans on the basis of a
      restructured on-lending agreement.

·      Restructured the financial agreement, with Spetstrans being made responsible only
       for repaying the loan principal at the fixed currency exchange rate set at the date of
       equipment transfer, rather than for the entire loan principal and interest at the market
       exchange rate. The hokimiyat was made responsible for bearing the foreign
       exchange risk as well as interest and expenses related to the loan.
·      Directed the Sanitary Cleaning Board and raion ordering departments to pay all
       amounts due to Spetstrans from tariff revenues, together with late penalties and other
       compensation for payment arrears.
·      Endorsed Spetstrans's adoption of a uniform tariff for industrial, commercial, budget,
       and communal clients in all districts of Tashkent.
·      Authorized Spetstrans to propose increases in the tariff up to 8 percent per year for
       solid waste services. The local authorities did, however, retain the right to approve
       any tariff increases that Spetstrans proposed.

These reforms have been instrumental in increasing the reliability, frequency, coverage,
and efficiency of solid waste management services in Tashkent. They have also helped to
create the basis for placing Spetstrans on a sounder financial footing than previously,
helping to ensure their sustainability once the project ends. One concern, however, is the
unwillingness of the municipality in recent years to approve proposed tariff increases. The
tariff has not been adjusted to reflect inflation since 2003 despite efforts by both the IBRD
and EBRD to convince the hokimiyat of the need for an increase (the real value of the
tariff eroded from 250 sum at the beginning of 2003 to 169 sum by the end of 2005). This
has not yet caused financial difficulties for Spetstrans due to its success in increasing
system efficiency and due to the financial relief it has received from the hokimiyat through
exemptions of leasing fees and of release of responsibility for payment of principal and
interest and other expenses related to the loan. However, the continued delivery of quality
services in the future will require either increases in tariffs or other sources of revenue,
such as budgetary allocations. The hokimiyat is aware of the challenges and has issued a
letter to the IBRD laying out its plans to ensure that Spetstrans is able to mobilize
sufficient resources to maintain adequate services in the future.

3.3     Efficiency
(Net present value/economic rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost, and
comparisons; and financial rate of return)

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

Given project investment costs of US$43.23 million, Spetstrans's actual financial
performance since 2000, net transfers from the government for debt service on the loans
from IBRD and EBRD, and projections of a 10 percent real increase in revenue in 2007,
the project has a net present value of US$1.1 million (assuming a discount rate of 10
percent), and an internal rate of return of 11.4 percent. The company has submitted a
request to the hokimiyat for a rate increase to take effect in 2007. The key assumptions of
the analysis are: (a) the capital costs are incurred between 2000 and 2006; (b) the lifetime
of the project is 10 years, starting in 2000; (c) the real annual revenues of the utility rise by
10 percent in 2007 and are constant thereafter; (d) resources to service the IBRD and
EBRD project loans come from government transfers rather than from internally generated
funds, and (e) total operations and maintenance costs remain constant in real terms
between 2006 and 2010. More on the analysis appears in annex 4.

                                                12

In addition to a collection service that households directly perceive and are willing to pay
for, improved collection and safe disposal of solid waste provides important environmental
benefits that people in general do not directly identify and are therefore not necessarily
willing to pay for. For example, sound disposal practices prevent contamination of ground
water, help people avoid contact with hazardous waste, and discourage burning of trash,
which itself creates health risks. These benefits cannot be readily calculated, but certainly
add to the overall benefits of the project. Payment for these services--pure public goods--
is in many countries made through provision of public subsidies, rather than through tariff
collection.

Although the project generates a lower net present value than estimated at appraisal
(US$3.6 million), the without project scenario would have been worse. The city's solid
waste management services were collapsing at the time of the intervention of the World
Bank and the EBRD, and investment in equipment, operations and maintenance, and
landfill construction was imperative. What would have happened without the support of
the two Banks can only be speculated. What is certain, however, is that thanks to their
financial resources and expertise the city was able to acquire collection vehicles at much
lower cost than expected (due to the introduction of international competitive bidding), the
city's vehicle fleet operates much more efficiently than in the past (due to the construction
of transfer stations and introduction of software to establish more efficient collection
routes), billing systems are more effective (due to the company's adoption of modern
financial management practices), and operations and maintenance costs have fallen (due to
the introduction of new vehicles and equipment). Moreover, the city's overflowing
unregulated waste dump has been closed and no longer poses a hazard to its neighbors,
while an upgraded landfill located in an area with no residents living in the immediate
vicinity (the residential area nearest to the landfill is more than 4 kilometers away) operates
in an environmentally safe manner.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

Spetstrans has earned a net profit in only one of six years during 2000­05. However, it has
earned an operating profit in three of the six years, and has improved its performance
steadily since 2002. (Operating earnings represent the profit that Spetstrans generated
through its main operations, before interest and taxes. Operating earnings is arguably the
best measure of a company's true performance.) Spetstrans has also consistently generated
positive cash flows from its core operations, resources it is using to fund operations and
maintenance, and a contribution for equipment replacement. A table with details of the
financial analysis is presented in annex 4.

These results are encouraging in light of the municipality's reluctance to approve increases
in tariffs for solid waste collection (which account for 88 percent of Spetstrans's revenues),
despite increases in fuel and other costs. Spetstrans's reasonably good performance is due
to two factors. The first is that the company has been able to improve its tariff collection
performance (the average days of billing fell significantly for residences and industrial
organizations from 2001­05, see section F in Data Sheet), and therefore to mobilize higher
revenues than would otherwise have been the case. The second is that the company has
been able to contain its costs by operating its vehicle fleet more efficiently. However, its
ability to generate an operating profit in the future without increases in tariffs or other

                                                13

sources of revenue will become increasingly challenging, especially if oil prices remain
high. Moreover, the utility will eventually need to replace its vehicles and other operating
assets, which will require additional funds. The World Bank is now preparing a carbon
finance project that is expected to generate adequate revenues to enable the utility to
finance its operations and a significant share of its equipment replacement costs through
2015. The Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement is scheduled to be signed in 2007.

3.4      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

 Rating       S

Achievement of the objectives of the project is rated satisfactory. The project objectives
were and remain relevant. The project design is also appropriate for Tashkent. The project
achieved its two development objectives, although with some delays that were linked
largely to a lack of congruence between the approach of the World Bank and that of the
EBRD. Although the net present value of the project is lower than estimated at appraisal,
due to the reluctance of the authorities to raise tariffs on residence customers, the cost per
ton of Tashkent's solid waste management system is quite low by international standards.
Satisfactory performance along all three parameters justifies an overall outcome rating of
satisfactory for the project.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

None.

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Taking into account concerns raised during the social assessment, the project team closely
monitored the social aspects of the project during implementation to identify any emerging
adverse social impacts and to recommend measures to help mitigate them. One important
issue that became obvious during the upgrading of the solid waste management system was
the need to provide safe working conditions for waste pickers, and to ensure that the
project improvements did not negatively affect their livelihoods. Although at the time of
project preparation few waste pickers were working at landfills, their numbers rose
substantially during project implementation as economic conditions in the country
deteriorated and unemployment increased. Shortly after the project became effective,
Spetstrans's recycling subsidiary hired approximately 80 waste pickers to recover plastic,
paper, and other recyclables at the main landfill, paying them for the materials they
collected according to its value. The company later provided the waste pickers with gloves
and protective clothing. However, when the transfer stations started operating, and the
company restricted access to the landfill as a result, many of the pickers found alternative
means for earning income. Some found jobs at an adjacent recycling center, while others
continued searching for recyclables at the collection points in the city, or took construction
jobs with Spetstrans or other enterprises carrying out project-related construction work.
Some of the pickers were able to earn a living operating a secure collection point. An
additional outcome of the project was the creation of over 1,000 new jobs. The PIU
reports that 950 people are employed at the secure collection points and another 80 at the
transfer stations--jobs that did not exist prior to the project. Finally, the construction of

                                                14

the secured collection points led to the development of several recycling enterprises.
These include enterprises producing roofing tiles, toilet paper, material for upholstered
furniture (from the stuffing of old mattresses and other material), material from plastic
bottles for coat linings, blankets, and pillows, and slats for wooden crates from tree
cuttings.

The project promoted the use of social assessments and public consultations to seek
feedback on project design issues. This helped to change the relationship of the state to its
citizens. See more on this in the section immediately below on institutional change.

(b)     Institutional change/strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development)

The project helped bring about important institutional reform. It contributed to the
transformation of a nearly collapsed system of solid waste management to a reliable and
efficient operation. Indeed, Tashkent's system is now serving as a model for other
countries in the region; officials from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have visited Tashkent to
learn from its experience. To bring about this transformation, the project supported a
number of key reforms. Among the most important are:

·       Making Spetstrans an independent legal entity in 2002, with its own income
        statement, balance sheet, and bank account. Operating independently has
        encouraged the company to be much more efficient in providing services. For
        example, it optimized the waste collection system using computer models,
        introduced a modern computer-based accounting system (although some
        weaknesses remain), and implemented an effective system for collecting tariffs.

·       Making Spetstrans responsible for collecting tariff revenue, rather than the
        Sanitary Cleaning Board and the raion ordering departments. Prior to this change,
        the district hokimiyats were using the funds for purposes other than solid waste
        management, undermining the financial viability of the service provider. Once
        Spetstrans assumed responsibility for revenue collection, its financial position
        improved dramatically, enabling it to provide a high level of service. However, to
        maintain a satisfactory level of service, tariffs will have to be increased periodically
        in line with inflation.

·       Incorporating competitive bidding practices into its general procurement of goods
        and services. Both the hokimiyat and Spetstrans were convinced of the significant
        benefits of this practice through experience with international competitive bidding
        under the project, which resulted in savings of over US$4 million on vehicles
        compared with the estimate at appraisal.

·       Consulting with the public and responding to public concerns. This helped in not
        only designing a waste management system that meets public needs, but also in
        changing to some extent the nature of the relationship between the government and
        citizens. For example, the use of consumer satisfaction surveys introduced a new
        outlook for the service provider, and helped in the transition away from a focus on
        Soviet norms to one on citizens' views. The hokimiyat saw the value of public
        consultations in dealing with issues related to willingness to pay and system design

                                                15

        (such as siting of transfer stations and design of collection points), and is likely to
        seek such consultations in the future.

·       Using an M&E system for planning, accountability, and learning. The staff of the
        PIU now regard indicator reporting as an important tool for project planning, for
        establishing accountability in project management, and for providing the feedback
        necessary for improving project effectiveness. Based on this positive experience,
        the municipal authorities are expected to introduce the practice into other areas of
        municipal management.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative)

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for core ICR, details in annexes)

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

 Rating        M

The risk to development outcome is rated moderate.

The hokimiyat was fully committed to the project. Although it has not approved increases
in tariffs, it has worked to ensure that Spetstrans has adequate resources to provide quality
services. Few other IBRD-supported projects in Uzbekistan have enjoyed this level of
commitment from the responsible government entities. Moreover, the design of the system
is appropriate to local conditions, so the costs of operating, maintaining, and expanding the
system are not high relative to Tashkent's municipal resources.

One concern is the failure since 2003 of the hokimiyat to approve increases in tariffs for
residential users, on the grounds that this action would meet with resistance from the
public. The failure of the hokimiyat to raise these tariffs in line with inflation will not
necessarily undermine the financial sustainability of service provision, as long as adequate
funds for operations and investment can be raised through other means. Currently,
Spetstrans collects rental fees from the operators of secured collection points who resell
items left for disposal. Spetstrans may also benefit from a proposed composting project
that is expected to generate an estimated US$4 million of carbon finance by 2015, if
approved. A letter to IBRD from the hokimiyat dated June 14, 2006 lays out the means by
which adequate financing of services will be ensured.

Benefits of investments in capacity building and institutional strengthening are likely to be
sustained. Computerization of accounting and service routing, improved tariff collection,
and enhanced management practices (such as through use of an M&E system) have led to
greater efficiency in service provision. Spetstrans is fully cognizant of the benefits, and is
likely to sustain them.

Environmental benefits are also likely to be sustained. The closure of one of the city's
unsanitary landfills and the modernization of its main landfill have substantially reduced
the risks of environmental contamination due to disposal of solid waste. The landfill
operators have been fully trained to operate the facility safely and in accord with


                                               16

regulations. Records of inspections indicate few violations of regulations. One aspect
requiring attention is the need to introduce better monitoring of the waste being disposed
of at the landfill to ensure that hazardous waste does not enter the disposal site. However,
the planned Community Development Carbon Finance Tashkent Solid Waste Composting
is expected to result in further improvements at the landfill that will involve improved
monitoring of waste entering the landfill.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)

 Rating       S

The Bank's overall performance in ensuring quality at entry was satisfactory. The Bank's
performance in identification was satisfactory. Improving solid waste management in
Tashkent was a priority for the central and local governments to improve the quality of life
in Uzbekistan's capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 2.2 million.
The hokimiyat and municipal solid waste authorities led the process of designing the
project, in close collaboration with the World Bank and the EBRD. The project design
incorporated lessons learned from experience in Uzbekistan and from other countries of the
former Soviet Union and elsewhere in the world. It also reflected the findings of a social
assessment that showed concern of inhabitants with the poor state of their solid waste
management services and their willingness to pay considerably higher tariffs for services
than had previously been expected.

The Bank's performance in preparation and appraisal was satisfactory. An economic
analysis was prepared. A comprehensive M&E framework was formulated. Although its
outcome indicators are not well specified, the project appraisal document contained a set of
appropriate quantitative indicators and targets aimed at tracking progress with
implementation.

Preparation was made more complicated due to the decision to enter into a parallel
financing arrangement with the EBRD, which was able to secure grant funds from the
European Union to finance technical assistance, but conditioned disbursement of 80
percent of its loan on the hokimiyat's meeting triggers that proved to be difficult to meet.
The Bank should have considered an alternative project design that would have made it
less dependent on the EBRD's funding decisions.

Appraisal of implementation arrangements was satisfactory. The project team recognized
the importance of involving a PIU with the ability to comply with the World Bank's
procurement procedures and other fiduciary requirements, and ultimately supported a PIU
situated in the hokimiyat with the necessary technical assistance. Estimates of project
costs were reasonable, given available data of needed capacity. The project design was
flexible enough to allow funds not needed for originally specified purposes to be used for
other priorities. Assessments of environmental, social, and fiduciary risks helped in
highlighting issues that required special attention during project implementation.

(b)     Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

 Rating      S

Bank performance in supervision was satisfactory. The Bank fielded 12 supervision
missions during the project's seven years of implementation. Missions generally took place
two times a year. Missions lasted about two weeks each and typically comprised three or
more members, including foreign and local consultants investigating a wide range of
technical and operational issues. During the first three years of project implementation, the
Bank's supervision missions coincided with those of the EBRD. As indicated in the
"Working Document," the World Bank led supervision of the technical aspects of the
project, and the EBRD led supervision of its financial aspects. In practice, the World Bank
focused on all aspects of project implementation, particularly in recent years.

During the early years, supervision missions focused primarily on issues of project
management, procurement, financial management, reporting, and PIU staffing. They also
paid attention to the plight of the growing number of waste pickers in Tashkent, and on ways
to ensure that the project would not have a negative impact on their livelihoods. Later
missions paid increasing attention to institutional issues identified in the reports of the
EBRD-financed technical advisors, including system optimization and financial
sustainability, completion of transfer stations under the turnkey contract, and completion of
local construction works to comply with loan covenants. The midterm review focused on
issues of financial sustainability, which led to significant reforms in the financing of solid
waste services and to the adoption of numerous measures for reducing costs and improving
the operational efficiency of the solid waste management system. Several beneficiary
assessments informed the project team of the extent to which the project was meeting
people's expectations for improved waste management services, providing important
information used in adjusting the project design.

Bank supervision reports were detailed and regularly reported on trends in monitoring
indicators. The World Bank's Eastern and Central Asia Region and its Middle East and
North Africa Region have used the project's supervision reports as models in their training
programs. However, targets should have been adjusted periodically to reflect new
knowledge and changing country circumstances. For example the target for tariff increases
should have been modified to reflect inflation (or specified in real, rather than nominal
terms). In addition, some of the physical targets should have been amended to reflect new
information on required system capacity, so that actual performance would not be
measured against unrealistic targets.

A Quality Assurance Group review of supervision conducted just after the midterm review
found supervision to be satisfactory overall. The review also highlighted concerns about
the financial sustainability of city's municipal solid waste management system, due to
problems at that time with Spetstrans receiving the funds it needed to operate satisfactorily.
These problems were subsequently addressed. The progress was noted in a Country
Portfolio Performance Review conducted in July 2004 that cited the project as one of the
two top performing projects in Uzbekistan. The review mentioned several aspects of the
project as being especially important to its success: the effective use of social assessment
in a range of project design issues and the substantial involvement of stakeholders in both

preparation of the project and design of aspects of the solid waste management system. An
assessment of monitoring and evaluation of projects in the Bank's Uzbekistan portfolio
carried out in August 2006, commended the project's M&E system and its regular
reporting on indicators.

The project development outcome and implementation was rated satisfactory at all times
during implementation. A midterm review carried out in September 2001 resulted in
improved implementation and faster disbursement, but no fundamental changes in project
design.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

 Rating      S

The Bank's overall performance was satisfactory. In lending, the Bank responded to the
government's request for assistance in improving Tashkent's solid waste management
services, drawing on the lessons of experiences in Uzbekistan and in other countries. It
also drew effectively on the expertise and resources of the EBRD to design and implement
a project that fit local capacities and needs. Supervision was thorough. The World Bank
team responded flexibly to challenges and adapted readily to new information.

The dedicated oversight of the World Bank's task team leader was instrumental in keeping
implementation of the project on track, despite delays in provision of complementary
inputs to the project by both the EBRD and the hokimiyat. Her depth of knowledge of the
technical and social issues of solid waste management was also essential to success. The
expertise and dedication of other members of the project team, including those located in
the country office, was also critical to success. Finally, the continuity of the task team
leader and of team members, particularly those located in Tashkent, was essential in
maintaining a close dialogue with the government project team and contributed to the
quality of the project.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a)     Government Performance

 Rating      MS

The government's performance in implementation was moderately satisfactory. The
hokimiyat maintained its good relationship with the Bank throughout implementation.
Although the hokimiyat constructed the nonsecure and secure collection points in a timely
manner, it was not able to prepare the sites for the transfer stations on schedule, leading to
delays in overall project implementation. Although not common practice in Uzbekistan, the
hokimiyat for the first time held public consultations on a siting decision (for the transfer
stations) and incorporated the findings of the periodic beneficiary assessments into their
decisions on the design of the waste collection system. The siting of the transfer stations, the
innovative concept of secured collection points, and the closure of the Hasanbay landfill all
depended critically on stakeholder participation. However, despite the recommendations of
the World Bank and the EBRD, the hokimiyat has not permitted Spetstrans to raise tariffs for
residential consumers since 2003. Although this has not yet led to a decline in services,


                                                19

Spetstrans will not be able to make the capital investments necessary to maintain services in
the future without additional revenues, whether from increased tariffs, budgetary allocations,
or other sources.

(b)     Implementing Agency Performance

 Rating       S

 Spetstrans (service provider)                                S

The performance of the implementing agencies was satisfactory. The hokimiyat's PIU
staff was highly effective in implementing the project in full compliance with the Bank's
fiduciary and environmental and social safeguard polices. They managed technical and
administrative matters in a highly competent manner. With a sanitation engineer as head
of the PIU, the staff paid considerable attention to technical matters. The DHV
management consultant provided valuable training during the early years in project
management on the fiduciary and other policies of the World Bank and the EBRD.
Spetstrans also performed satisfactorily. However, the quality of Spetstrans's financial
reporting, although improving throughout the project period, still needs to be enhanced to
address weaknesses mentioned in several audit reports relating to the need to (a) fully meet
International Accounting Standards, particularly those relating to the need to verify its
inventories and to prepare both consolidated and separate financial statements; (b) improve
its internal controls in sales and revenue management; and (c) improve its calculation of
write-offs of inventories. These weaknesses were not considered significant enough to
result in an unsatisfactory rating for the project's financial management. The Bank also
recognized that the company was not able to fully meet all expectations largely due to the
inability of the EBRD to deliver planned technical assistance aimed at increasing capacity
of Spetstrans for financial reporting and management.


(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

 Rating       S

The overall performance of the borrower was satisfactory. The government demonstrated its
commitment to the broad objectives of the project and its approach from identification to
completion, and met its counterpart funding obligations. The implementing agency
performed very well. It handled procurement and financial management in accordance with
Bank guidelines. It also ensured compliance with the Bank's environmental and social
safeguard policies.

6.      Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

In projects involving parallel financiers, agreement on realistic project conditionality
is essential for smooth implementation. The EBRD included triggers for disbursing 80
percent of its loan. These were impossible to meet and delayed implementation of EBRD-
supported activities until the triggers could be revised. To avoid similar situations in the

                                                20

future, all financing partners should agree on project conditionality prior to Board
approval. In the absence of agreement, a project should be designed in such a way that any
delays or complete withdrawals of funding from any one financing partner does not disrupt
project implementation or force fundamental changes in its design.

Use of social and beneficiary assessments can improve project design and facilitate
monitoring and supervision. The initial social assessment carried out during project
preparation showed that inhabitants would be willing to pay four times what they had been
paying for an improved solid waste collection service. This finding convinced the
hokimiyat that mobilizing additional funding from beneficiaries of services was feasible.
The findings also persuaded the authorities to close an in-city landfill and to design
collection points that were more accessible to children and the elderly. Beneficiary
assessments carried out during project implementation allowed the project team to track
changes in user satisfaction with the services, and to adjust the project design to better
meet expectations. The beneficiary assessments were also used for informing technical
decisions (for example, the decision to build more secure collection points and fewer
nonsecure collection points). To be useful, beneficiary assessments must be well designed.
Key to success are (a) pairing a local social scientist with an international social
development specialist to provide quality assurance, and (b) conducting a baseline survey
and periodic follow-up surveys (such as at project midterm and closing) to track changes in
attitudes of beneficiaries to improvements in services.

Well designed monitoring and evaluation systems can be invaluable in managing
projects for results. The government in collaboration with the Bank designed a project
monitoring system that included quantifiable indicators and a clear plan for tracking and
reporting on them. The PIU reported on progress with the indicators every six months,
which allowed the hokimiyat authorities, Spetstrans, and the Bank teams to quickly spot
emerging problems and raise the issues with the authorities or Spetstrans as necessary to
try to resolve them. Periodic beneficiary assessments and targeted surveys, carried out by
local social science firms, helped ensure that the project responded to the demands of
Tashkent inhabitants. For example, when the surveys showed that secured collection
points were popular with residents, project managers agreed to finance additional rolling
bins to service them.

In situations where information is uncertain (such as quantities of municipal solid
waste generated), taking a phased approach to project implementation can help in
adapting the project once better information becomes available. The first phase could
finance urgently needed equipment, studies to produce accurate information to underpin
the investment, preparation of a strategic municipal solid waste management plan, and a
second phase investment plan. Once the studies, strategic plan, and second phase
investment plan are finalized, the project would finance the remaining investments.

Overburdening the municipality with large counterpart obligations can unnecessarily
slow project implementation. Requiring the hokimiyat to meet a counterpart obligation
of US$11 million (appraisal estimate) significantly slowed project implementation because
the hokimiyat found it difficult to mobilize the funds. The Bank should have recognized
that the hokimiyat was already devoting considerable resources by agreeing to borrow for
solid waste management in addition to its meeting many other demands. Insisting that it


                                              21

devote even more of its scarce resources to solid waste management strained city resources
and delayed project implementation.

Supporting the PIU with international project management expertise can help the
government develop the skills needed for successful project management. The
consultants who worked with the PIU provided invaluable hands-on training and assistance
to PIU staff during the first three years of the project, first as full time advisors and then
through site visits every three months. Midway through the consultant assignment, the
PIU staff was fully competent to take over the responsibility for implementing the project.
The experience showed that having international advisors work in the offices of the project
managers can be effective in transferring skills and knowledge. The consultants who
visited the PIU on a periodic basis proved to be considerably less effective and never
established a close working relationship with the staff.

Notes:
1.   The planned equipment was not purchased as a result of the cancellation of EBRD's final procurement.
2.   The original targets for amount of waste to be collected and delivered were based on Soviet-era norms,
as the actual amount of waste being collected at the start of the project was not known.
3.   The original target for waste delivered to landfills was lower than the baseline, because it was assumed a
large proportion of waste would be delivered to transfer stations instead.

Annex 3: Outputs by Component

Component 1: Investment

The outputs of this component are satisfactory.

·     Collection Infrastructure. All of the planned 13,345 collection bins were
      purchased and deployed. Using savings resulting from the use of international
      competitive bidding, the hokimiyat purchased an additional 5,950 bins to equip
      both nonsecure and secure collection points. In addition, the hokimiyat and
      Spetstrans used their own resources to construct 750 nonsecure collection points
      and 400 secure collection points. Based on the 2005 beneficiary assessment, 90
      percent of the residents are now satisfied with the accessibility of collection points.
      The successful implementation of this component also resulted in the closing of the
      unsightly and unsanitary garbage chutes in multifamily apartment buildings,
      reduction in public complaints about poor service, and a substantial decline in the
      incidence of illegal dumping, according to the hokimiyat authorities.

      The construction of the secured collection points led to the development of several
      recycling enterprises. These include enterprises producing roofing tiles, toilet
      paper, material for upholstered furniture (from the stuffing of old mattresses and
      other material), material from plastic bottles for coat linings, blankets, and pillows,
      and slats for wooden crates from tree cuttings.

·     Collection Vehicles and Support Equipment. All of the 140 collection vehicles,
      including 100 side-loading, 23 rear-loading, and 17 10-ton roll-off vehicles, as
      originally planned, were purchased under the IBRD loan. Using savings resulting
      from the use of international competitive bidding practices, the hokimiyat
      purchased an additional 50 side-loading and 50 rear-loading collection vehicles to
      replace equipment that were reaching the end of their service life.

·     Vehicle Park Development. A central repair facility was constructed, which is fully
      operational and servicing about 250 vehicles belonging to Spetstrans and the
      Yunosabad garage per month. The facility is also servicing compactors from other
      cities on a commercial basis. In addition, all large vehicles now undergo scheduled
      maintenance every 5,000, 15,000, or 45,000 kilometers, depending on the type of
      vehicle. Such regular maintenance will extend the service life of the vehicles.

·     Landfill Modernization. The hokimiyat upgraded landfill infrastructure and
      practices by (a) improving vehicle access to the landfill, (b) building a fence around
      the landfill to prevent unauthorized entry and dumping of waste, (c) closing the
      filled-in segment of the main landfill, (d) improving unloading pads and lighting,
      (e) covering the landfill, (f) organizing recycling activities, and (g) completing a
      staff building, vehicle storage facility, equipment washing facility, and repair
      workshop. It also constructed a weighbridge and a small control building at the
      landfill to track the quantity of waste collected, which is essential information for
      effective system management and capacity planning.


                                             27

·       Landfill Closure. One landfill, Hasanbay, was closed and the site covered with
        construction waste. Spetstrans also fenced off the landfill, constructed a guard
        house, and is providing a guard 24 hours a day to prevent vehicles and residents
        from entering the territory of the landfill. Although the site does not pose a threat
        to the adjacent residential areas, the guard is posted to ensure that the site is not
        used for any type of development. Although a second landfill, Zangiota, was
        initially expected to be closed, it was determined to be outside the jurisdiction of
        Tashkent, and therefore outside the scope of the project. Nonetheless, Spetstrans
        stopped using the site and closed the portion it had been using.

·       Transfer Stations (IBRD) and Transfer Vehicles (EBRD). Three out of the four
        planned transfer stations were completed and put into operation. The
        commissioning of the three stations has allowed Spetstrans to optimize the use of
        available waste compactors, and save an average of US$298,000 per year on
        operations and maintenance. The hokimiyat decided not to construct the fourth
        transfer station during the project implementation period for several reasons. First,
        and most important, data from the new weighbridge revealed that the city was
        generating a smaller quantity of waste than had been estimated and that three
        transfer stations would be sufficient to handle the waste. Second, the proposed
        Community Development Carbon Finance Tashkent Solid Waste Composting
        Project, if approved, would ultimately reduce the amount of waste that would need
        to pass through the transfer stations. Third, the hokimiyat could not reach
        agreement with the contractor on a contract amendment that was needed to modify
        the siting, configuration, and timing of the construction of the fourth transfer
        station. The project purchased and deployed all 32 transfer station vehicles
        financed by the EBRD.

·       Biomedical Waste Facilities (EBRD). Biomedical waste bins and vehicles were not
        acquired under EBRD finance, as expected. The loan closed before the government
        procured the equipment. Instead, the hokimiyat plans to procure the equipment,
        construct a separate biomedical cell at the landfill, and provide related staff training
        using its own financial resources.

Institutional Support Component

The outputs of this component are satisfactory.

·       Project Management Support. The project management consulting services
        financed by a grant from the EBRD effectively provided training and hands-on
        assistance to the PIU to build its capacity in procurement, financial management,
        and other aspects of project management. By midterm the PIU was fully able to
        carry out all project management responsibilities in a timely and efficient manner,
        allowing the consultant to leave the full-time position, and provide backstopping
        through periodic visits.

·       Institutional Strengthening. Under EBRD-financed technical assistance, Spetstrans
        developed a strategic municipal solid waste management plan that specifies
        measures required to optimize the system and identifies options for its future


                                               28

   development, including measures to improve hazardous waste management,
   encourage waste minimization, and initiate a recycling program. The technical
   assistance facilitated Spetstrans's corporatization in 2002, through which it became
   an independent legal entity with its own income statement and balance sheet, and
   its own bank account in local currency. It also helped Spetstrans to greatly improve
   management of services by helping it to improve its utility accounting and
   management information system and by introducing a computerized billing and
   tariff collection system. The company is collecting 90 percent of billed residential
   tariffs. Moreover the average number of days with bills overdue has dropped from
   90 days in 1998 to less than 60 in 2005 for industrial and commercial users and to
   less than 30 for residences. However, the average days of billing for government
   institutions has risen to 160 days. Spetstrans is now covering all of its costs of
   operations and maintenance and part of its equipment replacement costs, consistent
   with expectations at appraisal. With technical assistance, the hokimiyat took a
   major step in 2005 to introduce private sector participation into the municipal solid
   waste system by privatizing one of Spetstrans's ten district garages. The company
   now operates on the basis of a service contract with Spetstrans and subleases solid
   waste collection equipment and facilities. The experience will be evaluated at the
   end of the year to see if it would be feasible to privatize at least another two district
   garages in 2007, and its remaining garages during subsequent years. In addition,
   Spetstrans is leasing 280 out of 395 secure waste collection points to private
   operators, who recover their costs through sale of waste materials delivered to the
   collection point.

·  The hokimiyat led public consultations during critical stages of implementation to
   seek the input of the residents. In some cases, these consultations led to changes in
   the original plans; a notable example is the decision not to use one of the planned
   transfer station sites. According to the State Committee for Nature Protection, this
   was the first time that Tashkent residents played a significant role in a decision
   regarding the selection of the site of a public facility. The hokimiyat also required
   the transfer station contractor to hold public meetings on each of the transfer station
   sites. In addition, the hokimiyat, with assistance from the institutional
   strengthening consultants, carried out social surveys to obtain information on
   public reaction to the improvements in the system. On the basis of the
   recommendations of the landfill engineering consultants, Spetstrans upgraded its
   operations at the main landfill at Akhangaran through reconstruction, purchase of
   new vehicles and equipment, and the installation of a weighbridge with computer
   equipment. Finally, the technical assistance helped the PIU establish an M&E
   framework, which it used to regularly monitor project implementation progress.
   Staff of the PIU now regard indicator reporting as normal for planning,
   accountability, and learning.

Annex 4: Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic analysis

Given project investment costs of US$43.23 million, Spetstrans's actual financial
performance since 2000, net transfers from the government for debt service on the loans
from IBRD and EBRD, and projections of a 10 percent real increase in revenue in 2007,
the project has a net present value of US$1.1 million, assuming a discount rate of 10
percent, and an internal rate of return of 11.4 percent. The company has submitted a
request to the hokimiyat for a rate increase to take effect in 2007. The key assumptions of
the analysis are: (a) the capital costs are incurred between 2000 and 2006; (b) the lifetime
of the project is 10 years, starting in 2000; (c) the real annual revenues of the utility rise by
10 percent in 2007 and are constant thereafter; (d) resources to service the IBRD and
EBRD project loans come from government transfers rather than from internally generated
funds, and (e) the total operations and maintenance costs remain constant in real terms
between 2006 and 2010.

The table below compares the current estimates of net present value and internal rate of
return for the project compared with the estimates made at the time of project appraisal.

                                          Current estimates                     Appraisal estimate
Net present value                              1.1 million                            3.6 million
Internal rate of return                       11.6 percent                           13.2 percent

In addition to a collection service that households directly benefit from and are willing to
pay for, improved collection and safe disposal of solid waste provides important
environmental benefits that people in general do not directly identify and are therefore not
willing to pay for. For example, sound disposal practices prevent contamination of ground
water, help people avoid contact with hazardous waste, and discourage burning of trash,
which itself creates health risks. These benefits cannot be readily calculated, but certainly
add to the overall benefits of the project.4 Payment for these services--pure public
goods--is in many countries made through provision of public subsidies, rather than
through tariff collection.

Although the project generates a lower net present value than estimated at appraisal, the
without project scenario would have been worse. The city's solid waste management
services were collapsing at the time of the intervention of the World Bank and the EBRD,
and investment in equipment, operations and maintenance, and landfill reconstruction was
imperative. What would have happened without the support of the two Banks can only be
speculated. What is certain, however, is that thanks to their financial resources and
expertise the city was able to acquire collection vehicles at much lower cost than expected
(due to the introduction of international competitive bidding), the city's vehicle fleet
operates much more efficiently than in the past (due to the construction of transfer stations

4   Environmental benefits were estimated at appraisal on the basis of the people's responses to surveys on
willingness to pay. However, the surveys do not distinguish between people's willingness to pay for
environmental improvements versus enhanced services. This report does not attempt to quantify the value of
the environmental benefits.

and introduction of software to establish more efficient collection routes), billing systems
are more effective (due to the company's adoption of modern financial management
practices), and operations and maintenance costs have fallen (due to the introduction of
new vehicles and equipment). Moreover, the city's overflowing unregulated waste dump
has been closed and no longer poses a hazard to its neighbors, while an upgraded landfill
located in an area with no nearby residents operates in an environmentally safe manner.

SPETSTRANS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, 2000­2005

Spetstrans has earned a net profit in only one of six years during 2000­05. However, it has
earned an operating profit in three of the six years, and has improved its performance
steadily since 2002. (Operating earnings represent the profit that Spetstrans generated
through its main operations, before interest and taxes. Operating earnings is arguably the
best measure of a company's true performance.) Spetstrans has also consistently generated

                                                        32

positive cash flows from its core operations, resources it is using to fund operations and
maintenance, debt service requirements, and a contribution for equipment replacement.

Spetstrans financial ratios reveal its performance over time and provide an indication of its
profitability, liquidity, and leverage. As the first three indicators in the table above show,
Spetstrans' ability to earn a profit has been improving over time. Its operating margin (the
amount Spetstrans earns from its primary business), while low, has been improving since
2002 and turned positive in 2004. However, net income in relation to revenues, which
measures how much Spetstrans keeps of its total revenue, remains negative, in part due to
payment of income taxes. The company's return on assets, although negative in all but one
year during 2000­05, has generally improved over time.

Spetstrans's liquidity position is satisfactory. Its current ratio of greater than one signifies
that it can meet its near term obligations with its short term assets. Spetstrans also has a
very modest debt to equity ratio, so should have little trouble meeting its obligations to
debt holders despite its low profitability.

These results are encouraging in light of the municipality's reluctance to approve increases
in tariffs for solid waste collection. Spetstrans's reasonably good performance is due to
two factors. The first is that the company has been able to improve its bill collection
performance (the average days of billing fell significantly for residences and industrial
organizations from 2001­05, see Section F), and therefore to mobilize higher revenues
than would otherwise have been the case. The second is that the company has been able to
contain its costs by operating its vehicle fleet more efficiently. However, its ability to
generate an operating profit in the future without increases in tariffs or other sources of
revenue will become increasingly challenging, especially if oil prices remain high. The
World Bank is now preparing a carbon finance project that is expected to generate
adequate revenues to enable the utility to finance its operations and a significant share of
its equipment replacement costs through 2015.

It should be noted that although tariffs for solid waste collection are too low to cover full
costs (operating and investment), the proportion of total costs recovered through tariffs are
higher for solid waste services than for other communal services such as water supply,
electricity, or heating.

Annex 6: Beneficiary Survey Results

A local social science research firm carried out a beneficiary assessment to assist the task
team in determining the extent to which the project met its objectives from the perspective
of the users of the system as well as to identify any adverse social impacts that may have
arisen during project implementation and to recommend measures to help mitigate them.
The assessment involved a citywide household survey and in-depth interviews with waste
pickers to understand how they were affected by the project-related improvements at the
main landfill and at the collection points around the city. The main findings of the
household survey include:

(a)     Overall, 60 percent of the respondents in a citywide household survey reported that
        they are satisfied with their solid waste collection service.
(b)     Among households receiving the highest level of service, 80 percent report that
        they are satisfied. However, satisfaction differs in the 11 districts of the city;
        households in Yunosobad District are the most satisfied.
(c)     The large majority (90 percent) of respondents said that they were satisfied with the
        location of their collection points. By contrast, in the 1997 social assessment, less
        than 30 percent said they were satisfied.
(d)     The most satisfied households are those with access to secure collection points and
        the bell system (collection vehicles ring a bell upon arriving at a block and
        residents bring their waste to the vehicle to be taken away).
(e)     Among those households indicating that they are not satisfied with their solid waste
        service, about half indicated that the main reason for their dissatisfaction was the
        litter surrounding the bins, resulting from the activities of the increasing number of
        waste pickers in the city.
(f)     More than 90 percent of the respondents indicate that they are paying for their
        collection service. On average, household payments for solid waste service
        account for only 0.3 to 0.7 percent of household income. This suggests that there is
        an opportunity to raise tariffis; an acceptable amount for developing countries and
        transitional economies is to pay about 1.5 percent of household income for solid
        waste services.

With regard to the waste pickers, the beneficiary assessment found that waste picking at
the nonsecure collection points had increased, suggesting that the number of people
without jobs or other sources of income in Tashkent was increasing. Income from selling
materials found at the collection points was the only means of support for many of the
waste pickers.

While noting that the design of Tashkent's solid waste management system was not
responsible for or able to solve this situation, the project team suggested that Spetstrans
consider hiring waste pickers to clean up areas surrounding the bins at the nonsecure
collection points. This would allow the waste pickers to earn more income and have
greater security, while improving sanitary conditions and consumer satisfaction. Currently
Spetstrans' recycling subsidiary is allowing 20 waste pickers to operate at the main landfill
to recover plastic, paper, and other recyclables and paying them for the materials they
collect according to its value. Many of the pickers who are no longer operating at the main

                                               37

landfill continued waste picking at the collection points in the city, or took construction
jobs with Spetstrans or other enterprises carrying out project-related construction work.
Some of the pickers were able to earn a living operating a secure collection point.

Annex 7: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results


A stakeholder workshop was not carried out as part of the ICR. However, the team carried
out a beneficiary assessment (see annex 5) and met with key stakeholders to discuss the
results of the project (see annex 8).

Annex 8: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Introduction

1.     The City of Tashkent ("the City") and the government of the Republic of
Uzbekistan ("government") have received loans in the amount of US$ 43.2 million from
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) (jointly referred to as "Creditors") in
support of a program of investments to rehabilitate the municipal solid waste management
system in the City of Tashkent. The program is known as the Tashkent Solid Waste
Management Project, hereafter referred to as "the Project." It consists of the following
components:

       (a) improvement of the waste collection system;
       (b) technical re-equipment of waste collection vehicles;
       (c) improvement of the system of maintenance and repair of vehicles;
       (d) construction of transfer stations;
       (e) closure of two city landfills;
       (f) modernisation of main Ahangaran landfill;
       (g) establishment and development of the biomedical waste management system.

Project Achievements: Tashkent Solid Waste Management Project

2.   In general, it is important to note that the implementation of Tashkent Solid Waste
     Management Project allowed the Tashkent City Municipality not only to restore, but
     also to significantly strengthen and upgrade the city's solid waste collection system.
     In our opinion, the Municipality, with close assistance of the Banks, managed to
     achieve the following main project targets as a result of project implementation:

 (a) Improved significantly the sanitary condition of residential areas of the city;
     rehabilitated the system of waste collection and disposal; established a regulatory
     framework for recording the volumes of solid waste generation and removal;
     liquidated about 120­150 uncontrolled dump sites from the city area; significantly
     reduced disease rates of population through increases in provided waste collection
     services and environmental sanitation of the city. Achievement of this point fully
     corresponds to the project aims.

 (b) Completely renovated the waste collection vehicles fleet with modern equipment and
     waste compactors; increased their roadworthiness and operation ratio. Achievement
     of this point also corresponds to the project aims.

 (c) Improved operation and maintenance of vehicles and equipment through purchase of
     service equipment for district garages and central repair workshop; decreased
     operation and maintenance costs; with putting central repair workshop of Spetstrans
     into operation, regular service and maintenance of the vehicles is done with
     Spetstrans own efforts with lower costs; earlier these works were carried out by side
     organizations like «Hyundai-Invest-Center» and «Daewoo-Service-Center» at a much
     higher cost. Achievement of this point also corresponds to the project aims.

                                               40

  (d) Through construction of three transfer stations in Hamza, Yakkasaray and Yunusabad
      districts, the operation efficiency of waste collection vehicles improved significantly,
      their idle mileage was decreased, savings in fuel and consumables use was achieved,
      use of the Zangiota and Hasanbay in-city landfills was discontinued; according to
      calculations, the annual net profit from using each transfer station amounted to an
      90­200 million sums, on average. Achievement of this point also corresponds to the
      project aims.

  (e) Upgraded operation of the main city landfill Ahangaran through reconstruction,
      purchase of new vehicles and equipment, and installation of weighbridge with
      computer equipment. Achievement of this point also corresponds to the project aims.

  (f) Created about 1,000 additional jobs through construction of secure waste collection
      points in the residential areas of the city, and established a formal system of
      recyclable materials separation, collection, and treatment. The volume of waste
      generated in the city was reduced by approximately 35-40% because of separation
      and recycling of secondary materials. Although waste separation was not a specific
      objective of the project, its achievement not only corresponds to the project's aims,
      but is an especially positive benefit of the project.

3.      Today, the waste management system of the city is working in a more organized
manner, and can serve as a good example for the cities throughout Uzbekistan as well as in
other developing countries. We and our guests who visit Tashkent speak highly of the
sanitary conditions of the residential areas of the city which have improved significantly
since the start of the project.

4.      Through the project, the municipality managed to solve a number of serious
problems, such as lack of vehicles and bins for solid waste collection, and other technical
means. Besides, the government and municipality managed to rehabilitate and transfer a
number of old depreciated vehicles of Russian manufacture to other cities of the country:
Nukus, Samarkand, Gulistan, Andijan, and others. Thus, not only Tashkent itself received
benefits from implementation of our project, but also these other cities.

Institutional Development Impact Achieved Through the Project

5.      An important factor for keeping sustainability of the project, maintaining the
required level of service and provision of financial stability in the whole solid waste
system was liquidation of useless management units and reduction of managerial costs. To
achieve this, the Sanitary Cleaning Board and its 10 district sub-divisions ­ odering
departments - were liquidated, Spetstrans district units' bank accounts were liquidated, and
tariff collection was organized into one main account.

6.      In addition, 280 out of 395 secure waste collection points were leased to private
persons or companies, with the purpose of reducing the operational and production costs of
solid waste collection and removal.

7.      One of the main project targets was introduction into the system of market
relations, creation of competitive environment and private sector attraction. To this end, an

                                                41

international tender was arranged in 2003 for private sector participation in the bidding for
solid waste removal services contracts in two city districts ­ Chilanzar and Shaihantaur.
The tender failed because no company was interested in submitting an offer.

8.      Despite the tender failure, the municipality continues to work towards this target.
Today, three waste operators are working in the city: Spetstrans (which serves 9 city
districts), Ordering Department of Yunusabad district, and limited liability company
«Sergeli-Faiz-Trans». The increase in the number of waste operators in the city provides
hope that given this competition, they will be more functional through a better level of
service provided and striving to expand their activity in the sphere of solid waste
management.

Sustainability of Project Achievements

9.      During project implementation, the solid waste management system of the city
became more sustainable and effective in comparison with other fields of economy. Here
we have fewer failures, shortcomings, and employee turnover. Purchases within the
project and use of modern and highly productive technical means allowed increasing
prestige and value of personnel working in the system. With the help of the project, the
municipality managed to completely renovate the waste collection vehicle fleet and
establish an upgraded system of repair and maintenance which allowed it to increase the
reliability and operational life of the equipment.

10.     The system efficiency improvements under the project allows the municipality to
serve all categories of clients in the city (population, industrial and commercial sector),
which are all served equally. Presently, the municipality managed to eliminate all past
problems with the lack of vehicles and bins for solid waste collection.

11.     Invaluable help of the project, acquired knowledge and experience will allow us to
keep and strengthen the level and quality of service in the system of solid waste
management in the future.

12.     Along with significant and positive results of project implementation, some
difficulties with tariff collection from population and budget enterprises remain issues for
the municipality. Although some progress was achieved compared to the situation at the
beginning of the project, these results remain very modest and are not fully satisfactory.

13.     Thus, ensuring the financial sustainability of the system, which is directly
dependent on tariff collection rate from all categories of clients, remains our concern.
Although the tariff collection rate in solid waste has increased significantly reaching the
level of 85­90% as compared with other communal services provided such as electricity
supply, heating and gas supply, the municipality will need to continue to work in this
direction.

14.     Special attention should be given to the necessity of developing and introducing
mechanisms for establishing a reduced tariff for socially vulnerable groups of the
population. In this regard, because of the general difficult economic situation, the
municipality is not yet ready to follow the example of developed countries to implement


                                               42

subsidies and social support to the low-income groups of the population when paying for
solid waste collection services.

15.     We understand the difficult conditions experienced by the solid waste management
units in the city before project start-up and receipt of donor assistance from the Banks. It
cost us a lot of work and energy to bring the system up-to-date. That is why the
municipality will make every effort to keep and increase the level of service without
further donor assistance.

16.     From the perspective of ensuring the sustainability of solid waste service, the
municipality sees the following main tasks:

       (a) Stimulation and support of initiatives for wide private sector participation or
            attraction of foreign operators to contract for solid waste services to be provided
            in the city;
       (b) Development and introduction of methods of social support of low-income
            groups of the population who find it more difficult than other residents to pay
            for services;
       (c) Seeking of funds to carry out a census of population with the purpose of
            obtaining accurate data. This is important not only for solid waste operators,
            but for other fields of economy;
       (d) Development and introduction of effective methods of collecting tariffs for
            solid waste services together with the payment of tariffs for electricity or gas
            supply;
       (e) Seeking of funds to fully finance the city budget enterprises so they will be able
            to adequately pay for solid waste service;
       (f) Development and introduction of projects financed from Carbon credits on
            waste composting, separation and recycling of secondary materials, selection
            and treatment of biogas at the landfill, and reduction of transport emissions in
            the atmosphere through operation of transfer stations, etc.;
       (g) Creating incentives for leasing the city landfill, transfer stations, or other solid
            waste management facilities to private operators or foreign companies.

Efficiency of the Banks' and Government's Activities

17.     As it is well known, the project was financed from the IBRD and ERBD loan
funds. Many procedures and requirements of the Banks were similar, with only slight
differences.

18.     We have accumulated a very positive experience co-operating closely with both
Banks during the seven years of project life. Before that, the municipality did not have any
experience of working with international financial institutions, or attracting foreign
consultants and experts.

19.     The implementation of the project allowed our specialists to benefit from the wide
experience of international foreign consultants and experts of the two Banks who are
dealing with such projects in different parts of the world for a long time already. Overall
support, understanding, and advice of these experts allowed our local staff to express
openly their points of view, support different discussions, and prove their opinions.

                                               43

20.     Before the project, our local specialists used in their daily work methods and
provisions formulated during the Soviet times. They had regular meetings and shared their
experience with colleagues working in the other CIS countries. However, project
implementation and involvement of various international experts and consultants in the
project exposed local staff to a wider range of views and expertise, which increased the
qualifications and experience of local staff.

21.     Efficiency of IBRD performance. We can state only the positive sides. In the
opinion of the majority of our specialists, the work performed by the IBRD is estimated as
HS (Highly Satisfactory).

22.     We are particularly pleased in finding IBRD staff helpful even before project start-
up, at the stage of its identification. The IBRD made available staff training for key
specialists working toward implementation of investment projects in the future. Such an
experience allowed the municipality to have qualified staff ready to work right by the start
of project implementation, which excludes possible delays or mistakes in the future work
of the projects.

23.     In addition, during project implementation, the Bank organized regular short-term
trainings, seminars, and discussions in the beneficiary countries to increase the quality of
staff's qualification and for already functioning implementing agencies. This allowed the
implementing agencies to share experiences whenever they faced certain difficulties in
project activities. Seeking of solutions in such situations was widely practiced via opinion
exchanges, discussions, and arguments under supervision of the Bank's experts.

24.     During project implementation, our staff practically annually visited training
courses, arranged by the IBRD in Tashkent, Bishkek, or Almaty, and received relevant
certificates.

25.     In our view, the successful outcome of project implementation was anticipated
even at the times when at the initial stage of the project the draft tender documents for
procurement of the main goods, works, and services were drafted and approved with
assistance of the IBRD staff. As it is known, one month prior to the effectiveness of the
IBRD Loan Agreement, the international tender for purchase of waste collection vehicles
and bins was announced. This allowed staff to save time and resources.

26.     We also benefited from independent sociological surveys of the population carried
out by the IBRD before the project start-up, during its physical implementation, and upon
project completion. Such a practice allows us to objectively assess the situation, introduce
adjustments in a timely manner, and avoid mistakes and miscalculations in the future work.
Here we were especially fortunate to have Mrs. Janis Bernstein as our Task Manager for
the project who has specialized expertise in social development.

27.     One of the effective points in the work of the IBRD is annual and regular
supervision missions to oversee the process of project implementation. We have many
times managed to solve issues, which might otherwise have led to delays, during these
missions with direct participation of our Task Manager at the level of the municipality or
the government. In particular, the issue of local works financing, their completion

                                              44

schedules, and contracts registration, etc. We do not remember any failure of the IBRD
Mission to arrive in Tashkent, while this has been the case with EBRD supervision
missions during the implementation of our project.

28.     Throughout project implementation, we have not had any case when IBRD would
delay answering our questions, approving tender documents, or reviewing reports and
contracts. The IBRD performance was always excellent in its efficiency, accuracy, and
responsiveness. We always received clear and full replies to our requests.

29.     We are also grateful to the local office of the IBRD in Tashkent for success in our
project, particularly the assistance and efficiency from Mr. Martin Raiser, O. Borovikov, F.
Rakhimov, and other staff of the local country office. The practice of conducting quarterly
Technical Group meetings with participation of the IBRD experts and representatives of
PIUs and the government were most helpful and effective. Organization and arrangement
of press conferences, interactive meetings and seminars, project site visits, speeches placed
on the media, TV, and Internet were all a significantly positive aspect of the local country
office performance.

30.     In close co-operation with the IBRD for more than seven years already, we can
declare with confidence that if the municipality, the government, and other international
financial institutions would work as hard as the IBRD, the success of implementation of
investment projects in Uzbekistan would be ensured.

31.     Efficiency of the EBRD performance. We can put a less satisfactory mark here.
In the opinion of a majority of our specialists, the work performed by the EBRD is
estimated as L (Likely Satisfactory).

32.     Looking back, we note that EBRD's lack of efficiency in their work was followed
by delays in the implementation of our project, and problems associated with the
conditions of the Loan Agreement. Inclusion in the EBRD Loan Agreement of such a
strong measure as Debt Service Reserve Account (in hard currency) as a protective means
for the EBRD, dividing the loan into Tranches A and B with release triggers only upon
achievement of certain conditions such as private sector participation, the necessity of
annual Loan and LAD extensions, and other factors led to extensive delays throughout
project implementation.

33.     During long close co-operation with both Banks, we can compare them on different
levels. This comparison would not play in the EBRD favor. Obviously, the EBRD, still
being "a young bank" is lacking certain experience in different countries of the world.
They might not have taken into account the peculiarities of each region, and local
conditions. Further, the Bank has taken an unjustifiable strict approach toward
beneficiaries, and is much inferior to IBRD with regard to efficiency and consistency.
Perhaps this will sound strongly unjustified, but we would call EBRD more of a
"commercial bank".

34.     We could give several examples in confirmation of the lack of efficiency from the
EBRD side, and its local office in Tashkent, but we don't think it is necessary. We believe
the EBRD management and experts are aware of that and we hope they are working in this
direction.

                                               45

35.     By mentioning only shortcomings here, it would be unfair to belittle the
considerable input of the EBRD into the success of project implementation. Thanks to the
EBRD, we have modern machinery and landfill equipment, long distance trucks, computer
equipment and software, and good service equipment for vehicles maintenance. The EBRD
also made a large contribution through its provision of technical assistance for the
institutional development program for the solid waste management system. We should
also note here that the initial idea of the project was started by the EBRD.

36.     Efficiency of the government's performance. The financing of the following six
project components with completion schedule until the end of 2000 was envisaged under
the project from the municipality own funds, namely:

        (a) Site preparation and supply of engineering communications, roads construction
            at the locations of four transfer stations;
        (b) Construction of the turning access at the crossroads of Akhangaran highway
            and access road to the Akhangaran landfill;
        (c) Reconstruction and upgrading of the Akhangaran landfill with a separate site
            for biomedical waste disposal;
        (d) Closure of Zangiota and Hasanbay landfills in accordance with environmentally
            acceptable requirements;
        (e) Upgrading of 11 city garages and the central repair workshop of Spetstrans
            (initially the financing from the EBRD loan funds was envisaged under the
            project);
        (f) Annual audit of PIU activity and other municipality units involved in the
            project implementation.

37.     Unfortunately, due to absence of stable sources of funds with the municipality and
the government, the local works completion schedule was delayed several times. Three
times new schedules for financing and completion of local works were accepted during
project implementation, which were later delayed due to the lack of funds. As a result, this
led to substantial delays in the project implementation, adjustments, and revision of
implementation completion schedules under the project. An important lesson from the
project, therefore, is the need to reduce the volume of local works for future projects,
especially those dealing with the performance of construction and construction-and-repair
works.

38.     In addition, substantial delays occurred during the stage of registration of the
signed contracts with the Ministry of Foreign Economical Relations, Investments and
Trade. In some cases, registration and approval of the contracts took from three to six
months. It is obvious that in future projects, it is necessary to specify mechanisms, terms,
and conditions of registering the contracts signed under ICBs with the concerned
government authorities.

Lessons Learned from Project Implementation

39.     Looking back, it is necessary to point out that during the implementation of the
project, which is mostly assessed as successful, a vast and positive experience was gained.
This experience has already turned out to be useful for new projects undertaken by

                                                46

Tashkent municipality, such as: "Rehabilitation of Tashkent City Water Supply System"
financed by the EBRD, and "Road Construction and Maintenance with Upgrading of
Asphalt Plant" financed by the Islamic Development Bank.

40.     As it is known, the IBRD commenced the identification and preparation of a new
solid waste investment in the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara. For successful
implementation of this proposed investment and the projects listed above, the
implementation experience of the Tashkent Solid Waste Management Project can be
considered as valuable and exemplary. In our opinion, the following aspects deserve
repeating to produce good results:

        (a) Preparation and coordination with beneficiaries of the draft tender documents
            for procurement of goods, works, and services prior to commencement of the
            project, and during their identification, preparation, and evaluation. This could
            allow reducing significantly the duration of project implementation.
        (b) Preliminary assignment of key specialists of the future project implementing
            agencies and training them in procedures of conducting a project, procurement,
            and financial management.
        (c) Timely adjustment of procurement plans during the implementation of projects,
            depending on their results of assessment of procurement plans implementation.

41.     In addition to the above, some negative factors which caused delays and disruptions
in the schedules of works under the project should be mentioned. First of all, it is the
execution of local works, which were expected to be financed from the municipality's own
funds. Due to the lack of stable sources of funds, these works were completed with
substantial delays. In the implementation of future projects, it is necessary to reduce the
works which are to be financed from the beneficiaries' own funds, especially if it involves
construction, installation, and repair works at project sites.

Public Awareness

42.     Public contribution into the project implementation is invaluable. During project
implementation, public surveys of all groups of the population were conducted with the
assistance of IBRD sociologists and consultants. The first survey was carried out prior to
the project start-up; the second one, in the middle of project implementation, and the third
one during the stage of completion of the main components of the project. In addition, the
process of implementation was regularly highlighted in the local press. Key specialists
were interviewed on TV and radio; they explained to the population of the city the main
goals of the project and shared the results. At the same time, public discussions with
socially active members of the communities were carried out with the assistance of
mahalla and district committees whose requests and wishes in the field of solid waste
management were taken into consideration.

43.     The municipality had plans to cooperate actively with local communities, increase
public awareness, and get them involved in improving the city's sanitary conditions.
However, limited funds and sometimes complete lack of funds became a significant
obstacle in our way for conducting efficient and active work with the population and
raising public awareness.

Solid Waste Management Enterprises and their Current Potential

44.     In the course of project implementation, the municipality has managed to
strengthen the equipment and facilities as well as increase the efficiency of SWM
enterprises. Renewal of the collection vehicle fleet, upgrading of the landfill through
provision of modern equipment, construction of collection points and transfer stations, and
provision of a stable and sufficient stock of waste collection bins allowed the enterprises to
significantly increase their efficiency.

45.     Before the project, due to the absence of specialized vehicles, SWM enterprises
were practically not involved in removal of bulky wastes generated during construction
and repair works. The procurement under the project of 17 units of large container vehicles
HD-260 Arm Roll supplied with 345 pieces of 20 cubic meter containers allowed them to
enlarge their scope of services. Moreover, rapidly developing private house building
activity provides good business opportunities for those vehicles. Currently, the assistance
of such vehicles is remarkably valuable for the construction works. The construction of
secure and non- secure collection points in residential areas allowed the municipality to:

        (a) create about 1,000 additional jobs;
        (b) stop using waste pipe chutes and waste collection cells in more than 700 multi-
             story buildings, which were not designed for operation in the conditions of hot
             climate and thus caused poor sanitation and insect breeding (flies, mosquitoes,
             cockroaches);
        (c) introduce, on a formal level, the system of separate collection and selection of
             recyclable wastes;
        (d) reduce the volume of collected waste through selection of recyclable materials.

46.     More exact and routine calculation of the volumes of incoming and utilized waste
became possible through installation at the city landfill and transfer stations of the single
type weighbridges with computer equipment, which also resulted in a more accurate
planning of work.

Positive Changes in Tashkent's Solid Waste Management System

47.     The successful implementation of the project in Tashkent with the population of
more than 2 million people can serve as a good example for other cities of our country,
with a smaller number of residents.

48.     The construction of three transfer stations in Hamza, Yakkasaray, and Yunusabad
districts allowed Spetstrans to increase significantly the efficiency of waste collection
vehicles, minimize their idle mileage, and save on fuel and lubricants use. According to
our calculations, the operation of each transfer station allows Spetstrans to save about 190­
200 million sums per year.

49.     For separate collection and disposal of biomedical waste, a separate cell is being
allocated and equipped at the Akhangaran landfill, and procurement of two special vehicles
along with 200 special bins is envisaged. In the future, more advanced systems, such as

                                              48

neutralization of waste through incineration or processing in microwave furnaces, might be
quite possible.

50.     The Akhangaran landfill is now functioning as the main site for disposal of the
city's solid waste after the closure of the Hasanbay landfill and discontinuing waste
disposal at the Zangiota landfill. We have managed to develop its service equipment,
improve the condition of the access roads, install electronic weighbridges, and create basic
conditions for equipment maintenance and personnel with the help of the project.

51.     Finally, 1,145 secure and nonsecure waste collection points were constructed in the
city. The construction of these collection points resulted in the improvement in the
sanitary conditions of the residential areas of the city, and increased the cultural level of
service to the population.

Annex 9: Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Hokimiyat of Tashkent. On February 2, 2006, the task team met with the key hokimiyat
officials involved in project implementation to discuss the results of the project. At the
meeting, Mr. Ibragimov, then Head of the Main Investments Department of the Tashkent
City Hokimiyat, told the mission about the benefits that have been obtained through the
project, including: (a) complete renewal of Spetstrans' vehicle fleets, (b) construction of
waste transfer stations, (c) establishment of a Central Repair Workshop, (d) modernization
of the Akhangaran city landfill, and (e) improvement of Spetstrans' operational and
financial management systems, all of which resulted in substantial improvements in the
quality of waste collection and disposal services as well as the sanitary and environmental
conditions in the City of Tashkent. Mr. Ibragimov emphasized that this positive
assessment of the results achieved under the project was completely objective, based not
only on the perceptions of the Hokimiyat officials, but on the comments he was hearing
from foreign visitors coming to Tashkent.

More specifically, Mr. Ibragimov informed the mission that the project resulted in: (a) a
more efficient and cost effective use of the renewed vehicle fleet which allowed Spetstrans
to reduce the fuel and operations and maintenance costs; (b) substantial net cost savings as
a result of commissioning three waste transfer stations; (c) improved tariff collection rates
as a result of the transfer of responsibility for tariff collection to Spetstrans and
introduction of computerized customer information and billing system; (d) reduced costs of
operating the landfill due to the procurement of necessary landfill equipment and improved
operational efficiencies; and (d) additional income generated by Spetstrans through
recycling activities at the secure collection points. He also mentioned that in order to help
ensure the financial sustainability of Spetstrans, the Tashkent City Hokimiyat assumed full
responsibility for repayment of the World Bank Loan to the Ministry of Finance on behalf
of Spetstrans, and exempted the company from payment of the leasing fees for the use of
the new equipment. According to Mr. Ibragimov, all of the above measures allowed
Spetstrans to adequately cover its operating and maintenance costs and make a marginal
profit during the past two and a half years.

Responding to the concern raised by the mission about the financial sustainability of the
solid waste management system over the medium to longer term, Mr. Ibragimov provided
assurances that the Tashkent City Hokimiyat was committed to taking all the necessary
steps in this regard. For example, he explained that while there were no immediate plans
to increase the tariff for households and budget-financed organizations, the financial
sustainability of the system would be ensured through: (a) increases in the tariff levels for
the industrial and commercial clients in the event there are increases in the cost of inputs
(for example, fuel, lubricants, and labor); and (b) continued privatization of Spetstrans
district garages and greater active involvement of the private sector that will help realize
the benefits of competition and further reduce the system's operations and maintenance
costs. He also emphasized that while the hokimiyat did not expect a deterioration in
Tashkent's solid waste management system over the medium to longer term, it was
committed to taking all the necessary measures to provide financial and other types of
support to the MSWM system, should the need arise, in order to ensure the sustainability
of the investments financed under the World Bank and EBRD loans.
