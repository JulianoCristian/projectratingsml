strengthen the capacity of the Yogyakarta provincial\n            government to implement effective area development programs\n            in two extremely poor districts and to assess new\n            technologies designed to achieve these objectives through\n            several experimental programs. Specifically the project\n            would: (a) test and adapt appropriate agricultural\n            technologies and soil conservation measures for upland\n            farming; (b) introduce low-cost promising income-generating\n            activities, e.g. fisheries, livestock, and small-scale\n            enterprises; (c) improve selected rural roads, low-cost\n            preventive and primary health care, and safe drinking water\n            supply; and (d) strengthen provincial planning and program\n            implementation, through technical assistance, training and\n            local participation."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
