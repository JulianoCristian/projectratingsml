 technologies designed to achieve these objectives through\n            several experimental programs. Specifically the project\n            would: (a) test and adapt appropriate agricultural\n            technologies and soil conservation measures for upland\n            farming; (b) introduce low-cost promising income-generating\n            activities, e.g. fisheries, livestock, and small-scale\n            enterprises; (c) improve selected rural roads, low-cost\n            preventive and primary health care, and safe drinking water\n            supply; and (d) strengthen provincial planning and program\n            implementation, through technical assistance, training and\n            local participation."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
