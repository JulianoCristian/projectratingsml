Governance\n            Technical Assistance Project for Haiti were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was high, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the project was prepared and implemented\n            under extremely challenging political and natural\n            circumstances, in a setting in which the capacity to\n            implement projects is very low. These factors ended up\n            delaying the implementation of the project. However, at the\n            closing, the project has achieved most of its initial\n            objectives. There are no shortcuts or quick wins in building\n            project implementation capacity in fragile states. That\n            inevitably takes time and resources. It is recommended that,\n            for future operations, promoting transparency and public\n            accountability, on the one hand, and communications and\n            public outreach of the government's economic governance\n            reforms, on the other, will be conceptually separated.\n            Overall, Bank operations, especially the capacity building\n            initiatives, will benefit from sound social and conflict\n            analysis of the stakeholders, dynamics, interests and\n            trends. More could be made of the World Bank's\n            convening power at senior levels of the Government to ensure\n            that civil society monitoring is taken seriously. Given the\n            weak capacity of civil society in many fragile states, there\n            should be more resources committed to capacity-building of\n            civil society itself, in order to enable it to perform any\n            monitoring function, and they should be provided through\n            continuous in-country support (possibly by a third party\n            specialized in civil society capacity building). There could\n            be also more South-South learning initiatives, based on\n            lessons learned from similar experiences in other countries\n            for both civil society and government."}, "docdt": "2010-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
