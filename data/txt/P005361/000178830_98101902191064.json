In view of the growing size of\n            CIH's sub-projects, the free limit above which Bank\n            approval of a project is required would be raised from\n            $100,000 to $200,000, and the aggregate free limit would be\n            $4 million. The Bank would thereby continue to review the\n            bulk of the projects being financed out of the Bank loan.\n            The loan will be disbursed to finance 100 percent of the CIF\n            cost of imported equipment; 65 percent of the cost of\n            imported equipment or equipment assembled or processed\n            locally from imported components, if purchased in Morocco;\n            and the foreign exchange component of construction costs."}, "docdt": "1972-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
