Adjustment lending is successful when Government\n            commitment is strong. 2) The synergy between the IMF and WB\n            in supporting the structural agenda is key for ensuring the\n            sustainability of the reforms. 3) Clear regional integration\n            goals, such as EU accession, provide strong incentive for\n            reform. 4) A key factor in the success of the PSAL II was\n            the availability of substantial technical assistance to\n            carry out the reforms and privatizations. 5) Use flexibility\n            to adjust strategies based on  market conditions. 6) Despite\n            the broad scope of the project, the loan included a detailed\n            policy matrix that was easily monitored. This specificity\n            contributed to the success of implementation, as it set\n            clear goals for the Government. 7) Constant field presence\n            proved to be an essential element of success given the depth\n            and complexity of such an ambitious reform program."}, "docdt": "2005-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
