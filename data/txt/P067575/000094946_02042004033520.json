The project\n            will pursue five key development objectives: 1) exit of\n            public banks from government ownership, through\n            privatization, and other options, accompanied by measures to\n            strengthen the overall environment for private sector\n            banking, and financial sector modernization; 2) divestiture\n            of the largest public sector industrial, and commercial\n            loss-makers from the government portfolio, accompanied by\n            further measures to complete privatization of pools of\n            enterprises, and joint ventures, ensuring transparency; 3)\n            reform of the energy sector, introducing modern management\n            principles, and sound regulation to ensure utility companies\n            from cross-subsidization and soft credit, potentially\n            forestalling enterprise restructuring. Reforms will be\n            supported by legal and regulatory frameworks for private\n            sector participation, increasing prices to cost recovery\n            levels, ensuring consistency in tariff structures, and\n            increasing collections for sustainable operations,\n            reinvestment, and quality service delivery; 4) strengthening\n            of the business environment, by removing administrative\n            barriers that hamper investment and trade, removing special\n            funds for fiscal consolidation, and, strengthening\n            bankruptcy practice standards for a competitive private\n            sector -oriented economy; and, 5) provision of social\n            protection systems, and safety nets, in particular for\n            workers affected by restructuring, and privatization."}, "docdt": "2002-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
