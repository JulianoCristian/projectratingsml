Recent economic\n            developments show Romania is pursuing a broad reform agenda,\n            including economic, institutional and governance reforms,\n            anchored in the process of EU accession. However, there has\n            been a marked deterioration of the current account deficit\n            to in 2003, fuelled in part by the expansion of bank credit\n            to the private sector. Foreign direct investment (FDI)\n            increased slightly in 2003, while fiscal deficit is\n            relatively manageable, although quasi fiscal deficits remain\n            high. Overall, the Bank considers the macroeconomic\n            situation, and policy framework in Romania satisfactory, and\n            conditions for second tranche release have been met, or\n            substantially met, in areas related to the financial sector,\n            energy sector, privatization and social protection.\n            Conditions substantially met demonstrate that a) the monthly\n            rate of collection for payments to Termoelectrica reached\n            one hundred percent of the total electricity billings for\n            each month commencing October 1, 2001, and, b) the\n            cumulative monthly rate of collection for payments to\n            Termoelectrica for district heating supplies reached at\n            least ninety-seven and a half percent of the total billings\n            for the period commencing January 1, 2002.
