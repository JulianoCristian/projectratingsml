               FOURTHPROGRAMMATIC SOCIAL REFORMLOAN

                         Loan and ProgramSummary

Borrower:            Republic of Peru

Amount and Terms:    US$100million

ImplementingAgency:  Ministry of Economy and Finance

Description:         The Government of Peru (GoP) has requested a loan to assist
                     in the reform of the social sectors. This i s the fourth and final
                     stage of a four-year program, which uses a Programmatic
                     Development Policy Loan instrument to support reforms
                     aimed at increasing access, transparency, and efficiency in
                     service provision. The reform process, initiated in 2000, has
                     had very important achievements in the different sectors. The
                     main goals of the program are to (i)    improve the antipoverty
                     focus of public expenditures; (ii)increase access of the poor to
                     quality health and education services; and (iii)     enhance the
                     transparency of social programs, while empowering their
                     beneficiaries intheir design and implementation. The proposed
                     loan will achieve these objectives by supporting efforts to
                     complete and consolidate reforms in five areas: (i)social
                     expenditures management,       (ii)redesign, targeting,        and
                     administration of social protection programs, (iii)     access to
                     health services, (iv) access and efficiency in education, and (v)
                     transparency and accountability inthe social sectors.

                     Macroeconomic indicators in Peru are strong, and in this
                     sense, the country i s in an excellent position to advance and
                     consolidate reforms. However, the political and institutional
                     context for reform i s more complex, as the political climate in
                     i s not fully supportive of the current administration and
                     Congress i s often engaged in short term political conflicts.
                     Still, there has been strong support for social program reforms
                     and significant ownership of the PSRL program by the
                     government.     The program has enabled continuity in social
                     reforms.




BenefitsandRisks:    Benefits. The PSRL program was designed to support
                     structural reforms in the social sectors, rather than to provide
                     transitional income support for the poor. These reforms aimed
                     to increase access to and improve the quality of basic services.
                     They were designed to foster human capital accumulation and,



                                      vii

as a result, improve the living conditions of the poor in the
medium term by expanding their social and economic
opportunities. Thus, this program must be evaluated not in
terms of its impact on income poverty but in terms of its
impact on social indicators such as enrolment rates and access
to primary health care.

Although the nature of the reforms i s such that their full
realization will take years, available information on selected
indicators suggests that some of the expected improvements
have already started to materialize. For example, on the fiscal
front, the program has had a positive effect on the protection
of priority social programs and on the reform of the civil
servants pension regime; regarding equity and transparency, it
has supported the development of a monitoring and evaluation
system for the PSPs; finally, as a result of the measures
completed in the health sector, access to health services has
improved dramatically with the rapid expansion of coverage
for the Integrated Health System -SIS

Risks. This being the last stage of a programmatic loan, the
most serious risk i s sustainability, as there will be no future
operations to continue support of this exact reform program.
Also, a serious weakness that goes beyond the PSRL i s the low
political support for the current administration. Isolated but
growing regional unrest and continued low levels of public
support and the uncertainty surrounding the 2006 presidential
elections are putting pressure on the Government to limit
reforms    and     increase  expenditure.   The    advances   in
decentralization, while positive in theory, could result in
negative effects in the social sectors if they are decentralized
without the necessary safeguards and controls to ensure
sustainability in service provision.

Two factors reduced the probability that these risks will affect
the program's sustainability. First, through the PSRL, core
mechanisms of a poverty reduction strategy have been adopted
by the Peruvian government and built into management and
budgetary structures. Also, PSRLhas promoted a participatory
approach in the design and implementation of social policies,
with active participation of civil society at different levels of
government and consultations with sub-national governments.
This active     involvement    of numerous       actors  in the
implementation and provision of social policies and services
will enable reforms to be further protected from instability
within the central government.       The implementation of a
transparent evaluation and monitoring scheme, support for
expansion of the CLAS model in health services provision,


                 ...
                V l l l

                          and changes in procurement are a few examples of policies
                         that will result in more sustained and better involvement by
                         NGOs and beneficiaries as well as increased ownership and
                          demands for accountability. This expanded base of political
                          support will enable the long term continuity of reforms.

                         The second mitigating factor i s that while PSRL will not
                         continue, the Bank will remain closely associated with
                          reforms, supporting them through other operations and
                          sustaining a policy dialogue. The continuing operations
                         include      the    Decentralization       and   Competitiveness
                          Programmatic      Loan    ("DECSAL")       and  the  Technical
                         Assistance Loans for the Social Sectors and Decentralization.
                         DECSAL will continue to support the implementation of
                          decentralization in the Social Sectors, while the Technical
                         Assistance Loan will finance further development of specific
                          activities included in PSRL. Also, a new ESW on the social
                          sectors ("RECURS0 PERU") will provide an opportunity for
                         the Bank to maintain and deepen the policy dialogue in
                         preparation for upcoming social sector operations, helping to
                         increase the sustainability of PSRLreforms.

                         An additional risk i s generated by the high level of
                         dollarization of Peru's economy, which makes it vulnerable to
                          external interest rate or exchange rate shocks. However, the
                          Government has strongly supported a sound macroeconomic
                          environment to diminish this risk, by implementing a
                          stabilization program, improving the fiscal balance and
                          increasing debt sustainability over time.

                                      I.INTRODUCTION


1. The Programmatic Social Reform Loan IV (PSRL IV)i s the fourth and final stage in a
series of programmatic development policy loans supporting Peru's social reform agenda. It
i s a loan for US$lOO million. The PSRL series was initiated in 2001 with the Transition
Government that followed the demise of the Fujimori Government. PSRL Iemphasized
transparency and budgetary protection of key social programs. PSRL 11was prepared during
the first year of the Toledo Administration and supported the design and launch of longer
term reforms in anti-poverty programs and social reforms. PSRL I11 focused on
consolidating existing reforms and, within the context of decentralization in the social
sectors, creating the necessary fiscal space and legal and institutional framework for a
smooth transition towards the new model. Finally, the focus of PSRL IV i s to increase
sustainability of the reforms, by promoting transparency and monitoring at local and national
levels of program execution, increasing efficiency, improving targeting for all programs, and
ensuring that service delivery continues to improve while decentralization i s implemented.

2. The PSRL program has extended over more than a four year period. In a changing
institutional and economic environment-adapting        to two different governments, at least
sixteen ministers, and many more lower level officials in the three social sectors-         the
program has preserved its three original goals to (i)  improve the antipoverty focus of public
expenditure; (ii) increase access of the poor to quality health and education services; and (iii)
enhance the transparency of social programs, while empowering beneficiaries in the design
and implementation of programs.

3. The main achievements of PSRL IV consist in: (i)        sustained support for Priority Social
Programs (PSPs), in the context of overall fiscal restrictions; (ii)
                                                                   important advances towards
the development of a more accessible and equitable pension system; (iii)continued
expansion in the coverage of basic health care and in the development of instruments to
articulate national priorities in a more decentralized system; (iv) significant changes in the
administration of human resources in the Education sector, resulting in better assignment of
resources and more transparency; (v) the implementation of a monitoring and evaluation
system of PSPs with participation of civil society; and (vi) important changes in the
procurement systemwhich promote transparency and efficiency inPSPs.

4. While PSRL IV i s the last stage of the programmatic loan designed to support reform in
the social sectors, other projects are part of the Bank's continuing support to the Peruvian
government. These include the Decentralization and Competitiveness Programmatic Loan
(DECSAL), two sectoral investment projects- the Rural Education Project and Health
Reform Project, two technical assistance loans for fiscal decentralization policies and
decentralization of the social sectors, and a new analytical program, RECURSO PERU,
which focuses on the social sectors within a decentralization context and aims to provide
conceptual support and dialogue between the Bank and central and sub national authorities.

5. As the PSRL program has covered reforms in a wide range of areas, the World Bank
teams working on this program have come from many different sectors, with members from
different networks bringingtheir experience and expertise to the team.

                         11.THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIALSETTING
A. Political Context

6. After a decade of the Fujimori regime and a short transitional government, President
Toledo was elected to office amidst an economic recession. Beginning its term in July 2001,
the new government received support from the international community at the Madrid
Consultative Group Meeting in October 2001 and signed a two-year Stand-by Agreement
with the IMF in February 2002. Though the economy has been stable since then and i s
growing, the government's agenda continues to face political challenges. The government
lacks a majority in Congress, and there have been five cabinets in less than three years, and
opinion polls indicate that the administration political base has weakened. The political
problems have made implementation of major reforms difficult. However, recent changes in
Congress have led to a more collaborative environment that may defuse anti-government
sentiment and make Peru more governable.

7. In order to seek support for its policy agenda in the last two years of its administration,
the government recently put forward a Roadmap (Hoja de Ruta, 2004). This initiative builds
on the original National Agreement (`Acuerdo Nacional') signed inJuly 2002, which aims to
build consensus between the major political actors, parties, unions and civil society. It also
builds on the government's ongoing goal of decentralizing the social sectors in order to
empower local governments and beneficiaries. The Roadmap comprises of about 180 new or
existing government programs and projects grouped under eight policy areas. The roadmap
was perceived as a positive way to lay out short-term priorities, but the public and opposition
political parties have largely received the Roadmap with scepticism, most likely due to the
lack of detail it contains regarding program implementation. However, it i s still too early to
predict how effective the Roadmap will be.

B. Macroeconomic Conditions and Outlook

8. Peru's macroeconomic performance has been positive in the last few years. Following
the severe economic slowdown of 1999-2001, which produced negative per-capita rates,
growth recovered in 2002 and has remained steady, with GDP averaging 4.5 percent in
2002-04, higher than the original CAS projection of 3.7 percent, with strong growth in
mining, manufacturing-textiles      and food-and      construction. The annual inflation rate of
2.5 percent (end-of period) was among the lowest in the region in 2003 and i s projected to
remain low at 3.5 percent in 2004. Guided by the inflation-targeting framework, inflation
expectation surveys have consistently forecasted 12-month inflation around the bottom of
the target band, thus contributing to reduced lending rates at the Central Bank and at other
domestic banks. Unemployment has showed a moderate declining trend since March 2003.
However, unemployment in Lima has not fallen and most employment increases have been
concentrated in large firms.' Finally, international reserves also increased in 2003 by about
US$600 million (equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP) due to a dynamic export
performance and strong private capital--namely foreign direct investment--inflows into
sizable mining investment projects, which put moderate pressure on the Nuevo Sol to
appreciate.

 9. The economic program under the Toledo administration has focused on maintaining
 macroeconomic stability, including moderate fiscal adjustment, with the purpose of
  supporting a sustained recovery in economic activity and employment, maintaining low
 inflation, limiting external vulnerability, and laying the basis for a marked reduction in
 poverty over the medium term. Sound macroeconomic fundamentals have provided a
 cushion against external shocks, including global growth weakness and regional financial
 turmoil. Internationalmarkets have reacted favorably to Peru's economic stability, and since
 its return to international markets in January 2002, the Government of Peru has successfully
 placed seven bond issues at favorable terms.

  10.Based on successful compliance with the 2002-2003 IMF agreement that ended in
 February 2004, the Government has negotiated a new US$422.8 million precautionary IMF
 Stand-by Agreement covering the period June 2004-August 2006. The new agreement aims
 to reduce Peru's primary vulnerabilities associated with high debt stock and financial
 dollarization, lower poverty, and raise employment in the context of prudent macroeconomic
 policy and strengthened structural reforms. The agreement projects an average real GDP
 growth rate of 4.5 percent for 2004-06, average annual inflation around 2.5 percent, and
 high international reserves. Key fiscal targets under the agreement include gradual combined
 fiscal deficit reduction from the current 1.7 percent to 1percent over the final two years of
 the agreement.



                                                                   3

11. Peru's economy has seemingly defied continuous political turmoil. However, strong
growth performance and prudent macroeconomic management have had limited impact on
employment and poverty levels. Economic growth has averaged 4.4 percent a year for the
period 2002-03, while employment grew by a mere 1 percent during the same period and
more than half of the population remains below the poverty line. Poverty increased rapidly
between 1997 and 1999 and has remained stable since then. Moreover, the accumulated rate
of per capita GDP growth since 1997 has been negative (-0.24 percent). The decline i s even
more pronounced when output growth relative to the potential labor force rather than total
population i s considered. At the same time, employment gains in leading sectors such as
construction, manufacturing, and retail have lagged and have been mostly concentrated in
Lima. The continuous political turbulence and stressful social conditions reflect a
widespread discontent given that recent growth has not yet overcome losses in per capita
income suffered duringthe 1998-2001period.

12. Peru's continued commitment to macroeconomic policy discipline in 2003 and 2004 has
resulted in low inflation and a stable exchange rate, rapid growth of exports, high official
reserves, a rising trade surplus, a declining current account deficit, and a well capitalized
banking system. GDP real growth in 2003 was led by private investment (5.4 percent) and
exports (5.9 percent), and to a lesser extent by public investment (5.0 percent), and i s
projected to grow at 4.2 percent in 2004 driven by private investment and export demand.
Private investment was boosted by the Camisea pipeline, a natural gas project that was
completed inAugust 2004.

13. Exports grew strongly - aided by the surge in commodity prices - in 2003 at 16.4
percent in dollar terms. They reached US$8.9 billion and are on track to reach a record
US$11 billion in 2004. As a result, a trade surplus of US$731 million was reached in 2003,
compared to US$306 million in 2002. The 2003 current account deficit narrowed to 1.8
percent of GDP, from 2.0 percent of GDP in 2002, and it i s projected to continue declining
to a record low 0.6 percent of GDP. Peru's external position i s likely to continue improving
inthe next year, though this is contingent on a favourable external environment.

14. Inflation has been at its lowest level in the last 40 years. Supported by the inflation
targeting framework adopted in 2002, inflation remained at 2.5 percent during 2003.
Interventions in the foreign exchange rate market by the Central Bank have helped stabilize
the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. In addition, the Peruvian banking system has been
gradually strengthened on the basis of a steady consolidation since 1998, recent asset quality
improvement, and reforms to the financial regulation and supervision framework. Despite all
these positive developments, Peru's sovereign rating i s still below investment grade. The
sovereign rating i s mostly constrained by a relatively large public debt (47.7 percent of
GDP) and a political environment that has limited progress in structural reforms.

15. Fiscal policy has been prudent, leading to a steady improvement in public accounts. The
combined public sector deficit narrowed from 2.1 percent of GDP in 2002 to 1.7 percent of
GDP in 2003. Fiscal figures thus far for 2004 suggest that the 1.4 percent of GDP fiscal
deficit target will be met comfortably. Furthermore, the Government intends to reduce the
fiscal deficit and established a 1 percent of GDP target in the 2005 budget that was recently
sent to Congress. If this happens, for the first time in Peru's modern economic history, the
fiscal deficit will have fallen for five consecutive years without jeopardizing growth. Despite




                                                4

strong spending pressures, a small primary surplus was achieved in 2003 for the first time
since 1998, as revenues rose at a faster pace than expenditures. The surplus i s projected to
grow even more in 2004, reaching 0.8 percent of GDP. However, the decline in public
investment that started in 2001 has not been reversed. It reached only 2.9 percent of GDP in
2003, its lowest level since the 1980s.

C.Poverty and socialindicators

16. After the economic crisis of the late 1990s, Peru enjoyed a period of sustained and, more
recently, fairly strong GDP growth. However, GDP per capita growth during this same
period was much more modest and benefited rich households disproportionately. This was
due to the fact that growth was initially concentrated in sectors with high capital-to-labor
ratios (biased growth), and when it later expanded to the rest of the economy GDP growth
failed to generate new jobs or investments (non-inclusive growth) that translated into higher
income for poor families.

17. As a result, recent economic growth has not been accompanied by a decline in poverty.
After the increase caused by the 1998/99 economic crisis, the poverty rate remained stable
between 2001 and 2003, at around 55 percent, while the extreme poverty rate declined from
24.4 to 21.6 during this same period. This implies that due to population growth, the number
of poor increased by 400,000 people, while the number of extreme poor fell by 550,000
people2.

18. In 2003, the latest year for which data can be found, rural poverty rates in Peru were
significantly higher than those in urban areas. In 2003104 the rural poverty rate has almost
doubled the rate for urban areas, and the extreme poverty rate in rural areas i s five times
higher than in urban areas. More than three-quarters of Peru's rural population lives in
poverty, and 46 percent lives in extreme poverty. In Metropolitan Lima, 36.5 percent of the
population i s poor, and the rate goes up to 48.5 percent for the remaining urban areas.
Extreme poverty for Lima and other rural areas i s much lower, at 1.8 percent and 14 percent
respectively. Nevertheless, since approximately 72.2 percent of the population i s urban, a
majority of the poor live in urban areas. The incidence of poverty varies significantly across
the different regions of the country. Poverty rates on the coast, where near half of the
Peruvian population lives, are much lower than inthe sierra (highlands) or the selva (`jungle).
Extreme poverty i s also more severe in these areas, where around 40 percent of the
population consumes less than what i s defined by the extreme poverty line.




  Due to improvements in the ENAHO's sampling framework in 2000, a consistent poverty series cannot be
constructed for 1997-2003. Instead we present two sets of poverty numbers: one for 1997-2002, where the
figures for 2001 and 2002 have been adjusted to make them comparable to those of 1997-2000; and one for
2001-2003.Although the level of poverty varies across series, poverty trends are similar

19.Inequality in Peru continues to be relatively high by international standards. Between
1997 and 2002, inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient for per capita consumption)
remained almost unchanged, reflecting the weak growth in GDP per capita during the whole
period. Inequality within urban areas (other than Lima) i s still substantially greater than in
rural areas, (with Gini coefficients of 0.34 and 0.30, respectively). Lima i s the most unequal
region in the country (0.40) and the rural areas in the Coast and Sierra have the lowest
amount of inequality (0.26).

20. Nonetheless, access to services in Peru has improved considerably. The proportion of
households with household water connections rose from 54.8 percent in 1997 to 66.1 percent
in2002. Moreover, the fraction of households with electricity rose from 69.2 percent to 71.8
percent in the same period. Finally, 53.1 percent of the households were connected to the

sewerage system in 2002, up from 45.6 percent in 1997. The poor population benefitedmost
from the expansion inthe access to these services.

21. In 2000, immediately before the start of PSRL, the infant mortality rate in Peru was 33
per thousand. 185 mothers died in every 10,000 births. 25 percent of children were suffering
from malnutrition and only 51.3 percent of children were at the age-appropriate level in
grade 6. As part of its mediumterm program, the government adopted a set of goals for these
indicators, to be achieved by 2006. Infant mortality rate i s expected to decline to 26 per
thousand, maternal mortality rate to 160 in 100,000 live births, chronic malnutrition rate to
20 percent, and the percentage of children who are at age-appropriate level in grade 6 to 55.
While there i s no recent survey data available to assess the advance towards these goals (a
National Demographic and Health Survey was carried out in 2004, but its results will not be
published until early 2005), some indirect indicators show that there may have been some
improvements in recent years. The proportion of poor households with access to nutrition
and feeding programs among the poor grew significantly in several regions (in rural areas
grew more than 10 percentage points between 2001 and 2003), and the proportion of births
attended by qualified personnel went from 43 per cent in 2000 to 60 percent in 2003. Finally,
estimates for maternal mortality indicate a decline of nearly 100points from 2000 to 2003.

D.Recenttrends inSocial Expenditure

22. Since 2001, the poverty reduction strategies of the Peruvian government have faced the
big challenge of increasing social expenditure and of bringing budget protection to priority
social programs in a context of fiscal retrenchment. Both the National Dialogue Agreement
and the Estrategia para la Superacio'n de la Pobreza call for a gradual and sustained
increase in social expenditure. The National Dialogue proposes a minimum annual increase
of 0.25 percent of GDP in the national budget to education, until it reaches a benchmark 6
percent of GDP.3 In a similar vein, the Estrategia para la Superacio'n de la Pobreza calls
for a 2 percent GDP increase in the overall budget assigned to social expenditure in 2010.
Recognizing that these targets are ambitious and subject to budget constraints derived from
fiscal sustainability, the Bases also calls for a significant restructuring of poverty alleviation
programs inorder to make them more efficient and effective.

23. Supported by successive PSRLs, the Government has implemented a countercyclical
social policy successfully. Between 1999 and 2004, whereas the combined fiscal deficit
decreased from -3.2 percent of GDP to -1.4 percent of GDP and the share of total
expenditure to GDP decreased from 21 percent in 1999 to 18.8 percent in 2004, social
expenditure as a percentage o f GDP remained steady, ranging from 6.8 to 6.9 percent during
the period (Figure 5). All of these outcomes reflect both the fiscal retrenchment that
characterized successive years of fiscal adjustment and an active effort by authorities to
offset its impact on the social sectors through the implementation of counter-cyclical social
policy.

24. The sum of three key components ("functions") of social expenditures in the Peruvian
budget--education, health and social assistance--have also been constant, but their internal
composition has varied. The global share of these three functions remained steady at about
6.8-6.9 percent of GDP between 2000 and 2004 (Table 2). However, its composition has
suffered modifications: As a percentage of GDP, education increased from 2.7 percent to 3.1
percent of GDP, whereas social assistance decreasedfrom 1.1percent to 0.7 percent of GDP
during this period. For its part, the share assigned to the health sector did not change. Thus,
overall social expenditure gained little from the cutback in defense spending, which
decreasedfrom 2.9 percent to 2.3 percent during this peri~d.~

25. A more important shift in expenditure patterns has taken place infavor of the six priority
social programs (PSPs) protected under PSRLs. The PSPs are those expenditures for basic
education, health, and community assistance that are not devoted to salary and pension
expenditures but are oriented toward investment and other current expenditures that finance
critical inputs, such as textbooks, medicines, and food supplements. All PSPs have been
instrumental in implementing a countercyclical social policy effectively. They have more
than doubled their share from 0.5 percent of GDP in 1999 to a budgeted 1.04 percent of
GDP in 2004 (Figure 7), and remain steady at such level in the draft 2005 Budget Law. In
this way, the Peruvian government has been providing budgetary protection and expanding
those expenditures that play a crucial role inreducing the vulnerability of the poor.

26. The results gained from improved targeting in education and health expenditure will not
be realized in the short term, as most reforms require several years to be completely
implemented. Relocation of schools and health clinics i s difficult and the funding and
building of new facilities takes time. Spending in priority social programs is progressive.
This is a result of the Government's effort to improve targeting in programs such as the
Integral Health Insurance (Seguro Integral de Salud-SZS), which guarantees free access to a
package of health services mostly for mothers and children, and that puts emphasis in the
poorest departments. In education, a WB financed rural education project i s being
implemented, targeting rural areas were poverty i s higher and quality of education i s lower,
i s being implemented. Social assistance programs, such as food-aid programs and rural
infrastructure programs are now in the process of being decentralized to local governments
following pro-poor distribution criteria for transfers. These programs have also improved
targeting in the past year: expenditures of food-aid programs in the first quintile districts
have gone up from 30% in2002 to 35% in2003 and 38% in 2004 budget.

                 111.THE GOVERNMENT'SMEDIUM TERM STRATEGY

A. The NationalAgreement

27. In July 2002 the government, representatives of the major political parties, religious
groups and civil society signed a common statement called "Acuerdo Nacional" (National
Agreement). The document included a set of basic goals and policies that would be
supported by all participants. I t included 29 state policies directed toward accomplishing
four objectives: (i)Democracy and State of Law; (ii)Equity and Social Justice; (iii)
Competitiveness; (iv) Efficiency, Transparency and Decentralization. The relevant policies
aimed at poverty reduction and the social sectors state that the Government will:

0   Assign an increasing proportion of public expenditures to investments in education and health
 care, improve their efficiency, and target them towards the poorest;
0   Favor citizen participation in the identification of needs, the design of solutions, and the
 managementof social programs;
0   Establish systems for the identification, attention, and promotion of employment for people
 unable to support themselves;
0   Encourage institutional development, efficiency, equity, and transparency of the State in resource
 allocation, especially on programs oriented toward reducing poverty and encouraging participation
 and supervision by civil society organizations;
    Guarantee the exercise of rights and access to justice administration for the populationthat lives
 in poverty;
0   Encourage a culture of prevention and control of risks and vulnerabilities, assigning resources for
 prevention, assistance, and reconstruction.
28. Inmid 2003 a 30thstate policy was approved, "Elimination of Terrorism and affirmation
of the National Reconciliation" after the publishingo f the final report o f the "Comisidn de la
Verdad". InApril 2004, the National Agreement Forum signed the "Political, Economic and
Social Short Term Commitment," which defines short term actions that are in line with the
Hoja de Ruta. The topics include reforms in Basic Service Delivery, Education, Health and
Public Administration. More recently, in June 2004, a "Social Pact of Reciprocal
Commitments for Education" was prepared by six organizations under the leadership of the
National Council o f Education (Consejo Nacional de Educacidn). The main pillars o f this
agreement are: (i)   mobilization for quality learning; (ii) development strategy; (iii)
                                                               teacher
moralization of the sector and (iv) education financing, including compliance with the
annual increase in the education sector budget of 0.25% of the GDP.

29. The National Agreement has played a crucial role strengthening the acceptance of
reforms and placing some o f the main problems of the country on the public agenda. While
there i s general support for the basic goals and general policies defined in the document and
in later revisions, there have been political disputes about their implementation. Opposition
political parties have criticized the Government for not implementing the policies
adequately, but the recent signature of the Political, Economic and Social Short Term
Commitment appears to have eased the tensions and revamped confidence in the National
Agreement.

B. The Strategy for Poverty Reduction

30. The "Bases para la Estrategia de Superacio'n de la Pobreza y Oportunidades
Econdmicas para 10s Pobres - ESPOEP", which were approved in January 2003, set the
framework for government actions directed towards sustained poverty reduction. The
ESPOEP works on three pillars: (i)                    Dignity, (ii) and (iii)
                                                                        Equity                     Institutionality and ethics.
The initialpriorities set by the ESPOEP are:

0    Guarantee standards or minimum essential levels in basic social services delivery (health,
  education and hood securityhourishment) which include the poorest groups.
0    Reassign resources towards the two lower income quintiles, located in rural and urban-
  marginalized areas.
0    Integrate protection of human capital, giving priority to children and pregnant mothers.
0    Encourageeconomic opportunities, promoting decentralization and local potentialities.
31. On February 2004, the PCM published a Supreme Decree to strengthen the social
programs and projects and the implementation of the Social and Overcoming Poverty Policy
(Politica Social y de Lucha contra la Pobreza), strengthening the impetus to prioritise



                                                                    12

programs and coordinate and articulate actions to improve the efficiency of social public
expenditure. It also announced the creation of a Multi-sectoral Social Technical Committee
in charge of the coordinating with public institutions on the execution of the Social Policy,
the consistency of Strategic and Operative Plans, and the reassignment of priorities on the
social agenda. The Food Security Committee, the Overcoming poverty and Economic
Opportunities Committee, and the Rural Development Multi-sectoral Commission were
merged and their functions were assumed by the new Committee, except for the Food
Security Committee whose functions were assumed by the Inter-sectoral Commission for
Social Affaires (CIAS).

32. However, the main advancement made in this area was the elaboration of the Plan
Nacional para la Superacidn de la Pobreza 2004-2006 (National Plan for Poverty
Overcoming - hereafter PNSP). This plan includes (i)                          a General Plan; (ii) Plans for       Sectoral
Poverty Overcoming; (iii)           Thematic Strategies and Plans; (iv) Regional and Local Plans and
(v) a National Agenda for OvercomingPoverty.

33. This plan considers the problems associatedwith the current social expenditure programs
and policies and proposes a program to improve the quality and efficiency of social public
expenditure through five mechanisms: (i)                    priorization, (ii)      reassignment to target population,
(iii)
    reorientation, (iv) accountability; and (v) results-based management.

34. The PNSP also address the development of a monitoring and evaluation system. This
system consists of three modules: (i) policies and programs module, with a main set of
                                                      the
20 indicators settled by the Estrategia and second level indictors that will be defined by the
sectoral plans; (ii)          the investment module, which already operates as an instrument to
follow up projects and the construction of infrastructure; and (iii)                                    the budget execution
module, which monitors compliance with budget goals.




                                                               13

35. As part of the poverty reduction strategy, the GOP identified twenty goals to be achieved
by 2006. Eight of these goals are directly related to social program reforms supported by
PSRL. While the government defined these medium term indicators, no monitoring process
was set up, so assessing the progress Peru has made in these exact indicators i s not possible.
However, other indicators presentedin the Program Document do suggest that the country i s
performing well. The eight relevant medium term indicators are presented in table 3.

C. The DecentralizationProcess

36. As part of the effort to modernize the State and increase transparency, efficiency and
participation, in 2001 the Toledo government launched a gradual decentralization process.
As this process began several years later than it had in other countries in the region, Peru
was able to build on its experience and define a strategy that should result in a successful
transfer of programs and resources to regional and local authorities. The process has three
basic principles that guide all actions. First, decentralization should be fiscally neutral,
implying that increasing expenditures at the regional and local level should be compensated
by reductions in the central government budget. Second, the process must be gradual, to
guarantee that there i s continuity in service provision and that regional and local
governments are ready to receive the programs, functions, and resources to be transferred to
them. Finally, decentralization should enhance economic competitiveness by promoting
private sector development at the regional and local levels.

37. The Decentralization Framework Law was approved in July 2002, defining the basic
rules of the process, and the process has advanced with new Laws, regulations, and the
actual transfer of some programs. The Bank has been actively supporting the
decentralization process through sustained policy dialogue and, beginningin 2003, through a



                                               14

programmatic loan specifically designed for this (Decentralization and Competitiveness
Programmatic Loan - DECSAL). In addition, two Technical Assistance Loans for
decentralization will accompany and follow up on the PSRL (which only address some parts
of the initial transition stage of decentralization in the social sectors) In particular, the T A L
"Accountability for Decentralization" will address key decentralization issues in the social
sectors in more detail as they arise over the next years, particularly regarding the
decentralization of social programs. The DECSAL and the TALs will thus be the key
instruments to support        the decentralization process, while the PSRL addresses
decentralization only to the extent that i s has become relevant in the specific sectors at this
time.

38. In the Social Sectors, some programs already have been decentralized (in the area of
social protection) while others are expected to be transferred a later stage, when necessary
legislation i s approved and management systems are improved. The PSRL program was not
designed to support decentralization as a goal in itself, but it has adapted to and accompanied
the process. As Peru moved towards decentralization, the operation was adapted to respond
to changing government requests. Triggers and benchmarks were revised to ensure that
access and quality of service delivery in social protection, health, and education are
protected during the transfers, especially in the most risky initial transition period of
decentralization, and that opportunities to improve them were exploited. The PSRL
continues to focus on improving social sector services and outcomes, particularly enhancing
service delivery in this changing governance context. Thus, while this operation i s not
designed to support the decentralization process, several actions proposed in the policy
matrices of this and previous loans have a direct link to it.

                            IV. THE SOCIAL REFORMPROGRAM

The Social Sectors inPeruand the PSRL:The rationaleof the operation

39. After the Fujimori government fell in 2000, the new administration found itself in a
critical situation where social services provision was insufficient and inefficient, wrought
with access problems and a lack of transparency or monitoring. As the transitional
government began its term, efforts in the social sectors were focused on guaranteeing
continuity o f whatever programs existed and beginning a redesign process to improve the
overall program. In that context, the Bank provided support though the Programmatic Social
Reform Loan, approved in April 2001, with a focus on social expenditure, transparency, and
rationalization.

40. Since PSRL Iwas approved, there have been many changes in Peru. While the
macroeconomic front has stabilized and reached a sustained growth path, the political
climate has been more volatile, with President Toledo losing popular support rapidly. These
changes have implied different approaches for policy implementation in the social sectors.
The backbone of the program has maintained the same goals, namely, looking to (i)     improve
the anti-poverty focus of public expenditures, (ii)    improve access of the poor to quality
health and education services, and (iii)improve the transparency of social programs,
empowering their beneficiaries in the design and implementation of programs.

41. Although changes in authorities, political power balance, and economic and social
conditions led to necessary adjustments in the overall strategy, the actions supported by each
PSRL have consistently aimed at advancing these three goals. To achieve this, the program
has supported the adoption of policies and actions in five areas: (i)      social expenditures
management, (ii)   redesign, targeting, and administration of social protection programs, (iii)
access to health services, (iv) access and efficiency in education, and (v) transparency and
accountability in the social sectors:

    (i)     The Shift to Social Expenditures and Countercyclical Social Policy:
            a. Since PSRL I,the program has promoted the adoption of a medium term
                strategy in the assignment of resources to the social sectors. With Bank
                support, the Government began to consider social policy as part of the budget
                preparation process, making the procedure to assign resources to functions
                and programs more transparent and efficient. In 2001 the GOP prepared a
                Statement of Social Development Policy, a first step in defining a medium
                term view. In 2004, this work has evolved and resulted inthe preparation of a
                Macro Social Framework (MSF), as part of the Multiannual Macroeconomic
                Framework 2005-07. The MSF defines priorities and criteria for spending in
                the social sectors. Similarly, the 2005 draft budget law also publishes, for the
                first time, social policy goals and benchmarks for key monitoring indicators.
            b. Under PSRL, budget allocations to priority social programs (PSPs) have been
                protected in the context of fiscal retrenchment, initially to implement
                countercyclical social policy, and lately, to sustain pro-poor spending.
                Aiming to preserve the safety nets and increase the access of the poor to basic
                social services, the Bank has actively promoted budgetary protection of six



                                                16

         PSPs: initial, primary, and secondary education, individual and collective
         health, and social assistance. While most agreed spending targets have been
         achieved, sometimes with marginal under compliance, the continuous support
         in this area has had a significant effect in raising and stabilizing key social
         expenditures duringthe four-year period. From 1999 to 2003 expenditures on
         PSPs have doubled from 0.5% to 1% of GDP.

(ii)  Redesign, Targeting and Administration of Social Protection programs:
      a. PSRL I,   11,and I11supported the design and implementationof an emergency
         workfare program, "A Trabajar", which played an important role inproviding
         a safety net to poorer groups affected by the economic crisis. A Trabajar
         became a critical tool to compensate the effects of the economic crisis, acting
         as a countercyclical program. During the two years of maximum coverage
         (2002 and 2003) the program generated approximately 70,000 six-monthjobs
         in urban areas and 125,000 four-month jobs in rural areas. A Trabajar began
         to reduce the number of projects in 2004, as the economic situation improved,
         to approximately 40,000 beneficiaries.
      b. Food programs required deep revision to improve targeting and transparency.
         The Bank supported the development and use of poverty maps to improve
         targeting and the redesignof programs. Due to political constraints, efforts to
         consolidate nutrition and food programs had limited success, but increased
         transparency and adoption of explicit rules on management and procurement
         (as discussed inpoint e.iv) have resultedin a more efficient overall program.
      c. Two critical areas of the pension system were revised with support from
         PSRL. First, the civil servants scheme, a highly subsidized and unequal
         program, was reformed, reducing fiscal and equity problems. Also, the
         institutional design of the sector was improved, defining responsibilities for
         strategy and policy making decisions and adopting the goal of coverage
         expansion as an overall objective of the system.
(iii) Accesstohealthservices:
      a. With support from PSRL, Peru has reformed its basic model of health
         management, provision, and financing. The increasing role of the regional
         health departments ("DISAS") improved the accountability and transparency
         of the system, as DISAS are signing results agreements with the Ministry of
         Health and publishing monitoring indicators. B y supporting the expansion of
         community managed health centers ("CLAS"), the program empowered local
         communities and beneficiaries. Finally the creation of a basic health
         insurance scheme ("SIS") resulted in a large scale increase in the provision of
         health services for mothers and children. B y the end of 2003-2004, this
         program covered nearly 2.5 million children and 725,000 pregnant women,
         indicating that coverage i s almost universal. This i s an impressive result for a
         program that i sjust a few years old.

(iv) Access and efficiency in education:
     a. The PSRL program on education supported reforms aimed at improving
         efficiency, equity and quality o f education in Peru by:          (a) increasing




                                        17

       financing of the sector while ensuring improved efficiency (total budget for
       education went from 2.7% of GDP to 3.1% from 2000 to 2004); and (b)
       reforming the teaching career in order to improve the quality of all teachers,
       particularly those working in rural areas (by developing better control and an
       incentives scheme).
    b. While political changes and other restrictions made advances in this area
       especially difficult, the education sector has made some important
       achievements, some of which would not have occurred in the absence of the
       PSRL Program. One of the most relevant achievements i s the development
       and implementationof the Human Resources system that will make it feasible
       to plan and develop sector policies. In addition, and linked to the human
       resources management system, MINED has developed an incentives system
       focusing on hardship incentives for rural teachers and universal merit
       incentives. Finally, transparency in the sector was significantly increased with
       PSRL support. Student performance results are now publishedregularly, and
       participatory school councils are being created nationwide to monitor school
       performance.

(v) Transparency and Accountability in the social sectors:
    a. The program was initiated during the post-Fujimori transition and supported
       the strategy of the incoming Government to enhance a weakened governance
       context characterized by a lack of government transparency, increased levels
       of corruption, poor accountability, and little opportunity for citizen
       participation. Later on, when the GOP decided to embark in a process of
       decentralization, the program supported additional measures to improve the
       transparency and accountability of this process, particularly in what relates to
       the social programs.
    b. With support from the PSRL program, the GOP created a legal framework
       and information portal to guarantee citizens access to information, improved
       the transparency and efficiency in procurement procedures, and strengthened
       the government's capacity for fighting corruption. As the decentralization
       process expanded, PSRL promoted the adoption of a legal framework that
       could guarantee a manageable transition. The new legal framework strongly
       promotes citizen participation in public policy and budgetingat the municipal
       level, helping to promote a culture of participation that has resulted in
       substantial consultations between the MEF and civil society on draft laws
       and other initiatives, such as inparticipatory budgeting.
    c. PSRL strongly endorsed the development of "Ventana Amigable", a web
       based public information system which i s providing timely, trustful and
       disaggregate information that enables civil society organizations and citizens
       to track budgets and public expenditures, as well as the institutionalization of
       all participatory processes, by incorporating them into a results-based
       monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. The M&E system, coordinated by
       the MEF, has institutionalized links to existing monitoring systems in the
       health, education, and social protection sectors, thus providing a unique
       opportunity to integrate tracking of national social policy and decision-
       making.As decentralization proceeds in the social protection programs, new



                                       18

                tools for M&E are becoming available (Management Agreements and
                Accreditation Regulations) including incentives and links to results for
                monitoring and participation. These tools will help government track the
                progress in reaching the objectives of the PSPs, within a decentralized
                context, while contributing to transparency, quality, and efficiency of social
                expenditures, and giving citizens and service users a voice in decision-
                making.
           d. PSRL supported important changes in procurement procedures for the social
                sectors that resultedin increasing transparency, economy, and efficiency. An
                e-government was introduced (with the creation of a web based procurement
               portal for more than 600 public agencies) and the supervision and control
               rules inpublic procurement were unified.
42. Table 4 gives a history of key actions completed within each stage of the PSRL program,
placing the key actions of PSRL N within a historical trajectory and presenting some
indicators of progress (quantitative and qualitative) in the different areas.

43. A more detailed discussion of each area of the program i s presented next including a
brief description of the challenges for policy design and implementation identified at the
early stages of the program, the strategy designed by the Government to develop solutions,
advances obtained during the implementation of PSRL I,11, and 111,the rationale and goals
of actions included in PSRL N, and finally, a comment about the perspectives and
sustainability of reforms in each sector.

A. Improving the anti-poverty focus of publicexpenditures.

44. The Government of Peru (GOP) i s improving the anti-poverty focus of public
expenditures to reinforce targeting and increase effectiveness. To this end, four groups of
activities (described below) are being implemented:             (i)formulation and initial
implementation of a poverty reduction strategy, (ii)reorientation of public expenditures
towards social programs that benefit the poor, (iii)improvements in targeting social
expenditures by reforming pension systems, establishing a well-targeted anti-cyclical
workfare program, and improving targeting of infrastructure rural programs, and (iv) reform
of food distribution programs through integration, improved targeting, and focusing of
results.

          A.1. Poverty Reduction Strategy
45. The lack of a strategy has weakened the impact of Peru`s anti-poverty efforts during the
last decade. Absence of clear objectives, coexistence and overlapping social programs in
different sectors, a lack of coordination between sectors and programs, inadequate designs,
and insufficient accountability and monitoring and evaluation systems were some of the
main problems in this area. These problems were reinforced by a clientelistic and opaque use
of the anti-poverty programs. This has led to inefficiencies, increased administrative costs,
poor targeting of beneficiaries, and the presence of programs that do not contribute to
reducing poverty or increasing human capital.

46. Duringthe transition government, and underPRSL1, a "Social Letter"(Carta Social) was
approved b y the Mesa de Concertacidn de Lucha contra la Pobreza. The Social Letter
established broad guidelines for poverty reduction via social and economic policy adopted
by the State, civil society, the Catholic Church, and international cooperation agencies.
During the preparation of PSRL 11, in December 2001, President Toledo issued a Social
Policy Letter stating the "pillars" that guide the government's social policy (Dignity, equity
and institutionality). In July 2002, the National Agreement (Acuerdo National) was signed
by representatives of political, religious, civil society and Government groups, approving 29
State policies, including one for poverty reduction. The poverty reduction strategy was
further developed during the preparation of PSRL I11with the publication of the Basespara
la Reduccidn de la Pobreza. The Buses are described insection 1II.B.

47.Under PSRL N, the anti-poverty strategy will become part of the Governments'
mainstream planning and budgeting process through the adoption of a macro-social multi-
annual framework within the macroeconomic multi-annual framework. This policy will have
several advantages: (i) macroeconomic multi-annual framework i s institutionalized and
                         the
has to be approved each year by the council of ministers, (ii)   it will set the base for multi-
annual budgeting in the social sectors and could provide clearer protection for priority
programs, (iii) it will establish clearer objectives, goals, and policies for social policy in a
medium-term strategy, and (iv) it will help the institutionalization of social programs within
the decentralization process.

          A.2. Shiftingto Pro-Poor Expenditure
48. Budgetary protection under PSRLs has played a critical role in preserving, augmenting,
and improving the quality of pro-poor social expenditure. Between 1999 and 2004, a set of
Priority Social Programs (PSPs) has doubled the budget execution assigned to them (Table



                                                22

5). Execution has also shifted from low performing education programs to high performing
health and social assistance programs that are devoted to extreme poverty and will be
executed by local governments. Deviations between planned and executed priority
expenditures have also decreased over time, except for secondary education and collective
health. This shows that the budget i s increasingly being used as a guide for allocations, and
budgetary protectioni s thus playing a critical role inplanning and execution.

Activities supported by PSRL I,II and III

49. The rationale for budgetary protection has evolved. Whereas it was previously seen as
playing solely a countercyclical role under PSRL I,in PSRL IV it i s seen as a key financing
tool of the Peruvian poverty reduction strategy. The Government initiated a social protection
policy in the 2001 budget. Initially, it selected 11 budget programs distributed among eight
sectors (budgetary functions): education and culture, health, transport, justice, social and
community assistance, sanitation, agriculture and energy. Initially, budgetary protection
consisted in assigning a minimum envelope for the 11 programs equivalent to US$1 billion
(NW3.5 billion), 9.9 percent of the national budget or 1.9 percent of GDP. It focused on
what i s a priori-defined as quality pro-poor social spending: non-salary current (non-wage,
benefits or pension) and capital outlays. Yet, the following year, it became apparent that both
the number of programs and the amount of the budget protected were excessive.
Furthermore, what began in Peru as a tool for preserving a minimum level of quality social
investment through fiscal adjustment soon became an instrument for guaranteeing the
financing required for the achievement of Peru's poverty reduction goals in the medium-
term.

50. Thus, under PSRL 11,the Government not only complied with the execution of the 2001
budget for the protected programs, but also started to fine-tune its policy. Spending in these
programs surpassed the target--reaching US$1.1 billion--despite recessionary trends,
reflecting a desired anti-cyclical behavior that i s a-typical in social expenditure. However,
upon review of the experience of 2001, four issues were identified: (i)    budget protection at
the level of aggregate sector expenditure (functions) was also needed to guarantee the
"floor" spending needed to make progress towards medium-termdevelopment goals; (ii)         the
broad coverage of protected programs and large amount assigned to them augmented budget
rigidity; (iii)
              a few individual programs exhibited significant deviations between planned and
executed expenditures, with all education programs showing a significant under-execution,
and social and community assistance indicating over-execution; and (iv) critical monitoring
and evaluation of protected spending was missing. Consequently, the protection policy was
refined. Budgetary protection at the level of aggregate sector expenditure was also
introduced. Protection was limited to 6 selected programs in 3 sectors (down from 11
programs in 8 sectors), which reduced budget rigidity. The global allocation to the reduced
set of PSPs became equivalent to 1.2% of GDP, slightly up from 1.1% of GDP in 2001
(Table 5). To deal with deviations between planned and executed expenditure, individual
targets for each of the programs were again defined for 2002, but with flexible contingency
clauses in the event of a budgetary resources shortfall and to allow up to 30 percent spending
reallocations from under executing to over executing programs. In addition, there was an
agreement to develop pilots for user-friendly monitoring and evaluation tools for PSPs,
supported by the SIAF, and in some cases, performance management contracts for specific

projects (sub-categories of the PSPs) like A Trubujur or the Mother and Child Health
Insurance (SIS-MI).

51. Under PSRL 111, the Government continued to perform well in the implementation of
budgetary protection. The global executed expenditure for the three priority social sectors-
education, health and social assistance-and                   six programs exceeded their aggregate targets
(adjusted in real terms) in 2002. In addition, the original individual execution targets, which
allowed inter-program transfers of up to 50 percent of their original allocations for the three
education PSPs--pre-primary education, primary education and secondary education, were
also met. Authorities also approved four individual 2003 budget allocations to PSPs that
were above their executed 2002 level, adjusted in real terms. To ban further diversion of
funds from the PSPs in education, the 2004 Budget Law (art. 8) introduced an explicit
prohibition against this practice. Indeed, in 2001 and 2002, failure to comply with education
priority expenditures (mainly textbooks and internet connections in schools) was due to
budgetary malpractices wherein reallocation of funds to payroll increases or the hiring of
new teachers were allowed. Finally, to improve the execution capacity, the Government and
the Bankjointly prepared a Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) for increased accountability of
the Social Sectors. Approved in July 2004, the Loan aims to develop a monitoring and
evaluation system inthe social sectors, with an initial focus on close monitoring of the PSPs.

52. Decentralization, however, brought new challenges to budgetary protection policy.
While in theory decentralization can help increase the efficiency of social expenditures,
make social programs more responsive and more responsible to local demands, and enhance



                                                              24

the transparency and accountability for more effective service delivery, at least in its initial
stages, decentralization faces serious challenges. Aside from the diversion of funds and low
execution capacity, five new issues related to decentralization have arisen since 2003: (i)  the
extent to which the six social programs will continue to be implemented by sub national
governments has been opened for review; (ii)      significant uncertainty has arrisen from the
timing of the transfer of education and health sectors to regional and local governments,
since the actual date for the transfer has not been set; (iii)
                                                            pressure for budget under-funding
to PSPs has intensified from concurrent needs to finance additional spending requiredby the
installation of sub national governments (still in a context of fiscal retrenchment). This has
led to a mutual commitment between the Government and the Bank: whereas 2003 global
execution was reduced to at least 85 percent for 2003, the room for budget reallocations
from under-performing to over-perfonning programs decreased from 50 percent to 30
percent; (iv) the social community and assistance program was redefined so as to let the
Government merge social programs dealing with extreme poverty -food              supplementary,
social and economic infrastructure investment and family assistance-under       MIMDES,thus
gradually decentralizing their execution at the municipal level; and (v) given newly
decentralized programs, the lack of a monitoring and evaluation system at the local level has
become critical. The set of SIAF supported pilot monitoring indicators in three projects,
whose resources are part of the PSP envelope: the SIS-MI, the food supplementary program
(PRONAA), and the urban emergency employment creation program (A Trabujar) has
become insufficient. The need to speed-up the development of a SIAF for local governments
(now known as SIAF-GL) with the support of the TAL has also become apparent.

Triggers, Benchmarks and Monitoring Indicators under PSRL IV

53. In response to the need to preserve national policy priorities through decentralized
programs, a Marco Social Multianual (MSM) was presented as a chapter of the Marco
Macroeconomico Multianual (MMM).The MMMprovides an annual consensus on national
macro/fiscal priorities. It i s approved by the Cabinet every year, subject to quarterly reviews,
and published by the media. Introduction of a social chapter reflects a medium-term
commitment by the Cabinet to the social priorities of the national agenda, a commitment that
should be ratified through participatorybudgeting processes with sub national authorities.

54. It was agreed that new legislation to preserve priority social spending through
conditioned (programhticas) transfers of the education and health sectors would be submitted
to Congress, but such decisions have not yet been implemented and will likely not be in the
future. Authorities have indicated that this i s due to the Executive's decision to delay
decentralization of the education and health sectors until 2006, and to the fact that some
aspects of such a bill can be retained through the bill recently approved on the accreditation
of sub national governments (and its regulations under preparation).

55. The global execution benchmark for PSPs in 2003 was missed by a marginal amount
(less than 2 percent), thus partially reflecting the under-funding associated with the fiscal
costs of decentralization. However, to offset this and comply with minimumfloor spending,
the Government approved two supplementary budget allocations, in June and October 2004.
These allocations have allowed it to maintain the 2004 global allocation and reach no less
than three individual budget allocations for the PSPs. In a similar vein, the government has
submitted a draft 2005 budget law containing global allocation levels and four individual




                                                25

allocations greater than their 2004 levels, adjusted in real terms. On the other hand, the
government overcomplied with de-seasonalized minimum levels of execution on the PSPs
agreed for 2004, during the months prior to appraisal of this loan (January-August 2004).
The level reached (87%) was above the target of 85 percent of the agreed global amount, and
preserved individual reallocations between PSPs below 30 percent of their targeted amount.
Reallocations, based on January-August 2004 execution were- initial education (12%);
primary education (-24%); secondary education (-20%); individual health (1%); collective
health (-14%); and social assistance (-21%).

56. Inresponse to the uncertainty introduced by MIMDES over the future of social programs
supported by the TAL, the Government has continued to complete the regulatory framework
with the approval of an Accreditation Law, improving targeting, issuing complementary
norms, and developing local capacity so as to prevent deterioration of service provision in
food-aid and infrastructure programs being gradually decentralized (see Section on Food
Programs below).

57. Based on the successful pilot experiences and supported by the TAL, the SIAF-GL i s
also being introduced to 80 percent of local governments. Inthe future, this will contribute
to improving PSPs focus, efficiency, transparency and proper monitoring mechanisms of
decentralized programs. SIAF-GLi s being complemented by SIME (Sistema de Informaci6n
de Monitoreo y Evaluacih), a system specially designed to track and control transfers to
local governments by MIMDES linked to SIAF and aimed at monitoring not only physical
and financial benchmarks agreed for the PSPs but also compliance with performance
management contracts by local governments, targeting requirements, and other accreditation
mechanisms.

58. PSRL I11also supported the preparation of a draft Law of Conditioned (ProgramBticas)
Transfers, regulating the process for decentralizing social services, but it was not approved.
Following the publication of the Annual Schedule for Sectoral Decentralization on March
2004, which did not mention Education and Health as sectors-to-be decentralized in 2005, it
became clear that the Executive considered that their decentralization was not a short-term
priority, as the institutional and political environment were not ready for the decentralization
of these sectors. The Bank agreed with such assessments. To partially offset this, Authorities
then decided to introduce key aspects of the previous bill in (a) the recently approved
Accreditation Law, which allows for Cooperation Agreements between the Central and
regional and local governments, and in (b) the 2004 and draft General Budget Law, whose
draft has been prepared and is expected to be approved before November 30, 2004, that
authorize the signing of Management Agreements between multiple entities of the Central
and Sub-national Governments. Once in place, these legal norms will allow MEF and the
Ministries of Education and Health to sign management agreements (Convenios de
Administracion de Resultados--CARs) with regional or local governments referring to
specific functions or competencies associated with the resources transferred b y the Central
Government, as well as with other results-oriented mechanisms. In the meantime, the
Ministry of Health has already signed 23 out of 26 management agreements with its
Regional Directorates in order to decentralize the administration o f specific health
competencies, effective from January lSt,    2005.

           A.3. Targeting of Social programs: Pension Reform
59. With more than half a century of history and several major reforms, including the
introduction of a funded scheme in 1992, Peru's pension system has yet to achieve its main
goal of providing income security to the elderly. As of 2003, Only 14 percent of the labor
force contributed to one of the existing programs, and 25 percent of the elderly received a
benefit. Considering that nearly 40 percent of the population aged 65 and older lives on an
income below the poverty line, and that participation in the pension system i s strongly
correlated with income level (only 0.5 percent of the workers in the poorest quintile make
contributions to Social Security, and coverage among the poorest quintile of the elderly i s
2.3%), it i s safe to assert that the system i s in need of a serious assessment and reforms. The
situation in Peru i s one of the worst in Latin America, since, of the fourteen countries with
information on the percentage of economically active population contributing to the Social
Security system, only Bolivia and Paraguay have lower rates.

60. While the system's coverage i s low, Peru makes a significant fiscal effort to finance its
pension systems from general revenues, partly as a result of the transition costs generated by
the 1992 reform andpartly due to the deficit of the Civil Servants program. The deficit of the
public pension systems i s close to 2 percent of GDP, equivalent to 69 percent of the amount
set aside to service Peru's external debt; 63 percent of public spending on education; 1.8
times the government's expenditure on healthcare; and 1.4 times the amount set aside to
alleviate poverty.

61. The pension system in Peru has three main components. The Private Pensions System
(Sistema Privado de Pensiones-SPP), created in 1992, which covers wage earners from both
private and public sector and operates as a funded, privately managed scheme. The system i s
runby four pension fund managers ("AFP", for its acronym in Spanish), with approximately
3 million affiliated workers (of which one third, or close to 8% of the labor force, make
regular contributions). While the system i s supposed to operate under competitive rules,
most workers lack the necessary information and interest to make the market work, and fees
have been too high. The supervisory agency has been trying to promote new regulations that
would reduce costs and increase efficiency, with mixed results.

62. The second component of the pension system i s the National Pensions System (Sistema
Nacional de Pensiones-SNP), a traditional PAYG scheme for workers who choose to stay in
a publicly managed scheme, instead of the SPP. The system pays a defined benefits pension
after 20 years of contributions and 65 years of age. SNP also pays benefits to workers retired
before the 1992 reform and provides a transitional bond to those who joined the SPP but had
previously contributed to the public system. The program i s managed by a central pension
office ("Oficina de Nomalizacih Previsional"- ONP), an autonomous agency attached to the
Ministry of Economy and Finance. In 2004 there were 970 thousand contributors to this
regime and 409 thousand beneficiaries, with a total expenditure of S./ 3.0 billion, or 1.5% of
GDP. Seventy seven percent of this expenditure had to be financed by the treasury. Several
parametric reforms introduced by Law 27617 in early 2002 have corrected a medium to long
term tendency to increase deficits, and current projections indicate that the cost will slowly
decline to around 0.2 percent of GDP in the medium term.

 63. Finally, a civil servants program called CCdula Viva (CV) offers very generous benefits
 and runs a large deficit, close to 2 percent of GDP in 2003. Workers can retire after fifteen



                                                   27

years of service, with no minimumage, and benefits are equal to 100 percent of the wage of
active civil servants. While the system i s formally closed since the early 1970s, legal
challenges and pressures have limited the effect of this restriction and many workers and
officials have been able to obtain benefits under this regime. As of this year, the system had
approximately 23 thousand active contributors and 295 thousand beneficiaries, and was
paying SJ4.7 billion a year (approximately 2% of GDP) of which 99% was financed by the
treasury.

64. The most critical problem in Peru's pension system i s the very low coverage, especially
among the poor, and the lack of a reasonable strategy to overcome it. While the main cause
of this can be linkedto weak labor markets and extended informality, specific measures can
be adopted to improve access, without generating additional fiscal pressures or creating
negative incentives for labor force formalization. As fiscal resources are limited, efforts
should be made to increase compliance within the existing systems by improving
enforcement and by increasing incentives to reduce undesired subsidies to mid and high
income beneficiaries and to protect the poor elderly excluded from the system. New,
targeted, non-contributory benefits designed to complement the pension system benefits
could be created to provide basic assistance to the poorest elderly, preserving the fiscal
sustainability. A medium term strategy should be developed to attain these goals, but until
recently, this responsibility was not held by any government office. Until mid 2003, most
strategic decisions were made at the Ministry of Economy and Finance, despite the fact that
the Ministry did not have a unit or any staff officially in charge of the area.

65. The fiscal cost of CV and SNP limits the possibility of developing a targeted anti-
poverty program for the elderly. Expenditures in these two programs are inflexible. Still,
they should decline over time, provided that there are no new successful challenges to the
legal framework. Simulations prepared b y World Bank staff indicate that expected savings in
the next few years should be enough to finance a targeted, non-contributory benefit to cover
poor individuals aged 75 and older.

66. The Private Pension System, SPP, has some important efficiency problems, which affect
the cost of the system for active workers and reduce the incentive to participate. Both at the
accumulating stage and after retirement, the level of competition among providers i s low,
resulting in high costs for workers and high returns for fund managers. (In 2002 the average
return on equity for pension fund managing companies was close to 80 percent). The
excessive costs in the accumulating stage result in lower income for workers, and on top of
that, high fees in the annuity markets result in lower retirement benefits. The regulatory
framework was designed assuming a competitive environment, but the industry appears to
have an oligopolistic structure, as it does in other countries inthe region.

Government Strategy

67. The Government's view of the pension system has been strongly focused on the fiscal
implications of the two public schemes. Many attempts to close the "Cedula Viva" program
have failed since the early 1960s, as legislators refused to support the reforms or they were
overturn by the Judiciary. On the SNP front, a major factor in deciding the 1992 reform was
the expected high cost the system would have in the medium term and the serious difficulties
of financing it. In this context, the main goal of the Government, throughout most of the




                                                28

1990s and also in recent years, has been,to reduce exposure to fiscal pressures from both
public systems and to promotethe transfer of workers to the new private scheme.

68. The strategy has focused on limiting benefits in the public schemes (especially for CV
beneficiaries), while making the SPP more attractive. With this goal, attempts to control the
civil servants scheme have included regulations to obtain information on its beneficiaries to
verify their legal status and monitor the system, and measures that make the system less
appealing to workers. In 1996 the ONP (Pension Normalization Office) was able to collect
information at the national level for the first time, and a special commission created in 2001
recommended a number of changes inthe system to reduce its cost.

69. More recently, a Legislative Decree (817) and a Law (26835) established maximum
benefits and reduced survivors benefits, but they were declared unconstitutional by the
Constitutional Court in 1997. In 2003 a Supreme Decree (043-2003-EF) required that all
public agencies paying CV benefits with funds from the National Treasury had to prepare a
report for ONP with detailed information on active workers and retirees, and this
information has slowly been sent by the different agencies

70. Regarding SNP, the Government has made a sustained effort to improve the
administration and management of the system. Processing time for issuing recognition bonds
has been reduced, and important efforts have been made to reduce inequities between SNP
and SPP. In recent years, new legislation allowing early retirement for some workers (such
as miners and workers who could retire early in SNP but not on SPP) in SPP and the
approval of a minimumpension for SPP beneficiaries (which was originally set in the 1992
legislation, but never implemented) have reduced pressure from some groups to switch back
from SPP to SNP. Earlier this year a new Law was approved, authorizing workers to switch
back when it i s clear that their rights were negatively affected by joining an AFP, a measure
that significantly reduced the political pressure to open unlimited switching among the two
regimes.

71. Finally, the work to improve efficiency and reduce costs in SPP has been permanent. In
the last year an important change inthe process for hiringinsurance companies for disability
and survivor benefits resulted in a reduction of average fees charged by AFPs. In September
2004 the SBS announced new measures, including the authorization for internet-based
transfers among AFPs, simplification of transfer procedures, and the authorization of
discounts in fees for workers that remain on AFP for certain lengths of time. All these
measures should result in improved transparency and competition, and, consequently, a
reduction infees inthe medium term.

Activities supported by PSRL I,II and III

72. While the problems of the pension system were not included in PSRL I(when the focus
was on the social and economic emergency), PSRL I1 supported the approval and
implementation of Law 27617. This law introduced several changes in the three pension
systems, reducing costs for the C V regime and making the SNP and SPP more equitable and
transparent. Among the main aspects of the new legislation, there were: a reduction of
benefits to survivors under the Cedula Viva regime, from 100% of deceased's benefits to
5096, creation of a new Recognition Bond, for workers who made contributions to SNP and
then joined SPP, compensation for contributions made until December 2001 (otherwise,



                                                 29

workers were penalized for switching to SPP), reestablishment of the minimumpension for
beneficiaries of SPP, and early retirement allowed for some workers under SPP with benefits
equivalent to SNP.

73. PSRL I11 focused on the institutional and transparency problems of the system as a
whole and supported the approval of MEF's resolution RM326-2003-EF/I5, which assigned
to the "Direcci6n General de Asuntos Economicos y Sociales ("DGAES") of the Ministry
the task of designing a strategy to increase coverage and efficiency of the system and
collecting and disseminating information about the system as a whole.

74. Also, PSRL I11supported two laws approved in July 2003 which established a special
contribution to C V that would be made by beneficiaries receiving more than S/43,600 a year,
increased contribution rates for CV participants from 6% to 12% immediately with further
increases to reach 27% by 2009, and created a maximum benefit for new retirees under C V
of S/3100. These laws should make the C V regime less appealing to current and future
workers limiting the pressuresto bendthe rules and enrol inthe system.

Triggers, Benchmarks and Monitoring Indicatorsfor PSRL IV

75. Following advances under PSRL I1and 111, PSRL IV i s supporting the consolidation of
reforms aiming at improvements in the institutional framework, reductions in inequities and
softening of fiscal pressures from the public pension schemes. As expected in PSRL 111,the
DGAES has prepared a strategy document, called "Plan de Acci6n de 10s Sistemas de
Pensiones en el Peni" (Action Plan for Pension Systems in Peru), where a clear diagnostic i s
presented and concrete measures to reduce costs and increase coverage (including
quantitative goals) are proposed. DGAES has also prepared and published a statistical report
for Peru's pension system as a whole, integratingthe information of the different systems.

76. Laws 28046 (establishing contributions of C V beneficiaries to a solidarity fund) and
28047 (increasing contributions to CV) have been implemented and savings or additional
contributions are being registered. While law 28047 has been fully implemented for most of
2004, Law 28046 suffered some technical delays but was finally implemented by mid 2004.
Total collection from the application of both laws has been approximately S./ 75 million per
year.

77. Finally, the Government has unexpectedly moved towards a new attempt to completely
close the C V regime. To avoid the traditional constitutional problems, the Government has
proposed a Constitutional Amendment to modify the clauses that protect C V participants.
This amendment was approved on a first review inMay 2004, with wide support (96 out of
 112 Congress members supported the reform), and a second and definite vote i s schedule for
the second semester of 2004. If the amendment i s finally approved, new legislation
eliminating the CCdula Viva scheme will be immediately introduced in Congress.

Perspectives and Sustainability of Reforms

78. After years of minor changes and frustrated reforms, the Government of Peru started a
strong push towards rationing and increasing the efficiency of its pension schemes. The
decision to promote a Constitutional Amendment shows the level of commitment and
ownership of these reforms, and the support this proposal has received in Congress indicate



                                               30

that the compromise includes most political parties. Once the amendment i s approved, the
Government will, for the first time, have the capacity to effectively close the CV system,
eliminating a long-live source of fiscal problems and inequity.

79. For the first time in decades, Peru now has a government area incharge of designing and
supervising pension policy. The DGAES has assumed the task seriously, creating a team to
work on this and producing solid background analysis and documents. As expected, the
strategy document not only defined actions but it set clear indicators and objectives within a
timeframe. Among the most relevant data, the strategy aims to reduce the transfers of funds
from the Treasury to Cedula Viva from the current 10.6% of the total budget to 8.6% by
2008 and to increase coverage in the SPP from the current 11.2% of the EAP to 14.5%, also
by 2008.

80. The Bank will continue to support the consolidation of this policy beyond the PSRL.
Through continuous policy dialogue and financing through the Accountability for
Decentralizationin the Social Sectors Technical Assistance Loan approved on July 15,2004,
different activities of the DGAES will result in an institutional strengthening of this area
within MEF.

81. While it was not included explicitly as part of the policy matrix, the private SPP scheme
has also registered some advances. A review of the rules to contract life and disability
insurance by pension fund managers has resulted in a reduction of total fees paid by workers
of approximately 1096, and the changes announced in September 2004 about procedures to
switch funds and fees' structures could result inhigher competition and lower costs, creating
incentives for higher participation and coverage. These measures were contemplated in the
strategy document prepared by the government.

         A.4. Targeting and Decentralization of Social Programs. Workfare, rural
         infrastructure and food programs
Government Strategy

82. The economic crisis of the late 1990s resulted in serious problems in the labor market
and affected the income of the poor. The poverty rate grew by 7 percentage points in four
years, and urban unemployment reached 9 percent. In September 2001 the Government
launched "A Trabajar", a workfare program with rural and urban components. While the
urban component was designed as a "pure" workfare program (with low wages, high
proportion of expenditures in unskilled workers and secondary relevance of outputs), the
rural component was closer to an infrastructure program, where the main goal was to
renovate decaying structures and build new ones. The programs expanded rapidly, and b y
2002 and 2003 generated almost 200,000 short termjobs, inmore than 4,000 projects.

83. As the economic situation improved, the Government decided to start phasing out the
programs. The urban component was scheduled to be closed during 2003, and the rural
component would continue as a better designed infrastructure program. However, both
programs have continued throughout 2004, at a smaller scale than in previous years.

84. Since the 1990s, Peru has had a number of nutrition and supplementary food programs
that tended to overlap, with inadequate funding, little planning, and no monitoring or




                                               31

evaluations. While some programs hadclear nutritional objectives, other used the food aid as
a conditional transfer to reach other goals, such as income redistribution, school attainment,
etcetera. Beginning in 2001 the Government started an attempt to reorganize the sector, to
improve its overall efficiency and access by the poor. Then main goals in this process have
been:

            a. Retargeting,i.e. allocating funds and resources to those who need them most

            b. Decentralization, through transferring administration and implementation of
                programs to sub-national governments

            c. Transparency, by promoting accountability and civil society participation in
                the monitoring of programs.

85. The GOP administers about 14 different food programs, not all of them with national
coverage, with varied objectives and institutional arrangements. In 2003 total spending in
food programs was about S/. 850 million or about 0.45 percent of GDP. The main program,
Vaso de Leche, i s decentralized, as it i s administered and implemented by the district
municipalities. The other main programs --comedores populares, desayunos escolares,
alimentacih infantil, and papilla infantil, with a total budget in 2003 of S/. 505 million, are
still centrally administered by PRONAA, within the MlMDES, and have started a process of
decentralization.

Activities supported by PSRL I,II and III

86. Beginning with PSRL 11, the Bank has actively supported the implementation of A
Trabajar, as the main tool in Peru's anti-cyclical policy for the labor market. The focus of
the programs was to improve targeting by requiring that at least 67 per cent of workers in the
urban component and 49 percent in the rural component belong to the first and second
(poorest) quintiles. Also, it was agreed that the urban program would spend at least 75
percent of its budget on unskilled labor, while for the rural scheme the percentage was
reduced to 40 percent, recognizing the important role of the program for the rural
infrastructure situation. Finally, an impact evaluation of the programs was prepared under
the support of PSRL11.

87. PSRL I11 continued to support the development and implementation of A Trabajar,
requiring improvements in the targeting (as the percentage of workers from the first two
quintiles would have to by 80 percent). The participation of unskilled labor in total budgets
was maintained and new impact evaluation analyses were required.

88. As the program was expected to be phased out, it was not considered when the triggers
and benchmarks for PSRL IV were first discussed. While there has been a change in this
policy andA Trabajar has not been completely eliminated, a major overhaul has taken place,
as the program i s now a better defined counter-cyclical policy instrument. This redesign and
its implementationhave received direct support from IDB and some bilateral donors, making
any additional support from the World Bank redundant. Hence, PSRL IV i s not supporting
policies related to this program.




                                               32

89. In 2001 and 2002, with the support of PSRL Iand 11, the government placed most food
and nutrition programs under the direction of one single institution, PRONAA. It also
reduced the budget of bad performing programs in order to protect better targeted, well
performing ones. In turn, the PSRL I11 supported the government in the initiation of the
decentralization process, by supporting the transfer of programs to municipalities.

90. The transfer of social programs to regional and local governments i s a long term project,
and some food programs have been the first to be transferred to municipalities. The
Government has implemented these transfers slowly, beginning with the Comedores
Populares program. Under PSRL I11the GOP presented a draft law of "Intergovernmental
Transfers" to Congress to formalize the transfer of resources to sub-national governments.
This law had three objectives: (i) protect resources from being diverted to other uses in
                                     to
the context of increasing decentralization; (ii) formalize the use of a pro-poor formula in
                                                to
later years for allocation to municipalities; and (iii) establish that the resources would be
                                                      to
transferred following performance agreements signed between a central agency and local
governments with a participatory monitoring mechanism.

Triggers,Benchmarks, and Monitoring Indicatorsfor PSRL N

91. At the time PSRL I11 was approved, the GOP and the Bank had assessed that the
Intergovernmental Transfer Law presented to Congress would be approved smoothly. Within
that context, a set of four conditions were defined, to ensure (i) application of the pro-
                                                                 proper
poor formula in the budget distribution, (ii)  the signature of performance agreements with
executing municipalities to guarantee service delivery; (iii)  the production and diffusion of
monitoring information for local communities; and (iv) the existence of a mechanisms to
ensure compliance with targets ineach municipality

92. However, the political debate stalled the draft law discussion, forcing the Government to
explore alternative ways to assure that the food programs will be protected during the
vulnerable first transition period to decentralization. Congress approved an Accreditation
law in June 2004, regulating the system to certify the management capacity of regional and
local governments, as described in detail in Annex 2, as well as a supreme decree defining
the way programs are to be targeted. The accreditation law makes reference to the criteria
for the transfer of responsibilities and resources to local governments, but given its general
nature, it does not specifically include information on how compliance with targets will be a
criterion for the transfer of resources for food programs to the municipalities where
performance agreements have been signed (point (iv) in the trigger). However, the
regulations of the Accreditation Law - the current draft to be approved this year - make the
linkbetween the accreditation process andperformance management agreements.

93. In addition, MIMDES has also passed several ministerial resolutions addressing
specifically the transfer of social programs, including one that stipulates a set of incentives
and penalties for compliance with agreed targets, which i s part of the performance
agreements signed with municipalities, and a Supreme Decree issued in September 2004
requires the use of pro-poor criteria inthe distribution of funds for social programs.

94. The target o f 50 performance agreements has been exceeded. In the case of food
programs, out of the 67 municipalities accredited to administer the Comedores Populares
program, 64 have signed management contracts with MIMDES and the other three have



                                               33

requested MIMDES to administer the program on their behalf. Another 27 performance
agreements have been signed between the MLMDES and district municipalities on the
transfer of Social Fundresources. These management contracts aim to ensure more efficient
and effective management of resources and guarantee minimum levels of service-delivery.
They specify the resources transferred, the purpose for which they can be used, the targets
that need to be complied with, and the monitoring requirements that need to be submitted
periodically to the MIMDES.

95. It should be noted that the performance agreements refer only to a subset of food
programs, and do not include nutrition programs, which have not been decentralized (with
the exception of Vas0 de Leche). It is expected that performance agreements related to
nutrition programs will be signed in the short term.

96. Another 58 provincial municipalities and 165 district municipalities are expected to
receive the transfer of their respective food and social fund projects later this year. These
transfers will also be complemented by management contracts, signed between the
MlMDES and these localgovernments, and linkedto the accreditation process.

97. Even though performance agreements for food programs specifically establish that
compliance with targets i s a criteria for the transfer of food programs funds to the
municipalities, at present there i s no mechanism to determine corrective actions for
underperforming municipalities. It i s expected that the GOP will present a proposal in the
next few months.

98. With regards to the retargeting of programs, the 2004 budget for nutrition programs has
been designed using a pro-poor formula, as agreed in PSRL111, and actual spending follows
that formula too.

99. Given the previous considerations, the trigger was rewritten inorder to reflect the actual
actions taken by the government, maintaining the original goals. Thus, the new text will
read: "There is a normativeframework in place assuring the implementation of transfers
of food programs to municipalities: (i) budget for nutrition programs is being allocated
following the pro-poor formula, (ii) pel3`ormance agreements related to Comedores
Populares have been signed with 50 municipalities and are being monitored by a central
government agency, (iii)monitoring information is available to the communities of these 50
municipalities, (iv) compliance with targets is a criteriafor the transfer of resources to these
50 municipalities ".

 100. In addition to the change in wording regarding approval of the intergovernmental
transfers law, points (i)and (ii)  have been clarified, as (i) exclusively to nutrition
                                                                     refers
programs and (ii)   to "Comedores Populares", which i s one of the food programs currently
functioning inPerk

Perspectives and Sustainability of Reforms

 101. The reforms introducedin the social programs during the duration of the PSRL have
aimed to improve access and targeting, increase efficiency, and promote transparency as a
tool to facilitate monitoring by the Government and social sectors. The level of success on
each goal has been significant, but it i s critical to sustain this trend into the future.



                                                 34

102.   The improvements in targeting have been consistent through the program, both in
terms of regulations and actual results. Pro-poor formulas are now included inthe budget to
assign resources, and the different agencies have been improving their performance year by
year. Similarly, the system i s now better organized and more efficient than it was a few years
ago, with less programs, better definition of areas of responsibility, and clearer objectives.
Finally, management capacity and transparency have improved through the development of
monitoring instruments, use of performance agreements, and the public dissemination
(through web pages) of information on performance.

103.    The advances registered in this sector have been important, but there i s still much to
be done in the short and medium term to ensure sustainability for the new model. The
Bank's main instrument to continue to support decentralization reforms and promote the
fiscal, institutional and cross-sectoral decentralization framework and its sustainability
(which will include policy actions related to the decentralization of social programs,
management contracts, and the monitoring and evaluation systems) will be DECSAL and the
TAL for the social sectors, which are supporting the implementation of the M&E model
cross-sectoral and specifically for social programs. Government commitment i s important,
both at the Ministry of Economy and Finance and at the sector, where ownership of reforms
has been strong. Local authorities are also very interested in managing the food programs,
providing important political and social support to the reforms. This i s being reinforced
through increased social vigilance by civil society at the local levels, expanding support and
sustainability of the new model.

          B.l. HealthCare
104.    The Peruvian government, as part of its strategy to overcome poverty, and consistent
with the goals of equity and social justice, expressed in the Acuerdo Nacional, i s committed
to increasing access to health services for the poor. Inthis context, inequity in access to basic
health services and inefficiencies in health financing are two main issues that are necessary
to confront. Increase in health supply i s not enough to ensure that the poorest of people,
particularly those who live in rural areas, have access to health services. Economic and
cultural barriers contribute to making inequity persistent, and specific actions need to be
taken to reduce their effect on equity in access.

Government Strategy

105.    With the purpose of breaking down economic barriers facing the poor, the GOP has
promoted the development of an Integrated Health System for Mother and Child, which
focuses on rural areas and on the poor. Besides, to overcome cultural barriers, it has adopted
a CLAS model, with actions oriented towards strengthening local communities so that they
will be able to manage their own primary health facilities.

106.    Simultaneously, MINSA has developed a strategy to promote efficiency within the
Ministry and in the health sector. On one hand, the realization of "Acuerdos de Gesti6n"
(performance agreements) between the Ministry of Health (MINSA) and the Direcciones
Regionales de Salud (DISAs) will be a powerful tool to link performance and outcomes in
health. On the other, better coordination between MINSA and ESSALUD -the two most
important health providers in Peru- could be achieved so as to promote health services




                                                35

exchange. The impact of this action should be important, considering that one of them
exhibits unused supply capacity and the other faces unsatisfieddemand.

107.    Two laws have generated a new scenario and have introduced new challenges for the
government strategy. First, the Decentralization Law establishes the future decentralization
of health services to regional and local levels, but it does not specify the mechanism and
timing for the transference. Since this has created an environment of uncertainty, MINSA i s
working on a technical proposal to make possible the transfer of the health network to the
regional governments, while protecting the regulatory role of the Ministry. Meanwhile, SIS
and the performance agreements are seen as instruments to implement the decentralization
process. Secondly, the Law 28006 (June 2003) gave economic, financial, and budgetary
autonomy to ESSALUD, making coordination with MINSA more difficult.

Activities supported by PSRL I,II and III

108.    Under PSRL I,the GOP launched the "Seguro Materno-Infantil", a basic health
insurance to cover poor mothers and children. This insurance was merged in 2001 with an
existing school-based insurance known as "Seguro Escolar". The Seguro Integral de Salud
(SIS) born from this union eliminates users' fees by reimbursing public providers for all
variables costs incurred in the service provision (mainly essential drugs and medical
supplies). A fee-for-service mechanism i s used to induce providers to supply the basic health
interventions included inthe benefit package. SIS i s organized into five healthplans: Plan A,
for children between 0-4 years; Plan B, for schoolchildren; Plan C, for pregnant women; and
Plans D and E, for adults.

109.    Under PSRL 11, the coverage of the SIS in Plans A and C increased beyond initial
expectations. In the year 2002, the coverage goal of 339,000 pregnant women and 823,000
children was exceeded. The SIS reached 544,876 pregnant women and 2,013,923 children.
Legal and administrative measures aimed at securing financial and managerial status for SIS
were also taken. Financial resources for SIS have been secured through general revenue. A
close monitoring of SIS management by the MINSA and MEF guarantees good performance
of this institution. Preliminary data shows that the SIS has been an effective instrument in
increasing the production of the basic services contained in the benefit package and reducing
the costs that poor people have to access health services, such as prenatal care, skilled birth
attendance and ambulatory pediatric visits.

 110. The connection between community and health services has been strengthened, as a
means to reduce cultural barriers to access. PSRL Iand PSRL I1supported the participation
of local communities in the management of primary health care facilities by facilitating the
discussion of local health plans and agreements with the health authorities. During these
phases, approximately 25 percent of all basic care health services in Peru became "Comites
Locales de Administracih de Salud" (CLAS), that is, local associations of citizens
authorized to participate inplanning and managing primary healthcare.

 111. With the purpose of increasing efficiency in the MINSA operations, previous stages
of the program introduced results-oriented instruments in the sector. Performance
agreements were first signed between MINSA and DISAs during 2002, as part of PSRL 11.
The initial agreements were limited to aspectsdealing with individual health services.




                                               36

I                                      The CLAS Model                                           I
 The CLAS (Comites Locales de Administracibn en Salud) are public community managed
 health facilities, created in 1994. Each CLAS has a board composed of 6 community
 members (half elected by the community and half selected by the chief doctor from
 community health organizations) and the local health clinic head doctor, with the task of
 administering their local health clinic. Each health center that turns into a CLAS became,
 legally, a private, non-governmental organization and must be approved by the Ministry of
 Healthbefore it i s inscribed in a public register. Although legally independent, each CLAS i s
 related to the regional health authority of the Ministry (in the case of Lima) because the
 CLAS are mainly financed by the primary budget provided by MINSA for these clinics -
 principally staff salaries. The CLAS health infrastructure i s public property.

 The CLAS are allowed to use revenue obtained through user fees for clinic improvements
 and to perform plans designed by the board. The CLAS model involves an innovative
 decentralization approach, transferring administration of local health posts to community
 representatives rather than to the municipality or local governments. The model was
 developed in part to achieve the objective of making health clinics more efficient and
 promote equity. A more efficient management of the primary facilities relies on the fact that:
I
1i)TheCLAS membersarerequiredto approve alocalcommunity healthplaneachyear,
 promoting responsiveness to the specific needs of the community; ii)The health workers are
 hired directly by the CLAS members, and are also evaluated on an annual base. This
 increases labor productivity and promotes a user satisfaction approach because workers are
 supervised by local community members, who monitor their daily work. On the other hand,
 CLAS has not proven to be as effective in the supervision of the quality of services, because
 the CLAS members are not necessarily competent in this field. B y 2003, more than 700
 CLAS existed, managing more than 2.000 health centers along all Peruvian territory.

 112.    In an effort to improve coordination of the health networks, pilot exchange
 agreements between MINSA and ESSALUD were established in two departments.
 Unfortunately, political instability, which led to changes in the chief of ESSALUD and his
 management team, hindered the implementation of a comprehensive managerial plan for the
 social insurance system that was being contemplated by the GOP. Most recently, approval of
 the Autonomy Law for ESSALUD further distanced the institution from control by the
 central government.

  113.   The purpose of PSRL I11in health issues was to consolidate and intensify efforts to
 achieve greater equity and efficiency in the public sector, paving the road for
 decentralization. The policy actions under PSRL I11were oriented to: (i)      Improve access to
 health services for the poor by expanding and consolidating the SIS and the CLAS model;
 and (ii) Reduce inefficiencies in MINSA b y going forward in the use of the performance
 agreements and by promoting coordination between MINSA and ESSALUD.

  114.   PSRL I11 focused on maintaining SIS targeting among the infant and maternal
 component and the poorest people, as well as on strengthening its insurance function and
 expanding its coverage. In 2002 the initial affiliation targets where significantly surpassed,
 reaching 544,876 woman and 2,103,923 children by the end of the year. To prevent
 deviation of financial resources to others plans, namely adults and complexity care mostly in



                                                 37

urban settings, the GOP set rules so that no less than 75 percent of the SIS total budget can
be expended in primary and secondary health care, and no less than 60 percent in plans A
and C (infant and maternal, respectively).

115.       Additionally, the government took actions to strengthen the SIS managerial capacity:
(a) integrating its information systems; (b) being fiscally responsible (every change in target
and benefit plan needs a budgetary allocation); (c) assuring financial resources to achieve all
the proposed aims; and (d) reimbursing services providers so as to ensure correct incentives.
Additionally, a performance agreement was signed between MEF and SIS to closely monitor
its activity.

116.       Under,PSRL 111, 762 CLAS associations were functioning throughout the country,
including 2,091 health centers (more or less 35 percent o f all first level facilities), up from
1,416 that existed at the beginning of 2002. Thus, the CLAS model serves more than 8
million citizen, mostly in poor and rural settings, with a budget of 9.73.2 millions, 5,800
health care workers and 4,900 active community members.

 117.        In2003 and under PSRL 111, MINSA signed management agreements with the 34
 DISAs. More comprehensive health indicators were included in these agreements, including
 SIS coverage rates, disease surveillance results, and immunization rates, among others. A
 close monitoring process over the management agreements of 2002 and 2003 was conducted



                                                                       38

by MINSA and discussed with the DISAs. The agreements have contributed to align policy
and decision making inthe public sector.

118.    Regarding attempts to improve the efficiency in ESSALUD, PSRL I11focused its
efforts on securing basic coordination in service exchange between ESSALUD and MINSA
in five departments (Tacna, HuBnuco, Huancavelica, Loreto and Ucayali). The purpose of
this was to improve access by the uninsured population of MINSA to complex care services
in ESSALUD facilities, and simultaneously allow affiliates of ESSALUD to accede to the
basic health services of MINSA.

Triggers, Benchmarks and Monitoring Indicatorsfor PSRL IV

119.    The objectives of this fourth step of the PSRL are to strengthen two key policy
instruments, SIS and management agreements, for the new decentralized environment, while
maintaining the former achievements. PSRL IV will recognize the SIS effort to keep
expanding coverage of infant and maternal populations -to over 560,000 pregnant woman
and 2,400,000 children under 5 years, improving skilled birth attendance and introducing
changes indesign and operational features that help to control excessive allocation intertiary
care. At the same time, PSRL IV supported the increased focus of SIS efforts among the
poor in rural areas.

120.    Since coverage of pregnant women (726,150) surpassed the mentioned goal in
December 2003, the opinion of SIS authorities i s that a more decisive focus on the poor must
be applied. Inthat sense, SIS i s working on a socio-economic assessment scorecard (FESE)
that will contribute to concentrate resources on poor people, restricting access for high
income women, as happened in 2003. This explains why coverage of pregnant woman will
fall as a whole, while more equity will be gained.

121.    SIS i s trying to concentrate its financial efforts on poor people. On one hand, more
than 75,0% of the expenditures on plans A and C are expected to be allocated on health
centers of levels Iand I1( in 2003 this figure -broadly measure- was 82,7% based on the
valued production). This i s intendto avoid pressures to allocate resources to complex care in
national hospital and institutes in Lima used mainly by people of higher income quintiles.
On the other hand, although there are no explicit targets in this field, because of SIS
universal coverage, the percentage of expenditures directed to the poorest quintiles, Iand 11,
i s closed monitored (40,6% in 2003).

 122.   Management agreements are seen as critical instruments for MINSA to strengthen its
regulatory capacity and promote better management performance of DISAS.The agreements
will be maintained between the national and sub national health authorities, including close
monitoring of results, which will be made public in order to reinforce accountability and
citizen participation.

Perspectivesand Sustainability of Reforms

 123.    The main feature in the Peruvian health sector for the next years will be the impact
that the decentralization process will have in the organization of service provision and
financing in the Ministry of Health. This scenario provides both threats and opportunities to
achieve better health indicators, mainly in child and maternal care. The scenario threatens to



                                               39

fragment weak health nets even more, reduce doctors' availability in regions, lower quality
of services, and increase inequity because of inadequate initial distributions of infrastructure
and human resources. On the other hand, the possibility of strengthening responsiveness of
health services to local needs, increase technical efficiency of hospitals and health facilities
through a closer monitoring of regional and local governments, and extending separation of
provision and financing function are major opportunities.

124.    The strengtheningof SIS - to increase mother and child health care as a national
goal- and the use of management agreements -to enhance efficiency in the public sector- are
instruments well established inMINSA that will probably be key tools in the handling of the
decentralization process. The World Bank will still be present in the Peruvian health sector,
mainly through the Health Sector Reform Project, co-financed with BID and executed by
PARSALUD, which will continue to assist SIS and the priority DISAS where poverty and
exclusion i s severe.

          B.2. Education
125.     The education sector in Peru has shown important advances in the last few decades,
with primary education enrolment at near universal levels, and secondary education at
around 80 percent. These achievements were obtained with relatively low expenditure levels
(at around 3% of GDP, versus an average of 4.5% in the region), but the high coverage and
access has not always been accompanied by similar levels of internal efficiency and quality.

126.    Repetition rates are high, and there are strong inequities across regions and social
groups that have been neglected. Rural women have an average of less than four years of
education, less than half of what their urban counterpart achieve. As of 2000, only 42.5
percent of rural children completed the sixth grade at the appropriate age, and absenteeism
was high.

127.    Quality of education i s of particular concern. Results from the first standardized test
in2001 showed that only 13.0 percent of urban sixth grade students and 2.4 percent of rural
students passed the language test, and 9.9 percent of urban and 1.1percent rural sixth grade
students passed the math test. The 2000 PISA (Program for International Student
Assessment) results showed that around 54 percent of 15 year old students in Peru cannot
understand what they read. This hampers their capacity to expand their knowledge and those
abilities that would allow them to become life long learners. These results had a significant
impact on public opinion in Peru, leading the Ministry of Education to declare the sector to
be in a state of emergency.

128.    The quality and motivation of human resources in the sector has been identified as
one of the key problems, with poorly trained teachers and administrators, little incentive to
improve within the career path, and inadequate distribution vis-a-vis student distribution.
Teachers typically show strong resistance to go to rural or remote communities, as the
system provides little if any compensation for those who are willing to do so.

Government Strategy

129.    The Government has openly recognized these problems, and improvement in the
quality of education and increased access to education services has been key in the national




                                               40

agenda. Education i s an important component of the "Acuerdo Nacional" which was signed
by major political groups and other key actors in Peru. This document identifies priority
education policies and indicators, including quantified goals for 2012. The "Estrategia de
Superacion de la Pobreza, Lineamientos de Politica" also calls for improving the quality of
education services for the poor.

130.    In recent months, the Acuerdo Nacional produced a "Pacto Social de Compromisos
Rec@rocos por la Educacidn. 2004-2006" (Social Pact of Reciprocal Commitments for
Education), which defined a set of basic agreements and common goals among the
participants in the National Agreement. The pact includes a list of policies and actions to be
developed infour dimensions:

0   Mobilization for quality learning;
    Teacher development strategy;
0   Moralization of the sector; and
0   Education financing
131.    While this document does not describe specific policies, it represents an important
advance in the process of modernizing and improving the education sector in Peru, as it
implies that the basic debate around the education system will now be excluded from the
political arena and that different political sectors will be able to collaborate in designing and
implementing the necessary reforms.

132.    The results of the standardized and PISA tests led the Ministry of Education to
declare the sector in emergency and introduce a reading comprehension, writing, and math
skills strengthening strategy, starting in April 2004. The implementation of the strategy was
planned for 2003, but was delayed due to changes in the Minister and staff in the institution.
Itwas startedduring the 2004 school year.

Activities supported by PSRL I,II and IIl

133.    The PSRL Program has supported GOP policies on education since 2001, through
three objectives:   (a) improved teacher quality and motivation; (b) increased access to
excluded populations; and (c) increased accountability for school performance. Achievement
of these three objectives has not been fully successful. In particular, during the preparation
of PSRL 11, the Bank encountered a new team in the Ministry which expected to implement
a number of reforms aiming at improving equity, efficiency, and quality in the sector.
However, the frequent changes and difficult political context did not allow for successful
implementation of this ambitious program of reforms. During the preparation process for
PSRL 111, the Bank and Government of Peru agreed to reduce the number of benchmarks
and triggers, and the education component kept two benchmarks. In this process, the first
objective was prioritized as it was identified to be the most critical and difficult to achieve
through other instruments, such as investment projects. On the other hand, the second and
third objectives are now being addressed through the Peru Rural Education Project, which
was approved in May 2003, that is, during the preparation process of PSRL 111. The
remainder of this section provides a summary of the policies addressed throughout the
Program.




                                                41

134.    Improved teacher quality and motivation. The GOP has long recognized that teacher
quality and motivation need to be addressed in order to ensure overall improvement in the
quality o f education. This objective was approached through two strategies: (i)the
introduction of new systems to allow for greater efficiency in human resource management;
and (ii) development of policy instrumentsto increase teacher motivation.

135.    As part of the first strategy, PSRL Isupported an important effort to try to clean-up
the payroll and career management system in order to make it more transparent and efficient.
The new payroll system was implemented in six payroll processing units reaching a
coverage of 45% of the teachers nationwide. As a result of the implementation of this
system, the Ministry of Education (MINED) was able to detect teachers who were no longer
in the system but were still being paid, or teachers who were not being paid appropriately
with respect to the position that they were holding. Subsequently, under PSRL 11, MINED
requested the Bank to support an overall reform of the teacher career, as part of an extremely
ambitious vision that would lead to a new Teacher Career Law. Although this vision has
been sustained in MINED, the timing was far too optimistic, given the country's political
context. A teachers strike, in May 2003, showed that all reforms would require a difficult
negotiation process for which the GOP needed to develop instruments which it did not have
at hand.

 136.    Under PSRL 111, the Government re-evaluated its strategy with respect to reforming
the teaching career and decided that the human resource management system was the key
prior action for decentralization of the sector. (The box below shows the various components
of the system.) In addition to the payroll system, previously supported under PSRL I,the
government implementedother components of the system with the objective of ensuringthat
teachers are paid within their appropriate rank, that no duplications occur, and that the
system i s safe from inappropriate handling. Efforts were made with respect to (a) the
expansion of the payroll system to reach a total coverage of 51 percent of MINED staff. This
 system establishes parameters for salaries, according to rank and other factors; (b) the
implementation of the teachers position system in Lima and Callao, reaching a coverage o f
 30 percent of education staff. This system links teachers to teacher positions, avoiding two
key problems, first that more than one teacher i s allocated to a position, and second that staff
 are paid within the appropriate category; (c) the rationalization of contracted teachers in two
 pilot districts, identifying that approximately 20 percent of teachers could be redeployed to
 areas where they are in greater need, or whose contracts can be cancelled; and (d) the
 automated payment of teacher salaries through the SIAF system, thus hindering
 manipulationinthis step of the process.

 137.    As part of the second strategy to support improved teacher quality and motivation,
 MINED identified teacher incentives as key policy instruments, particularly for rural areas
 where teacher quality i s lowest. A study carried under PSRL Iidentified that the following
 incentives were necessary to ensure teacher quality in rural areas: (a) financial incentives for
 rural teachers, scaled to the distance between the school and the provincial capital. The study
 recommended that assistance should be paid upon compliance with the teachers' attendance
 in the classroom; (b) financial incentives for teacher's ability to speak the local tongue
 fluently; (c) living facilities, and (d) appropriate training for multigrade environment. Under
 PSRL 11, MINED initiated a pilot program to provide incentives to teachers in rural areas,
 but the results from this pilot were ambiguous as teacher attendance was not verified. Of the



                                                  42

approximately US$ 6.5 million that was originally committed to financing this pilot, only
about US$300,000 was used to pay incentives and train teachers. Under PSRL 111, MINED
re-launched the pilot in three rural areas of Peru, covering 1000 teachers. The pilot, which
has a semi-experimental design, includes a control area, and student performance evaluation.

138.   Increased access to education to excluded populations. Under PSRL 11, two priority
excluded population groups were identified: (a) pre-school children and (b) indigenous
children whose mother tongue i s not Spanish. It was agreed that these excluded groups
should be targeted in the prioritization of education investments in order to achieve the
MillenniumDevelopment Goal of Universal Primary Education. During the preparation of
the PSRL I11loan, the Government and the Bank agreed that targets would be monitored
under the Rural Education Project, approved inMay 2003.

139.    Zncreased accountability for school peformance. PSRL I1introduced this objective,
which was to be implemented through two strategies addressing (a) participatory school
governance, and (b) transparency. With respect to participatory mechanisms, MINED
committed to the reorganization of schools through the creation of strong school councils in
order to promote dialogue between the school and the community and to promote
accountability at the local level. School councils were expected to participate in the
preparation, implementation, and evaluation of the Institutional Education Plan, evaluate the
use of school and Parent Association funds and link the community to school activities.
Under PSRL 111,the strategy with respect to school councils changed. The GOP decided that
school councils would continue to be promoted, but within the context of the teacher
incentives pilot. Thanks to the contribution of DFID, council members were trained to carry
out the monitoring of teacher assistance. In addition, the Rural Education Project supports
school autonomy and school councils, as part of the management component.

140.    The GOP has made an overall effort to ensure transparency. MINED was inserted in
this process and carried out a numberof activities towards this end: Under PSRLI,    MINED
published all the results for the 1998 student assessmentdata and the comparative analysis of
the 1996 and 1998 data. This information had been kept secret because of the very poor
results. Under PSRL 11, in November 2001, MINED carried out the student performance
assessment, including, for the first time, children in rural multigrade schools and Quechua
and Aymara speakers, having published preliminary results. Also, under PSRL, 11, the final
report of the Commission for National Consensus on Education was published as inserts in
newspapers with national distribution - "Propuesta de Acuerdo Nacional por la Educacih"
and "Las Voces del Pais"        and a complaints hotline and center was installed. Issues of
transparency are now being addressedthrough the Accountability for Decentralization of the
Social Sectors Technical Assistance Project, approved July 2004.

Triggers,Benchmarks, and Monitoring Indicatorsfor PSRL IV

141.                    The fourth phase of PSRL has focused entirely on the objective of teacher quality
and motivation through two benchmarks: (a) implementation of the Human Resources
Management System nationwide, and (b) development of teacher hardship and merit
incentives system. To date, MINEDhas progressed significantly towards the achievement of
the agreedbenchmarks, surpassing some of the goals, as described below.

142.                    With respect to the Human Resources Management System, MINED has committed
to (a) reach a coverage of more than 80 percent of the staff in 75 percent of the sector's
executing units; (b) introduce at least 50 percent of staff in the teacher and administrative
staff positions system; (c) pay more than 50 percent of staff through the automated SIAF
module; and, (d) rationalize more than 50 percent of contracted staff through redeployment
or cancellation o f their contracts. MINED has fully complied with its commitments and i s
currently paying, through the payroll system, 86 percent of teachers in more than 90 percent
of the sector's executing units. It has also crosschecked teachers and administrative
positions for 69 percent of staff and i s paying 90 percent of the sector's staff through the
automated payment module. Finally, the rationalization effort has gone beyond that of
contracted teachers. In an initial effort, by June 2004, approximately 60 percent of teaching
positions held by term-contracted staff were rationalized. MINED then initiated a second



                                                                        44

round in which the Regional Offices were declared to be under restructuring. This has
allowed for relocation of both term-contracted and open ended staff. Initial calculations
show that this process i s generating approximately U S $40 million in savings per year.
MINED is planning to allocate these savings to finance school infrastructure and inputs
within the context of the emergency program.

143.     With respect to the Teachers Incentives System, MINED committed to (a) continue
implementing the rural teachers incentives pilot during the 2004 school year; and (b) publish
for consultation a study on a proposed system-wide pay scale reform that would include
teacher incentives. MINED has drafted a proposed Incentives System which has been
initially consulted with civil society representatives and has a consultation schedule for the
remainder of the year with regional representatives, school communities, and the teachers
union. The system identifies two types of incentives, hardship and merit. The hardship
incentives i s already being piloted in rural areas, as part of the GOP's commitments under
this loan. The pilot continues to be successfully implemented and has shown initial positive
results in terms of teacher assistance to rural schools. In particular, the participation of
school councils in monitoring teacher assistance has been very successful. Parents feel that
they can contribute to the school through clearly specified roles. In addition, an initial merit
incentives pilot has been initiated in 12 schools, covering 189teachers.

Perspectives and Sustainability of Reforms

144.     The Education sector will continue facing serious challenges with respect to equity,
efficiency, and quality. Solving these problems i s not easy for a sector where, even when
appropriate interventions are implemented, results tend to be observed in the medium term.
This i s particularly difficult inPeru where, traditionally, Ministers last less than one year and
higher level staff come and go with them.

145.     Despite the weak institutional context, the GOP has identified the key problems and
i s trying to address them. The Sector has been declared in emergency, excluded groups have
been identified, and significant effort i s being put into institutingmajor reforms, particularly
those linked to the teaching career. Some of the processes are now institutionalized,
including the human resources system, the implementation of school councils and
publication of test results. Other processes still need further support, including the
implementation of better targetedprograms.

146.     The Bank will continue to support the Government in the process of implementing
and consolidating reforms in the sector. In particular, the Rural Education Project supports
efforts linked to all three PSRL objectives: improved teacher quality and motivation,
increased access to education to excluded populations, and increased accountability for
school performance. In addition the Accountability for Decentralization inthe Social Sectors
Technical Assistance Project will finance the implementation of integrated transparency and
social monitoring procedures across all three social sectors (education, health and social
assistance programs). Finally, the DECSAL program will continue to oversee the
decentralization process for education, including providing support for civil service reforms
and management contracts with regions on education financing and management.

C. Transparencyand Participationof the poor

Government Strategy

147.    The transition Government that came to power in 2001 had to tackle a context of
weakened governance characterized by a lack of government transparency, increased levels
of corruption, poor accountability - both within the state and towards citizens - and little
opportunities for citizen participation in the formulation and monitoring of policies and
programs directly affecting them.

148.    To address these issues, the Government launched a strategy to improve governance
by building more transparent, accountable, and democratic institutions with the aim of
contributing to more effective poverty reduction. Emphasis was placed on enhancing
transparency of government actions and use of public resources and opening up channels for
citizen participation in policy makingand monitoring of public programs.

Activities supported by PSRL I,11and III

149.    Within the PSRL, this translated into improving transparency in social programs and
expenditures and empowering civil society and users to participate in the policy and budget
process, and monitoring service delivery. The specific objectives were to i)provide access to
information for all citizens, restoring its credibility and enhancing its timeliness and quality;
ii)providecitizenswiththemeanstoplan,budgetandoverseetheservicesprovidedtothem
and thereby ensure that their voice i s heard and reflected accurately in government actions
and policies; and iii)provide an institutional framework and recourse mechanisms for
citizens to seek resolution inthe case of abuse of public functions or funds.

150.    These objectives were defined through a broad consultative process and national
dialogue which involved the GOP, the World Bank as well as other key stakeholders of the
reform, such as public sector representatives, the private sector, civil society and the donor
community.

151.    During PSRL I,PSRL I1and PSRL 111, the COP has made important advances in
improving governance, increasing transparency, strengthening accountability and enhancing
user power inthe provision of social services and citizen participation inthe policy process.

152.    Inthe areaof transparency, a legislative framework was created to guarantee citizens
access to information with the approval of the Law of Transparency and Access to
Information and its corresponding regulations. The framework stipulates the rights of
citizens with regard to public information and establishes the obligations of public sector
entities and the mechanisms they have to put in place to ensure the fulfillment of these rights
and obligations. It also establishes sanctions for non-abidance and requires an annual
reporting to Congress on the implementation of the Law.

153.    One of the main mechanisms to facilitate public access to Government information
has been the creation of the Transparency Portal ("Consulta Amigable"), which i s aimed at
making budget information and public expenditures easily accessible and useful to citizens
as a source for influencing and monitoring public action. The portal, managed by the
Ministry of Finance, now provides information (updated monthly) on budget allocations and



                                                46

expenditures of all sectors and public programs, including all PSPs, at the national and
regional level.

154.    While increasing its efforts to make government information publicly available, the
GOP also implemented measures to ensure that the information made accessible was
accurate and reliable. This was done by depoliticizing and strengthening the technical
capacities of the National Instituteof Statistics and Informatics (LNEI).

155.    The GOP also made important progress in opening up spaces for greater citizen
participation in public policy formulation, implementation, and monitoring. These efforts
have been facilitated by the on-going decentralization process, which has provided an
enabling context for greater citizen participation in budgeting, planning, and monitoring of
public services at the local level. The new institutions created within this process promote
citizen participation, as processes and mechanisms to institutionalize citizen involvement
have been defined and established. This new framework for participation makes Peru one of
the countries in Latin America with the most advanced legislative frameworks for citizen
participation in public policy and budgeting processes. Some of the key elements of the
framework include:

           a. The recognition of citizen participation as a fundamental right established
                throughout the legal framework for decentralization and the approval of a
                Law of Citizen Participation.

           b. The creation of Regional Coordination Councils and Local Coordination
                Councils. Building on the positive experience with the Mesas de
                Concertacion de Lucha Contra la Pobreza, they seek to establish a forum for
                coordination and consultation between government and civil society. With 35
                percent and 40 percent civil society representation respectively, these bodies
                have consultative and oversight functions over regional and municipal
                governments.

           c. The development of regional, provincial and district development plans,
                based on consultations with civil society and participatory planning
                processes. Likewise, input from civil society i s required for all sub-national
                investment plans.

            d. The institutionalization of participatory budgeting at the municipal level,
                makingPeru the first country inLatinAmerica to institutionalize this process
                inaLaw of ParticipatoryBudgeting.

156.    In relation to the PSPs, the GOP has tested innovative mechanisms aimed at
providing greater voice to the users of social programs concerning the quality and
transparency of the services received. A pilot applying the citizen report card methodology
to evaluate the performance of a selected number of social services as experienced by users,
was implemented in 2003 and the results were disseminated by high-ranking government
officials in an event that brought together the media, government, and civil society
representatives. The method i s aimed at providing a channel for users of public services,
particularly the poor, to evaluate the quality of these through a national survey and through




                                                47

the public debate of the results, create pressure for enhancing the accountability of public
service delivery.

157.   The health and education sectors promoted the establishment of local mechanisms
like the CLAS (Local Health Administration Committees) and CEI (Institutional Education
Councils) which offer their clients the opportunity to influence and participate in service
delivery. Currently, more than 760 CLAS and 7200 CEIhave been established.

158.   Finally, in order to measure the impact of all the afore-mentioned actions and to
enhance citizens' voice on issues of corruption, the GOP has committed to assess public
perceptions of transparency and corruption, b y incorporating a module on governance and
transparency into the ENAHO national survey. A baseline was established in 2003 and the
annual application of the survey will enable to monitor the change inperception over time.

Triggers,Benchmarks, and Monitoring Indicatorsfor PSRL I V

159.   Building on the efforts initiated during the previous PSRLs to promote transparency
and participation, the PSRL lV seeks to further institutionalize these processes by
incorporating them into a results-based and participatory monitoring and evaluation system
of the PSPs. The implementation of a transparent, participatory, and results-oriented
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system will help put inplace a system through which the
government will be able to effectively track progress in reaching the objectives of the PSPs
within a decentralized context, while contributing to enhancing the transparency, quality,
and efficiency of social expenditures and giving citizens and users the opportunity to
influence decision-making. The M&E system will track and evaluate the levels and
appropriate mix of spending on the PSPs at the national, regional, and when applicable, at
the municipal level, the critical inputs and outputs, and the level of satisfaction of users
measured through user-satisfaction monitoring methodologies.

160.    Inorder to ensure the neutrality, objectivity, and cross-sectoral character of the M&E
system and its connection to results-based management and decision-making processes, a
multi-sectoral Technical Committee has been established to oversee the implementation of
the M&E system. It consists of representatives from MEF, CIES-PCM, the three ministries
of the PSPs (Education, Health and MIMDES) and representatives from regional and
municipal governments through the CND. A working group within MEF responsible for
designing and implementing the M&E system has started operating and a first proposal for
the functioning of the integrated system has already been elaborated. The proposal includes a
participatory assessment of potential users of the system (including civil society),
recommendations for means of dissemination, periodicity of reporting, coverage, indicators,
stakeholder participation, and a calendar of gradual implementation of the system. The
working group i s currently consulting an initial set of monitoring indicators with different
stakeholders, which have included the Council of Ministers, each of the social sectors,
universities, research centres, and civil society organizations.

 161.   The working group has already produced an in-depth analysis of expenditures of
PSPs by region and according to poverty criteria, which has helped to identify continued
targetingflaws and under-execution of budgets. The analysis, as will the subsequentperiodic
M&Ereports, hasbeenmade publicly available on the Transparency Portal.




                                                48

162.    In parallel, each ministry (MIMDES, Health and Education) has started designing
and implementingits own sectoral M&E system. Teams of the sectoral systems coordinated
with the MEF team to make them compatible with SIAF. These systems are adapted to each
sector's decentralization mode and pace, to ensure that regional and local governments can
gradually start monitoring the implementation of their programs, both regarding targets, such
as inputs and outputs, as well as process, such as participation. Inorder to make effective use
of the information derived from the M&E system and to adjust program performance, so that
any detected weaknesses can quickly feed into program management and be translated into
performance improvement, the M&E system i s linked to the Performance Management
Agreements of those programs which have been decentralized (FONCODES and
PRONAA). By September 2004, 122 municipalities had signed management agreements and
69 hadestablished management committees involving users indecisions concerning the food
and local infrastructure programs and tracking results. Management agreements tie
MIMDES monitoring systems to decision-makingandresults through aMinisterial Directive
defining sanctions and incentives. Additionally, 33 social auditing committees (Comites de
Vigilancia) created by the Participatory Budget are tracking expenditures, procurement, and
targeting of decentralized food programs, and all provinces have set up procurement
committees (Comites de Adquisiciones) involving civil society representatives who are
democratically elected.

163.    As the Transparency Portal is a key tool of the M&E system, it has been expanded to
accommodate the information needs of the system. Gradually, municipal governments are
creating their own Transparency Portals, with information on expenditures, the social
services they offer, users' rights, eligibility criteria, and geographical coverage. Terms of
reference to evaluate and improve friendliness of the portal have been issued. The
evaluation, to be made by an expert independent organization, will include the organization
of a panel of users of the Portal involving civil society representatives, local governments,
community radios and communication experts. In the meantime, a search engine has been
added to the Portal in order to expedite information searches of non-expert users. The
appraisal mission of the Bank held in September 2004 strongly encouraged the GOP to
speed up the evaluation and improvement of the Portal, understanding that friendly access to
budget and public expenditure information by non-expert users is key to the participatory
dimension of the M&E system.

164.    In order to increase the sustainability of citizens' report cards, the INEI has
permanently incorporated modules into its national household survey (ENAHO), generating
information on levels of users' satisfaction with the health and food programs. So far, INEI
has made three monthly applications of the new questionnaire as part of the continuous-
survey modality recently adopted by ENAHO. It i s expected that the integrated M&E system
as well as the monitoring systems of the social sectors will systematically use this
information to set up their own report card mechanisms aiming at improving the quality and
equity in access to the services they deliver.

Perspectives and Sustainability of Reforms

165.    The establishment of new mechanisms of accountability and participation in the
social sectors and in the process of decentralization have opened opportunities for citizen
participation in service delivery and policy formulation. Results from ENAHO indicate a




                                               49

significant increase in the levels of participation, particularly among the poor, as shown in
the table below.

166.    The actions initiated under the PSRLs will be continued through the recently
approved Social TAL, which provides technical assistance resources to build the capacity of
the central, regional and municipal governments to continue implementing and perfecting
the M&E system. The Social TAL will still face the challenge of getting a stronger buy in all
sectors involved in the M&E system.

167.    A Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) grant will further complement these
efforts by strengthening the capacity of civil society to participate in the participatory budget
and monitor the performance of PSPs. It will also seek to improve access of the poor to the
information contained in the Transparency Portal by creating interfaces tailored to their
needs and through complementary mean such as community radio, bulletin boards and
community media, as the Internet still remains out of reach for many of Peru's poor.

168.    Additionally, the Law of Transparency and Access to Information i s under effective
implementation. It supports and enforces the dissemination of information on PSPs and other
decentralized social programs to communities. In the case of the decentralized PSPs it
contributes to strengthening the transparency and outreach of regional and municipal
governments.

169.    The Bank, in collaboration with DFID and other partners, has initiated a study and
broad dialogue on the accountability of Peru's social policy. This initiative aims at
improving existing and newly developed transparency and accountability mechanisms and
institutions in the context of decentralization and ensuring their sustainability through
demonstrating effectiveness and expanding their ownership to sub-national authorities,
political parties, users of the social programs, and civil society organizations.

D.TransparencyofFinancialManagementandProcurementAdministration

170.    Peru's overall risk level assigned in procurement i s average according to the CPAR
study carried out in 2001. This rate implies that lending operations and investments under
Bank-financed projects in Peru are viable but should adhere to transparency as much as
possible since the CPAR identified procedures and practices that don't conform to
international procurement standards and practices, such as the selection and hiring of
consultants.

171.    Procurement initiatives agreed to in the context of the PSRL have supported the
objectives of increasing transparency, economy, and efficiency in public procurement, and
strengthening the roles of state entities responsible for supervision and control of
government agencies with responsibility in management of public procurement such as the



                                                50

Audit General Office (Contraloria General de la Repdblica --CGR) and CONSUCODE
(Consejo Superior de Contrataciones y Adquisiciones del Estado). The aforementioned
objectives are fully consistent with those proposed in the Peru CPAR Action Plan agreed
with the Government in 2001.

Government Strategy

172.    In Peru, transparency in public procurement has been weak due to a limited and
timely access of bidders to procurement notices and documents related to management of
bidding processes. Also, lack of clear oversight and control mechanisms needed to enforce
compliance of government agencies with the provisions of the local procurement framework
has contributed to weak enforcement of procurement regulations.

173.    The above has prevented many bidders from being able to submit tenders, leading to
management of bidding processes that have limited competition, bidder complaints, and a
public perception of lack of transparency.

174.    Although the public sector inPeru has both an Audit General's Office responsible for
auditing and control and a national procurement agency in charge of administration and
oversight of the local procurement framework, considerable overlapping has existed between
those agencies in carrying out their respective assigned roles. In the past, such overlapping,
far from contributing to ensuring transparency and increasing effectiveness in control of
public procurement led to dispersion, inefficiency, and poor results.

175.    Consistent with the objectives for increased transparency and supervision and control
in public procurement identified in the Peru CPAR, the Government, in the context of the
PSRL implementation, outlined a two-pronged strategy grounded on: a) the signing of an
inter-institutional agreement between CONSUCODE and CGR for increased coordination
and efficiency inperforming control and supervision functions in public procurement, and b)
the issuing of a Policy Guide thereby the Government outlined broad guidelines towards
development and gradual implementation of an E-Government System (Sistema Electr6nico
de Adquisiciones y Contrataciones Estatales - SEACE) for the procurement of goods and
services, and works.

176.    SEACE's conceptual framework envisaged overall implementation of the e-
government procurement system in three sequential phases: i)a web page for advertisement
of bidding notices and documents in the CONSUCODE Portal; ii)an e-government system
for purchase of minor goods and services and; iii)an e-government system for procurement
of major goods and civil works contracts. Development and implementation of the first two
phases (the latter one to be implemented on a pilot basis) were agreed on as benchmarks for
the PSRL 111.

177.    The scope of the institutional agreement encompassed the preparation of regulations
and procedures which will guide supervision and control tasks by CONSUCODE and CGR
and later the issuingof a single consolidated manual for the use of those agencies' staff and
public procuring entity staff.

178.    The Government has been committed to improving transparency and access to
information and to promoting better governance and administration of public finances. The



                                               51

Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) conducted in 2001 concluded that the
financial tools at the disposal of the Congress and Executive Branch comprised of (a) a
robust financial administration legislation (b) highly dedicated staff and (c) an effective
integrated financial management system (SIAF).

Activities supported by PSRL I,II and III

179.    At the design phase of the PSRL, the identification in the Peru CPAR Action Plan of
tasks proposed for implementation of an e-Government procurement system and the
strengthening of the roles of state entities responsible for control and oversight of public
procurement served as a basis for outlining the Government strategy described above and
later on as triggers for PSRLIIand subsequent phases.

180.    Thus, PSRL Ienvisaged only indicative benchmarks and minimumtriggers to mark
progress in the program development towards implementation of PSRL 11. Consistent with
this, the Government of Peru issuedthe Supreme Decree No.031-2002-PCM a Policy Guide
on which basis an E-Government procurement system aimed at increasing transparency and
efficiency in public contracting will be phased and gradually implemented.         Electronic
means for advertisement of bidding opportunities and procurement information through
SEACE will become mandatory for public agencies, and training to public procurement
servants and goods and services suppliers will be delivered. CONSUCODE was appointed
as the Government agency responsible for developing and implementing the SEACE, as
provided inthe Decree.

181. The signing of the inter-institutional agreement between CONSUCODE and CGR
aimed at strengthening oversight and increasing coordination and efficiency of both agencies
incarrying out their respective oversight and control roles inpublic procurement was signed
inDecember 2001. With the issuingof the Policy Guide, as a trigger, and the signing of the
Inter-institutional Agreement, as a benchmark, agreed conditions for the PSRL I1 were
successfully met.

182.    Later on, the PSRLI1embedded benchmarks and triggers as conditions for PSRL 111,
namely, the implementation of a Web Page in the CONSUCODE Portal (Portal de
Compras), including the incorporation of approximately 600 public agencies regularly
advertising bidding notices and other equally relevant procurement information, as a
benchmark; and the preparation and issuing of control and supervision guidelines and
directives in public procurement by both CONSUCODE and CGR for mandatory use of
public contracting agencies, at all government levels, as a trigger. By end of June 2003, a
total of 648 public agencies was regularly advertising in the Web Page information on
procurement plans and management of procurement processes, and CONSUCODE and CGR
developed and issued a set of directives and guidelines on supervision and control on public
procurement through ajoint technical committee created to that end.

183.    The major recommendations of the CFAA, related to (a) more effective oversight by
Congress of the budget process and review of the allocations of available funding, (b) more
detailed and frequent reporting on expenditures to Congress, and (c) unfettered surveillance
and reporting by the Controller General of the acts and reports of the executive. In response
to the CFAA, three (3) indispensable elements of a sound fiduciary framework were built
into the policy framework for the PSRL 11: (1) Strengthening of the congressional oversight



                                              52

of the use of public funds (2) Increased independence of the Controller General, and (3)
Expansion of the scope and coverage of the integrated financial management system SIAF.

184.    Strengthened Legal Framework: The National Control Law N o 27785 was approved
on July 22, 2002 and ensures functional autonomy of the Controller General's Office
(CGR), in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The CGR i s now exercising
ex-post control according to its legal mandate, over the finances of the Ministry of Defence
and other security services, and a special audit has been carried out.

Triggers, Benchmarks, and Monitoring Indicatorsfor PSRL IV

185.    At the design phase of PSRL 111, consideration was given to the expansion of the
CONSUCODE Web Page in order to increase the Portal's capacity for advertisement and
create a single comprehensive manual on supervision and control guidelines jointly prepared
by CONSUCODE and CGR. This would enable the performance of their supervision and
control roles in public procurement to be more integrated and coordinated. The
accomplishment of this tasks was proposed as a benchmark for PSRL IV.However, towards
the end of PSRL I11design, the Bank, in agreement with the Government, decided to transfer
those initiatives to the DECSAL Project, then under preparation.

186.    This decision was based on the Government's advances towards decentralization of
administrative responsibilities and functions to the sub-national governments and on the
expected limited impact of implementing those initiatives within one sector while
decentralization was already underway, and on anticipated Government difficulties of facing
challenges and risks posed on transparency, control, supervision, and prevention of
corruption at all government levels. B y then, the Government had decided that the E-
Government procurement system (SEACE) was to be implemented as part of a component
(E-Government) designed under an IADB-financed State Reform and Modernization
Project.

187.    The Government's attention then focused on the social protection programs and the
need for maximizing the impact and benefits of PRONAA's food aid programs decentralized
to approximately 67 provincial municipalities by issuing more transparent regulations for
purchases of food; carrying out a wider dissemination of procurement notices; and
increasing public access to procurement information through the CONSUCODE Web Page
and other means of advertisement.

188.    The preparation and issuing of revised regulations by CONSUCODE and MIMDES
respectively was agreed as a benchmark for the PSRL IV. Pursuant to the Supreme Decree
No. 002-2004-MIMDES, dated on 03/18/2004, the Government issued new procurement
regulations for mandatory use of local governments and PRONAA. The new regulations -
implemented as of 03/25/2004- are fully consistent now with the principles and provisions of
the local procurement law and replaced previous regulations that lacked transparency and
applied procurement procedures that did not conform to the local procurement framework.
New regulations explicitly give CONSUCODE the mandate of overseeing management of
food purchase processes and deciding on submission of any claims by bidders.

Perspectives and Sustainability of Reforms

189.    Despite the fact that food purchases are targeted to social protection programs,
successful implementation of new procurement regulations may provide valuable insights
for assessing management of food purchases and bring valuable lessons for replication and
quality improvement inpublic procurement across sectors.

190.    The new regulations for purchases of food incorporate basic principles underlyingthe
public procurement framework, as described in the local procurement law (Ley de
Contrataciones y Adquisiciones Estatales). Procedures and practices for procurement
notices, bid submission and evaluation, and contract award, as outlined in the new
regulations for food purchases are -to a large extent- now consistent with those in the
procurement law.

191.    Notwithstanding the above, some limitations should be recognized in a transition
period of decentralization from PRONAA to local governments with respect to transparency,
institutional capacity, and monitoring and oversight, provided that efficient implementation
and the appropriate impact of the food aid programs at a national level are achieved.

192.    The efficient implementation and continuous improvement of new regulations should
be accompanied by complementary actions. A few recommendations follow immediately:

193.    CONSUCODE should issue directives making it mandatory for PRONAA and local
government agencies to advertise their procurement notices and bidding documents in the
CONSUCODE Portal. This would enable increased dissemination of procurement
opportunities to the local business community and give civil society access to information on
public procurement, with expected benefits incompetition and transparency.

194.     CONSUCODE should implement standard bidding documents for mandatory use of
all government agencies involved in purchases of food in social protection programs.
Streamlined structure and content may help government agencies -with a wide range of
technical capacities- to use such documents in a right and efficient manner. Standard
documents may enable CONSUCODE to provide training to agency staff in a straight
forward and standardized fashion and carry out a quality supervision of food procurement
processes, as mandated by the Supreme Decree No.001-2004-MIMDES.

 195.    In social protection, the implementation of nutrition and social investment funds
programs in a decentralized context i s much more intensive in procurement of goods and
services. Purchase of food as a vehicle to ensure positive impact and results in food aid
programs i s instrumental, but it cannot be achieved overnight and thus requires sustained
oversight and monitoring efforts on the Government side.

 196.    Periodic evaluation of procurement management in a representative sample of
municipalities i s a good means of assessing performance and quality of results and
retrofitting the procurement regulatory agency for improvement of regulations and
MIMDES-PRONAA on how well a decentralized procurement strategy i s being
implemented and what adjustments need to be introduced.




                                              54

197.    It is therefore highly recommended that an initial study be carried out over a pilot
sample of municipalities in order to determine the degree of selected agencies' compliance
with procurement procedures and practices, as defined in the regulations, to assess the
overall quality of procurement processes and results, and to identify critical issues for the
achievement of better results in terms of transparency, competition, and efficiency. If all in
all, procurement capacities are deemed adequate and leading toward good results, then the
transfer of programs may be easier and more expeditious. Conversely, it may be that results
suggest that current procurement capacity levels are low and that the transfer of programs
should be undertaken with more intensive technical assistance to agencies and training to
staff inthe search for increased institutional capacity and certification of procurement staff.

198.    It i s expected that a continuous use of this kindof approach will help improve quality
of results and effectiveness of food aid programs over time and increase country-wide
quality of public procurement.

199.    During 2003, two important regulations were issued to support the Control Law
issued during 2002. The first regulation institutionalises the role and function of the internal
auditor at all levels of government (central, regional, local) and the second regulates the
designation of eligibility of private audit firms to perform financial and operations audits of
public entities, including the procedures for registration, evaluation, designation, public
competition, and ex-post quality control by the CG.

200.    Through the Portal de Transferencia and the Ventana Amigable, a wide range of
financial and economic data i s made available to the public in general. Information i s
available on Macro Economic Projections, Strategic Plans of each Central Government
entity, consolidated data on budget execution, transfers to Regional and Local governments,
consolidated debt position (internal and external), execution of investment projects. Given
the accelerated scheme of fiscal decentralization, there i s a need to ensure that the authorities
with overall responsibility for accounting, financial reporting, and external control keep
abreast with the decentralization effort and have adequate institutional arrangements in place
to discharge their individual roles.

                                       V. The proposedLoan
A. Linkto CountryAssistanceStrategyand Other Bank Operations

201.    The proposed loan i s part of the PSRL program, included in the CAS discussed by
the Board in August 2002. That document assigned the PSRL a central role in two of the
three objectives of the Program Matrix ("Equity and Social Justice" and "Institutionality"),
because PSRL i s supporting important reforms in the social sectors and the institutional
improvements necessary for improved service delivery.

202.    While the CAS document envisaged two PSRL operations (PSRL I1and PSRL 111)
for a total of US$200 million, the solid economic performance of Peru since its approval
resulted in the satisfaction of the four triggers established for operating in the CAS' high
lending scenario. As a result, PSRL I11was approved for US$l50 million and an additional
(and final) PSRL I V for US$lOO was included in the lending program in late 2003.
Consequently, the total PSRL operation will be for US$450 million. The Bank i s currently
revising the Peru CAS. This revision will recognize the role of PSRL in supporting



                                                55

government efforts to promote improvements in living conditions and poverty in Peru, and
will confirm the assessment that made it possible to move Peru to a high-case scenario and
propose a PSRL IV.In the future, it will include several venues for support to enhance the
reforms undertaken under the PSRL IV.

203.    In addition to the series of PSRL operations, the Bank has been actively involved in
the development and implementationof social policies in Peru. Support for the Government
has been provided through AAA products, other adjustment operations, several investment
loans, and technical assistance loans. The design and supervision of PSRL benefited from
the analysis carried in a 2000 Health Report (Peru: Improving Health Care for the Poor), a
2000 EducationReport (Peru: Education at a Crossroad), a 2002 Public Expenditure Review
(Peru: Restoring Fiscal Discipline for Poverty Reduction), and a 2004 Pensions Report
(Peru: Restoring the Multiple Pillars of Old Age Income Security). Also, two studies
currently under preparation, a Poverty Assessment and a study on Governance and
Accountability in Social Policy, have produced useful information and analysis for the
preparation of a loan and will continue to promote policy dialogue with the government.

204.    Three investment operations, including one in health (Health Reform APL), one in
education (Rural Education APL) and one in water and sanitation (PRONASAR) have
supported several of the actions described in the different PSRL. Also, the second part of a
different    programmatic      adjustment    loan    (Programmatic     Decentralization   and
Competitiveness Structural Adjustment Loan - DECSAL) i s now under preparation,
covering aspects of decentralization not included in PSRL. The DECSAL will strengthen the
policy-dialogue undertaken by the PSRL and expand important reforms undertaken under
the PSRL IV. In addition, two technical assistance loans ("Peru: Accountability for
Decentralization in the Social Sectors" and "Institutional Capacity for Sustainable Fiscal
Decentralization")    were approved on July 2004 to support the implementation of
decentralization policies in Peru. An ESW on governance and accountability in the social
sectors i s currently beingcarried out, expanding the dialogue on key PSRL pillars.

205.    In particular, the DECSAL I1 and the PSRL IV are mutually reinforcing and
complement each other through strategic support in carefully selected areas. The DECSAL
continues to support the fiscal and institutional framework for decentralization, ensuring that
sub national governments have the capacity to manage the social sector responsibilities and
resources that will be assigned to them. It has several important linkages to the PSRL. It
promotes the cautious and gradual decentralization of social sectors though its support of the
accreditation process, management contracts, including contracts between the central and
regional government levels on health and education. It supports the design and
implementation of fiscal transfers, including earmarked transfers, such as those for social
infrastructure programs. It strengthens the transparency and participation theme of the PSRL
by promoting participatory budgeting. It also complements the teacher reforms by broader
civil service reforms, such as the legal framework for the civil service and automatic payroll
support, through the SIAF, another reform supported both by PSRL and DECSAL loans.
Finally, it complements the support of the PSRL and social TAL for the elaboration of a
cross-sectoral performance-based M&E system aimed at generating greater efficiency and
effectiveness inexpenditures.

B. Programobjectives and Prior Actions

206.   The main objective of PSRLhas been, since the beginning of the program in 2001, to
support Peru's medium term social policy reforms. The PSRL program started in 2001
supporting the emergency actions implemented by the transition government, while PSRL I1
focused on the development of long term strategies, and PSRL 111aimed to advance the
implementation of these strategies. PSRL IV i s the fourth and last stage of the programmatic
loan and has a particular focus on consolidating the reforms and increasing their
sustainability into the future.

207.   While the policy matrix has had some changes during the four stages of the
operation, the basic objectives, described in the program document of PSRL I,       have been
maintained through the whole operation: "...The objective of the PSRL is to support [...I
build[ing] the bases for a transparent and participatory resource allocation mechanism,
rationalization of expenditures, decentralized implementation and systematic performance-
tracking of social programs..."

208.   To reach these objectives, the PSRL focused on three basic goals, which guided the
different actions throughout the four years. These goals are to (i)   improve the antipoverty
focus of public expenditure; (ii)    increase the access of the poor to quality health and
education services; and (iii)  enhance the transparency of social programs, while empowering
beneficiaries in their designand implementation.

209.   During PSRL I11 negotiations the Government and the Bank defined a list of
proposed actions to be adopted before PSRL IV appraisal. These include actions in budget
management, a legal framework for decentralization, food programs, pension policy, reforms
in health and education, implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system, and
improvements in the procurement system. Among the fourteen actions expected to be
completed by appraisal of PSRL IV, there were eight triggers and six benchmarks. Of those,
one trigger had to be replaced, due to changes in the pace of the decentralization process.
The remaining triggers and benchmarks will be met by appraisal, albeit some minor changes
were made to the phrasing, to clarify them.

210.   The eight triggers were focused on the eight main areas of the social policy, and
advances in each of them reflect the overall effort of Peru's government to reform the social
sectors. As each of these triggers are expected to by fully met at the time of appraisal, they
will be presented to the Board of the Bank as the Prior Actions for this operation.

211. The first trigger is the only one that had to be replaced. This trigger was prepared in
the context of the decentralization process, as it was expected that these two sectors would
start to decentralize in the short term and, hence, it was critical to have an adequate legal
framework to guarantee that access and quality of services would not decline and would
improve thanks to opportunities created through decentralization. However, during 2004, the
Government made it clear that it i s not planning to advance with decentralization of these
sectors in the short term because it considers current conditions inadequate, as the
institutional and political environments are not adequate. This situation reduced the
relevance and feasibility of the planned legal framework. Decentralization of health and




                                                     58

education sectors are the last stage in the government chronogram of decentralization. The
adoption of formal laws in the short term was therefore neither urgent nor feasible.
Meanwhile, some actions taken during 2004 have improved the ability of the government to
control the decentralization process and avoid disruption of social programs. The Law on
Accreditation, approved in June 2004, establishes rules regarding the minimum conditions
local governments must satisfy before they can receive decentralized programs and defines
the authority of the central government to take back program execution if municipalities do
not hold an adequate standard of operations. Also, the Government has advanced in the
institutionalization of management agreements (Convenios de Administracih por
Resultados -CAR) as a tool to regulate, monitor, and enforce compliance with goals by local
authorities as different programs decentralize. The CARSwill be fully regulated through the
Permanent Budget Law, the framework legislation that sets the requirements for the annual
budgets, which is expected to be approved by Congress before November 30, 2004. While
specific laws on Health and Education will be necessary to proceed with a smooth
decentralization of these sectors, the steps taken during 2004 certainly show an advance in
right direction. Given these considerations, the team considered it reasonable to replace the
original trigger with one that i s more consistent with the slower advances of decentralization
in the social sectors, while providing evidence that the Government has maintained its
commitment to the protectionof social programs duringthe decentralization process.

212.    The phrasing in the trigger about the food programs was corrected to make it clear
that the required regulations are not implemented exclusively though laws, and that it refers
only to the programs that have been decentralized. The trigger had four specific goals: (i)  to
have the budget for nutrition programs allocated following a pro-poor formula, (ii)  to ensure
that performance agreements related to Comedores Populares have been signed with 50
municipalities and are being monitored by a central government agency, (iii)to have
monitoring information available to the communities of these 50 municipalities, (iv) and to
require that compliance with targets i s a criteria for the transfer of resources to these 50
municipalities. These goals were satisfied through a combination of laws, decrees,
regulations, and Ministerial directives, as the actual enforcement depended on different
authorities.

213.     The remaining six triggers have been met, and in several cases, the expected goals
were exceeded. Budget execution for the six PSPs in the January-August 2004 period was
87% of the global target; on pensions, the Government not only published the strategy
document but it took a very proactive attitude towards the Civil Servants program, proposing
(and receiving an overwhelming support from Congress in a first vote) a Constitutional
amendment that would allow the closing of this extremely unfair and expensive scheme.
Coverage goals in the Health Insurance program were largely exceeded, for both children
under 5 years old and pregnant women; and the implementation of the new human resources
system in Education proceeded at a much faster pace than expected, with nearly 90% of
executing units using the unifiedpayroll system, a major improvement in comparison to the
situation just a few years ago. Finally, the development of a participatory, transparent
monitoring and evaluation system for the social programs and the modifications in the
procurement system have proceed as expected and should result inbetter accountability and
social participation inthe design and implementation of social programs.




                                               59

214.    In addition to the triggers, a group of six benchmarks were included in the matrix.
All of them have been met.They include (i) publication of the Macro Social Framework,
                                              the
providing a medium term framework to the social policy planning; (ii) protection of
                                                                             the
PSPs at the budgeting stage, as the 2004 budget continued to be equal or higher in real terms
than in 2003, and the planned 2005 budget will continue this trend, (iii) the implementation
of two laws increasing the contribution rates and reducing high benefits in the Cedula Viva
pension scheme, which will generate savings of approximately S./75 million per year, and
the collection of information from agencies managing the scheme, (iv) the signature and
monitoring of management agreements between Ministry of Health and the Regional Health
Departments (DISAs). Agreements have been signed with 29 DISAs (only Lima and Callao
didnot sign due to institutional problems within the DISAs) and results are being monitored
in all regions (including Lima and Callao), (v) a teacher's hardship and merits incentives
system has been developed and i s under consultation, and (vi) the Law of Transparency and
Access to Information has been implemented, allowing communities to access information
inorder to assessthe implementationof social programs.

215.    The overall advance of the programs, considering the triggers and benchmarks that
have been met, as well as the proactive attitude of Peru's authorities to continue advancing
in their social reform program has been important, as it has not only an immediate effect on
social policies but also consolidates previous reforms and confirms a sustained path.

C. Cooperation with other multilateralagenciesand donors

216.    PSRL IV i s a World Bank operation, with no participation by other agencies or
donors. However, the team has been incontact with specialists in this area at the IDB, which
i s currently preparing a social sectors loan. The IDB operation aims at increasing equity at
the regional and individual level, by improving programs' targeting and developing a system
to monitor the quality of expenditures inthe social sectors.

217.    Several activities included in the IDB operation are linked to PSRL actions, both in
this fourth stage and in the previous loans. In this way, IDB loan continues the support for
some of the most critical areas in social policy reform, enhancing their sustainability over
time.

218.    The World Bank and the IMF have engaged in an interactive and continuous
dialogue on the World Bank's country assistance implementation, as well on the subsequent
programmatic loans, Social Reforms Loans and Decentralization and Competitiveness Loan.
The DECSAL I1 Program has been coordinated with the IMFat all stages. The dialogue has
concentrated on the macroeconomic background, setting of triggers, overall loan
conditionality, and risks and estimation of fiscal implications of Banks' operations.        On
issues related to decentralization, the IMF has taken the lead in assisting in the design of tax
reform, the Bank has taken the lead on the design and implementation of decentralization of
the social sectors and pro-poor spending policies, and on the area of monitoring and
evaluation of public expenditures. Joint work in particular continues in the area fiscal
decentralization and competitiveness. The Bank has contributed together with the Fund on
drafting laws and regulations for fiscal decentralization. In addition, a joint IMF-World
Bank-IaDB mission has taken place in September 2004 for a pilot study on Public
Investment and Fiscal Policy.




                                               60

219.    At the request of the Peruvian authorities, the IMF Executive Board approved a 26-
month Stand-By Arrangement on June 9, 2004 (see Annex 5), which the authorities are
treating as precautionary (Peru has not made any drawings under IMF arrangements since
1997 and intends not to do so under this arrangement). The program for 2004-06 aims at
consolidating macroeconomic stability, fortifying confidence, strengthening the basis for
sustainable growth and employment creation so as to reduce poverty. It focuses on the
consistent implementation of the authorities' inflation-targeting framework and on fiscal
consolidation, with a view to continue reducing vulnerabilities associated with public debt
and financial dollarization, while increasing the scope for priority social and infrastructure
investment. Discussions of the first review under the Stand-by Arrangement were held on
September 2004. The IMF staff`s initial assessment notes that the economy has continued to
perform well in 2004 and that the medium term outlook remains favorable. The political
situation i s viewed as a main risk to the program, but this i s tempered by an apparent
political consensus for prudent macroeconomic policies and certain structural reforms. To
help achieve the program objectives, the staff has indicated that further structural progress
needs to be made, including inthe areas of competitiveness and fiscal decentralization. Both
issues are being addressed by the Government with the support of the proposed DECSAL 11.

D.Fiduciary Arrangements and LoanDisbursement

220.    During the preparation of this fourth phase loan, the Bank team has performed a
review of the current status of the PFM reforms achieved during the program
implementation of prior PSRLs and as a result of the CFAA conducted in 2001, concluding
that these reforms continue to be in force and sustainable. Over the life of the program, the
Government has continued to strengthen public financial management on its own initiative
and the Bank has supported those initiatives through complementary operations in the
country portfolio, namely the DECSAL Iand I1and the supporting two technical assistance
Loans, namely Institutional Capacity for Sustainable Fiscal Decentralization and
Accountability for Decentralizationinthe Social Sectors loans.

221.    The Bank's due diligence included desk review of available information such as the
annual external Audit Report of the Central Bank, which contained an unqualified opinion; a
review of the results of a Special Examination performed of the Central Bank by the
Controller General's Office; and meetings with Government Officials including the
Controller General of the Republic. The IMF Safeguards Assessment of 2001 concluded that
the Central Bank procedures and controls to manage resources, including IMF
disbursements, appear generally adequate. Recommendations made by the fund included:-
1) Strengtheningof the special external audit committee 2) Implementation of International
Accounting Standards as appropriate to the annual financial statements 3) Enhancement in
the follow of external audit recommendations by the Internal Audit Office. These
recommendations have been fully implemented. The Fund i s currently carrying out an
update of the 2001 Assessment.

222.    Disbursement arrangements will follow the procedures for DPL approved by the
Board on August 2004. Except as the Bank may otherwise agree: (i)       all withdrawals from
the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into an account designated by the
Borrower and acceptable to the Bank; and (ii) Borrower shall ensure that upon each
                                                   the



                                              61

deposit of an amount of the Loan into said account, such amount or an equivalent amount i s
credited in the borrower's accounting system to an account, acceptable to the Bank, that
finances budget obligations. The proceeds of the loan may not be used to finance
expenditures typically excluded under the Loan Agreement.

E.Risks

223.    PSRL lV is not without its risks and challenges. Being the last stage of a four-year
program, its sustainability becomes the most serious challenge, as there i s no legal
commitment from the Government to sustain some policies after this operation and
Presidential elections approach. Political instability persists in Peru, and some of the policies
supported by this program may become the subject of sectoral pressures.

224.    The country's main weaknesses include low public support for the Government,
some regional unrest, continued low levels of public investment, and the uncertainty
surrounding the 2006 presidential elections, which are also prompting opposition leaders to
put pressure on the government to increase expenditure. Social demands and conflicts have
escalated in recent month^,^ and this could place additional pressure on weak public finances
and social service-delivery at a time when decentralization i s underway. The proposed
decentralization reforms, including the accreditation of sub-national governments are
politically sensitive. The design and management of these mechanisms could cause
distortions in fiscal and functional assignments at the sub-national level with negative
consequences for social service-delivery and the overall credibility of the decentralization
process. This reinforces one of the most serious risks for the PSRL, which i s the risk of a
dominance of political over technical criteria as the country i s moving towards presidential
elections.

225,    Diverging views on the goals, instruments, and methodologies of decentralization
between key actors at the central level could further limit the progress and sustainability of
the reforms. In a highly unequal society, such as Peru, opposition from vested political or
economic interest groups might also reduce the progress of programs or, depending on social
movements and the next administration, reverse some reforms. This i s further compounded
by growing support for the opposition. Substantial progress has been made with reforms, but
the remaining agenda i s great and the government faces important challenges ahead in
implementing it. Greater consensus between key sectors at the central government level will
be neededto ensure greater sustainability of the reforms. This includes the need for a change
of management and a communication strategy to address the unrealistic expectations about
decentralization shared by large parts of the population and many sub-national governments.
Reforms will need to heighten the level of transparency at the national and regional and local
levels of public administration, where corruption continues to be a challenge.



   Since taking office, the current administration has faced cycles of damaging political protest against some
    of its key policies. The Arequipa riots, in June of 2002, were a response to efforts to privatize state-run
    energy companies in southern Peru. These demonstrations resulted in virtually ceasing privatization in
    2002 and 2003. In 2003, the government faced similar protests by coca workers, which were only resolved
    after promises were made that were then largely unfulfilled. The government also faced a strike by
    teachers, which forced it to offer a wage increase. Social unrest continued in 2004 and escalated when on
    April 2004 the mayor of the small town of Ilave, inthe department of Pun0 was accused of corruption and
    killedby a horde.



                                                      62

226.    There are two mitigating factors that have reduced the probability that these risks will
affect the program's sustainability. First, PSRL has actively supported (with an important
degree of success) the adoption of core principles (bases) of a poverty reduction strategy.
These principles have beenendorsed by a national dialogue, coupled with the Roadmap, and
helped create greater consensus in the social sectors and increased commitment to reforms.
Also, PSRL has promoted a participatory approach in the design and implementation of
social policies, with active participation of civil society at different levels of government and
consultations with sub-national governments. The implementation of a transparent
evaluation and monitoring scheme, support for expansion of the CLAS model in health
services provision, and changes in procurement are a few examples of policies that will
result in more sustained and better involvement by NGOs and beneficiaries, demand for
accountability and their ownership over the programs, and thus expand political support of
the reforms in the long term. Most recent progress in the Ministry of Education, for example,
in the human resource management, underlines the increased ownership of reforms in key
ministries beyond the MEFwhere ownership continues to be strong.

227.    Secondly, the Bank will continue to support the reform of social programs through
several different operations, among which the Decentralization Loan ("DECSAL")            and the
Technical Assistance Loans for the Social Sectors and Decentralization are most important.
DECSAL will continue to support the implementation of decentralization in the Social
Sectors, while the Technical Assistance Loan will finance further development of specific
activities included in PSRL. The ESW on the social sectors currently undertaken b y the
Bank also provides an opportunity for the Bank to maintain and deepen the policy dialogue
inpreparation for upcoming social sector operations, helpingto increase the sustainability of
PSRL reforms and adding further international experience to the specific social sector
analysis undertaken. Also, IDB i s currently working on a Social Sectors Loan that i s fully in
line with PSRL objectives and will aim at consolidating and deepening the reforms
implemented inthe last four years.

228.    The best protection against sustainability risks i s ownership of reforms by the
Government. When government officials have close involvement in the definition and
implementation of policies, they are much more likely to support them when other sectors
propose changes. In the case of Peru, ownership has been relatively high, as policies and
programs have been designed by the Government, and the Bank had a supporting role. As in
other reform programs, the commitment by authorities in different areas has not been
uniform, but even after many changes in the Cabinet, the government has continued to
sustain the basic framework of PSRL as the core of its social policy, indicating that it will
continue to do so after the PSRL program i s completed.

229.     Given the high level of dollarization throughout Peru's economy, there i s a
sustainability risk linked to possible external interest rate and exchange rate shocks. While it
i s not possible to completely eliminate this type of risk, the Government has developed a
sustained effort to diminish it, by carefully implementing its stabilization program, including
particularly its efforts to achieve fiscal and debt sustainability.

230.     A more detailed set of risks related to the different components of the program are
presented in the next table, indicating the level of risk we assign to each problem, the

 specific mitigating actions that the Government has taken or will take in the near future, and
 the role o f WB instruments to support these mitigating actions.

                 VI. ProgramBenefitsandSocial and EnvironmentalImpacts
231.    Following the guidelines of OPBP 8.60, this section reviews possible effects of
operation implementation. We consider the program's impact on the poverty level and
social conditions, its impact on the environment, the role of civil society in the design and
implementation of the policies proposed here, the development of the program, and
fiduciary aspects.

A. PovertyandSocialImpact

232.    The proposed loan will provide financial support to the ongoing reform program for
the social sectors. As such, it will accompany existing processes, rather than trigger new
ones, so as to maximize their overall effectiveness and poverty reduction impact. In order
to achieve the goals of increased access to and improved quality of social services, the loan
policy matrix provides continuity for the retargeting of selected social programs, such as
the Feeding and Nutrition Programs, while supporting coverage expansion of basic
services, such as primary education, health care and, inthe mediumterm, pensions.

233.    Better targeting of resources, together with coverage expansion, are expected to
improve the overall allocation of public resources for the social sectors, while increasing
access and quality of services for the poor and vulnerable. As a result, we do not foresee
any negative distributional impact associated with such measures, nor any significant social
opposition to the continuity of the program.

234.    With regard to the indigenous population, the implementation of PSRL should
result in an improvement in quality of living, as the different actions in the policy matrix
aim to improve the conditions of all social groups, particularly those who are poorer and
more vulnerable. The M&E system supported by the PSRL has incorporatedindicators that
will track differentiated access and quality of service delivery of the social programs
according to ethnic, gender, and age groups. The system will therefore help the adoption of
corrections in the delivery system to improve social inclusion. Additionally, special
attention i s given to the needs of dispersed and indigenous groups by some protected social
programs, as well as Bank-financed projects (education, health, Indigenous and Afro-
Peruvians Peoples Development LIL).Also, the GEF-financed Indigenous Management of
Protected Areas in the Amazon Project will help regularize issues related to land-tenure
and environment inthe Amazon area.

235.    The policies supported by this program are not expected to have a direct impact on
income poverty, as they are not directly focused on income provision but on improvements
in services received by the poor. Thus, the effect of the program should be seen not in the
level of income poverty but in other social indicators, such as health, education, and
nutritional status, especially inpoor and vulnerable groups.

236.    Annex 4 of this document presents a detailed review of available indicators on
poverty and social conditions. While availability of data for recent years i s limited,
information collected from the upcoming Poverty Assessment, the report under preparation



                                              67

by UNDP on the MillenniumDevelopment Goals, and the most recent National Household
Survey show that while income poverty has not changed significantly in recent years, other
social indicators have improved.

B. Environment, Forest, and NaturalResourceAspects

237.    Following OP8.60, the operation was reviewed for any relevant aspects for the
environment, forest and natural resources. As the loan focuses on reforming social policies
and institutions at the macro level, the operation i s not likely to have significant effects on
the environment, forests and natural resources in Peru. Actions included in the policy
matrix aim to increase access to basic social services by the poor by improving fiscal and
financial conditions and strengthening the institutions involved in service delivery.

238.    While some of the proposed actions are related to the health system, they do not
have, directly or indirectly, an environmental effect, since they focus on the institutional
arrangements between the central government and local authorities, the development of
mechanisms to improve community control over health services quality, and a financial
scheme to provide care for mothers and children under five years old.

C. Participation

239.    Participation of civil society has been a major component of PSRL since its
beginning, through three different channels. Firstly and most importantly, the Government
has systematically engaged in national and sectoral consultations with civil society and
other stakeholders on the policies and mechanisms supported by the loan. Infact, the PSRL
IwastheresultdiscussionsheldintheNationalDialogue-a nationalforumledbythe
Government of Peru-, which involves all sectors and branches of the government, political
parties, the private sector, and civil society representatives. Subsequently, the evolution o f
most of the pillars of the strategy included in the matrix derived from consultations carried
out by the Government, such as decisions to protect priority social programs, enhance
access to public information, and decentralize. Sectoral fora such as FOROSALUD and the
Education Forum, which involved main stakeholders of each sector, also contributed with
feedback and backing to important actions supported b y the loan. Even some of the specific
measures and mechanisms contained in the matrix were objects of broad consultations led
by respective governmental sectors or institutions.

240.    The preparation of PSRL itself has also been a participatory process, as MEF
officials and the Bank team have met with representatives of Mesas de Concertacion de
Lucha Contra la Pobreza, the National Association of NGOs (ANC) and other civil society
organizations and think tanks in every mission, maintaining a continuous dialogue about
the different components of the loan. In the context of operations linked to the PSRL, like
the JSDF Grant and the Social TAL, Bank teams have promoted seminars and workshops
involving civil society organizations and experts on topics related to specific measures
supported by the PSRL. All previous program documents have been disclosed following
the Bank's policy.




                                               68

241.      Finally, promoting higher participation i s explicitly and prominently included in the
policy matrix as a critical action that the government needs to implement to improve the
overall quality of the social sectors. The details of this component of the matrix, as well as
the important advances registered in each of the four stages of the program are discussed in
the corresponding section of the program document.

242.      Overall, the extensive consultations with civil society carried out by Peru and its
system are satisfactory from the standpoint of OPBP 8.60.

D.FiduciaryAspects

243.      The Government has been committed to improving transparency and access to
information and to promoting better governance and administration of public finances.

244.     The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) conducted in 2001
concluded that the financial tools at the disposal of the Congress and Executive Branch
included robust financial administration legislation, a highly dedicated staff, and an
effective integrated financial management system (SIAF). The major recommendations of
the CFAA related to (a) more effective oversight by Congress of the budget process and
review of the allocations of available funding, (b) more detailed and frequent reporting on
expenditures to Congress, and (c) unfettered surveillance and reporting by the Controller
General of the acts and reports of the executive. Three indispensable elements of a sound
fiduciary framework were built into the CAS and policy framework for the PSRL 11: (1)
strengthening congressional oversight of the use of public funds, (2) increasing
independence of the Controller General, and (3) expanding the scope and coverage of the
integrated financial management system SIAF6.

245.      SIAFwas implementedin 1998 as a mandatory internet-based system for recording
data related to expenditures and revenues for the national budget. SIAF i s a powerful
repository of financial transactions. At the central government level, there are four
modules: Treasury Budget Execution, Accounting, Financial Statements Generation and
Debt Management. Budget classifications are integrated into the Chart of Accounts.
Information and are put to good use by the MEF and spending agencies. The
implementation of the system has promoted effective control, optimum cash management,
and informed decision making. The SIAF i s also used by some Bank-Financed Projects,
and Basic financial Statements are generated directly from the government's system.

246.     With regard to procurement procedures, the review of the country's legal
procurement framework, including the development of specific local regulations for
selection and contracting of consultants and the implementation of local standard
biddinghelection documents, i s also paramount. As emphasized in the CAS, it should


  Some SIAF core subsystems are under development. These modules include: a) Human Resource
Management-essentialfor civil service reform; b) National Assets- for due registry of state assets; and (c)
Monitoring and Evaluation of public expenditure, with a special focus on the tracking of PSPs spending.
They should be fully implemented by early 2005. Others have not been designed yet, like a Contingent
Liabilities modulefor due registry and to make proper provisions for in future budgets.




                                                    69

enable the achievement of increased transparency and efficiency in public procurement.
Although the GOP has recently conducted a review of the procurement law and a revised
draft proposing specific changes and i s expected to submit it to Congress, it will not
address issues regarding procedures and practices that are in conflict with international
accepted procurement standards. The preparation and implementation of national standard
procurement/selection documents has not yet started.

247.    Actions supported by this loan aim to improve the procurement procedures, with
particular regard to the purchase of food for food-aid programs at the local level. These
actions, which have already been implemented, have resulted in increased transparency and
economy inbiddingprocesses and enhanced public access to procurement information.

                                ANNEX 2. The accreditation process
1.      The transfer of responsibilities and resources to sub national levels of governments can be
the most important challenge in designing and implementing an effective decentralization model.
Within the fiscal federalism model, of the three functions assigned to the public sector, namely
macroeconomic stabilization, income redistribution, and resources allocation, generally only the
last function can be transferred to sub national governments with the goal o f optimizing allocative
efficiency. Ln designing intergovernmental fiscal relations and in particular the transfer system, the
principles o f subsidiarity, economies of scale and of scope and institutional and fiscal capacity need
to be balanced. International experience indicates that a strategy i s needed to mitigate key risks
such as an (i)asymmetry between assigned responsibilities and revenues and expenditures,
potentially leading to duplication, inefficiencies and macroeconomic deficits (ii)      deterioration of
service delivery, (iii)limited accountability due to a mismatch between transferred responsibilities
and resources, and (iv) politization of the transfer process in which political interests prevail over
technical and fiscal criteria, which can jeopardize the sustainability of the decentralization process.
2.       Peru has chosen an unusual and innovative path to the transfer of competences and
resources: Regionaland local governments need to pass their accreditation, showing that they have
the sufficient management capacity to adequately exercise the functions and resources to be handed
over to them. As a specific system for the transfers process to ensure an orderly and piecemeal
process, the accreditation process thus becomes an expression of the gradualism o f decentralization
- one of the three guiding principles of decentralization in Peru. At the same time, the gradual
approach helps to limit the risks mentioned earlier, above all the fiscal risksthat might endanger the
fiscal sustainability of the decentralization process - embodied in another guiding principle of
Peru's decentralization model, the goal of fiscal neutrality. B y making competitiveness an
important requirement for accreditation, the system i s based on the third guidingprinciple, the goal
of using the decentralization process to promote sub national competitiveness. Given the unclear
functional assignment expressed in the legal framework so far in Peru, where shared, quite general
responsibilities abound, the accreditation process can be an important instrument to manage the
overall transfer process - unless it becomes a victim o f political pressures.
3.       Initial experiences with accreditation have underlinedthe complexity of the challenges, and
the limitations of managing the accreditation system. In light of the lack of an accreditation system,
so far, a simplified and provisional system of accreditation has been started to be implemented.
This only applies to the decentralization of social programs, the first stage of the transfer process.
67 provincial goverments have been accredited under this simplified version for the transfer o f food
programs, and 241 district municipalities for the transfer of social infrastructure programs. For
2004, the proposed budget for the transfer of food programs amounts to S/.26,700,000 for the
transfer to the 67 provincial municipalities and for social fund projects it i s projected at
S/.47,900,000 for the 241 district municipalities. This process has been based on two resolutions by
the CND on verifications of mechanisms and basic conditions for the transfer by the MIMDES.
Conditions for their accreditation were quite formalistic in nature, such as requirements o f the
existence of key sub national institutions (such as Coordination Councils), a participatory
development plan and participatory budgeting process and basic administrative and competitiveness
requirements. The simplified accreditation process helped municipalities to prepare for the transfer
and initiate basic steps to convert the system into a monitoring and evaluation system. However,
there are also serious shortcomings which should provide lessons for the general accreditation
system. From anecdotal evidence, the conditions sometimes became a very basic checklist for the
MIMDES, in which independent of the quality o f the instruments provided, without further
evaluation, the simple existence of such instruments and plans were sufficient to grant



                                                  78

accreditation. There was very limited actual verification of the conditions and a more systematic
follow-up and monitoring was generally missing. While there were examples of a strong local
commitment and ownership, in other cases, it became clear that within a region the same
development plan was written for a number of municipalities, merely changing the name of the
locality. Very limited dissemination about this simplified accreditation system, the need for it and
the means to do it contributed to a very limited understanding o f the system. In other cases, partisan
politics encouraging elected local authorities to refuse any imposition from the top, discredited the
accreditation process.
4.       The accreditation process has also been further complemented by so called management
agreements between the central level and local governments. In the case of food programs, 64
management contracts have been signed between the MIMDES and the provincial governments.
Another 27 have been signed between the MIMDES and local governments on the transfer of
Social Fund resources. These management contracts aim at ensuring more efficient and effective
management of resources and guaranteeing minimum levels of service-delivery . They specify
resources transferred, the purposed for which they can be used, targets that need to be complied
with and monitoring requirements to be submitted periodically to the MIMDES Another 58
provincial municipalities and 165 district municipalities are expected to receive the transfer of the
respective food and social fund projects later this year. These transfers will also be complemented
by management contracts, signed between the MIMDES and these local governments, and linked to
the accreditation process.
5.       Congress has approved the general Accreditation Law on June 16, 2004. The law sets the
legal framework for accreditation across sectors starting with this year's transfer plan. The
underlying substantial divergences on the need for accreditation, the process, methodology and its
monitoring have resulted in a law that i s quite diverse in its content and formulation. Currently, its
regulations are being elaborated.
6.       The regulations o f the Accreditation law that are currently elaborated with support of the
Bank offer the opportunity to address some weaknesses of the law. Regulations should include a
focus on the SIAF in the role of verification of criteria for accreditation, building on the existing
SIAF currently expanded at the local level. The information needed to verify if accreditation
criteria are met should be generated and obtained from the SIAF as the only effectively viable
system currently in place for these purposes. This would avoid duplication and contradictory
outcomes between the information managed between the SIAF and the proposed system by the
CND.
7.        For greater transparency, public disclosure of the accreditation assessments should be
 made obligatory (including, for example through MEF's Consulta Amigable). This could include
publication of the requirements o f the accreditation system, progress achieved, and the names and
 achievement of those sub national governments already accredited, including the assessments of
 these governments. This could further be improved if the accreditation o f sub national governments
 could also made public through a legal norm, such as a ministerial resolution or a supreme decree.
 8.      The regulations should emphasize the need to make the accreditation system as simple,
 efficient and cost-effective as possible, avoiding to set up any huge, lengthy and bureaucratic
 hurdles, but rather to set adequate incentives to ensure that the transfer of responsibilities takes
 place in a gradual and fiscally responsive fashion in which through a correspondence of functions
 and financing service-delivery, accountability and fiscal discipline can be ensured to the greatest
 extent possible. In particular, the link between the annual transfer plan and the accreditation should
 be reinforced to ensure the correspondence between the responsibilities and resources transferred
 and avoid duplication.




                                                   79

9.      The institutional set-up should be revised, strengthening the outsourcing part and limiting
the responsibilities of the CND which cannot be in charge of deciding on the accreditation and be
the instance of appeal for conflict-resolution.

                                The Accreditation Law: Key content

   The accreditation law reflects the consensus reached on various highly diverging issues:
     Accreditation i s understood as the process ranging from the demand for the transfer of
     resources, the fulfillment of the accreditation requirements, the accreditation itself, the transfer
     of functions and resources to conflict resolution and the possible signing o f cooperation
     agreements between parties for the preparation and implementation of the accreditation
     process.
   Contrary to earlier intentions, it addresses both regional and local governments.

0  The accreditation law aims at certifying the management capacity of sub national governments
     for decentralization on the basis of technical and transparent criteria, and to create
     management information systems for decentralized public management.

0  To be accredited, sub national governments need to fulfill certain sectoral, fiscal and
     management requirements, including a number of mainly institutional and administrative
     conditions, such as a development plan, an institutional development plan, a participatory plan
     and budget, fulfillment of the rules of fiscal transparency - conditions which are simplified for
     the poorest municipalities.
    The criteria for the elaboration of management indicators are quite broad and weak, stretching
     from management capacity, fiscal and economic management, competitiveness and
     transparency and participation.
    For the design, execution and monitoring of the accreditation process, the CND has been given
     the leading role, but the possibility of outsourcing the decision on the fulfillment o f the
     accreditation requirements exists as well.

 10.      There i s no link to the management contracts or other specific M&E arrangements, but the
 law foresees the possibility of medium-term framework agreements for the transfer of resources.
 11.     A stronger link need to be established with the simplified accreditation system for social
 programs to ensure the continuity of the process already advancing and that those sub national
 governments already accredited do not lose their accreditation, including an emphasis on national
 minimumsector standards should be emphasized to ensure adequate levels of service-delivery The      .
 regulations should ensure continuity of the processes started by MIMDES and CND, so that on-
 going and future accreditation processes are well harmonized and reinforce each other.
 12.     The accreditation process also needs to be monitored closely. The system should allow for
 the transformation of the accreditation system into a system of monitoring and evaluation, including
 solid systems of reporting, and accounting. A revision of the accreditation should take place
 periodically to ensure that any feedback from the M&E can be incorporated into the process and
 that potential initial shortcomings can be corrected swiftly. Procedures for monitoring and ex ante
 and ex post evaluation of fiscal balances of sub national governments should be clearly specified as
 part of the accreditation process. Compliance with targets agreed i s particularly important for the
 transfer of social programs, such as food programs.
  13.    Links to the management agreements CdGs and the CARS should be introduced to
 complement the accreditation process and ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of transfers. In
 particular for the transfer of health and education to the regions and the transfer of social programs



                                                     80

to the municipalities, it is crucial to have a clear link between the accreditation system and these
management agreements.
14.      Indicators for the accreditation process should specify criteria of efficiency, targeting,
participation, transparency and fiscal responsibility. This i s particularly relevant for the
decentralization of health and education where the legal framework should also establish the
regulatory role for the Ministries of Health and Education in the planning and monitoring o f health
and education resources channeled to the regions.

I.SUMMARY

The Government's social policy i s one of the key instruments in fighting against poverty.
The priority is to guarantee universal access to basic quality services (health, education,
nutrition) to prevent loss of human potential. Additionally, i t i s necessary to increase
economic opportunities for the poor population, mainly by preventive maintenance of
social and productive infrastructure (health care centers, schools, roads, irrigation canals,
etc). On the other hand, it i s important to improve efficiency and transparency of public
management while at the same time social expenditure i s protected and rationalized within
the context of decentralization and based upon resources already allocated to different
sectors.
  Generating dignified and productive work opportunities i s the great challenge for the
whole society. Investment, production and productivity are mainly the responsibility of the
private sector. The State actions only generate conditions and build a bridge between
communities and families that cannot express their demands inthe market and who suffer a
highconsumption deficit. Additional social investment is guidedby alert signs based upon
the demands of families at risk, which permit to integrate and simplify the actions deriving
from diagnostics.
Taking into account the National Agreement, the Social Policy Letter, the 2004-2006
National Plan for Overcoming Poverty and the 2005-2007 Multi-annual Macroeconomic
Framework, this document contains: social policy diagnostic and objectives, priorities and
commitments for the 2004-2006 period, to then end in actions corresponding to scheduled
policies to guarantee their compliance.

II.DIAGNOSTIC
More than 50 percent of Peruvians -coincidently those who are underemployed and
unemployed- live with less than US$2 a day. 10 Half of these people live in the rural areas
(7.4 million people) and half in the urban area (7.2 million people), including Metropolitan
Lima. Extreme poverty affects 5.7 million people whose income i s less than one dollar a
day and i s not enough to cover basic food needs. In the rural population, 73.6% are poor
and 42.6% are extremely poor. In the urban area, including Metropolitan Lima, 2.45
millionpeople are extremely poor.
   The consumption deficit i s expressed in the additional amount of annual monetary
resources poor families would need to generate to get out of poverty. The basic
consumption deficit affecting all the poor people (Le. the difference between the average
cost of the basic consumption basket per capita, approximately US$ 2 daily, and the per
capita expense of each family) i s estimated at S/. 12,667 million for 2004, while the food

consumption deficit affecting all the extremely poor (i.e. the difference between the
average cost o f the food basic basket per capita, approximately U S $ 1 daily, and the per
capita expenditure o f each family i s estimated at S/. 2,6 10 million for the same year.

Economic growth i s essential for reducing poverty. In 1994-1997, a period with important
economic growth, there was a decrease in poverty and extreme poverty, most o f all in
urban areas. However, in rural areas poverty i s linked to more permanent factors. After
overcoming the stagnation phase started in 1998, Peruvian economy grew by 4.9 percent in
2002, the largest rate in the last five years, attained during a period o f economic and
political turmoil in the region. Meanwhile, in 2003, the growth rate was 4.1 per cent.
However, growth i s not sufficient. It needs to be inclusive and redistributive, aligning
economic and social policy to the common objective o f reducing poverty. The idea i s
overcome the current labor market situation -characterized by a high proportion o f
independent and family work in low productivity units- as well as to develop the basic
productive infrastructure and local markets in rural areas. At the same time we must
acknowledge that cultural discrimination and weak exercise of civil rights are added to
economic factors in explaining poverty.

The State's social expenditure also increased in the 90s. However, the assistance approach
and the lack o f efficiency in many programs limited its impact. The State social function
coverage and effectiveness is now being increased through a number o f measures aimed at
improving management and redirecting the use o f funds to better serve priorities and
guarantee transparency, committing all government levels inthis regard.

III.SOCIALPOLICY OBJECTIVES
The Social Policy aims at reaching full development o f human, social and institutional
capacity and seeks equity and social justice. It i s expressed in the set o f guidelines and
actions defined by the Government to assure all Peruvians dignified living conditions and
access to public goods and services.
 Its objectives coincide with the Equity and Social Justice Objectives o f the National
Agreement, which contains the following policies:

a)     Poverty reduction
b)     Access to Free and Quality Basic Public Education
c)     Access to Health and Social Security Services
d)     Guarantee Child Nutritionand Promotion o f Family Food Security
e)     Promote Dignified and Productive Employment
f)     Promote Equal Opportunities without Discrimination


Thus, a social policy directed at reaching full development o f human capacity and seeking
social equity must be expressed in a number o f guidelines and actions defined by the
Government to assure all Peruvians dignified living conditions with development
possibilities.   The basic courses o f action regarding said policy are contained inthe 2004-
2006 Roadmap o f the Peruvian Government - Topical Proposal VI: Overcoming poverty
with improvement in social expenditure quality and emphasizing health, education, labor,
housing and basic sanitation. it i s also expressed inthe Equity and Social Justice objective
o f the National Agreement, which prioritizes the following policies: a) Poverty reduction;
b) Access to Free and Quality Basic Public Education; c) Access to Basic Health and to a
 Social Security Package; d) Guarantee Child Nutrition and Promotion o f Food Security;
 and e) Promotion o f Dignified and Productive Employment.

I K 2004-2006 SOCIAL POLICY PRIORITIES AND COMMITMENTS
 Priorities and commitments are established in a decentralization and resource scarcity
 context, taking into account the urgent actions required on issues that are essential to life
 and comprehensive development, mainly o f extremely poor and vulnerable population.
 This implies working by redirecting public expenditure according to efficiency,
 productivity and equity in spending criteria.
 In this regard, the main actions shall be directed to human development and social
 protection o f prioritized groups and then at actions towards a healthy environment and at
 generating economic opportunities. To do so, core strategic priorities are established, as




                                               97

well as a number of complementary actions, according to intervention areas that align
Government actions towards prioritized groups.
Therefore, in terms of social policy the following basic guidelines ordered by priority are
proposed:

    Reducing human capacity loss, including access of the population to a basic package of
    health services, nutritional programs aimed at children under 3 years of age mainly in
    poor and extremely poor populations, as well as quality pre-schooling and primary
    education. It guarantees access to basic justice, understood as assurance of people's
    fundamental rights and access to appropriate ways of preventing disputes and solving
    them.
    Promoting the development of the basic capacities pointed out above, starting by
    improving access to secondary education, higher complexity health services and access
    to water and sanitation services.
    Promoting from the State while considering its subsidiary role, investment on
    infrastructure (roads, energy, communications, sanitation), information and technical
    assistance, as the necessary complement to leverage human capacities and expand the
    market mechanisms incharge of the private sector.
    Supporting temporary actions to generate employment by executing public asset
    maintenance.
In this regard the social priority in the country is to guarantee universal access to quality
basic services (health, nutrition and education) to prevent loss of human potential. Once
this priority is cared for, social expenditure must be directed to increase poor population's
access to basicjustice and preventive maintenance of social and productive infrastructure.
The abovementioned policy guidelines lead to the following criteria to prioritize social
expenditure:

First Criterion: Ensure efficient and effective use of goods and services (expenditure
quality) provided through Priority Social Programs (Pre-schooling, Primary Education,
Secondary Education, Individual Health, Collective Health, and Community Social
Promotion and Assistance) and Basic Justice (first level settlement of disputes).

Second Criterion: Ensuring operation and maintenance of social investments of the six
Priority Social Programs (Pre-schooling, Primary Education, Secondary Education,
Individual Health, Collective Health, and Community Social Promotion and Assistance)
and Basic Justice (first level settlement of disputes).

Third Criterion: Improving access -coverage- of people to basic health services
(preventive healtwpregnant mothers and children between 0 and 3 years of age) and
education (pre-schooling and primary). These services should also reach those areas in
which they are still not present, i.e. the rural area.

Fourth Criterion: In case of State actions not belonging to the six Priority Social
Programs or to basicjustice, the following spending guidelines shall be applied:




                                                 98

..  Ensuring that goods and services are a complement to actions aimed at developing
    human capacities.
    Ensuring operation and maintenance of social investments to complement actions
    aimed at developing human capacities.
    Prioritizing execution in extremely poor areas.
It is important to mention that during the last four years substantial progress has been made
on identifying priorities. In this regard, the social reform program loans agreed with the
World Bank inthe last few years have been circumscribed to this orientationbased on three
main axes: strengthening social policy planning, improving poor people access to quality
basic services and promoting social participation and transparency inpublic management.

IV.l BudgetaryPriorities
Priorities are financed in two ways, depending on the origin of financial resources: 1) by
reallocating currently allocated resources, as a result of improving the quality of
expenditure, to each one of the three main areas; and 2) with budgetary increases in a
scenario of fiscal prosperity.
In order to apply its priorities, the Government has defined a budgetary policy directed at
gradually increasing resources for these activities and investment within the framework of
fiscal balance.
 This budgetary policy i s reflected in the following directions that have been applied and
shall be maintained inthe near future:

i)      Give preference to the budget intended for education and culture, health and
        sanitation, and social assistance:
        o In2004, at least the samebudget executed in2003 will be executed.
        o A larger amount than that of 2004 has been budgeted for 2005 in the draft law
            submittedto Congress on August 30.
        o A Macro Social chapter has been included in the Multi-annual Macroeconomic
            Framework
ii)     Protecting the budget aimed at the 6 priority social programs (pre-schooling,
        primary education, secondary education, individual health, collective health and
        community and social assistance), particularly regarding non salary or pension
        expenditures:
        o A higher global amount was budgeted for 2004 and the amounts for 3 of these 6
            programs were higher than those of the previous year. At least 85% of this
            global amount will be executed.
        o The global amount and budget of 4 of these programs has been increased in the
            2005 budget draft law, replacing the community and social assistance program
            with the social and the poverty reduction programs transferred to local
            governments.
        o In the 2004 Budget Law and in the 2005 budget draft law an article has been
            included to prevent that budgets directed to this goal be transferred to salary
            expenditures or other programs.

IV. 2 Objectivesand policies by sector


                                               99

Basic Health:
0 Objectives: Guaranteeing access and quality care to the population, particularly those
  who live in poverty, prioritizing execution of preventive activities at large and those
  related to mother-child and families at risk in particular. Ensuring public subsidy in a
  Guaranteed HealthPlanfor the poorest families.
0 Policy Actions:
          o Improving the Integral Health Insurance (SIS, inSpanish) to increase access
             to priority health services, especially to mothers and children, expanding
              coverage. In order to promote SIS efficiency and to improve its financial
              sustainability, the 2005 budget shall prioritize resources directed to the first
              and second level of resources directed to hospitals, so as to prevent complex
              health care, which i s less equitable and less cost-effective, from capturing
              most of the budget.
          o Developing result driven management through Management Agreements
              between the Ministry of Health (MINSA, in Spanish) and Health
              Directorates (DISA, in Spanish), with the exception of Lima and Callao.
              However, in these two places management goals shall also be established
              and assessedby the Sector from its Headquarters.

BasicEducation:
0 Objectives: Improving quality of learning in the new education system, solving
  coverage and equity deficits, particularly in rural areas, prioritizing pre-schooling and
  primary education, particularly improving attendance, effective hours and educational
  materials -as well as secondary education by assuring eleven years of schooling- and
  basic educational achievements for all. Improving teacher and student attendance to
   attain 1000 annual effective hours. Ensuring timely registration of boys and girls
   (according to regulatory ages) in the first grade of primary school and increasing the
   number of boys and girls attaining the sixth grade of primary school at the regulatory
   age. Providing special attention to uncovered population, particularly bilingual, rural
   groups and children under 5 years of age. Priority: Improving basic education quality
   and reducing coverage deficit, mainly concerning pre-schooling and secondary
   education.

          o Developing an incentive system inhuman resource administration, to assure
              a minimum number of class hours, prioritizing rural areas. To do so, pilot
              projects are being implemented, including one of incentives to teachers in
              rural areas.
          o Implementing a nationwide job control and payroll automated system to
              avoid "ghost" teachers, analyzing teacher load and rationalization processes
              and facilitating the application of criteria to pay incentives regionally and
              locally.

SocialProtection:
0  Objective: increasing equity and efficiency in provision of nutritional programs and in
   the pension system, particularly in the first case, taking measures for an appropriate
   management that takes into account the decentralization process underway.



                                            100

0   Policy Actions:
           o The government has approved the regulations on transferring nutritional
               programs to sub-national governments and has signed management
               agreements for the gradual implementation of these programs by the
               corresponding governments, which are now being evaluated by the Ministry
               of Women and Social Development (MIMDES, in Spanish) as the
               regulatory entity. Likewise, criteria have been defined to allocate budgets
               following an equitable direction.
           o Publication by the Ministry of Economy and Finance of a policy strategy to
               improve the pension's system efficiency and coverage indicators.
               Improving the pension system by establishing measures to correct distortion
               generated by the "Ckdula Viva" system (a system that increases pension
               holders' salaries every time new increases to workers are agreed), limiting

Part of the social policy management strengthening process i s including participation,
transparency, and accountability mechanisms.       Also important i s the development of
follow-up systems to reflect these qualities and approach the State's social policies to
citizens.

PolicyActions:
           o Including a social chapter inthe Multi-annual Macroeconomic Framework.
           o Developing a monitoring system for social expenditure quality, emphasizing
               priority social programs that include participatory and transparency
               mechanisms intheir implementation. This system will permit to identify the
               main problems concerning expenditure execution, solving insufficiency and
               lack of articulation in existing information systems, increasing knowledge
               on information supply, promoting participation of society through social
               surveillance, and contributing as possible to the evaluation of efficiency,
               effectiveness and equity of the current social policy.
           o Includinguser satisfaction elements inhousehold surveys.
           o Improving transparency         and efficiency of public procurement by
               establishing regulations within the Higher Council for State Contracts and
               Acquisitions (CONSUCODE, in Spanish).
           o Establishing management agreements as an instrument for following up the
               performance of sub national governments for the case of transferred food
               programs.
           o Improving the Friendly Consultation ("Consulta Amigable, in Spanish) in
               the Financial Management Integrated System (SIAF, in Spanish), to make it
               more accessible.
           o Establishinglocal monitoring systems within the framework of developing a
               ParticipatoryBudget.

Taking into account three main axes: poverty reduction, improvement of poor population
access to basic services and increased participation in and transparency of social programs,
these are the following targets for 2006:

To assess progress and complying these 2006 objectives, it i s important to follow the
indicators that periodically measure progress made by government in the short term. Each
one of these indicators has targets to be reached in 2005.

                       Annex 4. Social Indicatorsand Results Monitoring
1.       The four operations grouped under the Programmatic Social Reform Loan Ito IV have
supported a series of reforms in the education, health and social protection sectors, aimed at
improving service provision, both in terms of coverage and quality, and, through these investments
inhuman capital, welfare.
2.       Although the full impact of most of these reforms will take years to unwind, some positive
trends can already be identified. We briefly describe here the recent evolution of poverty and
selected social indicators in Peru. Our choice of indicators i s based on two basic criteria: their
relevance in terms of the policies contemplated in the loan's program matrix, and the availability of
up-to-date information.
Poverty and other welfare indicators

3.       The national poverty rate increased significantly between 1997 and 2001 as a consequence
of the 1998/99 economic crisis, especially in urban areas. After this increase, the poverty rate
remained stable between 2001 and 2003, at around 55 percent, while the extreme poverty rate
declined from 24.4 to 21.6 during this same period". This implied that, due to population growth,
the number of poor increased by 400,000 people, while the number of extreme poor fell by 550,000
people.
 Table A4.1. The national poverty rate increased between 1997 and 2000 as a consequence
                                  of the 1998/99 economic crisis.. .

4.       Poverty figures are not comparable to those presented in Table A4.2 below due to changes
in the ENAHO' s sampling framework. There exists, however, significant variation across different
areas of the country, with poverty falling in rural areas and increasing in urban areas, especially in
metropolitan Lima. Across regions, poverty rates in both the Costa and the Sierra remained stable,
while those inthe Selva improved significantly.



l1 Due to changes in the ENAHO's sampling framework in 2000, a consistent poverty series cannot be
constructed for 1997-2003. Instead we present two sets of poverty numbers: one for 1997-2002, where the
figures for 2001 and 2002 have been adjusted to make them comparable to those of 1997-2000; and one for
2001-2003. Although the level of poverty varies across series, poverty trends are similar.

5.      Incontrast, the Unmet Basic Needs (UBN)index declined slightly between 2001 and 2003,
due mainly to improvements in housing conditions and access to basic services among the
population of metropolitan Lima.
6.      Differences between the evolution of monetary poverty and the UBN index are due to the
fact that both measures capture different aspects of poverty. While monetary poverty i s very
sensitive to cyclical changes in income and employment, the UBN index reflects a more structural
dimension of poverty and changes with secular trends in social and other investments.

Nutrition

7.       Malnutrition rates, especially among children, declined consistently duringthe 1990s, from
10.8 percent in 1992 to 7.1 in 2000, due to both long-term gains in welfare and the creation and
expansion of a series of nutrition and feeding programs serving different population groups.
8.      At the time when the first PSRL was negotiated with the Government of Peru, however,
these programs were poorly targeted and suffered from significant resource leakage. For these
reasons, the PSRL I-IV have strongly supported the rationalization of Peru's feeding and nutrition
programs. In particular, especial attention has been paid to the retargeting of benefits to the most
vulnerable and to the elimination of service overlap between different programs.

programs has been redirected from urban to rural areas, where poverty rates and malnutrition are
highest.

completion and adequate advancement rates, although starting from low levels, have shown
substantial improvements in recent years. The primary education completion rate increased from 22

15.       In the absence of direct measures of schooling quality and student performance, these
changes seem to suggest that the system has become more effective over time, at least in what
regards the retention and advancement of enrolled students through primary education. Moreover, a
large share of the observed improvements in completion and adequate advancement rates have
taken place since the beginning of the PSRL program in 2000. Although it is impossible to attribute
any causality to the program itself, the fact that these changes occurred at the time when the
reforms where being implemented i s encouraging.

Health

16.       Infant and maternal mortality have declined significantly over time. Mortality rates among
children under 5 fell by almost 50 percent duringthe 1990s, from 81 per thousand in 1991to 47 per
thousand in 2000, while the same numbers for children under 1 were 57 and 33 per thousand
respectively. Unfortunately no data i s available for recent years. At the same time, maternal
mortality also showed significant improvements, falling from 769 to 555 deaths per 100,000 live
children between 1997 and 2003.

18.     Although it i s impossible, given the available information, to trace these changes back to
the specific policies supported by the PSRL program, it i s not unlikely that some of the observed
improvements (especially those related to better delivery conditions) respond to the higher coverage
rates among infants and pregnant mothers and the retargeting of resources towards health centers
located in poor areas achieved through the program.
Social exclusion and the living conditions of the indigenous population

19.     In evaluating progress in Peru, be it in terms of poverty or social indicators, it is important
to remember that national averages hide a substantial amount of variation across regions and
demographic groups-particularly,     across indigenous and non-indigenous groups.
20.     Although the majority of the measures contemplated in the PSRL program does not target
the indigenous population explicitly, most of the criteria applied for coverage expansion and
retargeting of resources will tend to favor areas where this group represents a large share of the
beneficiaries (Le. poor rural areas).
21.     Unfortunately, information on the indigenous population is not collected regularly or
systematically in a nationally representative manner through household surveys, or otherwise. We
therefore present here 2001 figures (the last year for which information i s available) with the
objective of documenting the differences that exist between this group and the rest of the
population, and with the understanding that some of the overall improvements described above
must reflect improvements inthe education and health outcomes of the indigenous population.

        IMFApproves 26-month US$422.8 Million Stand-By Arrangement for Peru


The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a 26-
month SDR 287.3 million (about US$422.8 million) Stand-By Arrangement for Peru to
support the country's economic program through mid-2006. The approval enables the
release of a first drawing of SDR 80 million (about USSll8 million) under the
arrangement. However, the authorities have indicated their intention to treat this
arrangement as precautionary.
Following the Executive Board discussion, on Peru, Rodrigo de Rato, Managing Director
and Chairman of the Board, said:
"Peru's recent economic performance has been favorable, with solid growth and low
inflation. Substantial buffers, including a high level of international reserves and a well-
capitalized banking system, have been built up to further reduce vulnerabilities associated
with high dollarization and public debt, and there has been progress with structural
reforms. The authorities' program for 2004-06 aims at consolidating macroeconomic
stability, fortifying confidence, strengthening the basis for sustainable growth and
employment creation so as to reduce poverty, and further reducing financial vulnerabilities.
It focuses on the consistent implementation of their inflation-targeting framework and on
fiscal consolidation, with a view to continue improving public debt dynamics and
increasing the scope for priority social and infrastructure investment.
"The program also includes a broad set of growth-enhancing reforms aimed at reducing the
high levels of unemployment and poverty. In 2004, the authorities plan to foster private
investment by establishing commercial courts and improving collateral registries. They
also plan to grant operating concessions to the private sector and enter into targeted public-
private partnerships (PPPs), which will be implemented in a prudent manner and accounted
for transparently in the budget. The reform program will also improve public resource
management, modify public pension regimes-including the preferential CCdula Viva-
reduce labor costs, and strengthen bank supervision and the legal framework for fiscal
decentralization.
"The authorities' firm commitment to implementing prudent economic polices in the
context of a challenging political and social environment i s commendable. Strengthening
political consensus for critical reforms will be crucial to press forward with the reforrr
momentum of recent years and reduce the vulnerabilities facing the economy and reinforce
confidence in the continuity of prudent policies. This will help boost broad-based and

sustainable growth and employment and reduce poverty, while strengthening the basis for
Peru's successful exit from the series of Fund-supported programs," the Managing Director
said.
Recent economic developments
Peru made progress in stabilizing its economy and adopting growth-enhancing structural
reforms, under the 2002-03 Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund. Economic growth
averaged 4.5 percent a year, inflation remained low under the inflation targetingframework
of the central bank, and substantial buffers were built to mitigate financial vulnerabilities.
These buffers included a high level of international reserves and a well-capitalized banking
system. Progress was also made in structural reforms, including in the areas of
decentralization, pension reform, clarifying fiscal rules, strengthening the financial system,
and reorienting the privatization programtowards granting concessions.
In 2003, Peru's GDP grew by 4 percent in real terms and inflation was limited to 2.5
percent. Fiscal consolidation was in line with the government's target-the deficit of the
combined public sector was reduced from 2.2 percent of GDP in 2002 to 1.7 percent of
GDP. Revenues were boosted by tax measures introduced in mid 2002 and mid 2003.
Peru's external position also strengthened in 2003 and financial indicators improved. The
external current account deficit fell from more than 2 percent of GDP in 2002 to about 1.75
percent, driven by commodity export growth. Private capital inflows remained strong,
particularly foreign direct investment in the natural resource sector. Gross international
reserves rose by about US$500 million during 2003 and by a further US$250 million
during the first four months of 2004, to US$10.5 billion at end-April 2004. The Lima stock
exchange index surgedby 75 percent during 2003, reflecting higher mineral product prices.
Peru's sovereign spread continues to be among the lowest inthe region.
Program summary
The objectives of the program for 2004-2006 are to maintain macroeconomic stability,
foster robust growth and employment, further reduce vulnerabilities, and diminish poverty.
The program aims at enhancing the basis for strong economic growth, which i s projected to
average about 4.5 percent a year during 2004-06. It focuses on the continued
implementation of the inflation-targeting framework and on fiscal consolidation, with a
view to lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio from about 47.5 percent in 2003 to about 41
percent in 2006. Successful implementation of the program will enhance the basis for
definingPeru's exit strategy from Fundsupported programs.
The fiscal program i s based on reducing the overall deficit of the combined public sector
from 1.7 percent of GDP in2003 to 1.4 percent in 2004, and to 1percent a year in 2005-06.
Over this period, about one third of the adjustment effort of the central government i s to be
achieved through higher revenue, and the remainder through a containment in current
expenditure growth.
Monetary policy will continue to be managed within the inflation-targeting framework.
While preserving its floating in the exchange rate regime, the authorities intend to maintain
a solid cushion of foreign reserves to mitigate potential external shocks and political
uncertainties inthe period up to the 2006 elections.

Boosting economic growth and employment creation depends critically on the sustained
implementation of a broad set of reforms. The program includes growth enhancing reforms
 aimed at strengthening the investment climate, including the establishment of commercial
courts to speed up contract enforcement and improvements in the functioning of collateral
 registries. To bolster infrastructure investment, the authorities plan to grant operating
 concessions to the private sector and enter into Public-Private Partnerships in a fiscally
 prudent and transparent manner. Also, the authorities intend to improve resource
 management in the public sector, modify public pension regimes, reduce labor costs, and
 strengthen the legal framework for decentralization. The program includes efforts aimed at
 further strengthening the regulation and supervision of financial intermediaries.
 Peru joined the IMF on December 31, 1945, and its current quota i s SDR 638.4 million
 (about US$939 million). Its outstanding use of IMF financing currently totals SDR 80.3
 million (about US$ll8 million).
