PSRL IV is\n            focused on consolidating these reforms and increasing their\n            sustainability into the future.  It will support efforts to\n            complete and consolidate reforms in five areas: social\n            expenditures management; redesign, targeting, and\n            administration of social protection programs; access to\n            health services; access and efficiency in education; and\n            transparency and accountability in the social sectors."}, "docdt": "2004-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
