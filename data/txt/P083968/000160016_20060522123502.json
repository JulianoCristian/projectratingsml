Bank and Borrower performances were satisfactory.\n            Several lessons drawn from the three earlier PSRLs are\n            reconfirmed in this retrospective assessment of the four\n            loans: First, In addition to the \"mechanical\"\n            aspects of institution-building-information gathering and\n            analysis, new hardware and software systems, modernization\n            of skills, reorganization of work flow -- reforms that\n            realign public expenditures and programs, as well as\n            increase transparency and broaden participation in\n            government decision-making and implementation, often require\n            profound changes in social attitudes and threaten, or are\n            perceived to threaten, powerful entrenched interests.\n            Consequently, preparation costs are likely to be high; the\n            process and the commitment required of those who would\n            support it is likely to be long; and confidence in the\n            sustainability of the reforms initiated may take\n            considerably longer and will almost certainly need continued\n            financial and technical support. Second, the PSRL proves an\n            effective instrument for maintaining a constructive dialogue\n            and supporting a coherent and focused policy agenda. It has\n            bridged two Governments and several changes of Cabinet. It\n            has also allowed the flexibility needed to respond to new\n            initiatives (e.g., the workfare program and pension reform),\n            to adapt to a changing political context (viz.,\n            decentralization), to develop and refine targets and\n            performance indicators, to initiate and incorporate the\n            results of pilot reform experiments, to adjust Bank support\n            to the evolving performance of economic and social policies,\n            and to beat a tactical retreat and seek other approaches and\n            means of support when certain components proved infeasible.\n            Third, the central role of the Ministry of Economic and\n            Finance in the negotiation of the social agenda and in its\n            implementation pushed the reforms forward. However,\n            centering program design, coordination, and loan\n            negotiations in the Finance Ministry weakens the line\n            ministries responsible for implementation as diminishes the\n            commitment level of the respective ministers. Fourth, strong\n            monitoring and evaluation systems are essential.  Fifth, the\n            open and participatory fashion in which the PSRL agenda was\n            formulated helped to build consensus both inside and outside\n            the government. Sixth, PSRL's support of greater\n            transparency and participation in the setting of social\n            priorities and in the monitoring of government response to\n            them has made an important contribution."}, "docdt": "2006-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
