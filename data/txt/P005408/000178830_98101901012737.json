{"cdata!": "The Fourth Highway Project aims at\n            lowering transport costs, helping to reduce regional income\n            disparities, strengthening the planning capability of key\n            institutions in the transport sector, and raising the\n            productivity of road transport services. The project\n            consists of: a) road works, comprising continuation of the\n            Roads and Traffic Department's program of pavement\n            strengthening and improvement of provincial roads, and\n            completion of the Casablanca-Rabat expressway; b)\n            continuation of the Roads and Traffic Department's\n            program of routine and periodic maintenance of the\n            classified road network, renewal and acquisition of\n            maintenance equipment, and construction and equipping of\n            workshops for such equipment; c) a study of provincial\n            roads; d) a study of the freight transport market and\n            regulatory system; e) technical assistance to strengthen\n            institutional planning capability. The main project benefits\n            will be lower transport costs. Other benefits comprise\n            reduced future road rehabilitation requirements, avoidance\n            of road accidents, passenger time savings, and increased\n            farm incomes."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
