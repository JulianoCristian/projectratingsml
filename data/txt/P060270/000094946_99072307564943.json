Its\n            development objectives are to identify and adapt potential\n            improvements in enterprise reform methods to local\n            circumstances, test their feasibility through pilot\n            implementation, and make these lessons widely known among\n            local and central policy-makers. Components of the projects\n            consist of a) restructuring models for large and medium\n            enterprises; b) management development; c) retraining and\n            reemployment of \"laid off\" state-owned enterprise\n            employees; and d) development of private small and medium\n            enterprises. Each component will be implemented in the\n            following areas: Changsha, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Wuhu."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
