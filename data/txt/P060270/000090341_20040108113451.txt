 3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
 During the winter of 2000/2001,Xinjiang had a seriesof snow disastersleading to snow depths of
 0.5-lm in the plains and 1-2 m in the mountains, The snow cover lasted over four months. The
 temperature reached lows of minus 37 degrees Celsius (minus 35 degrees Fahrenheit). The areas
 also suffered from gale force winds. The snow, the cold, and the wind caused immense damage.
 Over 300 thousand herdsmen suffered, over 30 thousand animals died, about 5 million animals
 were hurt, 10 thousand animal sheds were destroyed or badly damaged, and 7-8 thousand houses
 were destroyed or damaged.

 3.1 Original Objective:
 The objective of the project was to assist the Borrower in restoring social and economic
 infrastructurecritical to the lives of herders devastated by this unusually severe snowstorm in hard
 hit areas of Altai Prefecture and Tacheng Prefecture of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region
 (XUAR), and in enhancingand strengtheningthe disasterresponse capacityof the affectedherders.
 This objective reflected Bank policy for emergency recovery assistance, i.e. to restore assets and
 production levels in the disrupted economy through the financing of investment and productive
 activities,rather than relief or consumption.
 By targeting the project towards a very poor part of the society in remote pastoral areas it
 contributedto four of the five major themes of the 1997Bank's Country Assistance Strategy CAS
 for China (infrastructure;human development including poverty alleviation; agriculture and rural
 development; and, environmental protection) and two out of the three major themes of the 2003
 CAS (addressing the needs of the poorer and disadvantaged people in lagging regions; and,
 facilitatingan environmentallysustainabledevelopmentprocess).
Finally, the project was responsive to the Borrower's need in a situation of a natural disaster that
seriously dislocated the local economy and called for a quick response. In line with best practice
for emergency operation,the project objectivewas clear andrealistic.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The original objectiveof the project remainedunchanged.

3.3 Original Components:
The livelihood of the herder families in Altai Prefecture and Tacheng Prefecture of XUAR is
almost always entirely dependent on livestock (sheep, goats, cattle, horses, camels, and other
livestock). With large numbers of animals dying, the livelihood of these families was severely
impacted.The ability to rebuild this livelihoodand protect it more efficiently from future disasters
largely depended on animal housing and feeding.Therefore,the key emphasis of the project was to
assist herders in rebuilding damaged or destroyed sheds and establishing a reliable winter fodder
base. In addition, a component on technical assistance and project management was designed in
order to contribute to an improved management of the livestock and grassland resources in the
region, and to ensure effective pro; ect management, including evaluation and monitoring. The
project had the followingcomponents:
(1) Restoration and Rehabilitation of Livestock Sheds (Altai: US $1.83 million - 42.7 percent
of total: Tacheng: US $1.59 million - 49.7 percent of total). This component addressed one of
the two most critical needs of the beneficiary population by financing investments for housing of
their animals. It was planned that about US $ 3.42 million would be invested in the rehabilitationof
about 212,500 sqm of sheds (2,125 units), restoration of 150,000 sqm of sheds (1,498 units),
pasture rehabilitation of about 60,000 mu (4,000 ha), and pasture improvement of 110,000 mu
(over 7,000 ha). The project planned to promote the improved "greenhouse" design permitting
greater retention of heat. For all beneficiaries investing into the reconstruction of sheds technical


                                                  2

 training was made compulsory in order to improve the economically and environmentally
 sustainableuse of these major investments for the herders.
 (2) Housing Restoration (Altai: US $0.56 million - 13.2% of total:). Restoration of houses was
 planned for Altai Prefecture where a considerable number of families suffered severe house
 damages or even the total collapse of their houses and where grant fund sources from the
 Governmentor donations were insufficient.The average size of a house planned under the project
 was 80 square meters. Assuming average costs of houses between RMB 11,400 for mud-brick
 construction and RMB 14,700for fired-brickconstructionthe restoration of about 300 houses was
 planned under the project.
 (3) Pasture Rehabilitation (Altai: US $1.70 million - 39.6% of total: Tacheng: US $1.54
 million- 48.1% of total)). This component addressed the other of the two most critical needs of
 the beneficiary population: improved winter forage security. The componentplan included 62,750
 mu (Altai: 38,900 mu; Tacheng: 23,850 mu) of sown (artificial) pasture, a 110,400 mu (Altai:
 7,000 mu; Tacheng: 103,400 mu) of grassland rehabilitation activity, and the provision of forage
 handling equipment including small tractors, and forage storage facilities (including 1,668 silage
pits). Technical training was also made compulsory under this component in order to improve the
 economicallyand environmentallysustainableuse of the investments.
 (4): Technical Assistance (TA) and Project Management (Altai: US $0.19 million - 4.5% of
total: Tacheng: US $0.07million - 2.2% of total). This component included (i) a Grassland
ManagementReview TA to re-assess the prevailing risk mitigation measures for preventing future
losses, and to develop the framework for a more sustainable grassland management; (ii) a TA
activity for Independent Monitoring and Evaluation of the impact of the project based on four
performance indicators (measuring livestock performance, increased winter forage, beneficiary
satisfaction, and equitability of beneficiary selection); and (iii) Project Management with
responsibilities given to Project Leading Groups (PLGs) and Project Management Offices (PMOS)
locatedin Animal HusbandryBureaus (AHB).
The componentswere clearly linked to the objectives.Moreover,by targeting the poorer part of the
affected herder population, the project ensured the objectives were achieved. The individual
components were well designed, complementing each other, and with detailed and practical
standards and complementingtraining for the efficient and sustainableuse of the investments.The
project took into account important lessons of previous Bank-financed emergency recovery
projects such as (i) paying attention to project preparation and simplicity of design: (ii) flexible
procurement methods, (iii) disaster-resilient reconstruction standards: and (iv) participation by
beneficiaries. Lastly, the simple design of the project took into account the capacity of the
implementing agencies, the extremely difficult natural conditions, and the need for expedient
implementationrequired for an emergencyrecovery operation.

3.4Revised Project:
The design of the project remained unchanged throughout the implementationperiod. Only small
reallocations of the various componentsoccurred reflecting adjustments to demand and availability
of additional funds due to an appreciationof the SDR against the RMB.

3.5Quality at Entry:
Quality at Entry is rated satisfactory because: (i) project objectives were in line with Borrower's
priority, the Bank's CAS for China, and the Bank's policies for emergency operations; (ii) timely
and quite accurate assessment of the disaster and the situation under which a project would be
implemented; (iii) the project's strong emphasis on targeting of assistance to the poorest and the
most needy; (iv) a realistic time schedule to meet the project objectives, which also included
mitigation measures to strengthen the area's resilience to natural hazards; and (v) the project's


                                                 3

 design, adequately addressing Bank's safeguard policies, in particular the issues of indigenous
 people and the environment.

 4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

 4.1 Outcome/achievementof objective:
 The project's objectives and outcomes were substantially achieved. Critical social and economic
 infrastructure of about 3,950 herder families in Altai Prefectureand about 1,670herder families in
 Tacheng Prefecture has been restored with a total of about 26,800 people in total benefiting.
 The disasterresponse capacityof the affectedherdershas been improved substantially.
 One of the principal reasons for the heavy ruminant livestocklosses from the snow disasterwas the
poor quality and design of livestock sheds, which failed to provide livestockwith adequate shelter
 during the severe weather conditions.The rehabilitated and reconstructedsheds greatly reduce risk
of losses from future snow disasters. In addition, sheds with the improved "greenhouse" design
provide a warmer housing environmentduring the winter season with advantages such as reduced
neonatal mortality, increased lambkid growth rates and improved fertility.Moreover, shed feeding
can be better controlled providing improved nutrition. Where livestock is housed and fed inside
sheds during the winter season, winter grazing is reduced, resulting in less grazing on dormant
winter and early spring grassesand improvedgrowth and recovery of grass cover.
The project also greatly enhanced winter forage security by providing herders with alternative
sources of forage, mainly in the form of sown (artificial) pasture, a small grassland rehabilitation
activity, and the provision of forage handling equipment including small tractors, and forage
storage facilities. These investments provide a secure source of good quality feed throughout the
winter season.
The TA and training provided under the project considerably strengthenedthe achievementsof the
project outcomes. For many herders the training provided was the first formal technical training
they ever received. The training has contributedconsiderablyto a solid constructionquality, and to
economically efficient and environmentally sustainable investments. The TA provided under the
project provided the opportunity to re-assess the prevailing risk mitigation measures to prevent
future losses, and to develop more sustainable grassland management. A considerable number of
officials and herders benefited from the TA activity.
Experiences from Bank supervision missions as well as the household survey data of the M&E
activity indicates that the project largely targeted the poorer part of the herder population which
had suffered substantial losses from the snow disaster. Beneficiaries were highly appreciative of
the project. Livestockproduction and therefore livelihoodof the beneficiarypopulation was greatly
improved through the project investments in terms of an higher income level and because they
enjoy greater resilienceto future disasters.

4.2 Outputs by Components:
(1) Restoration and Rehabilitation of Livestock Sheds (US $3.64 million actual; Altai:
US $2.04 million, Tacheng: US $1.60 million). The component is rated satisfactory. A total of
246,000 sqm of sheds (2,711 units) was rehabilitated, 187,000 sqm of sheds (1,660 units) was
restored. The component exceeded appraisal targets for restoration and rehabilitation of sheds.
Overall,constructionqualitywas high both for repairs and rebuilding.
(2) Housing Restoration (US $0.66 million actual; Altai only). The project is rated satisfactory.
A total of 354 houses have been reconstructed which exceeded appraisal targets by 18 percent.
House construction was of generally high quality with beneficiaries often putting substantial extra
efforts in the constructionof their houses.


                                                  4

 (3) Pasture Rehabilitation (US $3.22 million actual; Altai: US $1.60 million, Tacheng:
US $1.60 million). The component is rated satisfactory. About 57,200 mu (Altai: 30,900 mu,
Tacheng: 26,300 mu) of artificialpasture (91% of appraisal plan), generally alfalfa, in a number of
 cases with a nurse crop of barley, wheat or rape, have been established. In general, the quality of
 artificialpasture has been high. The success was due to seeds of very high quality, the availability
 of water, and the technical knowledge of the beneficiaries,which was partly transferred under the
project. Sometimes in parallel with investments into artificial pasture, the project supported the
building of 1,589 silage pits for improved fodder storage (Altai: 530, Tacheng: l,059), which is
about 95% of appraisal plan in terms of number and 76% in terms of volume capacity. Of the
investment made, about US $0.75 million (US $613,000 for Altai and US $133,000 for Tacheng)
was used for purchasing of tractors and forage equipment for improved forage processing. These
investments were of high quality and are well used, with many neighbors often sharing the
equipment. In addition, a smaller sub-component of pasture rehabilitation, mainly in Tacheng
Prefecture,was implementedon about 108,900mu (99% of appraisal plan).
(4) Technical Assistance and Project Management (US $0.20 million actual; Altai: US $0.14
million, Tacheng: US $0.06 million). The project is rated satisfactory. Firstly, two rounds of
quality TA in grassland management were successfully conducted by a team consisting of an
internationaland a national consultant. Secondly, in connectionwith the major investmentsunder
the project (shed reconstruction, pasture rehabilitation)beneficiary households received technical
training. A total of 9,900 person days (Altai 5,200; Tacheng 4,700) of training were provided,
generallyin 2 to 3 day programs. This is a substantial success,given that hardly any of the trainees
had any formal technical trainingbefore. Thirdly, the project supportedan independentmonitoring
and evaluation. A local consultant team went to the project areas in spring of 2002 and spring of
2003 to assess the project impact, mainly through household interviews. Due to methodological
problems of the survey, the consultant report does not measure the impact of the project in a
representative manner as envisaged by the project design. For an assessment of project
managementplease see Section 7 below.

4.3Net Present Value/Economicrate of return:
Since this was an emergency operation, no calculations of net present value or economic rate of
return was carried out. However, simplifiedcalculations demonstratethat the economicbenefits for
the herders and the overall economic benefits of the project are highly positive. For example, the
internal financial rate of return of new shed construction would be offset by a 15% increase in
lambhad survival. Increase in neonatal survival in greenhouse sheds has been reported to be well
beyond this level. The establishment of artificial pasture cost about RMB 200 per mu with flood
irrigationwould bejustified by only about one cubicmeters of incrementaldried alfalfa hay per mu
and year (opportunitycosts about RMB 50.) The yield can easily be more than two cubic meters
per year. The economic impact of the project is particularly positive because it supports
investments without which the continued production by the beneficiaries would in many cases be
severelyreduced andnon-sustainable,if not impossible.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not Applicable(see Section4.3)

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional impact of the project is positive. Given the emergency nature of the project, the
main focus was on rehabilitation of social and physical infrastructure rather than institutional
development.Nevertheless, the project had considerableinstitutional development impact in some
areas. Most importantly, the project substantially increased the capacity of the Government
agencies involved in project preparation and implementation,in particular the AHBs at all levels.



                                                 5

This was the firsttime that the TachengAHB was exposedto a foreign-fundedproject. At all levels
the AHB successfully adopted the various design aspects and requirements of the project. Besides
becoming familiar in the Bank's financial and procurement methods, the AHB increased its
capacity in a number of areas,including:(i) thorough targetingof public services,in this case to the
poorer and most needy part of the herder population; (ii) standard definition,implementation,and
efficient supervision of high-qualityworks and goods dispersed over a huge project area; and (iii)
familiarization with computer and other modern office equipment. The response to any future
disasterhas been increasedthrough the implementationof thisproject.

5. Major Factors AffectingImplementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
While the harsh climatic and geographical conditionsposed a serious challenge to implementation,
no major unforeseen factorsaffected the project outcome.

5.2Factors generally subject to government control:
The Government'spolicies as well as its support to the project had an overall favorable affect on
project implementation and outcome. However, one factor affecting the project negatively was a
substantial delay in the availability of counterpart funds. This led to delayed implementation as
well as greater financial pressure on beneficiaries and the local private economy in general
(suppliers/ contractors).

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementingagency control:
The performance of the implementing agencies was overall satisfactory. A slow start of project
implementation was partly caused by initial difficulties of the implementing agencies with the
unfamiliarrequirements of the project. However, a strong leadership and a few committed key staff
in PMOSat all levels combinedwith exemplarysupport from the Regional Finance Bureau ensured
a strong project implementation capacity and contributed to successful implementation of the
project.

5.4 Costs nndjnancing:
The end-of-projectcosts for both components are slightlyhigher (4% and 2% respectivelyfor Altai
and Tacheng) than the appraisal estimates,mainly due to additional tasks undertaken permitted by
the appreciation of SDR against USD and RMB. The project costs for most project activities
exceeded the appraisal plan ranging from 1% to 38% for Altai and 3% to 22% for Tacheng,
although, the project costs for some activities were lower than appraisal estimate. Annex 2a
presents a detailed project cost by component, project activity and a comparison of actuaVlatest
estimate vs. appraisalestimate.
Overall project financing is satisfactoryin both Altai and Tacheng with adequate fundingprovided
from expanded financing sources.The financingsources include IDA (66%),Regional government
(12%), prefecture government (7%), county government (8%) and beneficiary (7%). In Altai,
county governmentbecame an expanded financing source upon project effectivenessand provided
about 6% of the total financing required for the prefecture. However, one financing source in
Tacheng failed to fulfill its full commitment. In addition, not all counterpart funds were provided
on a timely basis. Annex 2c presents a detailed financing estimate by source,project activity and a
comparisonof actualAatestestimatevs. appraisal estimate.

 6. Sustainability

 6.1Rationalefor sustainability rating:
 Project sustainability is highly likely. The project design paid considerable attention to high
 implementation standards and these standardswere generally met and often exceeded. Both, in the
 case of shed rehabilitation and reconstruction as well as in the case of winter fodder production,
 these good implementation standardswill ensure the continued use of investments for many years
 to come. The economic benefits of the investments are estimated to be substantial given that in
 many cases the activitiesimplementedunder the project are an essential condition for the recovery
 of subsistence and income of the beneficiary family. The training provided beneficiaries with
 substantial knowledge to use and maintain their investments. While the environmental
 sustainability in many of the grasslands areas is fragile, the project investments contribute to an
 improvement of this sustainability by reducing the winter and spring grazing pressure on the
 grasslands.

 6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
 The individual household-based sub-projects go into regular operation once they are built. The
 households own the constructionsbuilt and forage equipmentpurchased under the project, and they
 have rights over a minimum of 30 years for the use of the land where fodder production has been
 established. These households have the strong incentive to use and maintain the investments. The
 Government (AHB) will provide support to the herder families, including through additional
 training. Moreover, the Government (FB with help from AHB) ensures the recovery of the loan
 proceeds from the beneficiaries.The finalizationof a fully computerizeddatabase will make these
 tasks more efficient.The PMOShave been re-integratedinto the general structure of their agencies
 at the end of the project, and the staff will use the experiencegained for futureactivities.

 7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank

 7.1Lending:
Bank's performance during project identification, preparation, and appraisal is rated satisfactory.
The Bank's input in terms of staffing, shll-mix and time allocation was adequate given the
relatively simple structure of the project. The Bank was proactive in identifying the financial
resources available from other World Bank financedprojects and the Bank team provided adequate
and timely preparation support to the Borrower. Appraisal was done quickly but thoroughly and
paid adequate attention to the Bank's fiduciary and safeguard responsibility. The whole process
from identificationto appraisal was very rapid in accordance with the emergency response nature
of the project. Project design was in line with overall Bank and CAS objectives, adequate to
achieve these objectives, and sufficiently simple given constraints in the capacity of the
implementingagencies.

7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's performance in project supervision is rated satisfactory, Size and frequency of the
supervision missions as well as their staff composition were adequate given the size and nature of
the project, and staff continuity was contained. The task team identified and addressed
implementationissues in an active and constructivemanner, and follow-upaction was successfulin
solving problems. Cooperation between Bank and Borrower was close and advice by the Bank
team highly valued by the implementing agencies. While the project would have benefited from
more intense supervision by the Bank team in the beginning, other factors outside Bank control
were far more important.

 7.3 OverallBankperformance:
 Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The Bank responded in a timely manner to the
 emergency recovery needs of the Borrower. Project design was in line with objectives; borrower
 supportwas strong,and project appraisaland supervision sound.

 Borrower

 7.4Preparation:
 Governmentperformance is rated satisfactory.The Governmentresponded quickly after the project
 identification.In a short period of time, it prepared the project according to the agreed framework
 and presented sufficient quality information to appraise the project in June of 2001. The
 Government also worked very early with the herders to start implementingproject activities in the
 first constructionperiod. However, at the same time, some delays, most notably the availabilityof
 counterpart funds and the strengthening of project management, lead to a relatively late
 effectiveness of the project and, under retroactive financing,relatively modest implementationin
 the first constructionperiod.

 7.5 Governmentimplementationperformance:
The Government implementation performance is rated satisfactory. While the availability of
counterpart funds as well as the strengthening of project management capacity was delayed, the
considerable commitment given to the project resulted in the full resolution of these issues. This
strong Government commitmentwas key to the project success.

 7.6Implementing Agency:
The institutionalarrangements for project preparation have proved adequate to bring the project to
a successful conclusion within the planned time-frame. The PMO in the AHB started from a very
difficult initial situationcharacterizedby the need to respond to a natural disasterin remotepastoral
areas, low standards of office equipment and insufficient transportation, and inexperience of
dealing with the requirements of a project financed by an international agency. However, strong
key staff in PMOS at all levels, particularly at prefecture level, were committed and received
training, in particular by the Regional Finance Bureau and through a study tour to the Inner
Mongolia SnowstormEmergencyRehabilitationProject. The intensive study tour organizedby the
regional PMO with participants from both prefecture PMOSand county PMOSto a parallel project
in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region resulted in a great improvement in overall project
implementation. This ensured that the implementing agencies acquired necessary slulls and
strongly improved their capacity so that the project could be completed with satisfactory quality
and within the set time-frame. In summary,the performance of the implementingagenciesexcelled
considerably,and is rated satisfactoryoverall.

7.7Overall Borrowerperformance:
The overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. The Government and the implementing
agencies have been consistently committed to the project. Overall performance excelled after
initial shortcomingand was the key to the overall successof the project.

 8. Lessons Learned

 The project has demonstrated the feasibility and substantial benefits of fast-track Bank-financed
 emergency rehabilitation projects even under extreme climatic and geographical conditions. The
 project's approach can be utilized for similar emergency for the herder population of remote areas.
 Important factorsof project success were:

 0       Thorough proiect preparation and simplicity in desim. Despite the time pressure during
 project preparation and appraisal,a lot of attention was paid to design details includingbreakdown
 of costs and procurement down to county level. Even more importantly, the scope of the project
 was well focused, and preparation avoided the inclusion of too many or too sophisticated
 components, The selection of the components centered around the life of the herder communities,
 i.e., the reconstruction of the basic services and support to their livelihood. This helped make the
 project relevant to them and increased their commitment and responsiveness.This emphasize on a
 sufficiently simple designpaid off. The project objectives and its design as originallyproved to be
 realistic and the project was implemented with satisfactory quality and as planned within the
 eighteen-month timeframe despite the natural conditions and initially limited implementation
 capacity.

 0      Ouick response. The operation showed that rapid and effective decisions by both the Bank
 and the Borrower can make a significant positive impact in improving the lives of lower-income
 Communities,especially in emergency situations.While some time was lost at the beginning of the
project and many herders would have benefited even more from an earlier response, the project
 achieved its objectives because it was fully implemented in the second construction season after a
relatively mild winter of 2001/2002.
        Strong.management structure. In emergency reconstruction programs, early availability of
funds or authorization, together with competent business procedures and record keeping are
essential to address the disaster repairs in a timely manner. Procurement procedures have to take
into account the emergency nature of the project and be implemented by well-trained staff.
Dedicatedhigh-level governmentmanagementand close interactionbetween Provincial,Prefecture
and County-levelmanagementteams is essentialto achieve success.
        Formalizing targeting of beneficiaries. Assisting individual households in their recovery
from an emergency situation requires considerable attention to a well thought-through targeting of
the limited resources. First, this requires that the criteria for selection of householdsbe measurable
and simple enough to be applied given the time-pressure of an emergency project and limited
capacity available. This aspect was achieved by the project. Second,it requires a selectionprocess
that is a priori defined and transparent. A clearer design and better institutionalization of such
selection process during preparation would have avoided some delays and mistakes made during
the early stagesof the project.
        Well-targeted training of project management and beneficiaries. Due to its emergency
response nature, the project focused on reconstruction of physical and social infrastructure.
However, a crucialpart of the successtowards this aim was the trainingprovided under the project.
First, training of project management staff was essential to build the capacity for project
implementation and, in hindsight, should have been provided even more intensely at the earliest
stages of the project. Second, the training provided to beneficiary households, though varying in
quality, was very satisfactory.For the vast majority of the trainees this was the first time that they
received technical training. It was well received, contributed to an improved construction and
sustainability of the investments made, and opened the eyes of many herders beyond these
investments to more comprehensive aspects of livestock and grassland management. The AHB is

 expected to build on this training, and the credibilitythey gained through it for transferring further
 knowledgeto the herder population.

 0      Supervision and Monitoring. A strong emphasis on input and output monitoring, reporting,
 and supervision contributed to a quality implementation of the project. The transfer of this
 managementapproacheswill servethe implementingagencieswell in many future activities.

9. Partner Comments

Borrower/implementing agency:
The ICR drafted by the World Bank is a comprehensive one that reflects the reality. We basically
do not have any objectionsto the document.
Our general comment about the project is as follows: The project is an emergency assistance
project. From project preparation, appraisal and design to implementation,the World Bank has
adopted timely action plans that correspond to local realities. Project preparation and appraisal
were quick and accurate; project design was simple and concise; project procurement methods
were flexible and easy to use; and project implementation was fast and efficient. During the
process of implementation,the World Bank has also responded to project demand and local actual
conditions and made timely adjustmentsto someproject activitiesand investment. The project has
always put an emphasison providing support to herders hard hit by the disaster who needed urgent
help. It has also required active participation by project beneficiaries. Project Manager and
officers came to visit project areas on many occasions to provide supervision and guidance and
help resolve, in a timely manner, the problems and difficultiesthat came up during the process of
implementation. All these have made it possible for all project activities to be completed on
schedule and for two most important issues facing the herders hit by the disaster to be resolved,
namely, restoration and reconstruction of damaged and collapsed animal sheds, and improvement
of fodder and feed supplyduring the springand winter seasons. We all believe that the project was
a successful emergency assistance project and it was warmly received by the governments at
various levels,the cadres and the farmers andherders.
Training and technical assistanceactivitiesunder the project were also successful. The farmersand
herders from minority ethnic groups who live in remote and disadvantagedareas received, for the
first time, technical assistance and professional training by well-known Chinese and international
experts. They gained practical knowledge and technique and benefited tremendously fkom the
project. At the same time, the staff of the PMOSat various levels and other personnel involved in
the project in the ten counties (cities) learned about the advanced and scientific project
management techniques and experiences of the World Bank, thus laying a sound foundation for
future implementation of World Bank as well as domestic projects.
However, due to our lack of experience with World Bank projects, as well as other inadequacies
such as understaffing,poor office conditionsand shortageof funds, there were problems during the
project preparation and implementation period. The problems included delay of project process,
slow progress regarding procurement and disbursement, and late supply of counter-part funds.
Thankfully, with the help of World Bank officials and experts, we managed to overcome those
difficulties and solved the problems in time so that the project was implemented smoothly and
according to the plan.
We hereby would like to thank the World Bank and the project manager and officers.

 Technical Assistance and Project Administration, In March 2002, a speech hold by prairie
specialists Dan Miller (American) and Cui HenXin (Chinese) in Urumqi, the topic of the speech
was adventurous administrationof the west prairie area of China, adventurous administration of
      "
the husbandry area and shift herding "; whole members from all ranks of the project offices
attended the speech.In September2002, two specialists,Dan.Miller and Cui HenXin, made an on-
the-spot investigationand directionin Arletaprefecture.
In order to carry out the project smoothly,leading teams and project administrationbranches were
established in counties (cities). There were three subsidiary work groups in county project
administration branches: financial group, purchasing group and file group. Since the project ha
been established, in accordance with the requirements of the World Bank, directed by senior
project leading office, the project leading team and administrationoffice developed their work in
aspects of programmer design, organization & administration, superintendent & inspection,
engineering superintendent and technical training. The organization was operating well so that
assures the aim of the project had completed smoothly.
In order to develop project work better, in accordance with the requirements of the World Bank,
the project officesin each county and Arleta prefecture ever sent staff to attend the project training
three times, they also went to Inner Mongolia for investigation and studying which organized by
municipal project office. The project office equipped with the computer, scanner, photocopier and
other modern office equipments.
Project Adjustment. In order to make the implementationof the projectbe in keeping with the real
circumstance of each county (city), the World Bank Office of Arleta prefecture handed over a
report to the World Bank in April 2002, in which they asked to adjustprojects and statereasons. In
May 2002, they received the reply from the World Bank, adjusted "the silages project" in Jimunai
county to "sprinting grasslands project", changed Arleta shi and Qinghe county' "processing
facility" into "rebuilding animal sheds project", adjusted "artificial grasslands project" in Fuyun
county to "herdsmenhousing and rebuilding shedsprojects".
Procurement for the Project. In April 2002, the World Bank Inspecting Group inspected the
circumstanceof 2001'engineeringconstructionof snow disastersproject, all of the project counties
started to collect quotations for bids on small-scale constructions (rebuilding of the herdsmen
houses, animal'ssheds)and goods purchasing. All of the enquirieswere answered at the beginning
of May. Bidding Evaluation Team was setup and all of the quotations were evaluated. 25 May and
4* June 2002, the World Bank approved the first contract of Jimunai for sprinklers and the first
contract of Altai municipal for rebuilding the animal sheds, prefecture PMO checked all of the
project counties' contracts, a total of 19 contracts were signed on small scale construction and
goods procurement. And then the project implementationwas started.
During the period of June to the July 2002,the Arleta prefecture project office purchased some
office equipments:5 computers, 6 photocopiers, 6 scannersand 1portable computer.




                                               23

 Project Payment. In order to enhance the fund administration,accordingto requirements fromthe
 World Bank & the project administrationregulations,special account for WB loan and counterpart
 fund account were opened at prefecture and each of the project counties. At the end of Nov.2002,
 the accumulative total investment made was 33.5661 million Yuan, the accumulative total
 available funds were 29.8623 million Yuan in which 20.7555 million Yuan was WB loan, and
 6.5351 million Yuan was counterpart fund from province, prefecture and county. And 2.5717
 million Yuan was herdsmen labor investment. The accumulated payment was 25.4068 million,
 including herdsmen labor account 3.4657 million Yuan, small-scale construction 18.8071 million
 Yuan, 99.9thousand Yuan was spent on project managementand office facility.
 The prefecture PMO applied for reimbursement from the World Bank four times and got 2.07555
 millionback that reached 86.4% of the World Bank investmentplan.
 Project supervision & assessment. According to the requirements from the World Bank, "project
 administration regulations" was made in Arleta prefecture. In the process of carrying out the
 project, people from municipal project office and prefecture project office had gone down to
 project counties (city) to inspect and to supervise. project staff also made strict inspection,
 supervision and checking at work. As for inspection, we adopted regular method and mixed with
 irregular method, inspected major areas thoroughly, and inspect scattered project sites by random
 way. And this played an important role in project supervision. All the data collected during the
 inspectionwere filed to guaranteea smoothproject implementation.
 3.ProjectAchievement and Impact
Main Achievement. Because every task of the project was conducting with on-the spot inspection
 and adopting the herdsmen' opinion as a base, the project constructionwas conductingobjectively
 and has gained a good effect. The World Bank snow disasters project in Arleta prefecture has
 constructed 530 silages, repaired 1437 animal sheds and 30925mu artificial grasslands, improved
 7000mu grasslands, rebuilt 244 animal sheds and 254 herdsmen houses. The project has trained
4927 herdsmen. There are 3946 beneficiaries' families and 19,004 beneficiaries covering 3
counties, 1 city and 35 towns. Successful project implementationhas assisted the beneficiaries in
normalizingtheir production.
 TechnicalInfluences. In autumn, 2001 and the spring, 2002, with careful preparation the project
office in every county (city, town) made the training cause to the beneficiaries regularly, the
contents of the training involved the World Bank project introduction, the standard of the project
construction, the silages construction & its maintenance, the scientific farming, the forage
manufacture, the preserve slulls, scientific herding etc. They also organized beneficiaries to have
an on-the-spot inspection and visiting. There were 4927 herdsmen trainers and beneficiaries were
satisfied with the training. In 2002, the county (city) project offices made after-supervisionabout
the completed project and found that most of the herdsmen hap applied the facilities and practical
techniquesthey had learnedto their production,which had a positive on surroundingpeople.
Environmental Influences. Implementation of the project has offered beneficiaries' herdsmen
houses, animals' sheds, grasslands, silages and other living facilities. In winter, part of animals can
be fed inside the sheds without marching to winter pasture far away; this has cut down destroy
towards grasslandsextremely,and has protectedthe biological environmentefficiently.
Social Influences.     By means of news medium, wide publicity of the World Bank, the
communication between herdsmen and visible construction site, all of these make sufferers and
people of all social ranks understand the project deeply. It's beyond all doubts that the World
Bank' aids to majority of herdsmen sufferers are especially on condition that our area suffered a
series of disasters. This inspire sufferers with their enthusiasm to regain production and rebuild
their houses, they participated in the project construction actively. By means of training courses,



                                                 24

the herdsmen have mastered the advanced husbandry technique, improved the scientific herding
level, increasedtheir income and caused wide-ranging social influences.
4. Experience
We have accumulatedrich working experience by means of project implementation,especially in
terms of internationalproject. We hardly ever carried out this sort of international project before,
but by way of the practice,we cultivatesome project talents and have establisheda good basis for a
smooth development of the World Bank project which topic is "grasslands comprehensive
development project". In addition, face-to-face speaking with the herdsmen in the process of
project implementation offered us an opportunity to accumulate our working experience; in the
meanwhile, it's also an opportunity that the herdsmen gave more credit to the government.
According to the World Bank requirements for technique and quality,we have made a progress for
the quality of the sheds construction.
 Certainly there were some problems in the process of the project implementation that we need to
draw admonishments.First, at the initial stage of the project, our work was developing passively
because our worlung staffs were unfamiliar with the project implementation regulations of the
World Bank. Be aimed at this point, the town project sent people for reach and further studying,
made the worlung situation changed inside out. Secondary, during the process of the artificial
grasslands construction, there was migratory problem existed because short of consideration
(comprehension)towards the snow disastersproject,but we corrected it in time.
5.Project evaluation
 During the project implementation, great help was offered by the World Bank. A) during the
preparation period, missions had been sent by the World Bank to come to the project counties to
inspect. And set the clear objectives for the project. B) During the implementation, World Bank
showed great concern and suggestionswere provided to solve the problems. C) When the project
was completed, training was provided on the preparation of the final report. And gave clear
requirements.Their hard working spirit deeply impressedus.
 Though it is the first time for the prefecture and county leaders to implementWorld Bank project,
they have been strictly doing the job according to the World Bank requirement, project
management regulations were carefully studied, and the loan was distributed to the herdsmen as
required by the World Bank. And repayment plan was also made. They frequently checked the
progress of the implementation.Counterpartfunds were allocatedtimely as planned.
Project implementation was done according to the World Bank requirement, and it has already
playing importantrole in the production in the project area. Requirementswere given to the project
counties to do a better job in later on management of the project to ensure bigger project benefit.
Good cultivationmanagement should be done to the artificial and upgradedpastureland to increase
grass yield. Further cares should be given to the newly built and upgraded animal sheds and houses
of the herdsmen. And more training should be provided to the herdsmen. And the loan repayment
should be done according to the plan. Data bank of the project herdsmen and their production
shouldbe establishedby using the available computers.

herdsmenhave been trained in the county of HeFeng. Someherders were trained twice.
Plan Adjustments
During the time of carrying out the items plans, because the actual cost was different from the
planning cost and the beneficiaryhouseholds selected in the county of HeFeng didn't live up to the
requirement of the World Bank, we had adjusted some items into purchasing goods under the
permission of the World Bank. The items had been adjusted from 1.52 million SDR to 1.505739
million SDR and the goods had been adjusted from 77 thousand SDR to 111.791 thousand SDR
and the training had been adjusted from 25 thousand SDR to 12.5thousand SDR on the condition
that the whole amount of the loans was 1.63 million SDR unchanged. And the money form
domesticshad been adjustedby 35 % under the require of the World Bank.
Procurement
All the purchasingitems were done by the require of the World Bank. But when the clerks from the
county of Emin they had signed the purchasing contracts, they had signed the contracts the
expenses of which were beyond the limit of the World Bank without understanding the require of
the World Bank. The engineering contracts' expenses they had signed about the cattle pens were
beyond the limit of the World Bank. And the contracts' expenses they had signed about the
reforming the grassland were beyond the limit of the World Bank. The county of Emin had


                                              28

 explained the events to the World Bank and the World Bank had already accepted the accounts
 forwardedby the county of Emin.
 Disbursement
 The purchasingitems had been done accordingto the require of the World Bank carefully. We paid
 the money after the items had been finishedand checked and accepted.
 Supervision and evaluation
 Because the engineering items were done by the beneficiary houses themselves,the supervising of
 the items was in the charge of the qualified departments. The departments mainly checked the
 qualities of the mending cattle pens and the newly-built cattle pens. And the departments checked
 the qualitiesof the reforming the grasslands and the newly-built grasslands,and the qualitiesof the
 newly-built vaults for the storing the green forage. The whole items were finished by the
 constructive standards of the World Bank carefully, so every subordinate item lived up to the
 standardsof the World Bank.
Main achievements and impact
 The main achievements. 179.632 thousand square meters of cattle pens had been finished and
repaired, which can make sure that 250 thousand sheep live through the biting cold winter. 101.938
 square mu of the grasslands had been reformed and 33.283 square mu of the grasslands had been
newly built, which can be estimated to yield 24 thousand tons of the hay which can meet the
require of 80 thousand sheep. 33.283 thousand square meters of the vaults for green forage had
been finished which can store 24 thousand tons of the green forage which can meet the require of
40 thousand sheep to live through the winter. 4574 herdsmen were trained to let them acquire the
knowledgeabout the making the forage and raising the domestic animalsin winter and the planting
the pasture grass.
Environmental and Social Benejits. We has solved the problems that the herdsmen hit by the
snowfall calamities wanted the forage to feed their domestic animals. And we had bettered the
ecology environments by protecting and newly built the grasslands. And the grasslands were
protected well. The grasslandsnow can yield more pasture grass.
We had helped the herdsmen to live through the biting cold winter and we had kept the society
stable. More and more people come to know the World Bank and the people in our region show
great enthusiasmto the World Bank.
Lessons and experience.
We have learnt a lot of scientific methods of management and the strict handle procedures and the
careful attitudes of the officers from the World Bank. And at the same time, a lot of clerks were
trained to learn the handle procedures of the World Bank. We have accumulatedlots of experience
to handle the items of the World Bank.
There had great differences between the World Bank and us in the items management and the
handling procedures. There were some problems existing in the handling the procedures because
we had contactedthe foreign capital of the World Bank the first time.
The selectingthe beneficiary households in the county of Emin and HeFeng didn't accord with the
require of the World Bank.
We reselected the beneficiary households in the counties of Emin and HeFeng after the World
Bank had found the beneficiary households chosen didn't accord with the require of the World
Bank. And we reselected 33 new beneficiaryhouseholdsin the county of HeFeng to help them with
goods instead of constructionwith the permission of the World Bank (greater area). And the areas
of some newly built cattle pens in the city of TaCheng were too large beyond the require of the

 World Bank. And 12 cattlepens were built with the soil tampered walls in order to reduce the cost,
 which would reduce the consistence of the walls of the cattle pens. We had asked the city of
 TaCheng to rebuild the walls of the 12cattlepens mentioned above.
 And the expenses of the newly built cattle pens in the county of Emin were excess of the
 permission of the World Bank, at the same time, the expenses of the reformingthe grasslandswere
 excess of the permission of the World Bank, from which we understand that we must obey the
 rules of the WorldBank to make surethe items go smoothly.
Assessments
 WorldBank Though the emergent aiding items from the World Bank to our region were not in the
 large scale, the World Bank had given us an ocean of helps when the clerksof our region had some
 difficulties in understanding the require of the World Bank. The officers of the World Bank had
 come to our region 4 times to check our work and offer us a great deal of helps in the whole 2001.
 They had pointed out the mistakes which we made in the handling the items and they had taught us
 how to handle them correctly. We had communicated with the World Bank frequently and got the
 useful information in time, which was the key factors by which we had finished the items
 successfully.
Borrower. The emergent aiding items from the World Bank to our TaCheng region were greatly
 supported by the communism committees and the communism governments. The beneficiary
households and the company carrying into execution they had showed great enthusiasm to the
World Bank. They had tried their best to carry out the items with the require of World Bank. There
were still some problems existing in the processing of the handling the items for the opinions we
hold differ from the WorldBank's.
We immediatelycorrect the mistakes which we made in the handling the items when the officer of
the World Bank pointed them out.
Administering agencies were founded accordingto the require of the World Bank ranging from the
prefecture to the village & town to manage the handling the emergent aiding items. Special clerks
were sent to see to the handling the items. And the TaCheng prefecture had know the 20% of the
processing information about the beneficiary households and the handling items. And the counties
and the villages & towns had know the 100% of the processing information about the beneficiary
households and the handlingitems.
At present we had finished all the constructive items under the order of the World Bank. And we
deal with the surplus fundswhich came form the changed interests by purchasingthe pasture grass-
processing machines and handing them out to the beneficiary households or new beneficiary
households. At present all constructive items had been checked and accepted, which have been
handed over to the beneficiary householdsto use. According to the informationwe have collected,
the beneficiaryhouseholdswere very satisfiedto the qualities of the constructiveitems.The newly-
built and the repaired cattlepens make sure that the herdsmen could let their domesticsanimals live
through the winter. Compared with the traditional cattle pens, the newly built cattle pens will
husband 20% forage. And the survivingrate of the lambs was improved.The reforminggrasslands
have taken on a new look, which yield 20% to 30% more grass than the last year. 90% herdsmen
are using the newly-built vaults for the green forages. There are about 20 thousand tons of forages
stored to make sure that the domestics animals in our region can live through the winter. The
herdsmen were very satisfied to the pasture grass processing machines, which can help the
herdsmen mow, transport, disintegratethe pasture grass and help the other herdsmen to mow and
transport the pasture grass to benefit. The artificial grasslands will benefit well in the future if they
are managed well.

Costs and Benefits.
The deathrate of the domesticsanimalshave been reduced and the survivingrate of the lambshave
been increased.And the periods of the domestics animals'getting maturing have been shorten.The
output of the pasture grass has been increased.Every beneficiary household must pay 10 thousand
Yuan back to the World Bank, which can be paid off in 5 to 8 years for the survivingrate of the
domestics animals has been increased and the cost of the forage has been reduced by the aiding
items of the World Bank. Every animal can get 15 to 20 Yuan more than before, by which every
beneficiaryhouse can pay off the 10thousandYuan in 5 to 8years.
Behavior of the WorldBank and Borrower
The strict and scientific methods of management and the handling procedures embody the open,
fair and square, transparent principles, especially the careful attitudes and the precise workmg of
officers of the World Bank gave the local clerks deep impressions. And the diligence and the
hardworkmg of the officers of the World Bank were the key factorsto the finishingthe items. The
herdsmen showed the great enthusiasm to the World Bank's items, so did the local governments
and communism committees. Though there were some problems existing during the items were
handled,the World Bank and the whole TaChengregion have overcomethe problemstogether.
Future Plans.
In order to make sure the items can yield the most benefit and help the beneficiary households
overcomethe problemsthey would meet in the future. The items offices in our region will be lasted
for a long time to sever the beneficiary households and train the herdsmen and help the treasury
departments in our region to reclaim the loans from the World Bank. And we will sum up the
experience and the lessons form the processing the items with the World Bank in order to do the
best work with the World Bank in the future.
