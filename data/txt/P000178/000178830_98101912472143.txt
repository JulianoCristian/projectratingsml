BURUNDI
APPRAISAL REPORT
I.  SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND MANPOWER NEEDS
Geographic and Socio-economic Setting
1.01      Burundi, a small country located on the northeastern shore of Lake
Tanganlika, is one of the poorest and most densely populated (147 persons
per Km ) countries on the African continent. About 95% of its estimated 4.1
million population are settled in small land holdings scattered across hilly
rural areas, making a living from subsistence farming and coffee -- Burundi's
most important export crop. Two major ethnic groups form the backbone of the
country's population: the Hutus, who represent the majority and are essen-
tially rural and the Tutsis, who tend to concentrate in main urban centers.
These two groups have been involved in serious confrontation with each other
and although they appear to be now at peace, their earlier differences still
determine to a great extent the prevailing political and economic scenario.
1.02      Major constraints to Burundi's development have been:  (a) a land-
locked position (about 1,400 Km from Dar-es-Salaam, the nearest sea port)
which isolates the country from external markets; (b) limited natural resources
in general, and in particular, a very small agricultural area in relation to
rural population; (c) rugged terrain which makes road construction and main-
tenance costly; and (d) extremely low levels of education and skills among the
labor force 1/ which preclude a more efficient use of even the limited natural
resources of the country.
Recent Development Trends and Prospects
1.03      In the first half of the 1970's the structural problems, which
hamper Burundi's development, were compounded by civil strife. Between 1970
and 1975, GDP remained virtually stagnant and per capita income in real terms
fell by 7 to 8% during the period. In the past three years, the upsurge in
coffee prices and a more stable internal situation gave impetus to economie
expansion: GDP is estimated to have risen in real terms at about 5.5% per
year. However, the situation in the early months of 1979 deteriorated signif-
icantly with the interruption of supplies from abroad resulting from the
confliet involving neighboring Tanzania and Uganda. By the end of May, the
situation was beginning to ease, and recovery is expected.
1/   Three out of four adults are illiterate and students in technical
education represent about 10% of secondary level enrollments,which
is an insignificant share of the relevant age-group.



1.04      The most important step taken by the Government with the purpose
of improving economic management has been the preparation of a roll-over
Five-Year Economic Development Plan. This Plan which originally related to
the period 1978-82 has already been revised and rescheduled to 1979-83. The
Plan includes the reorganization of public administration which is being
carried out with external technical assistance. The goals set in the Plan are
self-reinforcing and can be summarized as follows: (a) accelerate economic
growth in order to provide greater employment opportunities and higher income
to the poorest segments of the population; (b) give the Government a more
active role in mobilizing financial and manpower resources and a greater
participation in commercial and productive activities; (c) foster decentral-
ization of economic activity; and (d) emphasize agricultural production with
special attention given to food production.
1.05      The original Plan contained ambitious socio-economic targets.  In
early 1979 in the light of recent developments (para. 1.03) and changing world
economic prospects, these targets were substantially reduced to more realistic
levels. The implications of the expected decline in the price of coffee and
the steady increase in import prices on the availability of financial resources
were taken into account. Also the progress in the implementation of indus-
trial projects, many of them with public sector participation, and other
programs were re-examined and accounted for. The new projections for 1979-83
estimate that investment will be less than 70% the original target and thus
the overall rate of growth of the economy will be lower than projected --
about 5% as compared with the previous projection of almost 6% per year.
These targets may still be ambitious and are expected to be reassessed by the
Government in the forthcoming months.
Manpower Needs
1.06      Subsequent to the preparation of the 1978-82 Development Plan, new
studies on the employment situation in Burundi were carried out, with ILO
assistance, jointly by the Ministry of Planning and the Ministry of Social
Affairs and Labor. On the basis of these studies and consistent with revised
socio-economic targets for the period 1979-83, projections of manpower needs
and training requirements for the modern sector were prepared in May 1979.
These estimates are closely related to the development of the traditional
sectors (in particular agriculture) inasmuch as they include Government
manpower requirements for the provision of public services to these sectors.
Moreover, if the development of the country takes place along the lines and
at the pace projected in the Plan, the relative importance of the modern
sector in the economy should rise rapidly and employment opportunities in the
sector should increase at a substantially higher pace than the available labor
force.
1.07      For 1977, the employment studies estimated the total labor force
at about 1.9 million, 1/ with about 95% engaged in traditional activities,
mainly subsistence agriculture. The modern sector with about 92,000 workers
1/   This estimate is provisional pending the results of the August, 1979
population census.



- 3 -
includes: (a) salary and wage earners in jobs of a permanent nature provided
by public, semi-public and private concerns; (b) self-employed professionals
and businessmen included in official statistics; (c) persons working in
religîous institutions; and (d) the armed forces. The share of the public
sector within this modern segment of the economy is very high: almost 60,000
jobs arè provided by the Central Government, the autonomous public institu-
tions and semi-public entities (including mixed enterprises). This accounts
for the priority assigned by the authorities to the training of the manpower
required for the development of the modern sector.
1.08      The May 1979 employment projections relate to the modern sector,
excluding modern private agriculture (with about 5,000 workers in 1977).
According to these projections, employment in the modern sector would increase
from 87,000 in 1977 to 177,300 in 1987, and almost 400,000 by the year 2000.
Assuming that the labor force grew at 2.2% per year - projected growth of
total population - the share of the modern sector in total employment would
rise from 4.6% in 1977 to 7.5% in 1987 and 12.7% in the year 2000. Employment
opportunities in the traditional sector would still have to grow at an annual
rate of about 1.8% or by about 30,000 to 35,000 jobs per year in the next
decade. The expansion of agriculture, a priority in the development plan,
should provide most of these jobs. Although certain assumptions underlying
these projections appear somewhat over-optimistic, in general terms, the
expected gradual expansion of the share of the modern sector in total employ-
ment is reasonable.
1.09      The projected employment opportunities in the modern sector for
high level (university education) and specialized manpower are as follows:
1977             1987          2000
High Level Manpower         1,600            2,700          5,100
Specialized Manpower: 1/
Technical                12,100           24,000         52,000
General                  13,300           22,000         41,000
1/   Middle level technicians, skilled and semi-skilled workers.
Source: Annex 1, T-1.
These data indicate that a substantial change in the structure of employment
is expected. While in 1977, employment for middle level manpower in clerical
and administrative positions (requiring general secondary education) were 10%
higher than for middle level manpower in specialized and technical occupations
(requiring specialized and technical secondary education), by the year 2000
the position is expected to be reversed, with the latter exceeding the former
by over 25%. Although projections to the year 2000 are obviously tentative,
these expected changes in employment opportunities are extremely important
in the planning of the expansion of the educational system (paras 2.22-2.33).

II. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
Overview
2.01      Except for primary education which has undergone major reforms since
1973, the education system in Burundi continues to suffer from the inadequacy
of the structure, methods, and standards that prevailed at Independence in
1962. Each level of education is oriented towards the next academic level.
Even in technical education, courses are overly theoretical and abstract and
programs unduly long and costly with the result that the limited number of
qualified graduates are rarely employed at the level and in the specialized
fields for which they have supposedly been trained.
Structure
2.02      General formal education in Burundi (Annex 1, C-1) consists of six
years of primary education, four years of lower secondary education (Cycle
d'Orientation or C.O.), three years of upper secondary education and two to
five years of higher education (two years for Candidature, four years for
Licence and five years for Agronomist's Diploma, within the eight faculties
of the National University of Burundi). In addition to general education,
the formal system includes at the secondary level, the following specialized
programs:
(a)  Primary teacher training offered at junior and senior levels
in five- or eight-year courses, respectively; 1/
(b)  Technical education provided in four- and five-year semi-skilled
and skilled worker training courses, respectively, and three- to four-year
middle level technician training courses following the skilled worker training
courses or the general junior secondary C.O.; 2/
(c) Agricultural education training extension workers (A3's) in a
one-year course following two to three years of C.0. or in a three-year course
following primary education, and middle level extension technicians (A2's) in
four-year courses following completion of the C.O.; and
(d) Paramedical education training junior and senior auxiliary medical
and sanitation personnel in two- to four-year courses following completion of
the C.O.
1/   In the local terminology, five-year and eight-year teacher training
course graduates are respectively called D4's and D7's.
2/   In the local terminology, middle level technicians are called A2's,
Skilled workers A3's and semi-skilled workers A4's. Higher level
technicians (two to three years of university) are called Al's.



2.03      The educational system comprises three types of schools:  (a) Gov-
ernment or "officiaIl" schools; (b) Government-subsidized private schools
offering "official" programs, with their recurrent expenditures financed by
the Governnent; and (c) independent private schools. Except for 15,000 to
20,000 primary students and about 270,000 literacy students enrolled in
independent private institutions, education at all levels i- financed almost
exclusively by the Government. However, the shortage of qua±ified inspectors
and limited transportation facilities have so far hampered efficient monitor-
ing and control of the system. In 1977/78, public primary schools enrolled
over 142,000 students, i.e., only about 23% of the relevant age-group (Annex 1,
C-2). The enrollments in private primary schools and literacy centers repres-
ented an additional 45% of such age-group. Secondary and higher education
enrolled only 2.5% and 0.5% of their relevant age-groups with about 15,200 and
1,500 students, respectively. These are among the lowest enrollment ratios
in Africa - a reflection of Burundi's poverty and early stage of development
(paras. 1.01-1.02).
Administration and Planning
2.04      The Ministry of Education (MOE) has administrative, financial and
academic control over primary, secondary, teacher training and technical
education. Although the University is under the Directorate General of Higher
Education of the MOE, it enjoys a high degree of autonomy (Annex 1, C-3).
The contribution of the Ministries of Agriculture, Health and Public Works
to education in their respective fields represents an important share of
specialized education (about one third of enrollments).
2.05      Education planning in Burundi is carried out by the Planning Unit
of the MOE, established in 1977. This Unit, assisted by an education planning
advisor, is presently engaged in statistical work and school location planning.
Although adequately staffed, poor equipment, lack of working materials and
insufficient transportation facilities have hampered its operation with
particular regard to field work and surveys. The second education project
would provide equipment, materials and vehicles to help solve this problem.
Primary Education and Literacy Programs
2.06      Primary school enrollments which had remained stable at about
130,000 from 1972/73 to 1976/77, have increased rapidly--about 9% p.a.--in
the past two years.  The Government plans to enroll some 10,000 additional
students annually and to reach 200,000, i.e., 28% of the relevant age group
before the mid-1980's.  In addition, Government literacy centers to be estab-
lished in the next five years are expected to add about 20,000 student places
to the 300,000 places expected to be provided by the private religious
Yagamukama literacy programs. These programs offer three shifts of two days
of instruction each week over a period of six years. The centers are also
utilized for adult education. The system is popular with parents as their
children are available for farming and household work a major part of the
week. According to UNESCO, children who have participated in these programs



- ô -
can read, write and make basic calculations.  The decision as to the appro-
priate balance of primary education and literacy programs, in order to expand
the sector so as to reach universal literacy by the 1990s, would be based on
the findings of a comparative study of the educational outcomes of both types
of education, to be financed under the second education project.
2.07      The reform of primary education assisted by the first education
project (Credit 679-BU) is progressing satisfactorily. The use of the
national language (Kirundi) is now universalized. The curriculum has been
adapted to the local environment mainly through the introduction of agri-
cultural activities in which students and parents are involved. The Rural
Education Bureau (BER) responsible for the implementation of the reform,
is producing the textbooks and teaching aids required and is effectively
upgrading primary teachers and inspectors.
2.08      Primary Teacher Training.  In 1979, about 6,300 students were
enrolled in 21 primary teacher training schools.  The present capacity of
the schools is sufficient to provide the required number of new teachers for
the next five to seven years estimated at about 500 per year, assuming that
the students:teacher ratio in primary school will increase from its present
32:1 to 35:1 by the mid-1980s.  However, a number of shortcomings in the
teacher training system require correction: Firstly, because of the high
dispersion of the training schools, the average students:teacher ratio is low
(15:1). Secondly, the five-year course (D4) provides insufficient pedagogical
training, while the majority of the graduates of the 8-year course (D7), after
one or two years of teaching (either in primary or junior secondary schools),
proceed to the University. Thirdly, teacher training programs are overly
theoretical, placing only limited emphasis on practical methods and creative
work. In order to correct these shortcomings, the Government plans to replace
the existing dual teacher training system by a new single program including
the C.0. followed by two years of exclusively pedagogical training. It also
plans to concentrate teacher training facilities and improve the quality of
the training by giving it a more practical orientation.  For achieving the
latter goal, new science laboratories and libraries inter alia will be re-
quired in a number of existing institutions.  A possible future third educa-
tion project may assist these reforms when their specifications are further
developed.
General Secondary Education
2.09      General secondary education which has been expanding at almost 12%
per year in the past five years, attained an enrollment of about 7,900 in
1978/79 (70% junior secondary students - 25% girls). These students attended
29 schools of which 24 are Government-financed. While the average class-size
(33 students) is appropriate, the students:teacher ratio (16:1) is low due
mainly to the high number of small junior secondary units with average enroll-
ments of only about 150 students. About one-half of the teaching staff can
be considered fully qualified and these are mainly concentrated in senior
secondary education.



- 7 -
2.10      Students who complete secondary education will have had at least
13 years of general education. However, as the majority of secondary schools
lack adequate laboratories, equipment, teaching materials and libraries,
secondary education is overly theoretical and most of the students are inade-
quately prepared to enter higher education, particularly in the scientific
and technical areas. 1/ The MOE is aware of this problem and plans to equip
secondary schools, in particular at the senior level, with the necessary
facilities. In addition, to make the system economically more efficient, it
plans to regroup upper secondary education into about 15 schools equitably
distributed across the eight provinces. This would be a first phase in a plan
aiming eventually at separating junior and senior secondary facilities, so
that a proportion of the junior secondary students can be easily oriented to
types of education other than general senior secondary education. Furthermore,
the MOE is initiating a reform of general secondary curricula and teaching
methods to make students' work more practical and creative and to increase
self-teaching. This should be easy to implement because most of the secondary
schools are boarding schools which provide for supervised homework. A possible
future third education project may assist these reforms when their specifica-
tions are further developed.
2.11      The Secondary Education Bureau (BEPES) and the Inspectorate are
actively assisting in the reform and reorganization of secondary education.
The BEPES is adequately staffed with nationals and foreign advisors provided
by bilateral assistance which will also initiate construction of new facilities
for the BEPES in the near future. The Inspectorate which started activities at
the secondary level only in 1977/78, is planning to expand by adding 12 second-
ary inspectors to its staff. However, the lack of adequate means of transporta-
tion both for the BEPES and the Inspectorate are major constraints to field
visits, distribution of learning materials, and monitoring and control of the
reforms. The second education project would help resolve this problem by pro-
viding vehicles for these two agencies.
Higher Education
2.12      The University of Burundi, started in 1961 with four faculties
and 53 students, has now reached an enrollment of almost 1,700 students in
eight faculties. 2/ About 60% of the teaching staff are expatriates who apply
1/   Scientific and technical careers attract a high proportion of university
students (40% of enrollments in 1979).

international teaching/learning standards. This, combined with the deficient
preparation of secondary students (para. 2.10), results in very low internal
efficiency in higher education in general, and in sciences in particular. 1/
Notwithstanding this low efficiency, an unusual rapid increase in enrollment
in the Engineering Department ensures a substantial number of candidature
graduates 2/ who are qualified to specialize abroad as technical teachers at
higher technician and engineer levels. A sufficient number are expected to be
available to teach in the technical schools included in the proposed project.
As for the general education teachers required (para. 4.06 below), these can
be provided at existing facilities training secondary teachers and at a new
teacher training institute expected to start operations in 1979/1980. Junior
secondary teachers in particular will be trained in three critical subject
groups, namely French/Kirundi, Mathematics/Physics and Biology/Agriculture.
Technical Education
2.13      Overview.  Technical and other types of specialized education in
Burundi has been growing at a very fast pace in recent years -- at about
14% per year (Annex 1, T-2). However, the present system (Annex 1, C-1) is
neither quantitatively nor qualitatively in line with the development needs
of the various sectors of the economy. Under the MOE, technical education is
provided by: (a) eight technical schools training A2 middle level technicians
and A3 skilled workers; and (b) five vocational training centers training A4
semi-skilled workers (para. 2.02). The fields of specialization are: civil
engineering, electricity, electronics, heat engines, machine tools, auto-
mechanics, construction trades, woodwork, sheet metalwork, social work,
business, art and tailoring. Other specialized schools sponsored by other
Ministries but operating with the collaboration of the MOE are three agricul-
tural schools and the School for Public Works (GETO). The remaining technical
training institutions are under the exclusive responsibility of the Ministries
concerned. The most important of these institutions are those under the
Ministry of Health (para. 2.02). Other Ministries offer mostly ad hoc in
service training programs for their own staff. 3/ Enrollments in technical
education by field and level in 1978/79 are as follows:
1/   Over the last four years only 40% of all university entrants completed
the first two-year "candidature" and 34% the full four-year "licence".
In sciences the respective percentages were 30% and 13%.
2!   About 60 such graduates are expected in 1979 as compared with only 12
in 1978.
3/   Very -iinited updated information is available for these courses.

2.14      Curricula.  The overall training programs with 34% to 55% of general
education subjects, as noted previously, are overly academic and not specifi-
cally oriented towards possible future employment opportunities.  This is
particularly true in the case of industrial training schools where the initial
year for A3 and A4 courses (para. 2.02) includes about 80% of general education
essentially to make up for the deficiencies in primary education. It is even
more serious in the case of the A2 agricultural extension technician training
school (ITAB), where the share of general education in the first "transitional"
year is almost 90%. An additional shortcoming is the standardized duration of
courses which does not take into account the differences and specific require-
ments of the various trades.
2.15      Efficiency.  Most of the technical schools have inadequate facili-
ties and are poorly located. 1/ Also their equipment and working materials
are insufficient or inappropriate for the specific training they are supposed
to provide. These problems are particularly acute at the School for Construc-
tion Trades (CTTS) in Gihanga and at GETO in Bujumbura. This, combined with
a lack of coordinated policy and the unnecessary lengthy duration of many
courses, has resulted in the limited and uneven output of most technical
schools. 2/ The average students:teacher ratio is low (9:1) because of the
overly narrow fields of some specializations and the small overall enrollment
of most schools (50 to 100). Only two technical schools under the MOE have
1/   Exceptions are the Commercial Secondary School (ESTA), the Technical
Secondary School (ETS) and the ITAB.
2/   For example the number of graduates at the A3 level was as follows in
recent years:
1975       1976        1977
Woodwork                                8         14          17
Heat engines                            9         18          19
Machine tools                           9          17         14
Electricity                            6          21          17
Construction                          13          15          17
In 1978 there were no graduates at the A3 levels in these fields because
in 1974 no students were enrolled in first year.



- 10 -
enrollments which exceed 100 students, namely the Technical Secondary School
(ETS) and the Commercial Secondary School (ESTA) at Bujumbura-Kamenge. 1/
2.16      The ETS presently enrolls 600 students.  The school provides train-
ing:  (a) at the A2 level in electromechanics and electronics (85 students);
(b) at the A3 level in joinery/cabinet making, automotive, machine tools and
electricity (260 students); and (c) at the A4 level in automechanics and sheet
metalwork/bodymaking (255 students). The institution receives substantial
assistance from bilateral sources, mainly Belgium, and at present one half of
the teaching staff are expatriates. However, the organization of the school
is deficient, the pedagogical system antiquated and an important share of the
equipment obsolete. In contrast, with adequate management and equipment, the
ESTA provides good quality training. In 1978 it enrolled 78 students in a
two-year senior program in secretarial skills, accountancy, law, and manage-
ment and 96 students in a two-year junior program for typists and bookkeepers.
However, because most of the graduates from the junior program proceed to the
senior level, there is virtually no supply of typists and bookkeepers in the
labor market. 2/
2.17      Plans for Expansion and Reform.  A crucial element for the successful
implementation of the Government's Development Plan (para. 1.04-1.05) will be
the timely availability of skilled manpower of various specializations and
levels. The Government has determined that in order to meet these manpower
needs, technical education has to be rapidly expanded and improved (para. 1.09).
2.18      To improve technical education, adapt it better to employment oppor-
tunities and make it financially more efficient, the Government plans to
introduce structural and curricular reforms (Annex 1, C-4) which would:
(a) establish a minimum age (15 years), and raise the academic
standards required for admission into technical education; 3/
(b) set clear-cut objectives for each level and type of training
and develop new curricula consistent with these objectives;
(c) reduce the general education component in technical curricula
to the minimum required for the understanding of the specific
technical subjects. This would result in a shortening of
course duration, which in turn would allow for an increase
in the annual output of existing facilities;
1/   Recently the ITAB and the agricultural extension worker training school
at Karuzi (EPA) have exceeded the 100 enrollments.
2/   In 1977 and 1978 only seven graduates from the junior program entered
the labor market.
3/   At least two years of C.0. instead of only the completion of primary
education as presently, for admission into A3 skilled worker training
schools.



- il -
(d) set the duration of courses in an independent manner for
each level and type of vocational training, strictly as a
function of the vocational objectives specifically defined;
(e) introduce production oriented training directly related to
future employment opportunities. In this respect the cooper-
ation of potential public and private employers would be highly
beneficial. They could participate in schoolboards, curriculum
development, in-school and in-plant training activities,
graduates' vocational guidance and orientation, etc.; and
(f) initiate courses integrating specialized training and extensive
broader technical programs. This would give the students an
opportunity to assess their vocational abilities better before
selecting their specialization and to look for alternative
employment in case jobs in the narrower field of specialîzation
should become temporarily saturated.
2.19      The Government plans to increase the capacity of the technical
school system through projects for expansion of existing schools and construc-
tion of new facilities. A major reorganization and expansion project affects
the ETS at Kamenge (paras. 2.15 and 2.16) in which the Belgian Governnent has
agreed to assist. The expanded ETS would train A3 skilled workers in five
fields, namely woodwork/cabinet making, electricity, heat engines/automechanics,
sheet metalwork/bodymaking and machine tools, and A2 middle level technicians
in four fields, namely industrial electricity, electronics, diesel automotive
and general mechanics/machine tools. The second education project would
complement the scheme assisted by Belgium and in particular finance this
new A2 general mechanics/machine tools department. The Government plans to
increase the total capacity of the school from the present 600 to 950 student
places (including the addition of 250 boarding places to the present 370).
The new distribution of enrollment would be 180 students in a preparatory year
during which they would be tested and oriented towards the various A3 fields
of training, 450 students in the five A3 departments and 320 students in the
four A2 departments. The existing A4 semi-skilled training programs would
be phased out and their facilities would be absorbed by the A3 departments.
The duration of the new A2 and A3 programs would be three years. The nec-
essity of adding a fourth year for electronics is under review.
2.20      A second expansion project affects ESTA (paras. 2.15-2.16).  For
this school, the envisaged reduction of the A2 courses from four to three
years 1/ would allow a better utilization of existing facilities. As a result
school enrollment could increase from the present 174 to about 250. Further-
more, new facilities to be financed under the second education project would
be added. These would be addressed to a new A3 typist and bookkeeper training
program enrolling 280 students. With regards to GETO, the present output of
1/   The students would be recruited after completion of the C.0. and only
exceptionally from the A3 typist and bookkeeping training program.

civil engineering and construction technicians, and
surveyors (less than 20 per year) falls far below the immediate needs of the
public sector. This shortfall (para. 2.15) is expected to be overcome, on an
emergency temporary basis, 1/ by the envisaged limited expansion of the school
on its present constricted site in Bujumbura with the financial assistance of
a possible third highway project presently under consideration. Enrollment
would increase from the present 110 to about 270. This increase in enrollment
would help smoothen the transition from the existing GETO to a new School for
Public Works to be established in Gitega. This new school would be included
in the second education project. When the new school is completed, the
extended facilities in Bujumbura would be fully used by the Ministry of
Public Works to centralize its road and construction services, at present
dispersed over the Capital area. The new teaching equipment to be acquired
for the expansion of the old school would be transferred to the new school.
2.21      The facilities of the A3 School for Construction Trades at Gihanga
(para 2.15), one of the most efficient technical schools, are becoming increas-
ingly unsuitable due to the subsidence of the structures which were built on
black cotton soil; thus, for economy reasons, the institution should not be
expanded at its present location. The Government intends to replace the
school by a new A3 technical school of larger capacity to be established at
Bubanza (380 student places as compared with 120 at Gihanga) under the
second education project. With regard to agricultural education, the Govern-
ment plans to expand the capacity of its A3 extension worker training school
(EPA) at Karuzi from 120 to 250 student places. This expansion together with
program reforms at the A2 and A3 training levels (para. 2.18) would raise the
output of agricultural schools to the level required to meet agricultural
manpower demand by the late 1980's.
2.22      Future Capacity.  After the above mentioned planned expansion of
school facilities has been completed and the reform of the curricula has been
implemented, the capacity of technical education (including agricultural
education) would be about 1,300 student places at the A2 level (about 1,100
of which would be for industrial, commercial and agricultural trades) and
2,400 student places at A3 skilled and A4 semi-skilled levels (Annex 1, T-3).
The expected average annual output of the above facilities would be distri-
buted as follows:
1/   The present school location does not permit an expansion as required to
meet needs in the next ten years. Furthermore, the present buildings are
little more than warehouses.

2.23      The estimated average annual requirements for high and middle level
manpower training identified in the May 1979 employment study for the modern
sector (para. 1.08) are as follows:
Skill Level                      1978-87          1988-1992         1993-2000

1/   See paragraph 1.09 note 2.
Source: Annex 1, T-4.
It is estimated that existing technical schools could provide only about 22%
of the annual technical middle level manpower to be needed in 1978-87. By
1988, the new technical schools included in the second education project
would provide 14% of the required graduates and the technical school system
as a whole 40% of total requirements. The remainder would have to be trained
on the job. Even if economic development targets are not attained and sector
employment proceeds at a much lower rate than now anticipated (paras. 1.08-
1.09), expansion of technical education is urgently needed.
2.24      Taking into account that most specialized schools require two to
four years of general secondary education as an entry requirement and that
general secondary education also provides the entrants to higher education, it
has been estimated that the proportion of student places in general secondary
(including teacher training schools) to specialized education consistent with
employment opportunities should be 3:1. At present it is 7:1. If general
secondary education grows at about 7% per year and teacher training enroll-
ments stagnate, as projected in the Development Plan, when the new technical
schools are fully operational by the mid 1980's, the ratio should decline to
5:1. A continued faster growth of specialized schools would be required in
order to attain the 3:1 balance by the 1990's.

2.25      Technical Education Bureau (BEET).  The BEET was established in 1977
and entrusted with the development and implementation of plans and reforms for
technical education. Because of poor management, lack of a clear-cut policy
and staff shortage, the Bureau had been virtually inactive until very recently.
Presently, it is engaged in the reform of curricula and training methods for
civil engineering, electricity, electronics and mechanics courses. 1/ Eight
additional divisions in charge of the remaining fields of specialization in
the sub-sector are to be established in the future. The BEET lacks trans-
portation facilities and thus cannot monitor and control all technical schools.
The second education project would assist the BEET in this respect through the
provision of vehicles.
2.26      The BEET is under the authority of the Directorate of Technical and
Vocational Education within the Directorate General of Secondary Education.
The Directorate of Technical and Vocational Education manages its operations
independently and has a line of credit of its own in the MOE budget, which has
steadily increased over the last two years. This functional and financial
autonomy of technical and vocational education is the official recognition of
the importance and specificity of this subsector and is essential to its
improvement. During negotiations, the Government gave an assurance that it
will provide the Directorate of Technical and Vocational Education, as and
when needed, with competent and experienced staff and the financial resources
required for the appropriate operation and development of this subsector.
2.27      External Assistance to Technical Education.  In its effort to improve
technical education the Government is relying on the support of multi- and
bilateral aid agencies, especially in relation to the provision of equipment
and fellowships.  Of the 2,075 students presently benefiting from fellowships
within the country and abroad, 562 have elected technical training at tech-
nician and engineer levels. This represents 27% of the total higher education
fellowship program, a substantial share for a country at this level of edu-
cational development. FED provides a major contribution with 146 of these
technical training fellowships and it is prepared to increase its assistance
in this subsector, if required, under its 1980-1985 program. UNDP is also
expected to provide equipment and specialists' services to technical education
by priority, if required, under its 1982-86 IPF. However it is still premature
to assess the precise contents and amounts of these possible contributions.
2.28      Belgium is the major source of bilateral assistance to Burundi in
the field of technical education.  In addition to financing the extension of
the ETS (para. 2.19), Belgium is assisting the development of the Engineering

Department of the Faculty of Sciences (para. 2.12) and will finance the con-
struction of new facilities for the BEET. Furthermore, Belgian assistance
provides a substantial number of teaching staff (110 teachers of whom 16
technical teachers in 1977/78), technical advisors (five of them for the BEET)
and fellowships (among them five and eight for ETS teachers in 1978 and 1979,
respectively). It is expected that 20 teachers required for the second
education project technical schools may be provided by Belgium. The French
bilateral aid agency (FAC) also provides assistance to technical education.
In 1978/79 it had 10 teachers at the ETS, one at ESTA (para. 2.16) and one
at the BEET. In the near future, it will assign two additional teachers to
the ETS and one specialist to the BEET. Moreover, FAC plans the progressive
transfer of its technical assistance from general to technical education.
Education Finance
2.29      Although multi- and bilateral external assistance continues to
finance a major share of Burundi's education expenditures, its relative
importance has declined rapidly. While the level of official external aid
in real terms has remained virtually unchanged, the Government's contribution
has increased rapidly by almost 14% per year from 1974 to 1977. On the other
hand, private investment in education (mainly by parents and religious insti-
tutions) appears to be decreasing and total expenditures by this group have
fallen sharply. Total expenditures for education in 1974 and 1977 are esti-
mated as follows:

The increase in Government financing includes a rising participation in
investment programs. While in 1974, less than 1% of the Governiment's expendi-
tures in education were of a capital nature, by 1977 their share exceeded 10%
of the total and it is estimated to have attained 14% of that total in 1978.
2.30      The structure of the Government's recurrent expenditures in education
has undergone substantial changes in recent years, with the share of general
secondary and higher education rising steeply while primary and technical
education declined. Government recurrent expenditures in education in 1974
and 1978 have been estimated as follows:

1/   Education expenditures incurred by Ministries other than Education and
Agriculture.
For primary education, the decline in the share of recurrent expenditures
between 1974 and 1978 can be attributed mainly to a slower enrollment growth
than for other levels of education. This situation should change when the
schools being financed under the first education project come on stream.
The decline in the share of recurrent expenditures for technical education,
despite the sharp increase in enrollment (para. 2.13), can be explained by
the rapidly rising students:teacher ratios which lowered unit costs. In the
case of agricultural education, a sharp reduction in the financial deficit of
school farms has also contributed to lower unit costs without loss of training
efficiency. As for higher education, enrollments have more than doubled in
the past four years while unit costs have also declined due mainly to rising
students.teacher ratios.
2.31       The bulk of the Government's recurrent expenditures on education are
channeled through the MOE (over 95%). The share of recurrent expenditures of
this Ministry in the Government's recurrent budget has averaged about 22% in
the last few years. The Development Plan (paras. 1.04-1.05) assigns priority
to the provision of economic and social services. Consistent with these
priorities, the share of education expenditures in the budget is projected
to rise to 25% by the mid-1980's. This is a reasonable share in line with
that normally devoted to education by African countries at a similar level
of development (Annex 1, T-5). Recurrent expenditures for education are as
follows:

1/   Ordinary budget.
2.32      Recurrent expenditures in technical education which accounted for
5.8% of the recurrent budget of the MOE in 1978 are projected to increase
their share to about 8.7% of the total in 1983 (Annex 1, T-6). This assumes
that the second education project schools and those to be financed by bilateral
assistance would be completed as scheduled. The expenditure increase gen-
erated by the second education project would account for only 3% of the budget
of the MOE (para. 5.06).
2.33      The revised Development Plan (para. 1.05) has projected Government
total fixed investment for the period 1979-83 at FBu 31.1 billion (in constant
prices of 1978), with about FBu 6.2 billion assigned to education. With
regard to the financing of investment, about FBu 18.7 billion or 60% are
expected to be obtained from external sources, while the remaining 12.4
billion would be raised domestically. The proposed second education project
would contribute 2.7% of the total Government investment during the Plan
period (13.5% of investment in education) and at the same time it would
require less than 1.0% of the projected available domestic financing and only
4.0% of the foreign resources for the investment program. The second educa-
tion project which is consistent with the priority assigned to technical
education in the Plan would also be consistent with the projected financing
capacity of the public sector.

III.  BANK GROUP EXPERIENCE AND LENDING STRATEGY IN THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Past Experience
3.01      The Bank's assistance to education in Burundi followed the intro-
duction of a far-reaching reform of primary education in 1973. In response to
a Government request for assistance in the development of this sub-sector, the
Bank participated with UNESCO in a basic education sector survey carried out
in 1974. This was followed by a Bank Group identification mission in mid-1975,
and the subsequent preparation of a US$12.7 million equivalent primary educa-
tion project (US$10.0 million IDA Credit 679-BU, April 1977) which included
the construction of 100 primary schools/multi-purpose learning centers, a
practical subject teacher training center, a printshop for the Rural Education
Bureau (BER), and provision of equipment, furniture, and technical assistance
to the BER established for the implementation of the software aspects of the
reform. During the preparation and processing of the first education project,
discussions took place with the Governnent to review such problems as equit-
able access to primary education and subsequent distribution of the project
schools throughout the country, rural orientation of the curriculum, and
technical assistance in various aspects of curriculum development, teacher
training and management. As a result of this dialogue, several aspects of
Burundi's primary education policies regarding class size, school location
planning, automatic promotion, double-shifting and teaching loads were re-
examined by the Government and modified to achieve a more efficient and
equitable education system.
3.02      Implementation of the first education project encountered diffi-
culties in carrying out the construction programs due to the dispersion of
project schools over the whole country and the lack of an adequate con-
struction industry. Subsequently, the situation improved through the effi-
cient operation of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) which established
a departmental force to carry out the work using force account methods.
However, due to a countrywide shortage of cement and fuel resulting mainly
from conflicts between neighboring countries, virtually all construction
activities stopped in Burundi between September, 1978 and May, 1979. Although
the normal supply of building materials and fuel is now being restored, the
construction program is about one year behind schedule. This combined with
major price increases for cement is expected to result in a cost overrun which
is under review. To date twelve primary schools, the practical subject
teacher training center and the BER printshop have been completed and elght
additional schools are in the completion stage. Although the reformed curricu-
lum of primary education is now official, the delay in the construction of the
practical subject teacher training center has postponed the introduction of
practical subjects (agriculture, elementary technology, handicrafts, domestic
science) until the first graduates from this center come on stream in a year.



- 19 -
3.03      A lesson to be drawn from the first education project is that an
early and meaningful dialogue with the Government on the present and future
development of the education sector proved to be advantageous for project
preparation. Such dialogue will continue to be an essential part of the Bank
Group's strategy. This strategy was applied in the preparation of the
second education project resulting in the proposal to assist in extending the
reform of the education system to the secondary level, and more specifically
to technical education. The implementation of the first project also high-
lighted the difficulties of carrying out a widely dispersed construction
program. For these reasons, the second education project would concentrate on
a limited number of training institutions.
3.04      A new education sector survey conducted by UNESCO in 1978 has helped
broaden and update the information available on Burundi's education sector.
This comprehensive study also includes projections and recommendations as to
future educational development. It served as a basis for the discussion with
the Government during the identification of the proposed second project in
August 1978. At that time, a draft plan for the reorganization and improve-
ment of secondary education (para. 2.10-2.11) prepared by the BEPES was also
available and helped in these discussions.
Bank Group Strategy for Future Projects
3.05      After implementation of the proposed second education project, the
Bank Group's assistance to the education and training sector should foeus on:
(a) expansion of technical education at semi-skilled and skilled worker levels
and correlated development of non-formal on-the-job training schemes integrated
in the various specialized projects; (b) expansion of basic education following
the findings and recommendations of the pre-investment study to be financed
under the second education project (para. 2.06); and (c) improvement of
general secondary education and teacher training at all levels. As a good
information base on the sector has been developed in the last few years,
sector work should give priority to specific issue-oriented studies in support
of lending operations in the three areas depicted above.
IV. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Composition
4.01      The objective of the project is to assist the Government in (a)
training middle level technicians and skilled workers in industrial trades and
secretarial/administrative skills; (b) implementing and assessing the reform
of the education system; and (c) strengthening the MOE's planning, supervisory
and project implementation services. Specifically the project would include
the following:

- 21 -
Overall, the project would provide for: (a) the construction, furnishing and
equipping of 1,080 technical secondary student places, 990 student dormitory
places and 46 staff houses; and (b) the equipping of major ministerial ser-
vices (Annex 1, T-7).
Construction Trade Training School (CTTS), Bubanza
4.02      This new school would provide 380 places for skilled worker trainees
in masonry/concrete construction, plumbing, electrical installation and
general mechanics. All students would be boarders. The duration of the
course would be three years and the expected annual output would be about 110
graduates, equally distributed over the four specialized fields of training.
They are expected to be hired by public, parastatal and private construction
agencies at A3 level or enter into a business of their own. The curriculum
would include about 75% of workshop and field practice and related theory, and
25% of general education (French, Kirundi, Morals/Civics, Mathematics and
Sciences) directly geared to the skill training course. During the first two
years of training, students would be distributed over two broad technical
programs, namely construction/plumbing and mechanics/electricity. Specializa-
tion in one of the four above mentioned fields of training would be provided
only during the third year. Twenty-seven teachers would be required resulting
in a 14:1 students:teacher ratio. This relatively low ratio stems from the
principle of broad technical training involving introduction to a wide range
of different skills (para. 2.18 f) and small student units to ensure maximum
efficiency in practical training. This school would replace and expand the
Gihanga school for construction trades (para. 2.21) and would be the only
school at secondary level in the densely populated district of Bubanza. Among
the 16 administrative and support staff, one would be a highly qualified (Ai)
technical instruction director-workshops manager l/, responsible for the
organization and implementation of the training programs. The staff would be
accommodated in 22 staff houses, with those for the director, the technical
instruction director and the boarding complex manager to be located on the
school campus.
School for Public Works (SPW), Gitega
4.03      This new school would replace and expand the existing GETO (para.
2.20). In line with the Government's decentralization policy, the school
would be located in the second largest city at the most important cross-roads
in the center of Burundi, where the Government is establishing the second
major pole of development in the country. The site is suitable for practical
training particularly with heavy duty public works equipment. The school
would enroll 330 students, all boarders. The school would provide training
programs at two interacting levels, i.e., at the A2 level, 270 middle level
technicians would be trained in surveying, construction supervision, drafting
and rural engineering/hydraulics; and at the A3 level, 60 skilled workers
would be trained in heavy duty equipment operation and maintenance. The
1/   "Chef de Travaux



- 22 -
duration of the courses would be three years. The expected number of grad-
uates per year would be 80 middle level technicians consisting of about 27
surveyors, 27 construction supervisors, 16 draftsmen and 10 rural engineering
and hydraulics technicians and about 15 heavy duty equipment operators. It is
expected that graduates will be hired by the Ministry of Public Works, although
a few will probably work in private firms. Except for the 90 surveyor train-
ees, who would attend a separate course due to the specific requirements of
the trade, the other A2 middle level technician trainees would be provided
with a common two-year public works/construction course and would specialize
in construction supervision, drafting or rural engineering/hydraulics only in
the course of the final third year of training. The A2 curriculum would
include 30% of general subjects (Languages, Maths and Sciences) and 70% of
technical training. For the A3 curriculum the percentages would be 25% and 75%
respectively. Workshop and field practice would represent one to two thirds
of the vocational training programs.  The teachers required would be 28 thus
resulting in a 12:1 students:teacher ratio. This ensures a highly efficient
supervision of practical training in student groups of a manageable size.
Except for languages and morals/civics, general subjects would be taught by
technical teachers to ensure concentration of the program on technical train-
ing. Among the 15 administrative and support staff, one highly qualified
engineer would be the "Chef de Travaux". In addition to its regular curricular
activities, the school would be utilized for the upgrading inter alia of the
Ministry of Public Works's staff. All school staff would be accommodated in
23 housing units of which three would be located on the school campus for the
director, the technical instruction director and the boarding complex manager.
During negotiations, the Government confirmed its intention to transfer the
responsibility for the SPW from the Ministry of Public Works presently sponsor-
ing the GETO, to the MOE which is better equipped to support and supervise
training programs.
Mechanics Department of the ETS, Bujumbura-Kamenge
4.04      In the framework of the expansion and modernization of the ETS
(para. 2.19), the second education project would contribute a new pilot depart-
ment for 90 middle level technicians specializing in general mechanics and
industrial drawing. The ETS was selected because of its location in the
Capital area which will off er in the foreseeable future the only industrial
environment suitable to the proposed Department's activities. In addition
the insertion of this department into the existing ETS will be mutually
beneficial in view of the many correlated technical training activities of
the various departments of the school.  Moreover, the MOE intends to utilize
this modern department as a model for the reorganization of the whole school
over which it would thereby establish a better control. The duration of the
course would be three years. The curriculum would include about 70% of tech-
nical training, half of which would be workshop practice, and about 30% of
general education reinforcement principally in languages, mathematics and
sciences, tightly geared to the technical training programs. The first two
years of training would be common to all students. Specialization into
mechanics or industrial drawing would be provided only during the final



- 23 -
third year. The expected annual output would be about 25 A2 graduates. The
department would be organized as an actual production unit. The technical
training program would include a substantial number of production-oriented
training sessions covering all the aspects of mechanical production so that
the students be able as early as possible to participate in actual repair,
maintenance and manufacturing operations for the Government, parastatal and
private industries. In addition to the expected high quality of training
and greater students' motivation, the proposed department would help give the
country greater technological autonomy. The above objectives would require a
greater amount of diversified machinery with different operational capacities
and more supervision than it is usual in purely training (as opposed to
production) units. It would require Il teachers and a "Chef de Travaux" to
organize, monitor and control training operations, resulting in a students:
teacher ratio of 8:1.  The participation of employers in the proposed depart-
ment's and the whole school's operations would be of major importance to reach
the above objectives. The Belgian bilateral aid agency is expected to provide
250 dormitory places for the ETS in addition to the existing 370 places.
During negotiations, the Government gave an assurance that the staff and
students of the Mechanics Department will be provided with adequate accommo-
dation, as and when needed.
Typing and Bookkeeping Department of the ESTA, Bulumbura-Kamenge
4.05      In the framework of the reorganization of the ESTA (para. 2.20),
the second education project would provide a new department to train typists
and bookkeepers, which would be the only training institution in the country
for this lower level (A3) of secretarial skills (para. 2.16). The Department
would provide 280 student places of which 50% would be for girls. All students
would be boarders. The duration of the course would be two years with the
curriculum including 60% of vocational training and 40% of general education
reinforcement mainly in Kirundi, French and English. The expected output
would be 130 per year. Twenty teachers would be required resulting in a
students:teacher ratio of 14:1. Although the two programs would be separate,
they would include a substantial common core of bookkeeping, typing and office
procedures to provide each type of graduates with a wide range of professional
competence. The proposed department would be a pilot institution as the
extreme shortage of skilled staff at this level may result in private agencies
establishing similar training units. The project would include one staff
housing unit on the school campus for the boarding complex manager.
4.06      Availability of Teaching Staff.  In addition to 15 general subject
teachers, 74 technical teachers would be required for the proposed project
schools. 1/ Of the latter, 14 would teach commercial subjects and 60 would
teach industrial and technical subjects. No difficulty is anticipated in
1/   Six engineers, 22 AI's, 42 A2's, and 4 A3's.

recruiting the required national teachers for general and commercial subjects
from the existing training institutions in the country, and for industrial and
technical subjects, mainly from among the engineers and technicians expected
to return from fellowships abroad before the proposed project schools are
fully operational in 1985 (para. 2.27). Availability of national teachers is
also ensured by the 1977 presidential decree establishing a )nd system
offering fellowships in exchange for a legal commitment to serve for at least
10 years upon graduation in positions specified by the Government, including
education which is a Government priority.  At the present time, 196 students
are attending technician and engineer training courses in the country and 366
engineers are being trained abroad. Moreover a salary incentive representing
about 30% of the basic salary is already offered to university graduates
joining the teaching profession and additional incentives presently under
discussion between the MOE and teachers' unions are expected to attract
greater interest in the teaching profession. The Governnent can also utilize
its own ministerial technical staff in part-time or full-time teaching pos-
itions as this is presently the case at GETO. In addition, the Belgian and
French aid agencies and the UNDP (para. 2.27) are expected to provide the
expatriate teachers that would be required to fill the positions for which
national teachers might not be available. Also, no difficulty is envisaged in
obtaining from multilateral and bilateral aid agencies the expatriate technical
teachers in charge of providing pedagogical advice and guidance to national
teachers including those returning from fellowships abroad. During negotia-
tions, the Goverament provided an assurance that qualified expatriate teachers
will be assigned by priority to teach and provide pedagogical training to na-
tional teachers in project schools until national teachers are available to
fill their positions.
4.07      Characteristics Common to the Project Institutions.  The charac-
teristics common to the technical education components of the proposed project
are as follows:
(a) Students entering skilled worker training would be at least
15 years of age and have completed at least two years of
C.0. if joining industrial programs (para. 4.02) and at
least three years of C.0. if joining commercial programs
(para. 4.05). The academic background thus acquired prior
to admission into technical education would make it possible
to minimize general education and maximize vocational train-
ing within the technical course. C.O. students would be
oriented towards A3 skill training on the basis of their
personal choice, their teachers' guidance, manpower planning
authorities' recommendations and the decision of academic
authorities.
(b) Students entering middle level technician training would
have completed the C.O.. They would be oriented towards
A2 skill training on the same basis as in (a) above. A3
skilled workers could also be admitted as specified in (c)
below.



- 25 -
(c) Graduates from technical programs would be admitted to
the next higher level of training only if their number does
not exceed 10% of entrants at such level. This would result
in most technical education graduates entering the labor
market at the levels and in the specialized fields for which
they have been specifically trained, while providing an
opportunity to a number of the most qualified graduates to
reach the highest level of training compatible with their
aptitudes.
(d) The potential employers of project school graduates have
agreed to participate in the organization and practical
operation of Technical Education and Vocational Training,
including project schools (para. 2.18(e)), as requested by
the Government. This would adequately contribute to gear-
ing the technical training programs offered in project
schools to the actual needs of the profession.
(e)  In addition to their regular curricular activities, project
institutions would provide nonformal ad hoc training and
upgrading sessions to public and private agencies staff
and local communities particularly during vacations.
(f)  After adequate on-the-job experience, a number of project
school graduates could be selected as teachers or instructors
for technical schools (including project schools).
(g) Although the type of education assisted under the second
education project requires small classes for effective
learning, the average number of students per teacher in the
project schools (13:1) would be considerably higher than the
present uneconomical ratio (para. 2.15).
(h) All students would be boarders as the proposed project schools
would recruit on a nation-wide basis and no adequate accommo-
dation for students is available among local communities.
The Government has expressed its determination to introduce (i) the regula-
tions specified in (a), (b) and (c) above, and (ii) the training programs
to be provided in project institutions, specified in paragraphs 4.02 to 4.05.
Furthermore, during negotiations, the Government provided assurances that
(a) ministerial instructions establishing these regulations and programs will
be issued by December 31, 1981, as part of the overall reform and reorganiza-
tion of secondary education (para. 2.10) expected to be completed by that
date; and (b) it will take action so that, by September 30, 1980, employ-
ers participate in the organization and operation of technical education and
vocational training.
Pre-investment Studies
4.08      Basic Education.  Although the Government aims ultimately at uni-
versalizing primary education and intends to make every effort to limit the
cost of this type o£ educatlon, it would be beyond its means to reach universal



- 26 -
primary education before the end of the century. In order to reach universal
literacy, as an interim goal, by the year 2000, the Government envisages to
establish a basic education system which would combine the positive features
of existing formal primary education and the more economical Yagamukama
programs (para. 2.06). The study included in the second education project
would comprise inter alia: (a) an analysis of the cost effectiveness and
long-term efficiency of the Yagamukama programs as compared with standard
primary education and the Multipurpose Learning Centers established under the
first education project - the literacy lapse issue 1/ would be given particu-
lar attention - and (b) the geographic distribution of the literacy centers
and primary schools. This evaluation study would constitute a first phase to
be complemented by a second phase resulting in recommendations for the estab-
lishment of an efficient basic education system and/or experimental literacy
programs. No difficulty is anticipated in having this second phase financed
by other agencies such as the UNDP. The project would include about six
staff-months of specialist's services to assist in controlling data collection
and processing, equipment, vehicles and miscellaneous operational costs such
as transportation and report printing costs. This study is being prepared by
the Government with Unesco's assistance and is expected to be completed in
April 1980.
4.09      Technical Education.  The proposed second education project would
include about six staff-months of specialist's services to analyze the struc-
ture, content and methods of the existing technical training system, make an
inventory of existing facilities, identify further needs and propose ways to
meet them. A consultant hired by Unesco completed the required study in
February 1979.
Logistical Support to Ministerial Services
4.10      The second education project would provide office equipment and
supplies and two vehicles for the Planning Unit of the MOE (para. 2.05), nine
vehicles for the Secondary Inspectorate and four vehicles for the BEPES (para.
2.11) and office equipment and two vehicles for the BEET (para. 2.25), to
assist the Ministry in launching, monitoring and controlling its education
reform particularly at secondary level.
4.11      The first education project implementation unit (PIU) would be in
charge of monitoring and implementing a substantial portion of the proposed
second education project, namely the construction of the Mechanics Department
of the ETS (para. 4.04), the Typing and Bookkeeping Department of the ESTA
(para. 4.05) and about 50 staff housing units for the CTTS (para. 4.02), SPW
(para. 4.03) and ESTA. For this purpose the project would assist in strength-
ening the PIU (para. 6.02).
1/   Students fall back into illiteracy when programs are too short and/or
not followed-up.



- 27 -
Technical Assistance
4.12      The second education project would finance:  (a) the services of two
engineers to be engaged as "Chefs de Travaux" (paras. 4.03 and 4.04) for three
and a half years each, for the Mechanics Department of the ETS and the SPW
at Gitega; 1/ (b) 12 staff-months of specialists' services required for the
pre-investment studies (paras. 4.08 and 4.09); and (c) nine staff-years of
specialists' services to reinforce the PIU (para. 6.02). All technical
assistance specialists would be recruited upon terms and conditions satisfac-
tory to the Association.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.13      Because of the new features to be introduced into technical educa-
tion, the BEET should establish a tracer and evaluation program to follow and
assess the activities of students enrolled in technical education both during
their training and after graduation. The analysis of findings should indicate
whether the proposed curricula, duration of courses, admission requirements
for the proposed project schools need any adjustment. During negotiations, the
Government (a) provided an assurance that this tracer and evaluation program
will be established in the MOE by September 30, 1982 and detailed proposals
concerning this program will be provided to the Association for comments by
December 31, 1981; and (b) confirmed its intention to prepare and send to the
Association for comments within six months from the Closing Date a report
assessing the project, its implementation, its outcome and the role played by
the various agencies involved in its execution.
V. PROJECT COST AND FINANCIAL PLAN
Project Cost
5.01      The total cost of the second education project is estimated at
US$18.0 million equivalent including duties and taxes estimated at US$0.7
million. The estimated costs and foreign exchange components are given in
Annex I, T-8, and summarized below:
1/   These engineers would join their duty station six months prior to the
start of school operations (scheduled for September 1983) to monitor
and control delivery and installation of equipment, prepare the plans of
operations and coordinate the completion of syllabi. During the follow-
ing three years they would manage the implementation of the training
programs and train their national counterparts and advise technical
teachers.

5.02      Cost estimates for civil works, furniture, equipment and vehicles
are based on a review by Bank staff of (a) available data for similar compo-
nents in the first education project; and (b) recent construction contracts in
the private sector. Unit costs for the secondary level institutions included
in the project, range from US$380 per square meter for academic buildings to
be built by private contractors in Bubanza and Gitega, to US$240 per square
meter for staff housing and academic facilities in Bujumbura to be constructed
by the departmental force of the PIU using force account procedures. These
estimates (as of the base cost date of January 1980) reflect, inter alia, the
high cost of imported materials due basically to the very high transportation
rates from Kenya and Tanzania harbors to Bujumbura. Considering these factors,
prices per square meter compare reasonably with secondary school construction
in other African countries, e.g., Kenya, 1978, US$190; Mauritius, 1978,
US$215; Tanzania, 1977, US$235 (based upon exchange rates which reflect the
scarcity of foreign exchange). Construction standards for project schools and
staff housing would make maximum use of local materials and would reflect the
economical and functional approach adopted in the first education project.
Equipment costs and textbook prices are estimated on the basis of experience
in similar projects in Africa and preliminary equipment lists established by
bilateral and multilateral specialists in Burundi and the PIU. Technical
assistance has been estimated at US$50,000 to US$70,000 equivalent per staff-
year of specialist's services in line with UN specialized agencies rates for
the different types of services required by the project.
5.03      Duties and Taxes.  All items specifically imported for the project
would be exempt from customs duties and taxes in accordance with the normal
practice of the Government. It is expected that some of the building mate-
rials to be used in the construction of project institutions and some furni-
ture would be acquired on the local market and would accordingly be subject to
customs duties and/or taxes, estimated at US$0.7 million equivalent.
5.04      Contingency Allowances.  For physical contingencies, 10% has been
added to the base cost. Estimated price increases are based upon the follow-
ing annual rates for which price escalation has been calculated from the base
cost date (January, 1980) in accordance with the implementation schedule
(Annex 1, C-5):
Construction,      Furniture, Equipment,   Technical
4                             Professional Fees   Project Administration   Assistance
1980                 15%                       12%                  10%
1981-84              12%                        10%                 10%
Estimated price increases for construction are based upon recent trends and
forecasts in the construction industry in Burundi, as confirmed by the Ministry
of Public Works and the PIU. For furniture and equipment, the estimates
reflect the experience of the first education project and information obtained
from educational equipment suppliers. As for techncial assistance, the
estimates are based upon information provided by multilateral and bilateral
agencies involved in assistance to Burundi. Total price increases are esti-
mated at 32% of the base cost plus physical contingencies.



- 30 -
5.05      Foreign Exchange Component.  This component has been calculated as
follows: (a) construction, site development and project administration, 65%;
(b) furniture, 75%; (c) equipment and vehicles, 100%; and (d) professional
services and technical assistance, 80%. Including contingencies, the foreign
exchange component is estimated at US$13.4 million or 74% of the total project
cost. The foreign exchange component for civil works is high as compared to
those of non-land-locked eastern African countries (despite the simple nature
of the buildings proposed) because of the high dependence on imported materials
including cement, and the extremely high transportation costs due to Burundi's
land-locked geographic situation.
Financial Plan
5.06      The financial plan provides for IDA assistance of US$15.0 million
equivalent (87% of total project cost net of taxes), as follows:

of which taxes                     0.70                       0.70
The total Government contribution would be US$3.0 million equivalent (includ-
ing about US$0.7 million in taxes) spread over a period of five years with
a maximum contribution of about US$0.9 million equivalent in any one year.
Recurrent costs generated by the project are estimated at about US$0.8 million
per year when the project is fully operative, which would represent about 3%
of the projected recurrent budget of the MOE in 1985 (para. 2.32).
5.07      In November 1978, IDA approved an advance of US$135,000 from the
Project Preparation Facility (PPF), which would be financed by the Credit, to
help prepare the technical education component of the project and initiate
the basic education study (paras. 4.08 and 4.09).

VI.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
Implementation
6.01      Schedule.  The project would be implemented over a period of about
five years after the date of credit effectiveness including six months for
completion of payments and withdrawals from the Credit account (Annex 1, C-5).
Project completion is expected by December 31, 1984 with a Closing Date of
June 30, 1985. The implementation schedule is realistie and based upon
experience derived from the first IDA-assisted education project.
6.02      Administration.  The PIU established within the MOE for implementa-
tion of the first IDA-assisted education project, would be responsible for
the administrative and financial control of the project, including
coordination with the various Ministries and agencies and liaison with the
Association. The PIU is presently staffed on a full-time basis with a project
director, an assistant director (architect), an accountant, two construction
supervisors and suppport staff. The accountant and supervisors are financed
from funds provided under the first education project. The director, a
Burundi national, is a senior official of the MOE and therefore remunerated
by the Government, while the post of assistant director is financed by Belgium
under its bilateral program of assistance to Burundi. About eight staff-years
of specialist's services included under the first education project will be
used to pay for the services of the accountant and supervisors for a period of
two years up to the Closing Date of the first education project. In addition,
a full-time architect, two additional construction supervisors and a procure-
ment specialist are required over a period of three years to assist with the
expanded workload generated by the project. An additional nine man-years of
technical assistance have been included in the project for the above special-
ists who would be recruited upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Association.
6.03      Professional Services.  Design and supervision of construction of
all project institutions would be carried out by the PIU. With the recruit-
ment of an architect and construction supervisors, the Unit will be able to
handle all aspects of professional services with the exception of structural,
plumbing and electrical services which would be carried out by consultant
engineers, hired on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association.-
6.04      Site Selection.  Satisfactory sites have been selected for all
project institutions and confirmation of availability was received during
negotiations. These sites are provided free of cost by the Government.
6.05      The Building Industry.  Burundi's building industry is small and
heavily dependent on direct and indirect imports of materials and components
as well as plant and equipment, skilled manpower and managerial staff.
Despite strong Government support, this sector faces a considerable challenge
to meet the country's demands and objectives set forth in the Government's
on-going Development Plan. Problems in this sector were encountered for the
first education project and to overcome the difficulties (para. 3.02), the PIU
established a departmental force which has proven to be economical and effi-
cient in carrying out construction work by force account methods. This work



- 32 -
force is under the direction of the project architect and two construction
supervisors (para. 6.02). Materials are bulk procured by the PIU, by ICB or
by local competitive bidding which has also proven to be an economical and
efficient procedure. Due to the expected demand on the building industry, 1/
the dependence on the PIU departmentai force is likely to continue under this
project and about 35% of the civil works component (para. 6Y°6) is expected to
be carried out under this method. The work which can be groaped in such a
manner as to attract the interest of private construction firms (both local
and foreign) represents about 65% of the civil works component (para. 6.06).
A project to improve and upgrade the capacity of the local construction
industry is presently under preparation and is being considered for Bank Croup
assistance.
Procurement
6.06      Civil Works.  (a) Civil works contracts would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding advertized locally as well as
in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zaire for the academic and boarding facilities
of the CTTS at Bubanza and the SPW at Gitega. The above contracts are esti-
mated at US$7.2 million equivalent including contingencies. (b) The depart-
mental force of the PIU utilizing force account procedures would carry out the
construction of (i) staff housing for the CTTS and the SPW, (ii) the Mechanics
Department of the ETS; and (iii) the Typing and Bookkeeping Department of the
ESTA. The ETS and ESTA are both located at Bujumbura-Kamenge. The cost of
(b) is estimated at US$3.9 million equivalent including contingencies (35% of
the total civil works component). Based upon experience in the first project,
this method of construction would be more economical and efficient than using
private contractors (para. 6.05). However, some components of the work might
be carried out by local sub-contractors for whom contract awards would follow
local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Association.
6.07      Furniture, equipment and vehicles contracts, estimated at US$4.3
million including contingencies, would be awarded on the basis of ICB in
accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines for procurement, except for
contracts costing less than US$50,000 equivalent each, which would be awarded
on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance
with local procedures satisfactory to the Association. The aggregate total
of such contracts is not expected to exceed US$0.6 million equivalent.
6.08      Designs, Tender Documents and Equipment Lists.  Sketch designs,
draft tender documents and master lists of furniture, equipment and vehicles
indicating proposed grouping and cost estimates would be reviewed by the
Association.  Items would be grouped to the extent practicable to encourage
competitive bidding and to permit bulk procurement. Review of tender evalua-
tion documents prior to award would be required only for contracts above
US$250,000 equivalent for civil works and US$50,000 equivalent for furniture,
equipment and vehicles.  When ICB procedures are used:  (a) domestic manufac-
turers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a preference of 15% or the
1/   The sector is expected to step up production from FBu 2.75 billion
(US$30.7 million equivalent) in 1977 to FBu 8.9 billion in real terms
in 1982.



- 33 -
existing applicable rate of import duties, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f.
price of competing foreign suppliers; and (b) qualified domestic contractors
would be allowed a preference of 7-1/2% over the bid prices of competing
foreign contractors.
Disbursement
6.09      Disbursements (Annex 1, T-9) would be made on the basis of:
(a) 85% of total expenditures for civil works;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported
construction materials, furniture, equipment and vehicles,
or 85% of local expenditures if procured locally;
(c)  100% of foreign expenditures or 80% of local expenditures
for technical assistance and professional services;
(d) 75% of total expenditures for salaries and operating costs
of the PIU; and
(e) 100% refunding of the PPF advance disbursed and outstanding
at the project effective date.
6.10      All disbursements would be fully documented except for:  (a) work
executed by the PIU departmental force utilizing force account methods;
and (b) salaries and other operational expenses for project administration,
for which disbursements would be made against a certificate of expenditure,
documentation of which would not be submitted for review but would be retained
by the Borrower and made available for inspection by the Association in the
course of project supervision.
6.11      Auditing.  The PIU, a financially autonomous entity under the MOE's
sponsorship, would maintain separate accounts for all project activities in
conformity with national accounting practices. These accounts would be
controlled according to normal Government financial control procedures which
are satisfactory. The PIU would prepare an annual report summarizing the
financial situation of all project operations, which would be submitted to
the Association. In addition, the Government would make arrangements, satis-
factory to the Association, to have project accounts audited annually, in
particular for the work executed by the PIU departmental force utilizing force
account methods, and salaries and other operating expenses for project admin-
istration. This auditing would be performed in an objective and independent
manner by auditors acceptable to the Association, applying auditing procedures
satisfactory to the Association. Annual auditing reports would be submitted
to the Association within six months after the end of each Government fiscal
year.
VII. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
7.01      Through the strengthening of key services of the MOE, the second
education project would increase the efficiency of the education sector as a



- 34 -
whole and through the provision of new pilot technical schools and improvement
of existing technical education facilities, it would help increase the avail-
ability of middle level specialized manpower urgently needed for the country's
development.
7.02      The project would particularly assist in strengthening and improving
the MOE's planning, supervisory, curriculum development, institution building,
and implementation services at a critical time when a comprehensive reform of
the system is being developed. With the provision of equipment and vehicles,
this reform could better be surveyed, monitored and controlled (paras. 4.08
and 4.10). In addition, through the study of basic education (para. 4.08),
the Government could take stock of what has already been achieved at the first
level of the education system and draw the conclusions required for future
action.
7.03      The project would also assist in training specialized manpower in
key subsectors of the economy where their severe shortage jeopardizes develop-
ment projects. The total project output would be about 360 graduates per
year. Furthermore, the project would represent a major breakthrough in the
technical education system with pilot institutions gearing training to the
actual requirements of production and providing a model for the efficiency
oriented rationalization of structures, curricula and methods. As a conse-
quence a larger number of students could benefit from technical education and
recruitment of skilled worker trainees among C.O. students (para. 2.02) would
indirectly contribute to easing the social demand for general secondary
education. Limiting the number of technical education graduates allowed to be
admitted directly into the next higher level of training (para. 4.07(c)) would
have a number of advantages: It would ensure the availability of qualified
staff at the levels and in the specializations where they are needed and
thereby make manpower planning effective. It would also ensure valuable im-
mediate returns for the investment made by the Government on human resources.
The direct involvement of private and public employers in the operations of
the schools (para. 4.07(d)), the integration of pre-service training and
on-the-job upgrading for the staff of private and public agencies and local
communities (para. 4.07(e)), and the introduction of actual production-
oriented methods (para. 4.04) would guarantee an increase in external effi-
ciency.  In terms of technical teacher training, project schools would offer a
self-feeding system as prospective teachers would be selected among their best
graduates after reasonable on-the-job experience, and would be provided with
on-the-job pedagogical training in these schools. The common core of broad
general training prior to specialization, a basic feature of the proposed
curricula, would provide the opportunity to identify individuals' vocational
abilities better, increase students' motivation through diversification of
assignments and, above all, protect graduates against unemployment in case
their field of specialization should become temporarily saturated.
Risks
7.04      It is evident that the project entails a number of risks.  Among
them, the following are foreseen:
(a) A number of qualified national technical teachers might not
be available for service in the schools in time. The severe



- 35 -
shortage of technicians and engineers might provide them with
more attractive alternative employment opportunities; and
(b) The introduction of such innovative concepts as those on which
the project is based requires the services of a substantial
number of highly qualified specialists. Delays may occur in
recruiting a number of such specialists, resulting in some pro-
gram components being developed at a slower pace than others.
7.05      These risks have been taken into account in the design of the
project and the essential prerequisites are being met, namely the priority
attached to the project by the Goverament (para. 2.17); availability of
budgetary funds (para. 2.32); availability of expatriate teachers in case
all national teachers required would not be available in time (para. 4.06);
and prompt legislative/administrative action to introduce innovative curricula
(para. 2.18). The risks and benefits are to be closely monitored by the PIU,
the Planning Unit of the MOE, the BEPES and the BEET.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMIMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, the Goverament:
(a) Provided assurances that: (i) it will provide the Directorate
of Technical and Vocational Education, as and when needed,
with competent and experienced staff and the financial re-
sources required for the appropriate operation and development
of this subsector (para. 2.26); (ii) the staff and students of
the Mechanics Department of the ETS will be provided with ade-
quate accommodation, as and when needed (para. 4.04); (iii)
qualified expatriate teachers will be assigned by priority to
teach and provide pedagogical training to national teachers in
project schools until national teachers are available to fill
their positions (para. 4.06); (iv) ministerial instructions
establishing the regulations and programs referred to in
paragraph 4.07(a) through (c) and paragraphs 4.02 through 4.05,
respectively, will be issued by December 31, 1981 (para. 4.07);
(v) action will be taken by the Government so that, by
September 30, 1980, employers participate in the organization
and operation of technical education and vocational training
(para. 4.07); and (vi) a tracer and evaluation program will
be established in the MOE by September 30, 1982 and detailed
proposals concerning this program will be provided to the
Association for comments by December 31, 1981 (para. 4.13);
(b) Confirmed its intention to: (i) transfer the responsibility
for the SFW at Gitega from the Ministry of Public Works to
the MOE (para. 4.03); and (ii) prepare and send to the
Association for comments within six months from the Closing
Date, a report assessing the project, its implementation,
its outcome and the role played by the various agencies
involved in its execution (para. 4.13); and



- 36 -
(c) Confirmed the availability of sites for project institutions,
acceptable to the Association (para. 6.04).
8.02      The proposed project is recommended for an IDA Credit of US$15.0
million equivalent on standard IDA terms to the Republic of Burundi.

(General Note)
Modern Sector: Employment by Sector and Skill Level
Employment projections relate to the modern sector of the
economy, excluding private agriculture. However, as government employment
forms an integral part of the modern sector, employment in agricultural
services provided by the government is included in the projections under
public services, following the sectoral classification of the national
accounts.
The projections were established through an econometric model
on the basis of specified assumptions on productivity changes and the
growth rate of the various branches of the modern sector    projected
in the February 1979 revision of the 1979-83 Development Plan. The skill
levels have been defined as follows:
High Level: University education
Specialized manpower, Technical: One to four years of general secondary
education followed by one to four years of technical education.
Specialized manpower, General: Seven to eight years of general secondary
education or primary teacher training.
Unspecialized manpower: Literacy as a minimum.

.Source:   For 1978, Ministries of Education and Finance; 1983 and 1987, mission's projections.
Assumptions with regards to unit costs:
a) Teachers' salaries (wîthin the various levels of qualification) which were raised to comp-
ensate for inflation in the recent past, will be maintained at their real level of 1978.
b) The proportions of qualified teachers will increase at all levels of education.
c) Students:teacher (including administrative personnel) ratios will increase at all levels
of education.
d) Expenditures on teaching and learning material per student will increase rapidly in real
terms (they represent a very small proportion of total expenditures).
e) Boarding expenditures per student will remain unchanged in real terms.
Except for primary and general secondary education in the period 1979-83,where cost increases
for certain components are expected to outpace somewhat decreases for other components,for the
rest of the system these changes are expected to balance.
