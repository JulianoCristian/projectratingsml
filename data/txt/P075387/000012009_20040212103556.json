{"cdata!": "The purpose of the Education\n            Modernization Program is to support the Government through\n            the orientation of the educational system to the global\n            information society, in line with the Government's\n            e-Russia and e-Education Programs. The program is designed\n            to set up enabling conditions to assist with the system-wide\n            introduction, and enhanced use of Information and\n            Communication Technologies (ICT) in Russian general, and\n            initial vocational schools. This First Phase of the program\n            will support the program through the development of\n            sustainable capacity to produce high quality, affordable and\n            flexible learning materials; through the improvement of\n            pre-service, and in-service teacher training in the\n            introduction of ICT into classrooms; and, by establishing a\n            network of ICT resource centers in project regions. The\n            Learning Materials component would remedy the critical\n            shortfall in new-generation learning, by developing the\n            regulatory documents for materials, its development, and\n            use; developing, licensing, and distributing a range of\n            critical learning materials, to introduce a reusable object\n            oriented/constructivist design approach; and, by testing\n            materials that would focus on embedding ICT in teaching, and\n            learning practices. The second component - teacher training\n            in the educational use of ICT - will support the training of\n            teachers, and education managers in the use of ICT in\n            education, and, develop instructional design, and capacity\n            in learning materials production. The third component -\n            development of a network of interschool resource centers -\n            will support and promote regional and district interschool\n            resource centers, to provide services, and materials for\n            strategic planning in the effective use of ICT in education.\n            Additionally, teacher support and advisory services will be\n            promoted, as will dissemination in education practices, and\n            curriculum extension to isolated regions, supporting\n            selected distance education services. Community, and\n            industry access to training in ICT uses will be supported,\n            which includes computer maintenance in schools. Finally,\n            project management will be the responsibility of the\n            Ministry of Education Strategic Management Committee, who\n            will coordinate with Government authorities. The project\n            will finance capacity building to monitor implementation,\n            and, transparent and effective procurement, and disbursement practices."}, "docdt": "2004-01-20T00:00:00Z"}
