E-Learning Support\n            Project for Russia were as follows: outcomes were highly\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was highly satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also highly satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: in reform-oriented projects\n            it is important to support a set of complementary reforms\n            rather than focusing only on the most important individual\n            elements of reforms. The result is a far more comprehensive\n            impact. This project demonstrated that risks associated with\n            the need to put together and organize large numbers of\n            organizations and people with own practices and procedures\n            can only be done if new requirements for collaboration and\n            coordination among all elements in the system is developed\n            beforehand and systemically followed. This project also\n            proved that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)\n            in education is much more than installing computers and\n            buying software: these make just one element and could make\n            a systemic impact only if the content of learning, teaching\n            methods, forms, as well as the whole organization of\n            educational institutions into self-developing and\n            cooperating networks of innovative service institutions\n            could generate new quality and provide for achieving those\n            learning outcomes needed for the new knowledge and\n            information economy."}, "docdt": "2008-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
