Some lessons learned included: more thought\n            needs to be given to the general idea of 'exit'\n            strategies. The opportunity for 'exit' starts at\n            the design phase and continues by managing effective\n            transition strategies and assisting the Government to\n            transform such transitional arrangements into longer-term\n            capacity development and performance. Grant financing was\n            justified by the urgent need to restore a functioning health\n            sector, its strong development impact and as a means to draw\n            greater and broader support for the sector from other\n            development partners. It should be recognized that until\n            economic development takes off, the funding of the health\n            sector will continue to largely depend upon donor funding.\n            The present credit's sustainability cannot be ensured\n            solely by the government until there is substantial\n            macroeconomic development. Aspects of the project requiring\n            continuous funding (civil works/maintenance, training\n            medical personnel, and drug supplies) raise issues of\n            sustainability over the long run, in case of diminishing\n            support from donors. A shortage of health workers is a\n            perennial problem in most African countries, especially in\n            rural areas, and no satisfactory solutions have been found.\n            The exodus of skilled health workers during the civil war\n            exacerbated the problem in Sierra Leone. The country was\n            also not immune from the recruiting practices of developed countries."}, "docdt": "2010-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
