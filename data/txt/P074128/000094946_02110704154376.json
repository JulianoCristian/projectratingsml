Appropriate\n            design, sites and operation of sanitary landfills, leachate\n            treatment and control, and water quality testing will reduce\n            the risk of drinking water contamination. High temperature\n            incineration, installation of flue gas cleaning devices, air\n            quality testing, and non-incineration of materials\n            containing chlorine or heavy metals will prevent release of\n            pollutants into the air. Provision and ensuring the routine\n            use of protective clothing, staff training, and teaching\n            first aid will reduce the occurrence of occupational\n            hazards. Limiting access to disposal sites, fencing of\n            disposal sites, separating cells for medical wastes, and\n            sensitizing the public through the media, particularly\n            radio, television, posters, leaflets, newspapers, etc., will\n            minimize disease transmission. Furthermore, all health care\n            facilities will be equipped with appropriate equipment,\n            materials, and facilities for collecting, managing, and\n            transporting medical waste. Incinerators will be built and\n            adapted for use in health facilities. Infectious hospital\n            waste will be disposed of in sanitary landfills with set precautions."}, "docdt": "2002-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
