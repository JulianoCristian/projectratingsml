The project will achieve more specific\n            objectives through two components. The first component will\n            assist in restoring access to essential health services by:\n            a) improving primary and first referral health facilities in\n            four districts of the country; b) contributing to reducing\n            the burden of some of the most important infectious diseases\n            country-wide, by supporting Malaria and Tuberculosis control\n            activities and the Sanitation program; c) strengthening\n            health sector management capacity to improve efficiency and\n            further decentralize decision making to the districts. The\n            second component supports strengthening public and private\n            sector capacity by: a) improving the quality of services; b)\n            promoting development and regulation of the NGO sector,\n            strengthening the quality of care and enhancing the\n            contribution of the private sector; c) providing incentives\n            to the health providers to establish practices in rural\n            areas and smaller cities; d) contracting out clinical and\n            non-clinical services with the private sector; and e)\n            involving the civil society in decision making in health\n            administration and in health facilities. This project will\n            contribute to improve social conditions and alleviate\n            poverty conditions that persist after a prolong civil war."}, "docdt": "2003-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
