Soil erosion will occur, a major threat being\n            the flow of rainwater, and waste disposal of both solid, and\n            liquid wastes, creating water pollution. However, it is\n            expected that air pollution will improve following\n            construction, as a result of better traffic mobilization,\n            due to the diminished road traffic in favor of an improved\n            rail traffic, as well as adequate measures to accommodate\n            parking lots, and improve gas quality. Prior to\n            implementation, landowners, and residents should be\n            identified, ensuring adequate compensation, public awareness\n            campaigns should be conducted to inform on the consequences\n            of project works, and, bid document be revised to ensure\n            inclusion of environmental protection clauses. Mitigation\n            measures to be adopted during construction, and operation of\n            the project are: To diminish soil erosion, a waste\n            management plan will be established, to remove, dispose, and\n            treat wastes in an environmentally safe manner; Vegetation\n            will be planted on slopes to prevent further erosion, and\n            adequate drainage will be provided; Infiltration ditches\n            will capture silt, and pollutants; Adequate equipment, and\n            sound barriers will reduce noise, and dust pollution; and,\n            Safety measures will be enforced."}, "docdt": "2000-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
