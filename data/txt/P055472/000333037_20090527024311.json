"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Urban Mobility\n            Improvement Program Project for Senegal were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the challenging urban mobility needs of rapidly developing\n            urban centers in Sub-Saharan Africa require the\n            establishment of well-staffed and well-managed lead agency\n            to coordinate the activities of multiple stakeholders,\n            including the central Government. In sprawling urban centers\n            experiencing rapid growth of their population and increased\n            poverty, transport needs, and management of transport issues\n            can be very challenging in the face of weak capacity at the\n            central and local government levels and a mushrooming\n            informal transport sector. Fleets of old transport vehicles\n            compounded with lack of investment in the road\n            infrastructure are causes of poor quality of transport\n            services, congestion, increased road accidents and poor\n            safety of the road users. Having a dedicated agency able to\n            coordinate the needs of all the stakeholders in order to\n            improve urban mobility is a critical step in the right\n            direction for coordinating urban transport management, for\n            policy formulation and implementation, and for consensus\n            building among actors."}, "docdt": "2009-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
