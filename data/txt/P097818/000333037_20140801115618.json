Some lessons\n            learned included: government leadership with a focus on\n            results and impact is paramount in achieving expected impact\n            from technical assistance. Financiers and project\n            implementers should be aware that a strong and sustained\n            government commitment is a key in driving the development\n            agenda, especially where policy actions and incentives are\n            required. Knowledge of specialized sectors, such as emerging\n            RE technologies, sometimes hinders local entrepreneurs in\n            venturing into such businesses because of a lack of local\n            skilled labor. The approach of an entrepreneur incubator,\n            helping to develop business plans and feasibility studies in\n            addition to training local technicians and trainers at\n            institutions, could be instrumental equipping small and\n            medium start-up companies with the basic framework to\n            understand the business, and take advantage of local skills.\n            This is particularly important as small companies may not\n            have adequate financial capacity to invest in training of\n            their staff. Operations that target policy and institutional\n            development need to be addressed holistically, as lack of\n            one intervention could render the outputs of the support\n            activities not attaining the intended outcome. In addition,\n            lessons from this project also highlight the need for\n            realism with regard to what the project and other\n            complementary operations can directly influence."}, "docdt": "2014-07-30T00:00:00Z"}
