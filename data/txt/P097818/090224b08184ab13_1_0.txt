                         cheaper energy sources, reduction of system losses and increase in energy efficiency; energy diversification and strengthening the governance framework and the institutional
                         capacity to facilitate private sector participation in the sector. To advance these broad objectives, a new sector policy has been prepared and several laws which together define the
                         emerging sector structure and institutional framework - including GoR’s policy to increase private sector investments and off-grid electricity distribution.
