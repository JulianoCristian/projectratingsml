   1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

   1.1. Context at Appraisal

Economy
1.     Rwanda was ravaged by civil war and genocide in the early 1990s, followed by
border wars that finally ended in 2002-3. The domestic population had fluctuated
considerably due to genocide and migrations associated with conflict and was estimated
to be about 9.7 million (2007). Habitation patterns had also changed considerably –Kigali,
the capital city, had grown to close to 1 million, and new rural agglomerations known as
“Imidugudus” were emerging.

2.     Rwanda was largely an agricultural economy with small-holder farming and some
commercial agriculture (tea, coffee, which is being privatized). Agriculture accounted
for about thirty-five percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), though up to fifty percent
of the farmers did not effectively participate in the economy. The manufacturing sector
comprised a few enterprises in small-scale industry - agro-processing, brewery, textiles,
mining, sugar, and cement. In the aftermath of the genocide and associated conflicts
(1996-2000), real GDP grew at over ten percent per year as the economy recovered from
a low base. GDP growth was in the range of 4-6 percent during the period 2004-06. In
2007, GDP growth was about 7.9 percent driven by growth in the services and
manufacturing sectors while agricultural output expanded by just less than 1 percent due
mainly to poor weather conditions which also contributed to a 50 percent decline in
coffee output. Estimates were that the economy grew by 8.5 percent in 2008, fueled in
large part, by a strong recovery in agriculture, which grew by nearly 15 percent, with the
then ongoing expansion of the crop intensification program.

3.     Overall, the business environment was still weak, and specialized institutions to
support private sector development in the early stages of development. The pace of
reform increased during 2007-08 and this was reflected in the improvement in overall
ranking for Rwanda from 148 in 2007 to 139 in 2008 on the Doing Business Report.
Rwanda was also one of the ten fastest reforming countries among the 181 nations
scrutinized in the report. Infrastructure bottlenecks in the urban areas and limited access
in the rural areas still emerged as a significant constraint to continuing economic growth
and human capital development. In the 2008 Investment Climate Assessment survey
carried out by the World Bank, 340 Rwandan private enterprises identified Infrastructure,
or the lack of it, as the primary barrier to growth with the quality of Electricity,
Transportation and Telecom services all among the top 10 constraints.

Energy sector:

4.     At project preparation in 1998, most of the energy consumption was in the form of
wood fuels; the modern energy sector was very small – consisting of about 55 MW of
peak electricity demand on the national utility, Rwanda Electricity Corporation (RECO,
formerly Electrogaz), and about 182,000 cubic meters of oil products’ consumption. So
far, the majority of electricity supplies to Rwanda was generated from hydroelectric
power produced domestically and imports from Société Internationale des Pays des


                                            1
Grands Lacs (SINELAC) – an electricity company owned jointly by Burundi and the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – as well as from Société Nationale d'Electricité
(SNEL), the national electricity company in DRC. In addition to high inland transport
costs from Eldoret or even Mombasa, oil products imports were also subject to various
duties and taxes, so that on average, retail prices of petroleum products were about 100
percent higher than acquisition costs f.o.b. main supply sources (e.g., Arab Gulf markets).
Development of Rwanda’s energy resources – additional hydroelectricity, natural gas
dissolved in Lake Kivu, peat, geothermal, solar – has been constrained by small market
size, lack of financing and an inadequate institutional framework. RECO had only
approximately 110,000 customers and barely about 6 percent of the households had
access to electricity, almost entirely in the urban areas. Kigali alone accounted for about
two-thirds of the total number of customers and total demand of electricity.

Renewable energy development

5.     Renewable energy sources and technologies were still an untapped potential in
Rwanda. Although optimal utilization of locally available renewable energy resources
and efficient end-use would help Rwanda alleviate the supply gap and minimize its
dependency on costly fuel imports, the potential benefits for rural, non-grid areas
constituted the primary driver. Donor-driven projects and financing increased in this area
during the last decade but interventions remained scattered and largely outside of the
national energy planning process and government efforts had only recently taken off.
The level of local capacity in the area of renewable energy also remained low, both in the
public as well as private sectors. Solar irradiation is abundant but the Rwandan solar
market was very small and mainly limited to the ‘project’ market driven by donor
funding. Micro-hydro, after many years of neglect, had recently received considerable
attention in Rwanda and a number of projects were in pipeline. The use of traditional
fuels, such as biomass, was accelerated due to increased population and urbanization
reaching unsustainable levels, resulting in deforestation and soil deterioration.

Sector reforms had accelerated, though much remained to be done

6.     During the years following the energy crisis, progress was made in establishing the
legal and regulatory frameworks for the energy sector and safeguarding the rights of
consumers and a new breed of small-scale operators emerging in rural areas. A multi-
sectoral Rwanda Utility Regulatory Agency (RURA) was established and key staff was
recruited. RURA received start-up support through the International Development
Association (IDA) financed Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project
(CEDP) and the Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP) but had yet to gain
sufficient experience to fully carry out its mandate. New Electricity and Gas laws clearly
delineating the role of the private sector, the government, and the utility regulator were
expected to be approved by Parliament during 2009.

Rationale for Bank involvement

7.    As the largest donor in the sector, the World Bank (WB) was uniquely positioned
to support the Government of Rwanda (GoR) to build functioning energy markets for all


                                            2
the three renewable energy technologies (RETs), namely solar, hydro and biomass, and
integrate private sector actors by providing incentives and helping to establish regulatory
frameworks. The IDA project portfolio included the following: (i) The Urgent Electricity
Rehabilitation Project (UERP) (FY06): the UERP was instrumental in supporting the
sector turn-around. It funded key technical assistance (TA) support, such as the
preparation of the new Electricity and Gas laws, as well as investments to diversify
power generation resources and rehabilitate priority grid infrastructure including a new
main substation for the capital, Kigali; (ii) The Electricity Access Scale-up and Sector-
wide Approach Development Project (SWAp) (FY09): In 2008, the GoR designated, and
donors endorsed, the Bank’s role as the lead donor in the energy sector, as well as the
“donor representative” of the energy sector cluster. The Sector Working Group was
formalized in the signed Energy SWAp Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) dated
July 2008. Under this framework, the Bank assisted the GoR in preparing a National
Electricity Access Program (NEAP) to triple access to electricity services in four years;
(iii) A Poverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSG) Series (FY09): the PRSG Series
supports reform of the energy sector through policy dialogue; and (iv) Technical
assistance and transaction advisory support (FY08) for Nyabarongo hydro power plant,
and Lake Kivu methane gas.

Rationale for the GEF and AFREA involvement

8.    The involvement of the Global Environment Fund (GEF) and the Africa
Renewable Energy and Access Program (AFREA) 2 was highly complementary to the
Bank’s existing and planned energy portfolio as it facilitated the balancing of grid
extension activities with strategic and technical support to the emerging off-grid and
renewable energy (RE) sector, dominated by small and medium enterprise (SME)
operated schemes. The project would help the Government in mainstreaming renewable
energy development within the national Energy-SWAp, complementing the efforts made
on grid extension, through the IDA financed Electricity Access Scale-up and SWAp
Development project (EASSDP), to reach rural growth centers where grid connection is
not economically viable. In addition, the support was expected to be instrumental in
mainstreaming energy efficiency/DSM capacity within the electric and water utilities,
minimizing Rwanda’s costly dependence on thermal generation based on imported fuels.

9.    The main rationale for GEF support was to complement existing and on-going
investment in the RE sector, in a synergistic manner, by giving a special emphasis to
technical assistance (TA), which would contribute to the sustainability of the sector. The
GEF support aimed to bring together components that had been sparingly addressed in
national programs and other donor-funded programs, to help create a transparent base for
the private sector by establishing a regulatory framework that would provide clear
guidelines for investors as well as additional incentives involving temporary tax
refunds/subsidies.

10. Other ongoing initiatives that would complement/benefit the project included the
following:
           a. The Nordic Development Fund (€4.0 million) - This is parallel financing
              for the SEDP for the development of a commercial Solar Water Heater
              program.
           b. Support for Energy Small and Medium Enterprises (ESME) trust fund
              (US$3.50 million) - This parallel financing for the SEDP supports the
              scaling up of activities under SEDP, by in particular: (i) providing grants
              to help to buy down the capital cost of private sector led micro hydro
              projects, to enable the leveraging of funds from banks and investors; and
              (ii) providing matching grants to entrepreneurs for low cost modern off-
              grid lighting products.
           c. EnDev/GIZ PSP Hydro Program (€3.30 million) – This is a Dutch-
              German partnership with two components focusing on micro hydropower
              and biomass development. The micro hydropower component is aimed at
              creating new access to energy in rural areas by providing technical and
              business development assistance as well as co-financing for the
              development of micro hydro power projects. The program is designed to
              support the participation of private sector companies in the development
              and management of micro hydro sites (50kW-2MW).

              program (World Bank, Government of Netherlands, BTC, African
              Development Bank, BADEA, OFID, AFD, JICA and Saudi Fund) aimed
              at increasing connections to the national electricity grid. The program
              includes technical assistance and investments for grid reinforcement and
              extensions; energy efficiency; and household connections to the national
              electricity grid.

   1.2. Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
       approved)

11. Economic transformation to create employment and generate exports was one of
the three flagship programs called for in the GoR’s Economic Development and
Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS 2008-2012). Within this flagship program, a key
priority was to expand electricity access rapidly while also improving the quality and
lowering the cost of economic infrastructure – especially transport, power, and


                                           4
communications. The project was to contribute to achieving the GoR’s priorities by: (i)
providing incentives for private sector investment in renewable domestic power resources,
such as solar and hydro, for expanding access beyond the grid; (ii) increasing the
efficiency of biomass usage for household energy uses; and (iii) building capacity in the
area of utility and institutional DSM.

12. The overall goal of the project was to strengthen and consolidate the Rwandan RE
market. The GEO were to: (i) improve the policy and institutional framework of the
renewable energy and energy efficiency sub-sectors; and (ii) increase private sector
participation in the renewable energy sector.

13. The original GEO indicators were: (i) Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency
strategy study adopted by the Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA); (ii) Micro-Hydro
Feed-in and Bulk-purchase tariffs agreed with RECO and approved by RURA; (iii) Solar
PV dealers with field presence in at least one province outside Kigali offering sales and
maintenance services; (iv) Increase in number of staff employed in RE firms; and (v)
Avoided CO2 emissions.

      1.3. Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
          Indicators, and reasons/justification

14.     None

      1.4. Main Beneficiaries

15. The main beneficiaries of the project were: (i) The general populace of Rwanda
who benefitted from enhanced energy policies and increased private investments in the
renewable energy sector and biomass use efficiency; and (ii) Enterprises and
entrepreneurs of the RE sector benefitted from the new laws and regulations, which made
the Rwanda RE sector business friendly and more attractive.

      1.5. Original Components (as approved)

16. Component A: Strengthening of Renewable Energy policy, strategy and
management (US$3.5 million (GEF US$1.7 million, AFREA US$1.8 million)). The
objective of this component was to support the Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA)
to streamline and coordinate activities related to RE project design and implementation
including increased private sector participation in the process. This was to be achieved by
having the necessary operational guidelines. Activities under this component included:
(i) preparing the renewable energy policy and strategy; (ii) setting up the Lake Kivu
Monitoring Unit; (iii) conducting an Energy Entrepreneurship incubation program for RE
SMEs; and (iv) providing renewable energy advisory services and technical support.

17. Component B: Efficient utilization of biomass resources (US$1.4 million (GEF
US$0.9 million, AFREA US$0.5 million)). The objective of this component was to
increase efficiency in the use of biomass in order to reduce the unsustainable use of



                                            5
firewood and charcoal. It included activities focusing on increasing the use of improved
cook stoves and charcoaling efficiency.

18. Component C: Sustainable development of micro hydro resources (US$1.2
million (GEF US$0.9 million, AFREA US$0.3 million)). The objective of this
component was to enable private sector investment in micro-hydro power plants, by
addressing the following issues among others: (i) lack of access to credit from local
banking institutions; and (ii) lack of capacity to prepare detailed feasibility studies,
including clarity of tender procedures or other principles for identifying and selecting
investors. Proposed activities included: (i) private-sector led micro-hydro expansion; (ii)
technical assistance to ensure long-term sustainable operation of the existing micro-hydro
plants commissioned by the GoR; and (iii) establishing a micro-hydro helpdesk.

19. Component D: Solar Energy (US$1.55 million (GEF-US$0.35, AFREA-
US$1.20)). In this component, activities were aimed at increasing private sector capacity
in order to develop the market for solar systems in Rwanda, by: (i) developing national
installation and user guidelines for institutional PV applications; (ii) establishing
conducive frameworks and build capacity of local private firms to allow them to
participate in international tenders for the Rwandan market; and (iii) supporting the
development of a commercial Solar Home System (SHS) market for rural areas.

20. Component E: Energy efficiency (EE) strategy development (US$0.65 million
(GEF)). The activities of this subcomponent were aimed at reducing technical losses in
the electricity grid network and EE in major electricity users; and included three main
activities: (i) grid audit of the Energy Water and Sanitation Authority (EWSA) grid
network; (ii) EE audit of street lighting, water pumping facilities and public buildings;
and (iii) preparation of the EE policy that included actions to reduce energy use and
increase efficiency for the various electricity consumer categories.

   1.6. Revised Components

21. There were no significant changes in the components. An additional parallel
financing grant of US$3.5million, from the Energy Small and Medium Enterprises Trust
Fund, was provided to increase private sector participation in the Renewable Energy
Sector, specifically for micro-hydropower projects and low cost solar lighting products,

   1.7. Other significant changes

22. The official project closing date as set forth in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) is January 31, 2014. However, the closing date on the initial AFREA Grant
Agreement was December 2010 because of the Bank’s policy that the Grant Agreement
cannot be in force beyond the period of the Parent Trust Fund. As AFREA, the parent
trust fund, was extended and funds replenished, the closing date of the AFREA Grant was
extended as follows:




                                            6
   •   1st extension closing date: from 31 December 2010 for 21 months to 30
       September 2012.
   •   2nd extension closing date: from 30 September 2012 for 2 months to 30
       November 2012.
   •   3rd extension closing date: from 30 November 2012 for 14 months to 31 January
       2014.

23. It should be noted that, even with these extensions, project implementation never
went beyond the official project closing date at approval of January 31, 2014.

   2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

   2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

24. This project was prepared as a 4-year Specific Investment Loan (SIL) financed by
GEF and AFREA. Taking into consideration lessons from previous energy projects in
Rwanda, two basic principles guided project preparation: ensuring the readiness of
stakeholders for the project as well as simplicity of design and implementation. However,
due to the different processing timelines between the AFREA TF and the GEF, the
implementation of activities did not begin simultaneously. Additionally, the AFREA
TF’s closing date had to be extended several times, due to administrative reasons, as
highlighted in paragraph 22 above.

25. The project was designed to help the Government in mainstreaming renewable
energy development within the national Energy-SWAp, and complemented the grid
extension efforts financed by the Electricity Access Scale-up and SWAp Development
project (EASSDP) and other initiatives as highlighted in paragraph 10. The project
emphasized technical assistance (TA) that would contribute to the long-term
sustainability of the RE sector with a focus on accelerating the integration of local private
sector into the planning and implementation of renewable energy projects.

26. Project design incorporated best practices of similar projects in Rwanda and
internationally, such as GEF supported projects in Uganda and Sri Lanka, the Global
Village Energy Partnership (GVEP), and lessons gathered from the RE Toolkit
(www.worldbank.org/retoolkit). Several of the project components were designed taking
into account regional experience, most notably: (i) PV Solar experience in Kenya and
Tanzania, which highlighted the important role of the private sector in driving
development, and the need to: (a) increase focus on the policy setting and dialogue with
stakeholders, and (b) use flexible market driven approaches to work with the private
sector; and (ii) Biomass experience in Tanzania, where there had been limited impact in
terms of access to improved cook stoves because of the top-down approach.
Incorporating these key lessons and taking into account the Rwanda country context and
priorities have contributed greatly to attaining satisfactory outcomes.

27. Project preparation benefited from ongoing projects and leveraged similar
activities by other donors, in particular (i) the USAID-financed study to design a program


                                             7
for the promotion of efficient cook stoves; (ii) the Belgian Cooperation’s work on health
facility service delivery; (iii) the GTZ-Micro Hydro project and the work on the National
biomass strategy (BEST, 2008); and a number of upstream studies financed from the
UERP. This approach has enhanced the achievement of the PDO especially increasing
private sector participation in micro-hydro development and increasing the uptake of
improved cook-stoves.

28. The commitment of Government, donors and other stakeholders was ensured as
this project supported the joint Government and Donor SWAp, monitored by the Sector
Working group as per a signed MoU between the main stakeholders. The project was
complementary to the grid extension investments funded within the NEAP and helped
streamline and harmonize many dispersed renewable energy activities, thus further
leveraging the government’s available funding for RE. Moreover, the GoR agreed to
provide counterpart funding and other donors committed co-financing for investment
activities related to the project.

29. The quality at entry of the project was rated good by the Quality at Entry Review
meeting, and two issues in particular merit highlighting: (i) the mix of funding and
associated governing arrangements created a mismatch with the closing dates of the
grants requiring three closing date extensions, this affected the procurement and
execution of some of the activities, though ultimately this was well-managed and the
original project closing date was maintained; and (ii) the project design included many
components which could have made implementation complex, however, the design
provisioned enough resources and tailored the arrangements to manage each component
adequately. A degree of complexity could not have been avoided as the design responded
genuinely to the need of the GoR to develop a comprehensive RE and EE regulatory
framework and enable private sector participation in several sub sectors (solar, micro
hydro, biomass and energy efficiency) which were in a very early stage of development.

Assessment of Risks

30. Several risk factors were assessed and mitigation measures considered. The
relevance of risks identified at appraisal and effectiveness of mitigation measures is
summarized in the table below.

   2.2. Implementation

31. Overall Project Implementation. The project was complementary to the grid
extension investments, other initiatives by Government and other Donors, and was aimed
at assisting in streamlining and harmonizing the many other dispersed renewable energy
activities to further leverage the government’s available funding for RE. Key factors that
affected project implementation are summarized below.

32. Initial Delays related to lack of capacity at the PIU. There were implementation
delays during the initial stages of the project implementation, mainly due to the delay in
recruiting the project coordinator and the staff not being familiar with Bank procurement
guidelines. This situation led to delays in preparing the assignment activities ToRs and in
the recruitment of consultants to undertake various activities. Key staff to supervise the
project activities was eventually recruited by end June 2011.

33. Findings of the Mid-term Review (MTR). The MTR conducted in June 2012
concluded that most of the activities had substantially progressed and were expected to be
completed by end 2013, within the project closing date of January 31, 2014. The MTR
also noted the following:

   (i) Due to the late start of some of the components supported by the Africa
       Renewable Energy and Access program (AFREA) Trust Fund, some of the
       activities financed by the Trust Fund (TF), would not be completed by its closing
       date of September 30, 2012 and recommended extension of the AFREA TF
       closing date to coincide with the GEF supported activities.

   (ii) Project implementation was impacted by the change in the institutional set-up.
       Initially, the project was expected to be anchored in a Ministry of Energy
       department, which was later transferred to the newly created Energy Water and
       Sanitation Authority (EWSA), starting July 2011. The Bank missions noted that
       the EWSA human resources to support the biomass, solar and micro hydro
       subsectors were overstretched and that activities were not being mainstreamed in
       the respective EWSA department/sections, which led to delays in implementation
       in addition to posing a sustainability risk after project closure. In addition, as the
       operationalizing of the EWSA Law (enacted in January 2011) took root, effective
       July 2011, the change in the MININFRA/EWSA structure led to overlaps between
       policy setting at the MININFRA and the implementation function at the EWSA.
       This resulted in a weakened coordinated approach to various activities, which
       posed challenges to the integration and promotion of the participation of the
       private sector in the RE activities as well as to the adoption of needed policies to
       support RE development.

   (iii) In view of the above sustainability risk, the project Implementation Status and
       Results Report (ISR) DO rating was downgraded to moderately satisfactory in
       2011, with an action plan to improve performance.




                                            10
   2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

34. The performance indicators covered both institutional development related to the
management of the sector, as well as project outcomes and outputs, mainly studies and
plans, in light of the TA nature of the project. The results framework could have been
more robust, if more clear linkages had been made between the GEO, outcome indicators
and the components/outputs. Further, as required by the GEF, the results framework
included a specific indicator on avoidance of CO2 emissions, even though this indicator
could not be used directly to measure the attainment of the GEO.

35. The data identified in the M&E plan was regularly collected by the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) and was used to monitor progress. The evaluations informed
decision making, for example, after approval of the Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff
(REFIT) in 2012, the continuous monitoring of the number of micro hydro projects in the
pipeline to reach financial close led to the revision of REFIT in 2014.

36. The GEO indicator, avoided CO2 emissions, was not monitored during
implementation, as it was difficult to attribute a direct reduction of CO2 emissions to
specific activities, during the project timeframe. During the ICR elaboration, it was
possible to assess the CO2 emissions reduction only in relation to Component 2: Efficient
utilization of biomass resources, based on the impact survey of the awareness raising
campaign.

   2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

37. Although the project did not include investment components, guidance provided
under this technical assistance project could have resulted in certain downstream risks
(for example, promoting micro-hydro project with potential environmental and social
implications, or some adverse environmental implications due to the “industrialization”
of efficient stoves and kilns). In light of these potential downstream risks, the project was
rated Category B under the World Bank Policy on Environmental Assessment (OP4.01),
requiring a partial Environmental Assessment (EA).

38. The Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) which had already been adopted for the UERP was updated to
provide guidelines on how to avoid, manage or mitigate potential adverse impacts under
this project. In addition, an updated Environmental Management Framework (EMF) was
prepared for the micro-hydro sub-projects. By project closing, none of the activities
supported by the project triggered any undertakings under the EMF provisions related to
preparation of Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) in the event of land or any other asset
acquisition.




                                             11
Procurement
39. Overall procurement processes were rated satisfactory. Procurement training
provided to the PIU procurement staff during the initial years of implementation and
continued hand holding by the Bank team during the project implementation period
enhanced the procurement staff’s capacity. As a result, despite a slow start in preparation
of procurement documents (ToR, EoI, RfP), the PIU performed it procurement functions
well.

Financial Management (FM)

40. From a fiduciary perspective, FM arrangements under the project were
implemented in an adequate manner and maintained throughout the life of the project.
The audits of the implementing agency and project financial statements were submitted
on a regular basis. Overall, financial management systems were considered moderately
satisfactory.

   2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41. The project has been instrumental in strengthening and consolidating the RE
market in Rwanda by supporting several activities related to the energy policy, strategy
and management. As a result of the project supported activities and policy actions
adopted by GoR, a number of private firms are participating in the Rwanda renewable
energy market, and, several follow-on and new operations/activities have been developed
as highlighted in the following paragraphs.

42. Component A. Strengthening of Renewable Energy Policy and Strategy: The
activity proposed eighteen framework strategy programs in order to ensure a long-term
and sustainable contribution by RE resources to Rwanda’s energy balance. The findings
and recommendations were incorporated in the Energy Sector Strategy.

43. Component B. Biomass: The sustainable and efficient use of biomass resources
remains a priority of the GoR in the medium-term. The latest Economic Development
and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS II) for the period 2013/18 notes that over
eighty-five percent Rwanda’s primary cooking energy source comes from biomass
(illustrating the need for sustainable, safe and efficient usage) and includes interventions
related to: (i) ensuring a sustainable supply of wood; and (ii) promotion of the use of
improved energy efficient cooking stoves among others. EWSA and MININFRA will
engage other stakeholders, such as the Private Sector Foundation and local government
authorities to support sustainable use of fuel wood, increased uptake of charcoaling
techniques and an enhanced charcoal value supply chain by linking charcoal producers to
transporters and wholesalers.

44. Component C. Sustainable Development of Micro Hydro Resources: Following
on the assessments conducted during the project, EWSA and MININFRA is undertaking
an evaluation of about 69 potential micro hydro sites for possible development in the next
two years. Contracts for the development of the various sites were at different stages by


                                            12
project close. In addition, and with the support of the IFC, RURA is preparing light
regulations, including standardized Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), that are
expected to provide a conducive regulatory environment for the development and
operations of micro hydropower plants. The Russian Trust Fund for Energy Small and
Medium Enterprise development in Sub-Saharan Africa (ESME TF) will further support
the Incubation Program (Component A4) by funding private developers of micro-
hydropower projects and building up the capacity of the local stakeholders in the pico-
hydro sector. ESME TF will support about 5 private sector companies to develop sites
whose combined generation capacity is estimated at 4MW.

45. Component D. Solar Energy: The ongoing Bank-funded Increased Access to
Electricity Project (P111567) will use the standards developed during the project to
support the installation of Solar PV systems in selected health institutions. In the case of
Solar Water Heater (SWH), additional parallel financing from the Nordic Development
Fund (NDF) equivalent to Euro 4.0 million would support the installation of up to 11,500
SWH systems, over and above the current 623 systems, by end 2015.

46. Component E. Energy efficiency Strategy Development: As a follow up to the
assessment of the EWSA grid technical audit conducted during the project, EWSA set up
a committee to review the recommendations and prepare an investment plan to reduce
losses in the system, with various actions to be undertaken in the short-medium and long-
term. In addition, EWSA is already implementing several energy efficiency initiatives
related to the rational and efficient use of grid electricity, such as public awareness on
energy saving in homes and workplaces through good housekeeping methods.

   3. Assessment of Outcomes
   3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

47. The PDOs remain fully relevant to Rwanda’s development priorities and are
consistent with the EDPRS as well as the Bank Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).
Current GoR’s sector objectives focus on: reducing the cost of electricity and introducing
cost reflective tariffs through the use of cheaper energy sources, reducing system losses,
and increasing energy efficiency; energy diversification; and strengthening the
governance framework and the institutional capacity to facilitate private sector
participation in the sector. To help achieve these broad objectives, a new sector policy
and several laws have been prepared. These regulatory instruments define the emerging
sector structure and institutional framework, including GoR’s policy to increase private
sector investments and off-grid electricity distribution. The objectives were clearly linked
to the results framework outcomes and indicators (some of them had a direct impact on
the EDPRS) as the policy support actions were aligned with the different components of
the project.

48. The project design followed a participatory process. The choice of technology
options (solar, biomass, and hydro) and the work at the policy level remain priority areas



                                            13
for the country as the current strategy is to tap into these renewable energy sources for
further development of the electricity sector in Rwanda.

49. The implementation of the SEDP has played a supportive role in the development
of RE and EE markets in Rwanda. The project provided timely support to the ongoing
development of the sector, particularly activities related to legal, policy, and regulatory
frameworks as well as capacity building. Thus, the project addressed critical issues
related to RE and EE development as well as provided assistance to put in place a policy
framework to support future investment and the start-up of RE entrepreneurs. The project
also leveraged GoR’s and other donors’ funding to attract private investment.

   3.2. Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

50. The achievement of the Global Environmental Objectives is rated Satisfactory.
The GEOs: improving the policy and institutional framework of the renewable energy
(RE) and energy efficiency subsectors and increasing private sector participation in the
renewable energy sectors are linked. Progress in achieving the first objective lays the
foundation for achieving the second objective, i.e. improving the policy and institutional
framework of the RE subsector will encourage the participation of the private sector in
that subsector. As such, some of the project outputs indirectly support both project
objectives.

51. The project efficiently supported activities related to strengthening the legal and
regulatory frameworks for both RE and EE by, among other things, supporting the
development of guidelines and recommendations for a RE and EE strategy to govern the
sector for the next 10 years, and the adoption of the renewable energy feed-in tariff.
These actions created an enabling environment for private sector participation. Though
the project did not directly support physical investments, it helped put in place the needed
institutional and regulatory framework and capacity within the government. The project
reinforced the preparation of pre-investment analysis, such as the EWSA grid audits, all
of which provide the requisite environment for sector development and increased private
sector participation. Four (4) of the five (5) GEO indicators were fully or partially
achieved.

52. The project, complemented by other initiatives highlighted in paragraph 10,
supported investment promotion and capacity building for the private sector of both RE
and EE in the country. As a result, a number of private firms are participating in the
Rwanda RE market, for example: (i) several micro-hydro sites are being developed
(4.5MW under construction, whereas additional sites totaling about 5MW are at various
stages of feasibility and financial close); (ii) ten (10) local firms had been registered as
eligible participating firms for the Solar Rwanda program and about 450 SWH systems
had been installed, with an estimated capacity of 1,200m2, translating into an annual
energy saving of about 400MWh. The results show that the project contributed
significantly to strengthening and consolidating the RE and EE market in Rwanda. The
specific achievements can be disaggregated as follows (according to the GEO indicators):



                                            14
GEO Indicator 1: RE and EE strategy study adopted by MININFRA

53. The project helped MININFRA and EWSA to streamline and coordinate activities
related to the RE and EE strategy by: (i) supporting the development of operational
guidelines for project design and implementation; and (ii) integrating the private sector in
the process. The project outputs included preparation of a RE policy and strategy which
covered solar, hydro, geothermal and wind technologies. Based on the findings and
recommendations of the study, and timely technical assistance, MININFRA has prepared
a new sector policy which seeks to integrate renewable energy and energy efficiency
activities in sector development.

GEO Indicator 2: Micro-Hydro Feed-in and Bulk-purchase tariffs agreed with RECO and
approved by RURA

54. The project provided transparent market regulation and guidelines to facilitate
small distributed power production and distribution services, while building local private
sector capacity that can plan, design, implement and operate the small power plants. For
the specific case of micro-hydro power generation, GoR has put in place various
incentives to attract private sector, among which include, Renewable Energy Feed-in
tariff and light handed regulations including standardized Power Purchase Agreements
(PPAs) that will ease the regulatory requirements for the development and operations of
micro hydropower plants.

GEO Indicator 3: Solar PV Dealers with field presence in at least one province outside
Kigali offering sales and maintenance services

55.    The project developed guidelines for installation and use of institutional PV
systems and promoted the establishment of solar PV suppliers and dealers networks
outside the capital city of Kigali. The PV Solar Market assessment conducted during the
project indicated that there were eleven distribution outlets present in the major towns
outside Kigali. In addition to the market analysis, other outputs of the TA include: (i)
capacity building/technical assistance to private PV companies/technicians and technical
schools; (ii) creation of a Solar Association; and (iii) promotion of solar equipment and
improved organization of the distribution sector. Building on the TA outputs, the ESME
TF is supporting scale up of (iii) above by: (i) building linkages between companies
selling high quality equipment, trained and qualified technicians, and consumer groups
and possible other stakeholders, and (ii) raising the awareness of the public and media
about the quality of solar systems to complement the private sector’s activities.

GEO Indicator 4: Increase in number of staff employed in RE firms

56. The project promoted the concept of business incubation program in the RE sector
by financing a practical oriented short course on “Entrepreneurs Skill & Renewable
Energy Development” to local energy entrepreneurs facilitated by Kigali Institute of
Science and Technology (KIST). Results of the surveys conducted in December 2013
indicate that about forty-five enterprises are now involved in RE Business (Solar, Pico
and Micro hydro) and sixty-nine are involved in the biomass efficient utilization related


                                            15
businesses (improved cook stoves, biogas and efficient charcoaling). The survey results
also indicated that the above enterprises employ about 1,460 personnel, a number well
above the project target of 75.

57.    The increased private sector participation in the renewable energy business was
complemented by efforts, financed by other donors, to reach rural growth centers, among
which are: (i) GIZ’s Private Sector Participation in Micro-hydro Power Supply for Rural
Development project (PSP Hydro) which is aimed at creating new access to energy in
rural areas by providing technical and business development assistance as well as co-
financing the development of micro hydro power projects promoted by private
developers, and (ii) GIZ/GoR National Domestic Biomass program which supports
setting up of institutional biogas digesters and improved cook stoves for households and
institutions including training of trainers.

GEO Indicator 5: Avoided CO2 emissions

58.    Various project activities were implemented to promote RE and EE regulatory
actions and investments, which resulted in an avoidance of CO2 emissions when
compared with the more pollutant energy sources on the ground at the time.. Even though
the impacts of some of the components were difficult to unequivocally quantify in terms
of avoided CO2 emissions, all of them had a positive impact with respect to this indicator.
Avoided CO2 emissions by project closing are estimated at 0.560 mtonsCO2 equivalent
(attributed to the use of SWHs instead of grid electricity and efficiency from Improved
Cook Stoves (ICSs)). An additional 8.20mtonsCO2 equivalent will be avoided when the
4.5MW of micro hydro power plants are commissioned that were under construction by
project close.

   3.3. Efficiency
Rating: High

59. The efficiency assessment of the project is rated as High when assessed either
qualitatively or quantitatively.

60. Qualitatively, the project outcome is deemed efficient based on the following
outcomes: (i) the set targets at project design were achieved (Four (4) of the five (5) of
the GEO indicators were fully or partially achieved) within the project time frame (time
efficiency) and within the allocated budget without any cost overruns; and (ii) the project
facilitated the establishment of a conducive policy and regulatory environment for
increased investment and uptake of renewable energy technologies. The project has
facilitated approximately 9.5MW from several micro-hydro sites, which are at different
stages; an annual energy saving of about 400MWh from the installed SWHs, saving in
biomass of about 30-39% by using ICSs, and 30% of wood savings by using improved
carbonization techniques.

61.     The project did not lend itself to conventional economic and financial analyses as
it was not a typical investment project, but mainly provided TA. The benefits are indirect
and mainly as a result of guaranteeing the operations of already installed capacity. The


                                            16
PAD (Annex 9) prepared “with and without” GEF Project case to show and demonstrate
how barriers to renewable energy use would be removed using GEF funds. By fully
integrating renewable energy into all project activities, it was expected that the project
would result in a considerable expansion of the solar, micro-hydro, and improved stoves
markets. In total, use of renewable energy sources was estimated to reduce CO2
emissions by an estimated 0.63 million tons over the lifetime of the equipment installed
whereas overall the project would reduce CO2 emissions by an estimated 0.646 million
tons. Using the incremental costs analysis between the ‘with scenario’ and the ‘without
scenario’, the efficiency of the project has been quantitatively assessed depending on the
characteristics and outcomes of each component (details in Annex 3). A summary is
highlighted in the table below.

                    Table 2: Efficiency indicators per component
Component
Component 1:                   N/A. This component provided support to develop RE in
Strengthening of RE            the electricity sector of the country. The impact of policy
policy strategy and            and strategy is viewed as indirect and not easily
management                     measured but it is a necessary platform for the success of
                               the other components. The environmental benefits are
                               also indirect since this component focuses on soft
                               technical aspects rather than direct investments. By
                               providing O&M guidelines, standards and quality
                               regulations, this component enabled private sector entry
                               to the RE market and facilitated the presence of
                               competent local firms

   3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

62. The project is rated overall as Satisfactory, based on the above ratings of
relevance, achievement of GEOs, and efficiency.

    3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development 3
63. Because of the relationship between power supply, economic development and
poverty alleviation, as stated in the EDPRS and the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS),
the project intended to contribute to the reduction of poverty by leveraging limited
available public resources for the development of the RE sector through increasing
private sector participation. In addition, by supporting RE development and increased EE,
the project advanced the country’s longer term green growth strategy.

64. The biomass component had significant social and poverty-related impacts by
improving living conditions for users through the increased use of improved cook stoves
as well as by sustaining local jobs linked to the manufacturing of this technology. Visible
benefits include a high reduction of smoke in kitchens as well as savings in fuel wood
and charcoal purchasing. This is an important step in the government’s poverty reduction
strategy, particularly in rural areas, where it is most visible.

65. The micro hydro resources component focused on the promotion of private sector
participation in the power sector of rural areas, which, at the implementation stage, could
have a huge poverty impact and socio-economic development in areas where there is no
access to electricity.

66. The solar energy component, particularly the development of commercial SHS
market for rural areas and the SWH program, also focused on job creation and economic
development in rural areas.

67. The project indirectly supported vulnerable groups that include women and
children as most of the rural households rely on biomass energy to meet their cooking
and thermal needs.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
68. The project has provided several useful outputs for strengthening the Rwandan RE
and EE sector, both for the public sector (ministry, regulator and utility) and for the
private sector (project developers, commercial lenders, and service providers), including
several strategies, codes and regulatory proposals.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

69. The project assessments and policy actions initiated thereby are now being used as
to guide the development of the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) Rwanda program.

   4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

70. The overall Risk to Development Outcome is rated as Moderate taking into
consideration the strong ownership of the project and financial, social and institutional
aspects. The GoR’s commitment to a private sector presence in the country’s energy
sector is strong. GoR has recently initiated several actions to promote increased private
sector participation which include unbundling and corporatization of the utility (EWSA),
into separate electricity and water companies to ensure improved financial sustainability
of sector and reduced perceived risk by the private sector. Other ongoing/post project
undertakings also assure the project sustainability, among which are (i) regular review of
the feed-in tariff, (ii) GoR commitment to scale up use of ICSs and alternative energy
sources such as biogas digesters, and (iii) increased private sector participation in micro
hydropower development, low cost solar lighting products and other renewable energy
business, as detailed in paragraphs 42 to 46.

   5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

    5.1. Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71. The development objectives were realistic, the design was appropriate to achieve
these objectives, and the project had a high relevance for the government’s rural energy
strategy. In addition, the Bank provided adequate resources, in terms of staff weeks and
budget, to ensure quality preparation and appraisal work and maintained a good working
relationship with the Borrower.

72. However, there were also a few shortcomings in project preparation which were to
impact later project implementation. While ‘slow implementation due to weak sector
institutions’ was anticipated in the PAD as one of the critical risks, steps were not taken
during project preparation, to strengthen institutional capacity, which led to a slow start
of implementation. A more advanced stage of procurement activities during project
preparation would have enabled start of activities once the project was declared effective.
Also, the economic and financial analysis at project appraisal was not comprehensive
enough to provide a sound basis to assess the efficiency of the project activities.

73.     Taking into consideration the above mentioned, the World Bank’s quality at Entry
is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

74. The project was thoroughly supervised by a stable Bank team, with multi-
disciplinary skills, and without significant changes in team composition throughout
implementation. Supervision teams were supported by specialists to address specific


                                            19
issues which had been identified. At the project’s early stage, the start-up of activities
was considerably slower than planned. The Bank had intensive discussion with
MININFRA to identify the causes: (i) limited capacity built within MININFRA to
prepare the necessary terms of references for the studies; and (ii) unclear distribution of
responsibilities between RECO (later on taken over to EWSA) and MININFRA with
regard to procurement and general management of the project work stream. The quality
and frequency of supervision missions have been of a high standard, due in part to the
team being based in the country office. Issues which could affect project implementation
were identified in a timely manner, documented, and brought to the attention of
management. Numerous extensions of the AFREA Trust Fund closing date and
additional parallel financing from ESME Trust Fund reflected the Bank’s flexibility in
responding to changing circumstances.

75. Procurement was regularly monitored, including post-reviews conducted as part of
the supervision missions’ activities. Financial Management supervision was satisfactory
and the adequacy of financial management arrangements and implementation of
recommendations of external audits were reviewed regularly. The project prepared a
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and ESMF and supervision included
environmental and social due diligence, though none of the identified applicable probable
policies were triggered during implementation. The quality and candor of supervision
reports were good, including reporting on the outcome indicators.

76. Taking into consideration the abovementioned aspects, the Bank’s quality of
supervision is rated as Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

77. The ICR rates the Bank’s overall performance as Satisfactory. The Bank’s pro-
activity during supervision buttressed the PIU’s weak capacity, which overall led to
project being completed on time and on budget.

   5.2. Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

78. The high level of GoR’s commitment to the project is seen in its policy to increase
private sector investment in RE. Several laws and policies have been approved that
together define the emerging sector structure and institutional framework, including the
GoR’s policy to increase private sector investment, primarily in generation and off-grid
electricity distribution with a number of signed MoUs for investments. Other key
initiatives included: (i) adoption of feed-in tariffs, and (ii) unbundling and corporatization
of the utility (EWSA), into separate electricity and water companies to ensure improved
financial sustainability of the sector.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                             20
79. The performance of the implementation agency is considered Moderately
Satisfactory, especially during implementation of the project. There were delays at the
outset in the recruitment of the project coordinator and a lack of clear responsibilities
within MININFRA in coordinating the various components, which led to a slow start of
the project implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

80. The overall Borrower Performance is rated Satisfactory based on the GoR’s
strong and sustained commitment throughout implementation to expand RE supply by
increasing private sector participation. Despite implementation weaknesses that led to
delays in project implementation, government commitment to the development objectives
has been sustained and has played an important role in initiating the development of the
country’s renewable energy potential.

   6. Lessons Learned

81. Government leadership with a focus on results and impact is paramount in
achieving expected impact from technical assistance. Financiers and project
implementers should be aware that a strong and sustained government commitment is key
in driving the development agenda, especially where policy actions and incentives are
required. In the case of this project, Government followed up and acted on the several
recommendations that were the outcomes of assessments under the project, such as the
renewable energy tariff and light handed regulations including standardized PPAs. These
regulations have greatly reduced the transactions cost for micro hydro developers by
shortening the time required to negotiate PPAs and having forehand information about
the price of the generated energy.

82. Realism in project funding from multiple donors co-financing the project. Task
team leaders preparing projects with multiple sources of financing need to structure the
project in such a manner that takes into account the different administrative procedures
governing funding so as to optimize and leverage financing and minimize the risks of
mismatches in the funding of project activities. As highlighted in the ICR, the AFREA
funds could not be utilized prior to formal Board approval of the project and its
effectiveness and the TF had to be extended several times to enable completion of
activities. A lesson from this project was the need to have ensured that either the funds
from AFREA were considered as parallel financing instead of co-financing, funding
complementary components. The co-financing with GEF, posed a risk, that in the event
the AFREA TF was not extended, the intended outcomes could not have been attained
due to the partial completion of the activities or could have led project restructuring to
cover the funding gap, whereas in the case of parallel financing the GEF operation could
have continued, albeit the reduced targeted impact.




                                           21
83. An Incubation Program is a useful approach to build up local capacity of private
companies. Knowledge of specialized sectors, such as emerging RE technologies,
sometimes hinders local entrepreneurs in venturing into such businesses because of a lack
of local skilled labor. The approach of an entrepreneur incubator, helping to develop
business plans and feasibility studies in addition to training local technicians and trainers
at institutions, could be instrumental equipping small and medium start-up companies
with the basic framework to understand the business, and take advantage of local skills.
This is particularly important as small companies may not have adequate financial
capacity to invest in training of their staff.

84. Using Public resources in awareness raising and promotion campaign is a key
tool in promoting increased uptake of new products especially those offered by small and
medium businesses. Use of Improved Cook Stoves (ICS) has a huge impact, but in most
cases the end users may not be aware of such products. In addition, the ESMEs that
would take lead in availing these products to households in rural areas do not have
adequate finances to undertake the requisite awareness and marketing campaigns. Thus
using public funding to facilitate the private sector led market development by supporting
activities related to awareness could greatly enhance the uptake of technologies.

85. Balancing the project complexity/number of activities with project impact.
Operations that target policy and institutional development need to be addressed
holistically, as lack of one intervention could render the outputs of the support activities
not attaining the intended outcome. In addition, lessons from this project also highlight
the need for realism with regard to what the project and other complementary operations
can directly influence. By undertaking specific actions, such as assessment of the biomass
use, including training and the incubator program as well as awareness campaigns, all
complemented each other to increase the uptake of ICS. On the other hand, the
assessments, the incubator program, the complementary support from GIZ, having in
place the feed-in tariff and light handed regulation though having contributed to
initiating the micro-hydro market, have not reduced the feasibility study risk due to the
lack of detailed information about the resource (historical hydrological data).

                          Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1. Component A: Strengthening of Renewable Energy policy, strategy and
management (US$3.50 million. (GEF US$1.7, AFREA-US$1.80)). The objective of
this component was to support the Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA) to streamline
and coordinate activities related to Renewable Energy (RE) project design and
implementation including increased private sector participation in the process. This was
to be achieved by having the necessary operational guidelines. Activities undertaken
under this component included: (i) preparation of the RE policy and strategy; (ii) setting
up of the Lake Kivu Monitoring Unit; and (iiii) incubation program for RE SMEs; and
(iv) renewable energy advisory services and technical support.

   (i) A1: Policy and strategy development (MININFRA) - The Project supported
       several just-in-time support activities related to energy policy, strategy and
       management among which include: (i) due diligence of feasibility studies and
       project proposals; (ii) energy policy review; (iii) geothermal development
       preparatory activities; and (iv) preparation of the energy investor forum. The
       Advisory and Support has enabled the sector (MININFRA and the EWSA) to take
       informed decisions related to policy actions, project promotion and private sector
       engagement. This support is envisaged to continue as discussions and
       development of specific investments evolves further, especially in the sub-sectors
       of geothermal and micro hydro, in addition to continued general policy and
       targeted increased private investments in the sector.

   (ii) A2: Strategy study - The objective of preparing the RE Policy and Strategy was to
        assist the Ministry of Infrastructure in developing a set of renewable energy
        strategies in order to ensure a long-term and sustainable contribution by
        renewable energy technologies to Rwanda’s energy balance. The project
        supported Renewable Energy strategy studies which focused on solar, hydro,
        geothermal and wind technologies and a final report was submitted July, 2012.
        The RE strategy includes 18 framework strategy programs and investment plan
        recommendations and project investment needs in the next 5 years. The studies
        and recommendations thereof support the sub-component objective to pursue
        sustainably the development of RE resources.

   (iii)A3: Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), support for project implementation - The
        project supported the design and implementation of a comprehensive M&E
        framework Renewable Energy projects under implementation to facilitate
        monitoring of the development and project objectives. An M&E unit was set-up
        and closely collected data that was used to monitor progress as well inform
        decision making. Key indicators that were monitored during the project
        implementation include: (i) solar PV Dealers offering sales and maintenance
        services; (ii) RE firms and number of staff employed by these firms; and (iii)
        households use of improved stoves (both urban and rural). In addition, a number
        of baseline and follow-up surveys were undertaken among which are: (i) Urban



                                           24
       and Rural Households Using Improved Cook Stoves Baseline survey (undertaken
       in 2010) and Impact Survey December 2013; (ii) Firms involved in RE business
       (January 2014); (iii) Biomass use in Rural and Urban Areas (2012). The results
       of the findings were used to inform decision making such as: (i) the Biomass
       survey use indicated that a majority of households (92% of the surveyed
       households) use wood or its derivatives for cooking; and that biomass is still the
       most affordable source of thermal energy relative to the alternatives. Following
       the results of survey, a study of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) market in
       Rwanda was launched to help inform the possible interventions to promote LPG
       increased use, as an alternative source of thermal fuel for cooking.

   (iv) In addition to the M&E, the project supported the setting up of the Lake Kivu
        Monitoring Unit whose objective was to have in place a unit responsible for for
        scientific and environmental monitoring of the Gas extraction activities on Lake
        Kivu, including measurements of the lake density gradients that would provide
        information and data to enable development of the methane resource. The project
        supported activities related to the setting up of the unit such as laboratory
        equipment, technical assistance, capacity building and funding to arrange
        stakeholder workshops. The Unit has been set-up and to date has mainly focused
        on the near-plant monitoring to check the impact of the re-injected water,
        established a baseline around future extracting plants in addition to developing a
        website (www.lakekivu.org) that is used to share important information on the
        lake. The unit has now been integrated into the recently established Lake Kivu
        Basin Authority, which will help assure the sustainability and scale up of the unit
        set up under the project.

   (v) A4: Incubation program for RE SMEs - The objective of conducting an incubation
       program was to assist entrepreneurs involved in the development of micro hydro,
       biomass, photovoltaic, and energy efficiency activities to prepare business plans,
       maintenance, and operational procedures.

2. Component B: Efficient utilization of biomass resources (US$1.40 million. (GEF-
US$0.90, AFREA-US$0.50)). The objective of this component was to increase
efficiency in the use of biomass in order to reduce the unsustainable use of firewood and
charcoal. It included activities focusing on increased use of improved cook stoves and
charcoaling efficiency. The activities supported by the project include the following: (i)
Biomass utilization survey in urban and rural areas; (ii) Enhancing charcoaling efficiency
in key districts in three Province (Southern, Western and Northern Provinces); (iii)
Promotion Campaign for Improved Cook Stoves; (iii) Study on LPG Market in Rwanda;
(iv) The outcome/impact of the Improved Cook Stove campaigns in Rwanda; and (v)
Improved Cook Stoves Market Development.

       (i) B1: Improved Cook stoves: This subcomponent supported activities aimed at
           promoting the use of improved stoves and development of a sustainable
           market for efficient stove designs that reduce charcoal use. The implemented
           activities include the following:



                                           25
   •   Biomass utilization survey urban / rural area: the survey objective was to
       establish baseline information on the use of different sources of fuel, in
       particular fuel for cooking, plus the type of stoves used by the households.
       The survey was completed March 2012 and highlighted the following: (i)
       92% of the surveyed households use wood or its derivatives for cooking;
       and (ii) biomass is still the most affordable source of thermal energy
       relative to the alternatives. Following the results of the biomass utilization
       survey, a study of the LPG market in Rwanda was launched to help guide
       possible interventions to promote LPG increased use, as an alternative
       source of thermal fuel.

   •   Promotion Campaigns for Improved Cook Stoves (ICS): The promotion
       campaigns were completed in July, 2013. The key findings of the survey
       conducted December 2013 show that ICS use in Urban and Rural areas
       was about 82 and 48 percent respectively. The survey covered 1,107
       households (905-Urban and 202 rural). The activities undertaken under
       the project supplemented earlier GoR initiatives that included testing and
       selection of suitable improved cook stoves models that could be promoted
       for increased use in urban and rural areas.

   •   Improved Cook Stoves Market Development: The objective of this activity
       was to improve access to - and sustained use of - ICS through market led
       production and distribution, with the aim to increase demand and
       strengthen the supply chain: “last mile retailing system”. The activities
       undertaken in 10 selected districts included support to establishment of a
       retailing system: (i) (recruitment and training of mobilisers and installers);
       (ii) establishment of supply chains between producers and retailing
       cooperatives, mobilisers, and installers; and (iii) increased collaboration
       with District and Sector administrations for community mobilization and
       awareness. Through the approach of the engagement of retailers such as
       cooperatives, social networks, commercial retailers; uptake and selling of
       stoves increased in the selected districts. In a period of four (4) months
       during which the activities were undertaken: (i) production significantly
       increased from about 150 stoves per district per month to about 630 stoves
       per district per month; (ii) about half (48%) of the total production is fired
       and with sales of about 79% of the fired stoves.

(ii) B2: Value Chain Analysis and Transformation:            This subcomponent
     supported activities aimed at increased biomass efficiency and supported
     activities related to charcoaling techniques through popularization of
     improved charcoal production / carbonization techniques in the main zones of
     charcoal production. The project supported training and capacity building in
     charcoal making in 36 districts and helped individuals involved in charcoal
     making to form groups/associations. The activities’ outputs include: (i)
     trained charcoal producers reported a saving of about 30% of wood by using


                                    26
           improved carbonization techniques; (ii) 40 Charcoal producers’ cooperatives
           have been created, organized and are operational; and (iii) efficient tree
           cutting, charcoal making and transport permit system is implemented
           according to the guidelines provided by relevant Ministries. To ensure
           sustainability after project closure, EWSA and MININFRA propose to engage
           other stakeholders, such as the Private Sector Foundation and Local
           Government Authorities to support sustainable use of fuel wood, increased
           uptake of charcoaling techniques and enhanced charcoal value supply chain
           by linking charcoal producers to transporters and wholesalers.

3. Component C: Sustainable development of micro hydro resources (US$1.55
million. (GEF-US$0.35, AFREA-US$1.20)). The objective of this component was to
addresses a number of issues for speeding up the private sector’s investment in micro-
hydro mainly related to: (i) lack of access to credit from local banking institutions; and
(ii) lack of capacity to prepare detailed feasibility studies, including clear tender
procedures or other principles for identifying and selecting investors. Several activities
were undertaken to support the development of transparent market regulations and
guidelines while building local private sector capacity that can plan, design, implement
and operate the micro hydro power plants.

   (i) C1. Private-sector led micro-hydro expansion – The activities under this
       subcomponent were aimed at addressing a number of issues for speeding up the
       private sector’s investment in micro-hydro. The assessment of micro-hydro cross
       cutting issues was completed in July, 2011 which highlighted that, whereas the
       legal framework supports the participation of the private sector, there were still
       significant barriers to increased participation of the private sector in the
       development of micro-hydro in Rwanda. These barriers were mainly the non-
       cost-reflective tariffs, high costs, unfavorable loan conditions and limited
       capacities in both public institutions and private companies. Follow-up
       undertakings to address the identified issues included the adoption of Feed-in
       tariff and Light handed regulation: A Renewable feed-in tariff was adopted in
       February 2012. With the support of the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
       RURA has prepared light handed regulations including standardized Power
       Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that will ease the regulatory requirements for the
       development and operations of micro hydropower plants.

   (ii) C2. Sustainable micro-hydro - This component was aimed at improving the
        sustainability of the government-owned micro-hydro schemes beyond the
        construction phase and to leverage these investments by providing technical
        assistance to prepare business plans, maintenance and operational arrangements to
        ensure a long-term sustainable operation of these facilities on a private or Public-
        Private basis; including training of developers and project promoters to increase
        the domestic capacity to develop, construct, operate and maintain hydro schemes.
        Several assessments were undertaken aimed at creating an inventory and technical
        evaluation of existing facilities to facilitate the potential to transfer these to the
        private sector. These assessments highlighted the following: (i) the assets were



                                             27
       financially viable and could thus attract private sector investments; and (ii) the
       power plants have been consistently performing with good generation figures and
       annual plant load factor, though the plants have not been operated to the best
       standards in terms of operations & maintenance (O&M) practices. In addition, the
       assessments made recommendations related to: (i) renovation and modernization
       of the various plants, which could be undertaken on a Public Private Partnership
       (PPP) basis; (ii) preparation of a sector policy to address issues related to the
       ownership structure, private sector participation and management of state-owned
       generation assets. By project closing, MININFRA/EWSA had started the process
       of bidding out some of the existing plants to private operators on a concession
       basis (operations and maintenance). In addition to the project undertakings, other
       sector activities to address related issues included: (i) the Private Sector Project,
       supported by GIZ, has assisted private Rwandan SMEs by providing technical and
       business development assistance as well as co-financing for the development of
       some plants; and (ii) under the Bank Managed Trust fund for Energy Small and
       Medium Enterprises (ESME) there is technical support to assist the private sector
       micro-hydro developers to access the local credit market in addition to supporting
       them to develop business plans and project appraisal. Also, under the ESME,
       there has been engagement with the financial sector in Rwanda (commercial
       banks and other lenders) to encourage and support them to participate in RE
       financing. The engagement has focused on educating and training to help them to
       understand the business of lending for energy projects, including supporting the
       development of specific energy loan portfolios.

   (iii)C3: Micro-hydro helpdesk - This subcomponent was aimed at putting in place
        technical support to sustain operations and maintenance of micro hydro plants. In
        addition to the assessments undertaken related to the operations and maintenance
        of micro hydropower plants, a database of skilled personnel in the installation,
        commissioning and plants operations has been created (under the activities
        conducted in the incubation program-component A4), and it is expected that it
        will be regularly updated by EWSA.

4. The initiatives undertaken during the project implementation, in addition to the
assessments highlighted above and the incubation program, are expected to lead to an
increase in private sector participation in the development of micro-hydro power plants in
Rwanda over the next two years. By project closing, a number of private firms were
involved in the development of several micro-hydro sites (4.5MW under construction,
while additional sites, totaling about 5MW, were at various stages of feasibility studies
and financial closure).

5. Component D: Solar Energy (US$0.65 million-GEF) – The activities in this
component were aimed at supporting increased private sector capacity in order to develop
the market for solar systems in Rwanda. This would be accomplished by three core
measures: (i) developing national installation and user guidelines for institutional PV
applications, (ii) building capacity and conducive frameworks to allow local private firms




                                            28
to participate in international tendering for the Rwandan market, and (iii) supporting the
development of a commercial SHS (Solar Home System) market for rural areas.

   (i) D1: Solar PV for Public institutions - To improve the long-term sustainability of
       Solar PV systems in public institutions, the activities under this subcomponent
       supported the development designs, installation and user guidelines for PV
       applications in public institutions, as well as a framework for coordination among
       relevant Ministries. Prior to the development of the guidelines, a PV-sector
       capacity assessment was undertaken in order to evaluate the electricity needs in
       the rural public institutions, such as the administrative offices of districts and
       sectors, hospitals, health centers and primary and secondary schools. The
       assessment evaluated the use of solar photovoltaic systems and highlighted past
       experience in terms of technical aspects, procurement processes, implementation
       plans, and commissioning and post commissioning services. Key
       recommendations of the guidelines included: (i) user ministries to mainstream
       assessment of the respective institutions energy needs; (ii) quality assurance; and
       (iii) having in place an operations and maintenance plan to ensure that, once the
       systems are installed, they are operated in accordance with capacity loading,
       including regular maintenance and having adequate budget for replacement of the
       components.

   (ii) D2 Private-led PV for rural electrification - the activities under this
        subcomponent were aimed at promoting the private sector to engage in rural
        markets for PV systems by supporting existing companies to enable them to build
        rural distribution channels and outlets. Activities related to the development of
        solar PV market included: (i) Capacity building/Technical Assistance among
        private PV companies/technicians and technical schools; (ii) PV solar study and
        market analysis; (iii) Creation of a Solar Association; and (iv) Promotion of solar
        equipment and improved organization of the distribution sector. Overall,
        assessments highlighted that most companies already have developed their own
        distribution channels and noted the need to raise awareness about the quality of
        solar systems and to complement their activities. Support activities implemented
        under the ESME include: (i) building linkages between companies selling high
        quality equipment, trained and qualified technicians, and consumer groups and
        possible other stakeholders, and (ii) public and media awareness campaign.

   (iii)D3: Solar Water Heater (SWH) - Under this subcomponent, the Solar Water
        Heater (SWH) Program was implemented. This activity aimed at supporting the
        development of a commercially viable SWH sector in Rwanda by providing
        catalytic investment subsidies necessary to get the hot water program off the
        ground. The activities manly comprised: (i) technical Assistance for establishing
        the technical, financial and institutional set up; and design for the establishment of
        a subsidy scheme and (ii) implementation of the subsidy scheme (US$300 for
        SWHs, with capacities ranging from 120 to 250 liters and US$450 for SWHs with
        a capacity of 250 liters or more) and a credit, repayable over 24 months, (US$600
        to US$900 depending on the capacity of the system). The activities undertaken



                                             29
            under this component, including public awareness campaigns, have supported the
            creation of linkages between the private sector (suppliers of SWHs, either
            manufacturers or importers (or both) with networks of installers) and the
            beneficiaries (households) who are customers of EWSA, with the public sector
            (EWSA) providing the grants. By project closing, ten (10) local firms had been
            registered as eligible participating firms and about 450 systems had been installed,
            with an estimated capacity of 1,200 m2, translating into an annual energy saving
            of about 400 MWh 4.

6. Component E: Energy efficiency strategy development (US$1.92 million.
US$0.80 million from IDA). The activities of this subcomponent were aimed at
reducing technical losses in the utility and improving energy efficiency in major
electricity users. It included the following activities: (i) grid audit of the EWSA grid
network; (ii) energy efficiency audit of street lighting, water pumping facilities and
public buildings; and (iii) preparation of an Energy Efficiency Policy that included
actions to reduce/increase energy use efficiency for the various electricity consumer
categories. These actions covered: (i) promotion and use of more efficient equipment;
(ii) equipment labelling; (iii) awareness creation; (iv) energy auditing and financing; (v)
adopting minimum energy standards for new buildings and retrofits where possible for
existing buildings; and (vi) energy efficiency act.

                     Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Component B. Efficient utilization of biomass resources

1.    The objective of this component was the promotion of improved cook stoves (ICS)
in the Kigali area. Therefore, the analysis carried out below takes into account the
increased number of households in the Kigali area that use ICS which is an indirect result
of the awareness and promotion campaign conducted under this component. The
economic and financial analysis has been conducted based on the increase in the use of
ICS and associated fuel savings.

2.    Surveys conducted in 2012 and 2014 to measure the increased use of ICS found out
that the number of households using ICS in Kigali area increased from 40% to 82%
which represents 88,956 new households using ICS.

                             Use of Improved Cook Stoves (ICS)
                              Baseline                           2013
Kigali City                   40% (84,720 HH)                    82% (173,676 HH)

3.    The surveys noted that in Kigali, the main fuel used for cooking is charcoal at 65%
followed by fuel wood by 32%. The average annual consumption stands at about 1,891
Kg for fuelwood, while charcoal consumption stands at 771 kg per household and year.
On average, Kigali City households and the other largest urban towns’ households
consume 1 bag and a half of charcoal; therefore, they spend at least Rwf 10,500
(considering the price of one bag at Rwf 7,000). For firewood, the average amount spent
per month in the largest towns is Rwf 6,409.

4.   The project conducted a Controlled Cooking Test (CCT) to evaluate the savings in
fuelwood and charcoal in conditions as close to actual cooking conditions as possible.
The results of this test is shown in Table A3-1 below and indicates that the firewood
savings for an improved mud stove (the most commonly used in urban areas among
firewood improved stoves) is 39.6% and the charcoal savings for an improved metal
charcoal stove - single pot (the most commonly used in urban areas among charcoal
improved stoves) is 30%.

5.    The economic analysis of the technology has been done taking into consideration
the investment cost of ICS, the annual fuel savings, and a conservative expected ICS’
lifetime (one year for improved mud cook stove and two years for improved metal
charcoal stove - single pot). The IRR is above 900% for the improved fuelwood cook
stove and above 120% for the improved charcoal cook stove. Tables A3-2 and A3-3
summarizes these calculations.

Financial analysis

6.  The financial analysis has been done taking into consideration the budget for the
component (US$3.95 million) spent on the awareness and promotion campaign and



                                            31
assuming that 30% of the new households using ICS can be attributed to the awareness
raising campaign of the project 5. Table A3-4 summarizes the financial results of the
campaign based on the above considerations. The cash flow yield an economic net
present value (NPV) of US$ 6,200,000 and an EIRR of 25.9%.

CO2 emissions savings

7.    Considering that when burned, one kg of traditional wood emits 1,560 CO2
emissions g 6, the annual emissions savings of each type of ICS in Rwanda is shown in
the table below:

    CO2 emission savings charcoal cookstove (kg)                                              360.8
    CO2 emission savings fuelwood cookstove (kg)                                            1,150.5

8.   Considering the same number of new ICS installed, as a result of the awareness
campaign for the project as explained in the previous section, the total tons of CO2
emissions saved every year are about 16,084.

9.      The calculation is shown in the table A3-5.

   Since late 80s the GoR began distributing cook stoves and from that time initiatives have been implemented in the country (SNV,
CARE, Practical Action, etc.).

Component C: Sustainable development of micro hydro resources

10. By project closing, several micro-hydro sites where either under construction, at
feasibility stage, or at financial closure. All these sites had an overall installed capacity
of 9.5 MW. To calculate the efficiency of this component, we have considered that these
sites would provide electricity in areas where the population had no access to electricity
and also the Feed in Tariff (FiT) for small hydro power approved by the GoR. The
analysis compared the cost of electricity based on small hydro power with the cost of a
diesel generator, which would be the alternative generation source to having access to
electricity. With these assumptions, an average FiT for the small hydro sites is estimated
at US$0.10/kWh. In contrast, diesel gensets’ cost of generation in Rwanda is estimated
at US$0.25/kWh 7 , which means a 60% of economic savings for the consumers
benefitting the small hydropower generation systems.

11. Considering a capacity factor of the small hydro power plants of 40%, the annual
electricity generation of all the power plants assessed under this component is 33,288
MWh. Therefore, the annual savings for the consumer with respect to diesel generation
are US$ 4,993,200 if all small hydro power plants were installed.

Component D. Solar Energy

12. This component included a promotion program of SWH for Households (HH)
where a subsidy and a soft loan were offered to applicants for the installation of either
SWH of 200 or 300 liters.

Economically viability of Solar Water Heaters (SWH)

13. Solar Water Heaters (SWH) are economically viable compared to the use of
electricity to heat water. The IRR is above 20% in the two cases analyzed of 200 and 300
liters. For the case of the model of 300 liters, the return is almost 40%. The economic
indicators shown in Tables A3-5 and A3-6 give a payback period of 3 years for the model
200 liters and 2 years for the model 300 liters.

Financial analysis of SWH under the Promotion Program

14. The promotion program provided conditional financing (subsidy and soft loan) for
the purchase and installation of SWH of two sizes, 200 and 300 liters. These sizes were
designed for household use.

15. The financial analysis has been done taking into consideration the financing terms
of the subsidy and soft loan, the lifespan of the equipment, and the electricity savings of
heating water through solar energy instead of electricity.

      Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Relevance of Project

1.    This project proposed to mainstream renewable energy within the national energy
planning process and support renewable energy market development, which is still a
priority for the GoR. Of particular and immediate interest to the government is the
development three Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs): solar and hydro resources
minimizing the need for diesel fired thermal generation, as well as improving the
efficiency of the use of traditional fuels. These renewable energy sources and
technologies are still an untapped potential in Rwanda. Although optimal utilization of
locally available renewable energy resources and efficient end-use could help Rwanda
alleviates the current supply gap and minimizes its dependency on costly fuel imports, the
rural areas that will not be reached by the central grid that could greatly benefit in the
short-medium term. Donor-driven projects and financing have increased in this area
during the last decade but interventions remain scattered and largely outside of the
national energy planning process and government efforts have only recently taken off.
The level of local capacity in the area of renewable energy also remains low both in the
public as well as private sector.

2.    The challenge for all three RETs is to find sustainable solutions that fit the
Rwandan context and will operate under local conditions. Solar irradiation is abundant
but the Rwandan solar market is very small and mainly limited to the ‘project’ market
driven by donor funding. Micro-hydro, after many years of neglect, has recently received
considerable attention in Rwanda and a number of projects are in pipeline.

3.    The use of traditional fuels, such as biomass, has accelerated due to increased
population and urbanization reaching unsustainable levels, with deforestation and soil
deterioration as a result. The task at hand is to build functioning energy markets for all
three RETs integrating private sector actors at an optimal extent by providing incentives
and regulatory frameworks.

Evaluation of Outputs

4.     The Project achieved the following:
     (i)    The Energy Policy and Strategic study was prepared and a National
            Renewable Energy Strategic Plan is now in place.
     (ii)   The Lake Kivu Monitoring unit was set up and is now functioning as a cost
            and revenue center, to ensure sustainability of their work.
     (iii) 120 Entrepreneurs in RE were been trained in Entrepreneurship in areas of
            Biomass, Hydropower, Solar Energy and Energy Efficiency.
     (iv)   82% of households are using improved cook-stoves in the Kigali area
            comparatively to 70% expected from the impact of the Project activities.
     (v)    1,080 charcoal makers from 36 sectors were been trained on the improved
            carbonization techniques and 40 Charcoal producers’ cooperatives were been
            created, organized, operational and registered at sector level.
     (vi)   Installation and user guidelines for Solar PVs in public institutions approved.


                                            45
   (vii)  A full curriculum of basic solar training was prepared and made available to
          the trainers. Four sets of high quality training equipment were purchased and
          handed over to EWSA and the training institutions. Business training modules
          were created and over 60 technicians participated in business support courses
          to enable them to better run their businesses. In all, more than 100 technicians
          received training as part of the “Technical Assistance and Advisory Services
          for Solar PV Market Development Project”.
   (viii) Market creation of Solar Water Heater in Rwanda. Program designed for
          11,500 installations in individual households by December 2015. As of end
          January 2014, about 623 SWH systems had been installed.
   (ix)   The investment plan based on the electrical national grid energy loss audit was
          approved and MININFRA/EWSA is mobilizing resources for its
          implementation.
   (x)    The national building code integrates energy efficiency elements is approved.
          It is used to plan a technical assistance and implementation feasibility.

Major Lessons learnt

   (i) On the onset of project effectiveness, implementation of Project Procurement plan
       in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was not possible due to the delay in
       project effectiveness and some earlier anticipated activities had already been
       implemented using other sources of funding. In future there is need to be realistic
       with regard to the implementation timelines so as to respond to the needs of the
       borrower

   (ii) The Project Focal Point was appointed six months after the Project effectiveness.
        In addition, other key MININFRA and EWSA staff had other responsibilities in
        addition to the project activities, which led to an initial delay in the
        implementation of a number of project activities. A fully dedicated team at the
        MININFRA and EWSA would have enabled speeding up the project
        implementation. To avoid delays in future, it is proposed to set as Project
        effectiveness condition the Project implementation team in place to avoid delays
        in project implementation.

Follow up Actions

           (i) The findings and recommendation from assessment of the performance of
                the existing micro hydro power plants is in the process of being
                implemented.
           (ii) The EWSA Commercial Department and Energy Efficiency Unit, with the
                available financing from NDF, shall continue with the implementation of
                the SWH Program.
           (iii)The approved Energy Efficiency Strategy has been taken over by EWSA
                Energy Efficiency Unit for implementation.
           (iv) The MININFRA and EWSA shall continue mobilizing funds to implement
                the loss reduction investments.
