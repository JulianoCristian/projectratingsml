                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has been key in strengthening and consolidating the Renewable Energy Market in Rwanda by supporting several activities related to the Energy Policy, Strategy and
                         Management which have enabled the sector (MININFRA and the EWSA) to take informed decisions as related to policy actions, investments promotion and private sector
                         engagement. As a result of the project supported activities and policy actions adopted by GoR; a number of private firms are participating in the Rwanda Renewable energy market
                         among which are: (i) development of several micro-hydro sites (4.5MW under construction, whereas additional sites totaling about 5MW are at various stages of feasibility and
                         financial close); (ii) ten (10) firms are participating in the SolarRwanda program (installation of Solar Water heaters) and, at September 2013, had installed about 355 systems;
