This\n            environmental assessment (EA) document evaluated impacts, as\n            follows : loss of vegetation; erosion. sedimentation, loss\n            of fertile soils, wildlife and biodiversity; lack of urban\n            storm water sewerage and solid waste disposal facilities;\n            unregulated dumping of wastes; choice and location of power\n            systems and infrastructure; Rwanda's administrative,\n            legislative and regulatory framework policies on the\n            environment, and applicability of the Bank's safeguards\n            policies : OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment; OD 4.20\n            Indigenous Peoples( may apply); OP 4.12 Involuntary\n            Resettlement; inefficient enforcement of environmental\n            regulations; hydrology; irrigation water requirements;\n            handling, transportation and storage of fuel and lubricants;\n            noise levels and air quality; technical assistance and\n            institutional strengthening required for Electrogaz, the\n            project implementing agency; training requirements;\n            employment opportunities; social services and\n            infrastructure. As a result of this assessment the EA\n            suggest mitigations measures, including : an Environment\n            Advisor will hired to monitor as stated in the cleared EMP,\n            during construction and installation, the activities of the\n            contractors to ensure that the works are being carried out\n            as stated in the approved designs; review of technical and\n            environmental specifications, before the generators are\n            shipped to Rwanda; contract documents will include details\n            of all mitigation measures; final design that does not\n            comply with the requirements of the environmental laws of\n            Rwanda and the requirements of the Bank safeguards policies\n            will not be approved by Rwanda Environmental Management\n            Authority (REMA); monitor air quality and alert communities\n            when air quality is poor and could damage their health;\n            ensure safe and reliable road transportation of fuel;\n            provide site staff with suitable safe clothing, shoes and\n            health protection equipment; minimize dust propagation by\n            spraying water on roads adjacent to construction sites;\n            trucks carrying soil, sand and gravel will be duly covered\n            to avoid spilling; low emission construction equipment and\n            vehicles will used; litter, fuels, oil drums, used\n            cartridges will be collected and disposed properly;\n            encourage contractors to hire local workers as much as\n            possible; contractors must clean sites or areas contaminated\n            from spillages and leakages; source backfill material and\n            sand must be taken from approved locations; enforce regular\n            inspections of all piping systems from storage to\n            generators; select land for transmission  and distribution\n            (T&D) network grids, and expansion of substations to\n            house new generators, which will not impact Project Affected\n            Peoples PAPs)'s economic resources; recommend changes\n            in to system designs to protect ecosystems at risk; promote\n            peaceful resolutions to land disputes; develop a plan for\n            technical assistance and institutional strengthening for\n            participating project implementing agencies; and finally,\n            promote information campaigns with community members and\n            project affected peoples (PAPs) on environment best\n            practices throughout implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "2012-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
