                         2. The project's disbursements as of May 2013 are US$2.58 (AFREA) and US$1.74 million (GEF) equivalent to about 68% and 39%, respectively, of the grant amounts. The low
                         disbursement related to the GEF Trust is a result of the longer than anticipated procurement process. The disbursements are expected to improve in the next quarter as all of the
                         contracts financed by the trust fund have now been signed.

                         The project still remains relevant as evidenced from the GoR’s sector objectives related to reducing the cost of electricity and introduction of cost reflective tariffs through use of
                         cheaper energy sources, reduction of system losses and increase in energy efficiency; energy diversification and strengthening the governance framework and the institutional
                         capacity to facilitate private sector participation in the sector. To advance these broad objectives, a new sector policy has been prepared and several laws which together define the
                         emerging sector structure and institutional framework - including GoR’s policy to increase private sector investments and off-grid electricity distribution.
