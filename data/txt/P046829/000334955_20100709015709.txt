I    IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.                    I
    About this Report
           The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
    first, to ensure the integrity of the Banks self-evaluationprocess and to verify that the Banks work is producingthe
    expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and proceduresthrough the
    dissemination of lessons drawn from experience.As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
    the Banks lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
    that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
    which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
    important lessons.
           To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files'and other
    documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
    and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
    in local offices as appropriate.
           Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
    internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
    relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
    the document that is sent to the Banks Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
    the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

    About the IEGWB Rating System
          IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
     lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
     arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
     (additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
          Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
    be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
     relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
    objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
    sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
    Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
    the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
    were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
    extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
    and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
    operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
    Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
          Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
    expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
    Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
          Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
    operation and supported effective implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
    transitioh arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
    achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
    Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
    Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
          Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
    agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
    agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
    performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
    Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
    unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on the China Renewable
Energy Development Project. This project was financed through IBRD Loan No. 44880
in the amount of US$13 million, and eo-financing of Trust Fund No. 22642 in the amount
of US$27.0 million from the Global Environment Facility. The loan was approved on
June 8, 1999. The signature of the legal agreements was delayed until June 26,2001 , by
which time the project had been restructured and downscaled. The project became
effective on December 2 1, 200 1, and closed one year after the originally scheduled
closing date on June 30,2008. The loan was 99.5 percent disbursed.

This PPAR was based on a review of project documents, including the Implementation
Completion Report (Report No. ICR0000880), the Project Appraisal Document (Report
No. 18479-CHA), loan documents, mid-term review reports and other project files, as
well as discussions held with Bank staff involved in the project. An Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) mission visited China in April 2009 to discuss the project's
development effectiveness with the government, the project implementing agencies,
research institutes, semi-nomadic households, and other stakeholders. Their cooperation
and assistance are gratefully acknowledged.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to government
officials and agencies for their review, but no comments were received.

Summary
As the Chinese Government increased its commitment to the development of renewable
energy in the 1990s, the World Bank began collaboration with the government to expand
and accelerate the development of electricity generation based on renewable resources.
These partnership efforts between China and the World Bank led to the China Renewable
Energy Development Project (REDP), which was approved by the World Bank on June
8, 1999. REDP was among the first instances of international assistance to China aimed
at accelerating the commercialization of renewable power generation. REDP also marked
the beginning of a long-term programmatic approach that the Bank has adopted to create
the enabling environment, build capacity, mobilize resources and catalyze investments in
the renewable energy sector in China.

The signing of the legal documents of the REDP was delayed by two years because the
restructuring of China's power sector subsequent to appraisal created difficulties for
reaching power purchase agreements. Since the original targets were no longer viable, the
project was restructured by cancelling three wind farms under the wind power
component. The restructuring was approved by the Board on an absence of objection
basis. The legal documents were signed on June 26,2001, and the project became
effective on December 2 1,200 1, two and one half years after approval of the original
project.

As a result of the restructuring, the wind power component of the project was reduced
from 190 megawatts (MW) to 21 MW. The World Bank's financing was reduced from
US$lOO million to US$13 million, the Global Environment Facility grant from US$35
million to US$27 million, and the total project cost from US$445 million to US$205
million. The loan and grant were 99.5 percent disbursed. Due to considerably expanded
local counterpart investments, the actual project cost was $3 17.27 million. The project
was completed on June 30, 2008, one year after the originally scheduled closing date.

The project development objective (PDO) was to establish sustainable markets for wind
and photovoltaic (PV) energy technologies in order to: (a) supply electricity in an
environmentally sustainable manner; and (b) increase access of isolated rural populations
to electricity services. The global environment objectives (GEOs) were to: (a) reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by producing electricity from renewable energy; (b) reduce
costs of renewable energy to permit long-term financial sustainability; and (c) remove
barriers to the large-scale commercialization of the technologies. The PDO and the GEOs
were not revised in the legal agreements during project restructuring.

The outcome of the project is rated satisfactory, given substantial ratings for relevance,
efficacy, and efficiency. The REDP was successful in promoting the rapid growth of a
sustainable off-grid PV market in China. There were more than 400,000 PV systems sold
under the project, exceeding the target of 350,000. More than 2 million people in isolated
rural areas have been provided with access to PV-generated electricity thanks to the
project. The project could have achieved even higher sales volumes had there not been
any market inroads by highly subsidized government and donor PV projects.
                                             X


The project was effective in removing barriers to the large-scale commercialization of PV
technology. It helped reduce PV prices, improve quality, and establish a thriving network
of suppliers, wholesalers, and retailers, The project also contributed to the development
of national capacity in PV product specifications, testing, and certification.

The REDP supported the construction of two wind farms in Shanghai totaling 21 MW.
The investment proved to be a major learning-by-doing activity for local utilities that
built considerably greater capacity for wind farm design, procurement, construction
management, and operations than originally expected. However, the project's direct
contribution to the establishment of a sustainable wind market in China was modest, as
could be expected from the substantially reduced scale of the project after restructuring.

Although the impact of wind energy development was limited, the project's overall
efficacy is rated substantial, taking into consideration the substantial achievements on
the PV market development, and the fact that the 88 percent of the total project costs
were related to PV technology development. The project's efficiency is rated high. With
the exception of the wind farm component, the REDP achieved very high financial and
economic returns.

The risk to development outcome is rated negligible to low. The government continues
to show strong commitment to the development of renewable energy, and a series of
Bank follow-up projects has been developed to scale up the achievements of the project.
The market is promising for larger household PV systems with more end-use
applications, as well as for PV-based street lighting and grid-connected PV systems
sponsored by the government.

The Bank's performance is rated satisfactory. Quality at entry was satisfactory.
Although the project's scope was substantially reduced following a delay of two and a
half years in signing the legal documents, the factors leading to the delay and
restructuring of the project appear to have been out of the control of the project team. The
quality of supervision was also satisfactory. The Bank team delivered high-quality advice
and showed good judgment, persistence, and flexibility in resolving important issues
during project implementation.

Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. The government has shown
strong support for renewable energy and rural electrification. However, during
implementation it was weak in supporting the rationalization of the wind power tariff and
in coordinating various agencies involved. The transparent and proactive performance of
the implementing agencies contributed greatly to establishing the conditions that led to
the success of this market development project.

The lessons emerging from the assessment are as follows:

           For interventions in rural PV markets, it is important to conduct a rigorous and
           extensive market study early in the preparation stage to provide information
           on market characteristics and barriers and to lay a solid foundation for
           effective project design.

0   Linking subsidies to quality improvements can be effective in situations where
    consumer perception of and feedback on quality are limited.

    and sizes can be critical in unleashing the creativity of businesses in

1. Introduction
Country and Sector Background
 1.1     With rapid growth over the past few decades, China found itself in a dilemma
between the country's soaring energy demand and accelerating air pollution driven by
fossil fuel use. In recent years, China's electricity demand has grown on average at 12%
per year. About three-quarters of the power generation is coal fired, the dirtiest form of
energy use. China's heavy dependence on coal has taken a heavy toll on the environment
and led to serious pollution-related human health issues. Sixteen Chinese cities are
among the world's top 20 polluted cities (Stockholm Environment Institute 2002). The
International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that China will overtake the United States as
the world's largest carbon emitter before 2010 (IEA 2006).

1.2      In the 1970s and 1980s, China's energy development strategy was characterized
as "walking on two legs": centralized large-scale projects and decentralized rural
electrification. Renewable electricity-such as hydropower, biogas, fuel wood, and, to a
lesser extent, solar and wind energy systems-were considered a decentralized solution
to increase energy access in remote villages. During this period, with the exception of
small hydro, the development of renewable energy (RE) remained, for the most part, in a
research and pilot demonstration stage.

 1.3    By the mid- 1990s, with increased attention to the emission problems arising from
burning coal, the government increased its commitment to RE development, as outlined
in its New and Renewable Energy Development Program: 1996-2010 (World Bank
Report No. 15592, 1996). The program, approved by the State Council in 1994, sought
to improve the efficiency of RE technology, lower production costs, and enlarge the
contribution of renewables in the total energy portfolio. It called for the creation of a
modern industrial base and market infrastructure for mature RE technologies such as
wind and solar power by 2000. RE programs launched since the mid- 1990s also shifted
emphasis from being centrally managed and supply driven to an approach based on
commercializing proven technologies.

1.4     In recent years, China's RE, especially wind, experienced unprecedented growth.
China had about 135 gigawatts (GW) of RE power capacity in 2006 (including large
hydro), accounting for 17% of overall generation capacity and 22.18% of the overall
power generated.' China has now become the world's third largest installer of wind
turbines, with total grid-connected capacity of wind power reaching 5.89 GW.2 China is
also the world's third largest producer of solar PV modules, although most are exported
to Europe and the United States.

The World Bank's Assistance
 1.5   In 1995, the World Bank began collaborating with China to expand and accelerate
the development of RE-based electricity as part of China's 10th Five-Year Plan (200 1-
06). To have a lasting impact on the fast-growing energy sector, the Bank's approach
sought to create an enabling environment, build capacity, mobilize resources, and
catalyze investments in both the power and end-use sectors. These efforts led directly to
the China Renewable Energy Development Project (REDP), which at the time was the
second largest RE project the World Bank had approved. REDP was also among the first
instances of international assistance to China that aimed to accelerate RE development.

 1.6   The project concept was based on a major Global Environment Facility (GEF)-
financed study in 1994 (NEPA and others, 1994) and analytical and advisory assistance
on China's environment in 1997 (Johnson and others, 1997). The Bank had undertaken a
number of key studies of renewable energy in China, including "China: Renewable
Energy for Electric Power" (World Bank Report No. 1.5592-CHA 1996) and "China: A
Strategy for International Assistance for Accelerating Renewable Energy Development"
(Taylor and Bogach, 1997). These studies identified the need for major investments and
technical assistance efforts to support RE development in China and the priority areas for
such assistance. Based on the studies, solar photovoltaic (PV) and grid-connected wind
farms were identified as at or closest to commercial viability.

1.7     Since REDP, two additional RE programs have been approved and implemented.
These are the first phase of the China Renewable Energy Scale-up Program (CRESP) and
the follow-up of the Renewable Energy Scale-up Program. The dates and brief
description of these programs are discussed in Annex B.

Other Donor Assistance
1.8    Many other multilateral and bilateral donor agencies, including the United
Nations Development Program and the Asian Development Bank, have been and
continue to be involved in supporting China's solar and wind energy development. The
agencies, brief descriptions of the projects, and the amount of loans and grants provided
by each are summarized in Annex C.


2. Project Objectives, Components, Implementation,
and Financing Mechanisms
Objectives
2.1     The project appraisal document and Loan Agreement stated that the objective of
REDP was to establish sustainable markets for wind and PV energy technologies in order
to supply electricity in an environmentally sustainable manner and increase access of
isolated rural populations to electricity services.
                                                       3


2.2    The objectives of the GEF cofinancing grant were to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by producing electricity from renewable energy; reduce costs of renewable
energy to permit long-term financial sustainability; and remove barriers to the large-scale
commercialization of the technologies.

Components
2.3      The project's original components are discussed below. The percentage of total
project cost is in parentheses.

     Wind farm component (47 percent of project costs) for on-grid electricity
     production. The component consisted of an investment subcomponent (45 percent of
     project costs) to finance 190 megawatts (MW) of wind capacity at five sites:
     Huitingxile in Inner Mongolia (100 MW), Zhangbei in Hebei (50 MW), Pingtan in
     Fujian (20 MW), and Chongming Island and Nanhui (20 MW) in Shanghai. There
     was also an institutional strengthening subcomponent ( 2 percent) to overcome
     barriers to wind farm development and to promote private sector investment.

    PV component (35 percent of project costs) for off-grid electrification. The
    component had several elements:
    a) Grants for 10 megawatts-peak (MWP)~      systems to households and institutions in
       Qinghai, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Sichuan. Subsidies of
       US$l S O per watt-peak (Wp) of PV capacity per system (with a capacity of 10
       Wp or greater) would be provided to participating PV companies to improve PV
       product quality, warranties, and after-sale services, and to strengthen business
       capabilities and marketing efforts.
    b) Market development to overcome barriers and develop PV markets through public
       information campaigns, capacity-building for PV companies, and so forth.
    c) Institutional strengthening to improve product quality, certification and
       standards, and project management and monitoring.

0   Technology improvement (TI) component (20 percent of project costs) for wind
    and solar technology to improve quality and reduce costs. The component
    consisted of:
    a) Cost-shared grants were available to participating TI companies. A competitive
       grant facility was set up to improve quality or reduce costs of products. Grants for
       small and urgent cost-shared projects were provided through a quick response
       facility (QRF). A production investment fund provided commercial loans to
       companies to purchase production equipment, follow-up investment to grant-
       financed activities, or other investment activities.
    b) Institutional strengthening to support program management, improve the staff
       capacity in manufacturing companies, and carry out special studies to facilitate
       proj ect implementation.

3. A peak watt is a unit used to rate the performance of solar cells, modules, or arrays and is equivalent to
the maximum nominal output of a photovoltaic device, in watts (W) under standardized test conditions,
usually 1,000 watts per square meter of sunlight with other conditions, such as specific temperature.
                                             4


2.4     The project was restructured between Board approval and the signing of the loan,
grant and project agreements, as explained below, but the project development objective
remained unchanged. The restructured project had the following components:

         0   The wind farm component (12 percent of project costs) was scaled down to
             include only the two wind farms in Shanghai totaling 21 MW and to provide
             technical assistance to support the management of the wind farms and
             preparatory work on large coastal sites.
        0    PV component (76 percent of project costs) remained unchanged.
        0    TI component (12 percent of project costs). The design of the investment
             subcomponent remained unchanged, but supported only PV manufacturers.
             The institutional strengthening subcomponent remained unchanged.

2.5     During implementation, the project also introduced two significant changes:

2.6    In June 2003, the Market Development Support Facility (MDSF) was introduced
to provide cost-shared grants to participating PV companies to help them improve their
commercial skills and develop markets. Companies were eligible to apply for up to
US$lO,OOO annually for business and market development in 2003 and 2004, and up to
US$20,000 annually for 2005 and 2006.

2.7    In May 2005, the project increased the number of target provinces to include
Yunnan and Sha'anxi Provinces and Ningxia Autonomous Region. It increased the PV
subsidies from US$lSO/Wp for PV modules meeting the project standards to US$2.O/Wp
for modules meeting the higher performance requirement of the international standard
                                       As
and the new Chinese national ~tandard.~ of July 2007, only sales of systems with
modules conforming to the higher standard were accepted.

Project Implementation
2.8     The project was approved on June 8, 1999. However, the signature of the legal
documents was delayed until June 26,2001, and the project only became effective two
and a half years after the approval date on December 2 1, 2001. This was caused by
several events that led to the restructuring of the project. First, the reform of China's
power sector broke up large regional grids such as the North China Power Grid (NCPG)
into provincial grids. The impact of high prices for wind power was greater on the
smaller provincial grids than on NCPG, which would have been the original buyer of the
wind power from Huitingxile and Zhangbei wind farms. Because the provincial grids
were unwilling to share the incremental costs of wind power, no power purchase
agreements were made. Uncertainties over the power purchase price also deterred local
counterpart financing for the two wind farms. Second, the Chinese authorities raised
concerns about the environmental impact of the Pingtan wind farm under new and more
stringent regulations, which prohibited trees from being removed for any project
development. In a letter to the World Bank Country Director on March 26,200 1, the


4. These are IEC 61215 and GB 9535-1998.
                                                      5


Ministry of Finance requested that the wind farms at Huitingxile, Zhangbei, and Pingtan
be dropped from the project. Consequently, the project was restructured.

2.9     After project restructuring, the Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Corporation
(SMEPC) became the implementing agency for the wind farm component. SMECP
formed a special purpose wind farm company, Shanghai Wind Power Company (SWPC)
to carry out the investment. SWPC is owned by several entities: SMEPC, 35%; State
Power Corporation or China, 33 percent; and Shanghai Power Investment Corporation, a
subsidiary of SMEPC, 32 percent.,The Ministry of Finance on-loaned the $13 million
Bank loan to SMEPC, which were then on-lent it to SWPC. The technical assistance and
technical preparation work were implemented by SMEPC and were supported by local
and international consultants.

2.10 The implementing agency for the PV and TI components was the State Economic
and Trade Commission. A project management office (PMO) was established under the
Commission to oversee project implementation. The Commission was abolished in 2003
and relevant departments were merged into the National Development and Reform
Commission. This organizational restructuring partially contributed to the slow start of
the PV component.

2.1 1 For the PV component, considerable capacity building supported by REDP had
taken place during project preparation. In 1996, 17 PV companies with sales of solar
home systems (SHS)' were selected and received technical assistance in business
development and internal controls before the start of the project.6 These companies joined
REDP in December 2001. Nineteen more companies joined in two batches in 2003 and
2005.'

2.12 The closing date of REDP was extended for one year to June 30, 2008, to allow
full achievement of the development objectives of the PV and TI components.

Financing
2.13 The project's total costs were estimated during appraisal at US$444.2 million.
The World Bank was only financing the wind power component of the project. After
three wind farms were cancelled and the wind component was reduced from 190 MW to
21 MW, World Bank financing was reduced from US$lOO million to US$13 million in

5 . In areas where grid extensions were not feasible because of low population densities, long distances from
the existing grid, and the rugged terrain, a stand-alone SHS often represents the least-cost option to supply
of modern electricity. A SHS typically consists of a PV module, a rechargeable battery, a charge controller,
wiring, fluorescent direct current lights, an inverter and outlets for other DC appliances (such as radio and
TV). See a picture of an SHS in Annex B.
6. Several companies were spinoffs of Qinghai New Energy Research Institute in Xining. Companies based
in Xining have led the rural market for PV over 1997-2007.
7. REDP PV participating companies are different fiom PV manufacturing companies, which are located in
more developed areas. PV manufacturing companies produce PV modules and export 90% of the products
to international markets. REDP companies sell SHSs in unelectrified rural markets. These companies
purchased modules and batteries, made one or more of the other main components - controllers, lamps and
in some cases inverters-and were engaged at some level in distribution and retailing.

June 2001. The total GEF grant was reduced from US$35 million to US$27 million and
the estimated total project cost from $445 million to $205 million. Because of the
substantially increased counterpart investment in the PV market, actual project costs
amounted to US$3 17.27 million, as shown in Table 1.

3. Monitoring and Evaluation
3.1      Design. The key performance indicators of REDP included: (a) avoided
emissions from replaced thermal power generation; (b) installed wind and PV capacities;
(c) increased wind power generation; (d) increased PV systems sold to households and
institutions; (e) decreased capital cost of windfarms (US$kilowatt [kW]) and PV systems
($/Wp), and number of qualified PV component suppliers. These indicators were defined
at the country level rather than the project level; they reflect emission reduction, capacity
expansion, and cost decline resulting from all RE programs in the nation (first three
indicators). The first four indicators also included forecast data for 2009.

3.2     The causal chain in the design of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system
was not clearly formulated. Given the large presence of other RE programs in China, the
link between achievements at the country level and intervention of this project is not
clear. Country-level and forecasting indicators are also too broad or inexplicit to be used
to measure progress and achievements.
                                             7


3.3     Disaggregated cost indicators would have been needed to verify the links between
project inputs and the outcome for decreased capital costs. The cost of a PV system is
largely determined by exogenous factors, including the world silicon price (which is
around 56 percent of the PV module price), metal plumbum price for battery production
(24 percent of the whole system price), and world demand for solar PV modules (52
percent o f the whole system price) etc. The project's monitoring evaluation (M&E) did
not provide adequate evidence of the connection between REDP and the reduction of cost
and therefore was not able to convincingly demonstrate the logic of project design.

3.4     For TI, project M&E focused on the number of proposals selected for support and
the number of approved TI grants. Less attention was given to whether TI activities have
led to actual cost reductions or quality improvements.

3.5     Implementation. Although the weakness in the M&E design was not addressed
during project implementation, the M&E on PV system price and quality and on PV
companies' financial management was timely and rigorous. The PMO developed
management information system software to cross-check company sales reports for
completeness and internal consistency. It also contracted with consultants to regularly
review the accounting systems and records of purchases, inventory, sales, and cash
movements at company offices. The PMO also commissioned reviews on the cash sale
model, MDSF and TI grants, and impacts in areas such as jobs, education, health, and
quality of life. For the wind farm component, progress in construction of the wind farms
and subsequent electricity production were monitored and reported regularly.

3.6    Utilization. The comprehensive and strict market monitoring administered by the
PMO provided the incentive for companies to improve financial management and
product quality and supported quality audits and transparent grant release. It also
informed decision making, for example, on determining the best time to toughen quality
requirements. The two wind farms themselves generated valuable data on the
performance of the installed turbines; these data were used to inform the development of
wind farms in the follow-up projects.

3.7    The overall quality of project M&E is rated substantial. That rating is based
on a modest rating for design, and substantial ratings for implementation and utilization.


4. Relevance
4.1     The project's objectives were and remain substantially relevant. The stated
objectives of the project were well embedded in both the government and the Country
Assistance Strategies (1997-2005), which emphasize meeting infrastructure demand in an
environmentally sustainable way.

4.2     REDP also addressed three of the four core goals of the Bank's 2001 Energy
Business Renewable Strategy: help the poor directly through improved access; promote
private sector development; and protect the environment. REDP also addressed the
                                             8


government objectives of economic development in western provinces, where much of
the renewable resources are located.

4.3     The project development objectives remain substantially relevant at the time of
evaluation. It supports the current Bank Country Partnership Strategy (2006- lo), one
pillar of which is to manage resource scarcity and environmental constraints to the
country's future growth. In addition, the project objectives are fully consistent with
GEF's strategic objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate
change, and GEF's Operational Program 6 to support the promotion of RE by removing
barriers and reducing implementation costs.

4.4     The project objectives were aligned with the country's mid- and long-term energy
development policies. China has set a target of obtaining 10 percent of the country's
primary energy from renewables by 2010 (expected 60 GW) and 15 percent by 2020
(totaling 120 GW, including 30GW of wind power and 1 GW of grid-tied PV). In the
long term, China has set an objective of having 30 percent or more of its total energy
requirements satisfied by renewable sources by 2050.

4.5     The overall relevance of project design is rated substantial. The subsidy
instrument adopted by the project was innovative, so it effectively addressed some of the
key barriers in the pre-REDP PV market. By design, a company was qualified for sales
subsidies/grants, if the company (a) met REDP quality standards, (b) maintained sales
and service outlets with trained staff and stocks of spare parts in the area, and (c) kept
adequate sales and financial records and complied with the normal REDP verification
requirements. Clearly, such performance- and output-based subsidies provided incentives
and direct grants to companies to achieve economies of scale (by expanding output and
extending sales and service networks), improve product and service quality, and
strengthen their financial and business capabilities. The subsidies were partially passed
onto consumers and partially retained by producers, thus spurring both demand and
investment.

4.6     Furthermore, because the subsidy approach was technologically neutral (the grant
is based on per Wp of capacity) without specific restrictions on system size or design, it
encouraged innovation and allowed business decisions to be made in line with market
demand.

4.7     The Market Development Support Facility grants under REDP gave companies
flexibility to identify capacity weaknesses and improve business and market
development. This bottom-up approach was different than the common practice in rural
PV projects, which predetermined the `capacity-buildingneeds and offered standardized
packages of training and promotion. Similarly, the cost-shared grants under the TI
component provided broad scope for the entire PV sector to explore TI opportunities.
The cost-shared scheme also leveraged additional private investments, as the companies
typically self-financed 50-60 percent of the incremental costs of MDSF activities and
70% of the TI costs.

4.8    Notwithstanding the project's innovative design, there were some shortcomings:
                                                     9


a. At the time of project preparation, there was no consistent national policy to support
   the development of RE by spreading the incremental costs broadly across regional
   grids. The project underestimated the institutional and policy barriers that led to the
   restructuring of the project and originally set overambitious targets which were
   revised before loan signing. Although the delays and subsequent cancellation of the
   wind farms were largely out of the Bank's control, in retrospect, the project could
   have made a larger contribution by focusing on a longer-term policy-oriented
   approach. Ultimately, a conducive policy environment is a key precondition for
   commercializing RE development.

    It is commendable that this shortcoming was recognized early and addressed during
    REDP restructuring. A policy-oriented approach was immediately built into the
    design of the follow-up project (CRESP) during its preparation in 2000. CRESP is a
    10-year program aimed at supporting the implementation of a national policy
    framework for RE to address market barriers that hinder large-scale commercial
    energy markets in China.

b. The project did not develop financing mechanisms for rural consumers and private
   companies.8 Until now, retail SHS sales in China have been primarily cash based. The
   absence of consumer financing prohibited program benefits from reaching the poorer
   segment of the community and the non-herder's market and constrained the increase
   in the size of the system^.^ Private PV projects also had difficulties in obtaining bank
   credits, which may have limited sales growth.

c. No mechanism was built into the TI component to ensure information sharing. If the
    howled e produced by firms is exclusive and competitive, subsidies are not
   justified!' Otherwise, to stimulate a socially optimal level of TI, knowledge spillover
    methods should be incorporated in the project design.

d. The project focused on a supply-side approach to improve product quality. Less
   attention was given to consumer education to drive demand for quality.

e. Functions of the subcomponents are somewhat overlapping. As reported by the
   Implementation Completion Report (ICR), the parallel QRF facility ended up funding
   similar projects to the competitive grant facility. And it may have been more effective
   to eliminate QRF to release scarce PMO resources for other aspects of the
   components.




8. Due to time pressures for project completion, consumer finance pilots and a partial credit guarantee
facility were developed but not implemented.
9. PV systems were primarily sold to herdsmen, who can sell yaks to get extra cash. Yaks are worth about
$1,000 each. Thus, herders can fund a SHS without a loan.
10. Chinese f m s are inclined to focus on expanding production capacity; technology innovation typically
takes a lower priority. In that sense, the TI grants provide some necessary incentives to improve
technology.

5. Efficacy
5.1     The efficacy of the project is assessed against the achievement the project
development objectives as outlined in paragraph 2.1. The attainment of the global
environment objectives outlined in para 2.2 is also discussed, though not included in the
efficacy rating. The objectives related to PV market development and provision of
increased access of isolated rural populations to electricity services were substantially
achieved. The objective of establishing sustainable markets for wind energy was
modestly achieved. Taking into account that 88 percent of the project costs correspond to
PV development and the related increase in access, overall efficacy is rated substantial.

5.2     The achievements and issues of REDP are discussed in detail objective by
objective. Since removal of barriers to PV and wind energy technology markets was an
essential intermediate outcome and hence ingredient to establishing sustainable markets
for these technologies, the discussion of the achievement of the first two GEOs is
subsumed under the discussion of the related project development objectives. Three
additional GEOs are discussed at the end of the efficacy section. The overall efficacy
rating is based on achievement of project development objectives only.

Establishing. sustainable markets for PV energy technologies.

Rating: Substantial

5.3    At appraisal three key barriers to the establishment of sustainable markets for PV
energy technologies were identified and the project effectively helped overcome these,
thus contributing to the rapid growth of China's PV manufacturing sector as discussed
below.

PV Barrier I : Small-scale and relatively inexperienced companies

5.4     The combination of financial mechanisms, capacity building, and strict
monitoring and internal controls helped small companies in the rural SHS market expand
output, deepen distribution networks, and improve financial practices. There is currently
a well-established sector of companies operating in the production, integration, and
distribution of PV systems in the target market areas, as shown below.

5.5     Verified sales of PV systems under REDP have dramatically increased to more
than 11 MWp, compared with the target of IOMWp. Figure 2 shows the year-by-year
verified and reported sales. The average size of PV systems has also increased steadily,
from 18 Wp in 2002 to 45 Wp in 2007 as shown in Figure 3.

5.6     To be noted, sales increased sharply from 2002 to 2005, but declined in 2006 and
2007. According to project documents and interviews with PV companies, the decline
was partially caused by market inroads by highly subsidized government and donor PV
projects. l 1 The competitiveness of commercial SHS had been lowered by these

                                                                     11


government- or donor-funded programs, which supplied SHS with 90-100 percent
                                                                                               '



subsidies, effectively crowding out commercial sales. Highly subsidized systems can
undermine the development of local ownership and undercut market-based projects. This
highlighted that it is important to have proper coordination with parallel solar PV
programs to avoid potential overlaps and conflicts; project arrangements should actively
promote the adoption of a sustainable, market-based approach in government- and donor-
supported PV projects.

5.7    For the 17 REDP-supported SHS companies whose data are available, employees
more than doubled from an estimated 378 in 2002 to 843 in 2007, and the outlets
increased from 266 to 72 1 during the same period of time. The rural sales revenue
expanded 363 percent, from RMB 48.7 million yuan in 2002 to RMB 225.1 million yuan
in 2007.

5.8     The PV companies also upgraded their financial management during REDP.
Companies computerized their accounting systems and introduced standardized
documentation and controls to comply with the eligibility requirements of REDP. The
steadily rising rate at which the companies' report of sales was verified by the PMO is an
indication of the improvement (Figure 2).

5.9     REDP also helped the start-up of some PV manufacturing companies by
providing financial resources under the TI component. With lack of access to credits,
small and new companies view the TI component as crucial for conducting R&D. Some
of the beneficiaries of the TI grant have become major players in the international market
and are listed on stock exchanges in Europe and the United States.

PV Barrier 2: Poor-quality products and service

5.10 REDP used the "carrots and sticks" principle to motivate companies to improve
product and service quality. Companies that met REDP standards were eligible for
subsidies; companies whose product quality fell short of standards were subject to
                                                           12


financial penalties. Tests were conducted on products sampled at outlets and warehouses
to ensure compliance. By the end of the project, all but two PV participating companies
become ISO-9001 certified for quality management.'*

5.1 1 The project also introduced steadily higher technical specifications and
strengthened domestic capacity in testing and certification. REDP also led to the
establishment of a quality seal-Golden Sun-which has been recognized by the
government and World Bank financed-PV projects. However, the Golden Sun mark is
still mostly unknown among rural consumers.

5.12 The PMO maintained lists of the suppliers of certified components - panels,
batteries, lights and controllers. By requiring PV companies to use only certified
components, REDP also motivated PV manufacturing companies to improve quality. In
the end, there were 74 component suppliers that were certified as meeting the REDP
standards, compared to the original target of 30.

5.13 The IEG mission was informed that before REDP, low-performing products
damaged the reputation of both PV products in the domestic market and Chinese brands
in the international market. By improving product quality, REDP provided critical help
for China to become an international manufacturing center for PV modules.

PV Barrier 3: High cost/lack of mechanism to increase affordability

5.14 The retail prices as quoted by the solar companies showed significant reduction
between 2002 and 2004; there was a slight increase in the following years largely caused
by shortage of PV modules in the international market. Overall, after adjusting for
inflation, the average market prices of all PV systems declined by the end of REDP.
Table 2 summarizes the average prices of different PV systems.

                                           13



5.15 REDP contributed to PV system price reduction in three ways: output-based
subsidies were directly transferred to consumers, the profit margins were kept low as
REDP helped the market remain competitive, and the price was reduced in parallel with
cost reduction. (see paragraph 5.4).

5.16 However, the project did not overcome one important barrier identified at project
appraisal: the lack of financing mechanism to improve system affordability. REDP sales
were concentrated in Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Xinjiang and were relatively weak in
the other six provinces. The IEG mission was informed that partly because of the absence
of consumer financing, it was difficult for PV companies to penetrate into a non-herders
market, where consumers typically cannot afford the high upfront costs of the system.

5.17 In summary, REDP contributed to the rapid growth of the Chinese off-grid PV
market. The project was effective in reducing prices, improving quality, and supporting
the development of a marketing and distribution network for the sustainable development
of the technology, thus substantially meeting the first development objective, as well as
the related global environment objective or removing barriers to large-scale
commercialization of PV technology.

Establish sustainable markets for wind energy technology

Rating: Modest

5.18 At appraisal, four barriers were identified in the pre-REDP wind market that
needed to be overcome to establish sustainable markets for wind energy technology. As
could be expected from the substantially reduced scale of the wind component, the
project's impact on removing these barriers and hence establishing a sustainable market
for wind energy technology was mostly at the local level. However, REDP had achieved
an unintended impact on the creation of a regulatory framework for the development of
RE in China.

Wind Barrier1 :Higher generation costs than coal-Bred thermal power plants

5.19 REDP's support for scaling up investments as a way to reduce wind power costs
no longer appears to be essential, because China's wind power capacity, including in
less-developed provinces, has been growing at more than 100% per year in each of the
last three years. Figure 4 indicates the development of wind power in China in
comparison with the timeline of REDP wind component.

5.20 REDP also intended to lower wind farm costs by introducing international
competitive bidding. However, as discussed in paragraph 5.3, there was no net change in
installed cost at the end of the project.

Wind Barrier 2: Lack of a legal framework for wind farm projects

5.21 REDP had a major, albeit unintended, impact on establishing a regulatory
framework for RE in China. The difficulties encountered in establishing the power
purchase arrangements of the wind farms to be supported by the projects highlighted the
need for a stable pricing framework and a basis for the subsidization of wind power. The
follow-up Bank projects contributed to the design and development of a new regulatory
framework. These included a range of studies, workshops, and study tours, most actively
during the extended CRESP preparation activities from 2000-07. Bank-supported studies
analyzed the pros and cons of different policy options. IEG mission was informed that
Project staff involved in preparation of REDP also strongly advocated for a mandated
market share policy during the drafting of China's Renewable Energy Law.

5.22 The Renewable Energy Law, which became effective January 1,2006, provided
an overarching framework for the development of renewable energy in China. One of its
key provisions required power utilities to produce a share of the electricity from
renewable sources or to purchase power from RE generators at a government-determined
price. The law also stipulated a national cost-sharing mechanism whereby consumers
must pay for the extra (incremental) costs of renewable power. And the law establishes
fixed premium prices (feed-in tariffs) and pricing mechanisms for wind power and
biomass.
                                              15


Wind Barrier 3: Lack of institutional capacity

5.23 The project improved the technical, financial and legal capacity of local utilities
(SMEPC and SWPC) to initiate or participate in wind project development. SWPC
pointed out that through REDP, the company obtained ample experience in wind turbine
operating and maintenance, and procedures and methods for public bidding.

5.24 The experience from the Shanghai wind farms also informed the developer, Long
Yuan Company and made the implementation of the CRESP-funded Pingtan wind farm
(from 2004-07) easier. The Pingtan wind farm had been successfully completed and had
produced 11% more energy than planned in 2008.

Wind Barrier 4: Inadequate information on wind resources, site characteristics, and
equipment performance

5.25 The project generated valuable data on the performance of installed wind turbines.
Through REDP, local utilities learned about constructing foundations in soft soils and
conducting wind resource measurement. That knowledge contributed directly to the
adoption of 3 10-MW government wind project in Shanghai.

5.26 Overall, REDP effectively helped establish a sustainable market for wind energy
technology in Shanghai. However, it fell short of meeting its intended impact at the
national level.

Increasing access of isolated populations to electricity services

Rating: Substantial

5.27 REDP exceeded its targets of increasing access to modern energy through
distribution of SHSs. There were more than 400,000 SHS systems sold under the project,
exceeding the targets of 350,000. More than 2 million people in isolated rural areas in
western China have received electricity service through the project. The REDP has also
supported PV village systems (and a few with wind and PV) to provide electricity for
public facilities such as schools and health centers and for village satellite telephones, and
Buddhist temples.

5.28 At the sector level, REDP played a key role in the momentum in China's solar
energy industry. It increased awareness of PV technology among government and energy
company officials and contributed to the increased deployment of PV systems in
government rural programs. The government now has a target of 300 MWp for rural PV
systems (including both off-grid home systems and local PV grids) by 2020. The major
PV-based rural electrification programs are summarized in Annex C.

Alleviating poverty

5.29 Although REDP did not explicitly spell out a poverty alleviation objective, by
providing electricity services to rural areas, it did promote local economic development
                                                 16


and improve living conditions for households without electricity. This was supported by
an end-user survey covering 1,203 households in 6 villages in 2007. l 3 The survey
reported that 95 percent of SHS users claimed that the system increased their incomes; 15
percent claimed that the increase was significant. In addition, about 1,500 permanent and
3,000 temporary jobs have been created in the participating companies as a result of this
program.

Gobal Envrionment Obiective: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by producing
electricity from renewable energy

5.30 The weakness in the design of project's M&E makes assessment of the emissions
reduction objective difficult, because emission baseline values were not provided, and
there were no outcome target indicators to directly measure C02 emissions resulting from
the project.

5.31 The avoided C02 emission from Shanghai wind farms was estimated to be 33,700
tons per year. For the PV component, it was estimated that for a 20-Wp system, 550
kilograms of C02 are avoided, assuming 15 years of system lifetime. The calculation
was based on kerosene usage surveys conducted in four counties in Gansu and Tibet in
2007. Results from the survey may not represent the actual.project benefits because (a)
kerosene use in other target provinces was much higher than in Gansu and Tibet; (b)
emissions from candles, ghee lamps, and the substituted production of dry cells were
ignored because of a lack of reliable data; and (c) the calculation did not take into account
the carbon cost of manufacturing PV systems. In sum, this global development objective
was only modestly achieved.

Global Environment Obiective: Reducing costs of renewable energy to permit long-term
financial sustainabilitv

5.32 The project aimed at lower wind farm costs in China by allowing international
competitive bidding and large-scale development. During 2002-03, wind turbine costs in
China went down dramatically to about US$860/kW, as compared to US$1,3OO/kW at
the start of the project. However, wind turbine costs climbed up again by the end of the
project, mainly because of foreign exchange rate change and the rapid growth in installed
wind power worldwide which created shortages of wind turbines and pushed up wind
turbine prices. Installed cost of the Shanghai wind farm was $1,264/kW.

5.33 The PV system costs started at about US$lG/Wp and had fallen to US$9/Wp by
the end of the project, well below the target of $1 1/Wp. However, no detailed indicators
were developed to measure how much of the cost reduction was attributable to REDP,
and how much was related to exogenous factors such as worldwide price reduction of
silicon feedstock. Note that when insufficient information is provided by the Bank for
IEG to arrive at a clear rating, IEG will downgrade the relevant ratings as warranted.
Nonetheless, the IEG mission identified at least two mechanisms through which the
project invention contributed to cost decline.

             One PV company reported that by improving internal management and quality
             control, product failure rate was decreased; this resulted in cost reduction.

             REDP helped the SHS market remain competitive if not become more
             competitive. The gross margins including sales subsidies were estimated to be as
             low as around 13 percent in 2007. l 4 By comparison, the margins were about
             50% in the Philippine SHS market and 100 percent in Sri Lanka." There was
             evidence linking competition with increased efficiency and reduced cost.
             As shown in Figure 1, the unit price of larger systems came down more
             dramatically than smaller systems. Research commissioned by the PM016 found
             that solar modules of different capacities ( l o w , 18W, 25W, 40W, and 50W) had
             the same unit prices (yuadWp) if they were produced by the same manufacturer.
             Therefore, the difference in price trends among different systems may be
             explained by the increased competition for larger SHSs: as larger systems gained
             popularit among users, more efficient suppliers were attracted to produce bigger
             systems'! which led to increased competition and reduced cost.

5.34 Cost of SHSs may also have come down because of increased economy of scale
(paragraph 5.9) and the support from TI grants, which have the objective of lowering cost
and improving quality (if necessary) of PV systems or hybrid PV wind systems. More
detailed cost indicators could have helped confirm the impacts.

6. Efficiency
6.1    With the exception of the wind farm component, which accounted for just 12
percent of project costs, the project delivered high financial and economic rates of return.
The overall project efficiency is therefore rated high.

6.2      According to the ICR, the economic rate of return for wind farm investments
exceeded the appraisal estimate. This was the result of a larger estimated willingness to
pay. The consumer willingness to pay is assumed to be the wind power purchase price
plus a premium of RMB 0.253kWh that was actually paid by environmentally conscious
consumers under a "green" electricity program. One concern is that the green tariff may
already have reflected consumer willingness to pay to avoid greenhouse gas emissions. If
this is the case, the economic rate of return (ERR) calculation for the wind component is
overestimated through double-counting.

6.3      The wind farms had a poor financial rate of return (FRR) because of low capacity
utilization (around 20 percent). The poor wind resources in Shanghai presented a
formidable barrier to improving the wind farm performance.

6.4    According to the ICR, the PV and TI components jointly delivered exceptionally
high ERR. At the PV subproject level, the ERR for PV market development including
C02 emissions reduction benefits and considering consumer willingness to pay was
estimated to be 93.4 percent. The FRR was 88 percent.

6.5    As shown in Table 5, the economic returns of REDP are much higher than
comparable ERRS of similar projects in other countries. This is mainly attributable to the
apparently lower costs of Chinese PV systems, relative to those produced outside China.

6.6     For economic analysis, the project carried out a detailed energy survey covering
1,203 households in four counties. The study then estimated a log linear demand curve of
a representative household (a weighted average across five different income groups)
based on its energy demand for different lighting sources before and after the project. The
change in consumer willingness to pay is measured by the change in consumer surplus
corresponding to lumen consumption from kerosene and from a compact fluorescent
lamp. The project effort should be commended since few Bank projects attempt an
analysis of consumer surplus change as rigorous as this one.

6.7    Nonetheless, the economic analysis was potentially biased in several ways
discussed below.

    a. This analysis seems to attribute REDP-subsidized PV system adoption to REDP.
       But households were already adopting PV systems before REDP and would have
       continued to do so even in REDP's absence. REDP seems to have brought about
       a reduction in the relative price of 40-W and 50-W systems and thus may have
       pushed some people from a 20-W system to a 40-W system. Improvements in
       quality may have tipped the balance from kerosene for others. But if the
       increased solar system sales relative to a counterfactual are smaller than those
       from comparing before-and-after adoption, then the gains would be
       overestimated.
    b. The study estimated the project welfare gains as the change in consumer surplus
       by moving from total kerosene consumption to total reliance on a 20-W compact
       fluorescent lamp. However, as the survey indicated, consumers used a mix of
       lighting sources both before and after electrification, including kerosene, ghee,
       and candles. Therefore, the welfare change is not a straightforward comparison
       between kerosene and SHS.
    c. The current survey was conducted in Tibet and Gansu provinces. Among the
       targeted six provinces, the two rank the lowest in terms of per capita income.
       There is also large heterogeneity in lifestyle and energy supply conditions across
       the regions. Hence, results from the survey may not represent the conditions of
       the whole project. The survey could have covered a larger geographical area with
       a wider variety of fuel consumption patterns, incomes, and system sizes and
       prices.
                                                    20


     d. Household incomes are not static. In some cases, electrification directly
        contributed to the growth of income. As income increases over time, households
        are willing to pay more for their lumens at all levels of consumption. Therefore, a
        demand curve based on a one-time survey may not capture the entire benefit
        gains.
     e. The study spreads total TI costs over all verified sales and takes the average
        number as an incremental cost for each system sold. Such an approach may be
        misleading because TI funds were disbursed over many years. The stream of costs
        should be discounted to express them in present-value terms.

6.8    In Annex F, a demand curve for lighting is re-estimated based on consumption for
lumens from two observable bundles of fuel used before and after a SHS. The welfare
gain based on the "bundle" approach is larger than the ICR estimate. And the
corresponding ERR from the consumers' perspective is 115 percent versus the ICR
estimate of 35 percent. Some of the fuels (ghee and candles) that were substituted by a
SHS may have been omitted under the simplified ICR assumption that a consumer
switched from total kerosene use to total reliance on a SHS.

7. Outcome
7.1     The project outcome rating is satisfactory, based on project subratings of
substantial for relevance, efficacy, and high for efficiency (taking into account the much
greater weight in project costs of the PV and TI components), as summarized in Table 6
below.

8. Risk to Development Outcome
8.1    REDP's risk to development outcome is rated negligible to low. The market is
promising for larger household PV systems with more end-use applications,l8 and also in
the government-sponsored contract market for street lighting and grid-connected PV

18. The market for small SHS systems is now largely saturated in many areas, notably much of Qinghai.
                                             21


systems. Given the continued government commitment to developing RE, the contract
market is likely to grow in strength. In fact, by 2007 all members of the leading group of
18 SHS companies were engaged to some extent in contracting, with contracting sales
accounting for almost half of the sales on average.

8.2     The REDP SHS companies also began to make sales in export markets. At least
two of the companies have made contract exports for an estimated US$2.0-3.0 million
over 2006-07, including for World Bank-supported projects in Lao PDR, Mongolia, and
Papua New Guinea. By the companies' estimates, exports have reached an average of 7
percent of sales.

8.3     Regarding the wind component, at the policy level, the government has shown
strong commitment to the development of wind energy. The 2006 Renewable Energy
Law was enacted specifically to address the institutional and policy barriers that led to the
restructuring of REDP. At the project level, the satisfactory technical and financial
capacity of SWTP ensures that the wind farms will continue being maintained and
operated in a safe and efficient way.

8.4    In addition, a series of Bank follow-up projects, including CRESP and the follow-
up to CRESP, has been developed to scale up grid-connected wind power, including the
development of Huitingxile and Pingtan wind farms from the original REDP.

8.5     At the same time, there is some concern about the future growth of the PV
market. Profit margins of the rural market have remained too low because competition
was based too much on price rather than a price: quality ratio. Without the subsidies, the
average net revenue on sales for the PV companies was less than 1 percent, and seven of
the 18 companies would be operating at a loss in 2007. l9 Given such a low profit margin,
companies may find it challenging to improve or even maintain product quality,
especially after the completion of REDP. In fact, high-tech companies in other
developed regions have reportedly been unwilling to introduce improved but more
expensive products to the rural market because the price competition in rural market is
too intense. 20

9. Bank Performance
9.1     Quality at entry was satisfactory. The Bank team conducted a rigorous and
holistic market study early in the preparation stage. The study identified pre-existing
barriers in the PV market and provided information on potential market size and
characteristics. It proved to be important for the Bank team i,n adopting effective
instruments to achieve the project development objective and global environment
objectives. The project used novel designs and techniques, particularly in its emphasis on
market-driven approach. Considerable capacity building for PV companies during project
preparation prepared future development of the market.

9.2     Although the scale of the project was substantially reduced after a two and one-
half year postponement in the signing of the legal documents, factors leading to the delay
and restructuring of the project appear to have been out of the control of the project team.
A wind tariff covenant that would allow cost recovery was agreed upon at project
appraisal and included in the Project Agreement. Therefore, risks related to power tariffs
were to be mitigated by a convenanted action on the part of the Borrower should tariff
disagreements arise.

9.3     Quality of supervision was satisfactory. In linking REDP with international PV
expertise and best practices for PV market development projects, the Bank team ensured
that REDP benefited significantly from international as well as Chinese knowledge and
experience. The core team remained the same throughout the project design, appraisal,
and implementation period, facilitating consistency of dialogue. The Bank has also
shown good judgment, persistence, and flexibility in resolving important issues raised
during project implementation. For example, after the delay in securing power purchase
agreements, the Bank team effectively adjusted the design of REDP and the follow-up
projects to continue to achieve the main development objective and global environmental
benefits. After discovering that the use of SWPC's expertise to integrate the wind farms
was not in line with wind industry practice, the Bank team successfully convinced the
implementing agency to adopt the single responsibility procurement approach. Finally,
the Bank team changed the verification method of PV sales that was adopted originally at
appraisal after realizing its inappropriateness to the semi-nomadic local market.

9.4     The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory given satisfactory ratings
for quality at entry and quality of supervision.

10. Borrower Performance
10.1 The government performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Project
records show that, in the face of difficulties of reaching power purchase agreements
subsequent to the restructuring of China's power sector, the government was weak in
supporting the rationalization of the wind power tariff and in coordinating various
agencies involved to address the challenge. The inability to finalize power purchase
agreements led to the cancellation of three wind farms in the original project design. The
unsatisfactory performance on wind power was tempered by the government's strong
support for RE and rural electrification. The Renewable Energy Law ensured a
sustainable commercialization of RE based on cost-recovery principles and on ensuring
greater access for the poor. The opportunities presented by the government policy in the
western rural market encouraged the entry of many new companies during 2004-06.

10.2 The implementing agency performance is rated satisfactory. During the early
stages of project implementation, the PMO effectively explained to stakeholders the
project design and their role in it and mobilized their interest and cooperation. PMO staff
also undertook frequent field visits and other monitoring responsibilities to verify
physical progress., They managed to finalize a large number of contracts for subprojects
scattered in mountainous rural areas with difficult access. PV companies interviewed
                                           23


considered the dedicated support fiom the PMO as being crucial to the project success
and have expressed their appreciation.

10.3 Overall, borrower performance covering government and implementation agency
performance is moderately satisfactory in line with the harmonized evaluation criteria
calling for a moderately satisfactory rating when either government or implementing
agency rating or both are moderately satisfactory.

11. Lessons
11.1   The lessons emerging from the assessment are as follows:

          For interventions in rural PV markets, it is important to conduct a rigorous and
          extensive market study early in the preparation stage to provide information
          on market characteristics and barriers and to lay a solid foundation for
          effective project design.
          Linking subsidies to quality improvements can be effective in situations where
          consumer perception of and feedback on quality are limited.
          A technology-neutral and bottom-up approach that avoids prescribing designs
          and sizes can be critical in unleashing the creativity of businesses in
          developing products that meet local needs.
          Clear policies supporting development, access to the grid, and mechanisms for
          cost recovery are critical preconditions for private sector-led renewable
          energy development.
          A market-based approach to PV dissemination requires a consistent and well-
          coordinated approach by all PV project supporters. Market-based approaches
          risk limited uptake if they compete with heavily subsidized approaches.

Annex F. Estimated Consumer Economic Rate of Return
As discussed in the main report, ICR ERR analysis is likely to be biased due to simplified
assumption about consumer energy consumption behavior. In this annex, a consumer
demand curve and corresponding consumer surplus change were re-estimated using a
?bundle? approach.

Based on the household survey conducted in 2007, a representative household?s (the
weighted average of 5 income groups) consumption of kerosene, ghee light and candle before
the purchase of a SHS and the lumen consumption of a SHS is shown in Table 6.

Assuming a log linear demand functional form, the demand function can be estimated based
on the above observations:
P = 51.31q - 1.29

or in Figure 6 labeled as ICR.

The ICR assumes that this representative consumer shifts from using only kerosene before
SHS to using only PV for lighting, then the monthly change in consumer surplus, as
measured by the areas below demand function and above price, equals to 46.7 yuadmonth.
The consumer ERR is 35 percent as shown in Table 9.

Next, consider that the representative household in fact consumes a mix of fuel before and
after SHS as reported by the 1997 household survey and is summarized in Tables 7 and 8.

Based on the two observations highlighted in Tables 7 and 8, the demand function was re-
estimated as:
                                  P = 106.14Q - 1.07

Or in Figure 6 labeled as PPAR. The consumer surplus change is 122.88 yudmonth. The
consumer ERR is 114.6% as shown in Table 9.

The consumer ERR is estimated based on the assumptions made in the ICR: A SHS lasts for
15 years, battery is replaced every two years, costing 300 yuan; controllers are assumed to be
replaced every five years, costing 27 yuan; the average operation and maintenance costs is
23.7year including replacement of lights; and the system cost is 1200 yuan.
