1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The project focused on an aspect of the World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
presented to the Board in early 1997: meeting infrastructure demand in an
environmentally sustainable way to support continued economic growth. The project
concept was based on a substantial body of Bank work, including China: Issues and
Options in Greenhouse Gas Emissions Control, a joint report of the Chinese Government,
UNDP, and the World Bank issued in December 1994 and Clear Water, Blue Skies:
China's Environment in the 21st Century, published by East Asia and Pacific (EAP)
region in 1997.

Power demand was increasing by an estimated 17-20 Gigawatts (GW) per year and,
based on past experience, about 80 percent of this incremental demand was expected be
met by coal-fired generation. Clear Water, Blue Skies had estimated the cost of health
and agricultural damage from coal-related air pollution at six percent of GDP. Reducing
local environment damage from coal use became a priority for the Government of China
(GoC) which created interest in renewable energy and energy conservation as two
promising, but still relatively untested, options.

The Bank had undertaken a number of key studies of renewable energy in China,
including China: Renewable Energy for Electric Power, published in 1996, (World Bank
Report No. 15592-CHA), China: Renewable Energy Development for Thermal
Applications, and China: A Strategy for International Assistance for Accelerating
Renewable Energy Development, the latter two being published in 1997. These
concluded that biomass, small hydro, photovoltaics (PV) and wind were the renewable
energy technologies with the greatest medium term potential in China. Of these, wind
was close to, but not yet at, commercial viability for electricity production in grid
applications and PV was the least-cost option for off-grid electricity.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The original PDO was development of sustainable markets for wind and photovoltaic
(PV) technologies in order to increase supply of electricity in an environmentally
sustainable way and improve access of isolated rural populations to electricity services.
Key performance indicators were:
       · Avoided emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and total
           suspended particulates (TSP) as a result of thermal power generation replaced.
       · Electricity generation from wind farms.
       · Number of PV systems installed in households/institutions under the project.
       · Installed capacity of wind and PV systems.
       · Number of local manufacturers with components that are certified to meet
           international/industry standards.




                                             1

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The GEO was to: (a) reduce greenhouse gas emissions by producing electricity from
renewable energy; (b) reduce costs of renewable energy to permit long-term financial
sustainability; and (c) remove barriers to the large-scale commercialization of the
technologies. Key performance indicators were:
        · Avoided emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2).
        · Installed costs of wind farms and PV systems.
        · Remove barriers to large-scale commercialization of the technologies.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The project was restructured between approval by the Board and signature of the Loan,
Grant and Project Agreements, because three of the originally-planned four wind farms
did not obtain their final approvals from Government of China, thus making the
sustainable market objective for wind unrealistic. The restructuring was approved by the
Board on May 17, 2001 and the changes to the GEF financing were made in June, 2001.

The PDO was revised to: development of a sustainable market for PV technologies and
demonstration of the viability of commercial wind development in the coastal regions.
Key performance indicators were not changed, but their values were reduced.

1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The GEO was not revised on restructuring because it was considered that the same
objectives were achievable. The GEO indicators were modified at the time of
restructuring before signature, to reflect the reduced scope of the wind component.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

The beneficiaries identified at appraisal and after restructuring remained (a) nomads and
rural households in isolated areas of northwest China benefiting from increased access to
electricity; (b) participating PV companies which would gain commercial skills and
business opportunities; and (c) PV manufacturers which would be supported in their
efforts to improve quality and reduce cost.

Beneficiaries identified at appraisal but which as a result of the project's restructuring did
not receive either as substantial a benefit as expected, or none at all were: (a) people
living in areas with wind potential particularly those in northwestern regions; (b) people
living in areas where harmful emissions from coal fired power plant would have been
avoided; and (c) wind manufacturers which did not receive support for technology
upgrading.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

The project consisted of three components:




                                             2

    · A wind farm component, consisting of an investment subcomponent to finance
       190 megawatts (MW) of wind capacity at five sites (Huitengxile, Zhangbei,
       Pingtan and two in Shanghai), and an institutional development subcomponent
       aimed at overcoming barriers to wind farm development. Total cost of this
       component at appraisal was estimated at $208.9 million, of which Bank financing
       was to be $100 million and Global Environment Facility (GEF) financing was to
       be $3 million.

    · A PV component, consisting of an investment subcomponent that provided sub-
       grants for sales of 10 MW peak (MWp) of PV systems, a PV market development
       subcomponent to overcome PV market barriers and an institutional strengthening
       subcomponent focusing on improving quality of PV equipment, certification and
       standards and project management and monitoring. Total cost of this component
       was estimated at $155.9 million, of which $22 million was to be financed by the
       GEF.

    · A technology improvement (TI) component, consisting of an investment
       subcomponent under which wind and PV manufacturers were to be provided cost-
       shared grants to foster innovation, cost reduction and quality improvement and an
       institutional strengthening subcomponent for program management and
       monitoring. Total cost of this component was estimated at $79.6 million, of
       which $10 million was to be financed by the GEF.

1.8 Revised Components

The restructured project consisted of the same three components, with the wind farm and
TI components being modified as follows:

    · The wind farm component, consisting of an investment subcomponent financing
       20 MW of wind capacity at two sites in Shanghai, and a technical assistance
       subcomponent to support management of the planned wind farms and preparatory
       work on large coastal sites. Total cost of this modified component was estimated
       at $24.7 million, of which Bank financing was to be $13 million and GEF
       financing was to be $1.5 million.

    · The TI component, consisting of an investment subcomponent only for PV
       manufacturers, but with similar design as before. The institutional strengthening
       subcomponent remained unchanged. Total cost of this component was estimated
       at $24.8 million, of which $3.5 million was to be financed by the GEF.

1.9 Other significant changes

A number of changes were made in the course of implementation:

    · In June 2003, the Market Development Support Facility (MDSF) was introduced,
       at the suggestion of the PMO and participating PV companies, aimed at providing
       cost-shared grants to participating PV companies to assist them to improve their



                                           3

        commercial skills and develop their markets. There was also a reallocation of
        amounts between expenditure categories and procurement arrangements for wind
        and PV components to allow procurement of goods and to create an Incremental
        Operating Costs category.

    · In November 2003, to change the denomination of the GEF grant from Special
        Drawing Rights (SDR) to US Dollars, in line with a Bank wide reform.

    · In May 2005, following the mid-term review (MTR), to extend the PV project
        area to include two additional provinces: Yunnan and Sha'anxi; and one additional
        autonomous region: Ningxia. It also increased the PV sub-grant from $1.50 for
        modules meeting the project standards to $2/Wp for modules meeting
        international standards, namely IEC 61215-1993, and the Chinese equivalent, GB
        9535-1998, which by this time could be met by a number of Chinese PV module
        manufacturers.

    · In September 2005, it was agreed to drop the credit pilot; no amendment to the
        legal agreements was made for this change.

    · In September 2006, to extend the implementation period for the PV and TI
        components by one year, to compensate for delays that had accumulated during
        implementation and to allow full achievement of the development objective.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The choice of areas for support ­ wind and PV ­ was based on thorough analysis. The
project design was based on analysis of the Chinese context in addition to the work
mentioned in Section 1.1. The Bank's extensive engagement in the conventional power
sector in both investment and in policy over many years and specific Bank experience of
wind projects (primarily in India) informed the work on the wind farms. Design of the
PV component was based on an assessment of the market for renewable energy in rural
areas of northwestern China and took into account lessons learned from PV projects in
Argentina, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. The first hand experience of team members who
had managed similar programs in the Netherlands and UK was used to design the TI
component.

Project design focused on market development for renewable energy, relying on a
traditional method for wind, but on innovative output based and cost sharing mechanisms
for PV and TI. In this context, the PDO was appropriate given the size of the markets at
the time. The separation of the wind and PV components was sound, considering the
different implementing agencies, approach and purposes. Government commitment to
the design and approach were strong.

The project was acknowledged to be a high-risk, high-payoff operation, using novel
designs and techniques, particularly in its emphasis on technology development and in its


                                            4

reliance on the market and individual companies operating in the sub-sectors addressed.
The process of what would now be called adaptive management was recognized in the
project documentation and in the structures set up to manage the project.

The novelty of the design of the PV and TI components led to a number of
implementation issues. No amount of preparation could have anticipated all of them and
there was limited, if any, experience worldwide on which to draw. These issues are
discussed in more detail in the implementation section below.

Quality Assurance Group (QAG) reviewed quality at entry and found the project to be
highly satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

Implementation took some time to get under way and was assessed, twice, as
unsatisfactory during the period between Board approval and signing of the loan and
grant agreements.

The risk that power purchase agreements (PPAs) would not be agreed or maintained was
identified during preparation and was considered manageable based on the experience of
the task team with other power sector projects in China. Uncertainties about the
ownership of the wind farms to be developed and about how to share the incremental cost
of wind generated electricity from the Huitengxile and Pingtan wind farms led to a delay
in signing the PPAs, first noted in December 1999. Differing views among government
departments created an impasse around which it proved difficult to find a way.

Eventually, in March 2001 Ministry of Finance (MoF) requested that the wind farm
component consist only of the Shanghai wind farms. The Pingtan wind farm was also
dropped at this point for unconnected reasons: a government instruction that no trees
were to be cut down for any project development was being strictly enforced at the time.
After the subsequent restructuring the move to implementation went smoothly, with
effectiveness being declared in December 2001.

Implementation progress was generally satisfactory although it was disrupted by the
SARS epidemic in 2003, which restricted travel to and within China.

Wind Component

Institutional and procurement issues caused delay. After the restructuring, Shanghai
Municipal Electric Power Company (SMEPC) and its subsidiary special-purpose wind
farm company (Shanghai Wind Power Company ­ SWPC) became responsible for
implementation. Neither had experience of wind farm development or of single-
responsibility contracting for wind farms under which one contractor ­ in this case the
wind turbine supplier ­ took responsibility for the supply of the turbines and the design
and supervision of the construction of the foundations and the design and layout of the
balance of plant but with these latter two carried out by other contractors. The project
financed a study tour to European wind farms for managers of SMEPC and SWPC



                                            5

followed by face to face discussions with the regional procurement staff. The study tour
was effective in clearing up doubts about the merits of using a single-responsibility
contract.

Site changes caused delays to one wind farm. There was a delay caused by the
decision to move the Nanhui wind farm some kilometers south of its original site, to
increase the safety distance from the new Pudong International Airport. A change of the
capacities of the wind farm sites such that the wind farm in Chongming was reduced to
4.5 MW and the Nanhui wind farm was increased to 15.5 MW (for a total of 21MW) did
not affect implementation.

Finalization of the power purchase agreement took longer than expected. Under
Chinese rules, the price and quantity of electricity can only be provisionally agreed
following commissioning of the power plant, and firmed up one year after the start of
commercial operation. Both wind farms entered commercial operation on December 1,
2005. Production was slightly below forecast in 2006 but within expected variations due
to lower wind conditions.

The institutional strengthening component was implemented satisfactorily. Tasks
were generally performed according to priority, for example ensuring that the work to
support physical implementation was done before longer-term scaling-up issues were
addressed. The mid term review (MTR) noted that two major tasks, the wind resource
measurement and the development of an education center had not yet been started but
these were completed by the close of the wind component in June 2006.

PV Component

The PMO was formed before effectiveness and its staff had started working with
participating PV companies during preparation. The PMO monitored participating
companies, their performance and the market well throughout the lifetime of the project.
PMO staff felt it would have been helpful to have an initial training and organizational
period rather than launching straight into implementation.

More effort than expected was needed for project start-up. Signing up an initial 16
participating companies, and initiating the procedures by which PV sub-grants could be
claimed, verified, and paid required substantial effort. Teething problems that emerged
and resolved early in implementation included refining system eligibility criteria,
ensuring that the management information system (MIS) captured all relevant
information and preparing a labeling system so that components could be tracked.

Slow system sales were an initial problem. Caused in part by project delays resulting
from the creation of NDRC and the SARS epidemic companies had difficulty scaling up
sales. Average system size did not grow as expected either. Several participating PV
companies did not make high levels of eligible sales. The response included recruiting
additional participating PV companies, widening the project area to cover additional
provinces and autonomous regions and increasing the sub-grant for systems using



                                            6

modules that met international standards. Dropping under-performing companies was
considered but not pursued on the grounds that they could still contribute to market
development.

Increasing competition and the Market Development Support Facility (MDSF)
improved sales. These had positive impacts particularly in the last two years as
participating companies became more competitive and component shortages eased. The
competitive approach and technology neutrality were important factors. Several other
restructurings were undertaken to introduce improvements, including the MDSF aimed at
helping participating companies improve their commercial skills and build the market.

There was no pilot of credit mechanisms as originally planned. This was for two
reasons. First, and possibly unique to the western provinces of China, the cash market for
PV systems is large and the participating companies concentrated on these. Second,
following extensive study of the credit markets, the PMO and task team concluded that
the time needed to introduce the changes into the project would leave insufficient time for
a satisfactory pilot.

TI Component

The competitive grant facility (CGF) went smoothly. The use of a CGF, in which
participating TI companies could apply for cost-shared grants to improve quality or
reduce cost of PV components, was implemented in a series of four annual rounds. In
each round about half of all proposals were funded at a rate of between 25 and 30 percent
of the total activity cost. After the first year, the calls for proposals covered focal areas
which had been identified as quality and cost bottlenecks for PV systems.

The parallel quick-response facility (QRF) did not work as expected. Originally
conceived to shorten processing time to meet urgent financing needs of the grantees, it
turned out to be incompatible with the approval procedures of GoC and the Bank. It
ended up funding similar projects to the CGF. The mid-term review noted these
shortcomings; with hindsight, it may have been more effective to eliminate the QRF to
free up scarce GEF funds and PMO resources to concentrate on other aspects of the
component.

PMO-managed work to support quality improvement was effective. By providing
testing services, developing standards and mechanisms to ensure compliance with them,
and improving capacity to test and certify PV components and systems the support
worked as intended. This task was initiated during preparation and continued throughout
implementation. Timing and adapting this work to the needs of the market proved to be
difficult but the step by step approach was appreciated by stakeholders.

An initial disconnect between PV and TI quality improvement had to be solved.
Initially there was a disconnect between general quality improvement initiatives
supported by the TI component and ensuring quality for the PV systems receiving a PV
subgrant. Earlier development of testing and certification capacity might have benefited



                                              7

overall efforts to improve quality in the industry at large and among participating PV
companies alike. Whether this would have resolved the disconnect is difficult to know
even with hindsight, because success would have been dependent on the PV companies'
readiness and capacity to make improvements in quality.

Two QAG assessments took place: one in the first year after approval but before
effectiveness, which rated supervision satisfactory; and the second shortly after mid-term
which rated supervision highly satisfactory.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

Some of the indicators at the PDO and GEO level were not well connected to the project
or global objectives and were not easy to collect. The PDO indicators were, with one
exception covering quality, forecasts for the growth of wind and PV across the whole of
China and were based on, in the restructured project, figures for 2009. One PDO
indicator and one GEO indicator used forecasts of avoided pollutant emissions, also for
the whole of China.

Attribution of the project's contribution to these indicators is not possible other than the
direct reductions, primarily from the wind farm, which forms only a small proportion of
the total. This consequently creates difficulties in evaluating the project against the PDO
and GEO indicators. As practised today now that the start of the art of M&E has further
developed, more focused indicators may have been useful, particularly those focused on
the impacts of the project itself rather than sector-wide effects.

M&E Implementation

M&E implementation was carried out thoroughly. Relatively simple indicators for the
wind component were easily collected and provided for each supervision mission by
SWPC. Monitoring of the PV component depended mainly on information generated by
the MIS. Initially the PMO did not pay sufficient attention to this aspect, resulting in an
ISR rating of unsatisfactory for M&E in late 2003. This proved to be effective in
focusing efforts on timely tracking and reporting. Following the MTR PV and TI
components were monitored at each supervision, particularly system sales, and system
capacity and progress in CGF and technology support activities.

M&E Utilization

The M&E design was based on the earlier logical framework approach which makes use
of outputs rather than intermediate indicators. Hence intermediate indicators were
relevant to measurement of the project's implementation progress and used for that
purpose. For the wind farm component progress in construction of the wind farm and
subsequent electricity production were easy to monitor and well linked to planned project
outputs. Enabling environment indicators for the wind sector were also measurable and
easy to monitor through normal supervision processes.



                                             8

Similarly, the output measures for the PV and TI components were useful for gauging
project progress and helping the PMO and the Bank to focus on areas of implementation
that were lagging. PDO indicators were used at MTR to evaluate likelihood of
achievement of the project and global objectives.

At mid-term the possibility of adjusting the M&E indicator values was considered by the
PMO, task team and Bank management but was rejected.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

There was one temporary problem with environmental safeguards. The ISR rating for
safeguards compliance was downgraded to unsatisfactory and brought to the attention of
the executing agency and concerned government departments when SMEPC/SWPC
failed to undertake the environmental assessment after the decision to change the wind
farm site at Nanhui. The approach was effective in ensuring full compliance with all
environmental requirements before the start of construction.

Fiduciary

Fiduciary compliance was satisfactory, with all procurement following Bank policies.
All audits and financial management reports were provided on time, with the exception of
the accounts for SMEPC and SWPC and project accounts for the wind farm component
in 2003, which were delayed as a result of the SARS epidemic.

The main fiduciary challenge was in the PV component in ensuring that PV sub-grants
claimed were for eligible systems. Initial verification plans relied on a combination of
physical checks with purchasers of PV systems and physically tracking PV systems
through the manufacturing and distribution process. Physical verification by field visits
proved to be impractical. The main purchasers of systems are semi-nomadic, live in
extremely remote areas and speak different languages and dialects from those selling
systems. Consequently finding a system once it had been sold was near impossible and
in any event extremely costly; after two attempts at physical verification, it was
abandoned.

Following the decision to abandon physical investigation, the verification system was
overhauled and reviewed by a consultant. In addition to the physical tracking by serial
number of the PV module from start of manufacture through to completion of retail sales,
the PMO improved tracking of stock records and financial monitoring. It worked well,
since the verification process was able to detect and weed out ineligible systems. It also
detected one apparent case of fraud by a participating PV company which falsified bank
statements used as part of the financial verification process. Subsequent investigation by
forensic accountants found no evidence that any payments had been made that were not
due to the company but that the fraudulent claim had been detected and payment




                                           9

prevented, suggesting that the verification was working as needed. The company was
removed from participation in REDP by the PMO.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Wind Component

TA during preparation and implementation supported formal training and on the job
experience in operations and maintenance for the wind farm. Combined with a 'green
electricity' pilot program in Shanghai, which pays a premium for wind generated
electricity funded by consumers which want to demonstrate their commitment to the
environment, the cost of electricity supplied to SMEPC is fully recovered. The PPA is
for a term of 20 years, which is the planned lifetime of the wind farms. Based on the
financial analysis of the wind farms and SWPC in Annex 3 the company appears to be
financially sound and sustainable.

Recognition of the difficulties encountered in putting in place the power purchase
arrangements for the wind farms was one of the reasons for the development of the
GoC/GEF/World Bank China Renewable Energy Scale-up Program (CRESP) which
started in 2000. Throughout preparation and since its approval in FY05, CRESP has built
on the lessons learned from REDP and is contributing to the sustained scale up of
renewable energy in China, as well as financing further wind power capacity.

As both SWPC and SMEPC have an interest in output from the wind farms, this is
monitored carefully and suitable data about wind farm performance are available from
both parties. Such is the worldwide interest in the wind sector in China that several
specialized consultants and journals regularly monitor and report on sector performance.

PV Component

The transition for participating PV companies receiving output-based assistance in REDP
to fully commercial operations was started in the closing two years of the project. From
about mid-2006 communications and support to participating PV companies began to
focus on post-REDP sustainability. PV companies' requests for MDSF support
increasingly centered on developing their markets, extending and improving their
distribution networks and improving their products with a corresponding reduction in
their efforts to improve their commercial skills. The supporting programs also shifted
focus on supporting, for example, the development of a Chinese quality mark, the
'Golden Sun' for PV systems and components which enjoyed considerable take up by
market participants.

Monitoring of the market prices of systems showed that most of the participating
companies began to increase prices by five to ten percent in 2007. The output-based
support in REDP was about 10-15 percent of the cost of systems but companies were able
to limit the increase to this level as the PV module and battery price rises that took place
in 2005-06 began to moderate or decline. The strengthening of the Yuan against the US
dollar also helped to limit the influence of the subsidy in Yuan terms.



                                            10

The GoC has continued to support off-grid rural electrification, and is expected to
continue to do so as it strives towards its 2020 goal of universal electrification in which
PV will play an increasing role. The market is now self-sustaining, and thus further
additional support is not required.

With the increasing maturity of the market, several commercial firms have started to
monitor and report on it. Indicators of volume, prices and profitability of firms are
available from a number of sources, obviating the need for a formal monitoring program.

TI Component

The TI component provided one-off gains to PV equipment suppliers, which incorporated
the improvements funded in new products of higher quality and lower price which have
now entered the marketplace.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

Because the project was restructured before signing, and therefore before any
disbursements were made, outcomes have been rated by applying a weight of zero to pre-
restructuring outcomes and full weight to post-restructuring outcomes.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Climate change is today one of the (if not the) major global priorities and China's ability
to contribute to its mitigation both as an emitter and as a supplier of mitigation is
increasingly recognized domestically and internationally. Few question that renewable
energy will play an increasing role in climate change mitigation, and there is consensus
that market driven renewable energy development is most sorely needed.

Most importantly, development of renewable energy is unquestioned in China: the
country has committed to the development of 30 GW of wind and biomass capacity each
and 1.8 GW of PV capacity, all by 2020. Following REDP's success, China has used PV
for its own large-scale rural electrification program, including for mini-grids in towns and
villages, and is now exploring ways to develop grid connected PV. Market based
approaches and competition are now recognized in China as the best means to achieve
sustained renewables development and reduce costs.

One of the pillars of the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for China during
2006-10 is to manage resource scarcity and environmental constraints to the country's
future growth. The Bank also committed during the Bonn renewable energy conference
(in 2004) to increase its lending for energy efficiency and renewable energy by 20
percent each year between 2005 and 2009. Development of renewable energy remains
one of GEF's strategic objectives to reduce GHG emissions and mitigate climate change
threats.




                                            11

The Bank continues its engagement in the renewable energy sector in China. The
government developed a comprehensive Renewable Energy Law with Bank assistance,
among others, during the preparation of CRESP. CRESP also financed 200 MW of grid
connected wind-farms on two of the sites originally planned under REDP, a 25 MW pilot
biomass project and rehabilitation of small hydropower units. A GEF grant is being used
for supporting technical assistance which has adapted the TI approach to lower
construction costs for state-of-the-art wind farms and biomass.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

As an innovative project from both the Chinese and World Bank perspective, some
problems in launch and implementation were to have been expected. Notwithstanding
the difficult start, the impact of the project has been considerable.

Wind Component

The Shanghai wind farms, despite their small size, demonstrated the commercial viability
of well designed, procured and constructed wind farms. By the construction of 21 MW
of capacity and its subsequent operation, the outputs were as forecast (Intermediate
Indicator 1, Annex 2 part A). SWPC is now trained and effective (Intermediate Indicator
4), evidence for which is that it has further developed one of the Shanghai sites.
Shanghai municipal government has developed plans for 200MW of additional capacity
by 2010 (Intermediate Indicator 5 and Annex 7). The wind farms have became a model
for procurement and operation of wind farms by Long Yuan, a shareholder in SWPC and
the developer of the 100 MW wind-farm in Pingtan (Fujian Province) financed by the
Bank in CRESP, and at least one other non-Bank financed project of 150MW in the
coastal areas of Jiangsu province.

The contribution of wind farms to avoided emissions has been substantial with them
exceeding the target for NOx, and meeting it for TSP. By contrast the amount of SO2
avoided is substantially below expectations (PDO Indicator 1) possibly because of
enforcement of tough SO2 emissions regulations introduced during the project lifetime.
By the end of 2008, wind capacity installed in China had reached 10GW, about 12 times
forecast and generation about 103TWh, or 7 times that forecast (PDO Indicators 2 and 4)
and China had the fourth largest installed capacity in the world, accounting for about ten
percent of the total.

PV Component

The PV Component achieved its expected outputs and development objectives with
REDP verified sales exceeding 400,000 units with an aggregate capacity of 11.1MWp
compared with the objective of 350,000 systems and a capacity of 10MWp (Intermediate
Indicators 2 and 3). The project helped establishing a sustainable PV market in the north
western region of China. Drawing from the discussion in Annex 2 part B on the PV
component, indications of the vibrancy and sustainability of the market are as follows:




                                             12

    · Size. Sales of verified systems have grown during the project, indicating a strong
        market with no signs of saturation. Compared with the situation at appraisal when
        the market was thought to be about a quarter of the size it is today, there is
        evidence of strong market growth.
    · Concentration. Of the 18 most active PV companies, the four-firm concentration
        ratio (the market share held by the top four companies and a proxy for
        competition) is about 37 percent. PV module suppliers have a lower ratio of
        about 29 percent. In 1997, one year before appraisal, the four-firm concentration
        ratio was 51 percent. In other words, competition has increased.
    · Price competition. Price competition remains intense, with wholesale to retail
        markups in the range of nine to 13 percent.
    · Innovation and Quality. The range of product offering ­ while difficult to
        measure quantitatively ­ appears to have increased over the project lifetime, with
        a wider range of sizes of system, innovative products tailored to consumer needs,
        and a wide range of viable business models.
    · New Segments. With Government support, the Chinese market has broadened to
        include mini-grid and grid-connected systems, especially in remoter areas which
        increases both the scope of the market and its size, while also providing further
        incentives for innovation and quality improvement.

The evidence of a link between the PV component and market development is strong.
The 18 most active PV companies all grew significantly during the project period and are
now thought to share a market in northwestern China worth about $22 million per year
(100,000-135,000 systems per year), strong evidence that the 625,000 systems sold
forecast for end of project (PDO Indicator 3), has been achieved by participating PV
companies alone, given that they reported verified and unverified sales of 500,000
systems up to the end of 2007.

The total installed capacity of PV in China is estimated to be 80MWp, compared with
20MWp (PDO Indicator 4) forecast at the start of the project, of which participating PV
companies are known to have supplied at least 12 percent. In aggregate they doubled the
number of employees and sales revenues more than trebled. REDP-compliant sales form
a significant proportion of the total sales reported by companies, suggesting that the
market growth was linked to the improved quality, availability and suitability of the
systems fostered under REDP.

TI Component

The TI component exceeded its output indicators. Seventy-four component
manufacturers meet quality standards, compared with the 30 expected, and 18 companies
offer PV systems that meet international standards (PDO Indicator 5). It contributed to
the achievement of the PDO by improving the quality of a significant number of PV
system components, by developing the capacity to test to international standards and by
ensuring standards are enforced (Intermediate Indicators 6 and 7). Project PV standards
were adopted as national standards (Intermediate Indicator 8) and then higher,
international standards were adopted.



                                             13

Of a planned 200 technology improvement activities, 197 were carried out (Intermediate
Indicator 9) and 95 percent met or exceeded their aim compared with the target of 80
percent meeting their aim (Intermediate Indicator 10), resulting in an estimated $187
million investment in production of the improvements, 12 times the original target
(Intermediate Indicator 11).

Measuring the direct impact of these activities is difficult but it is notable that several of
the companies supported by the project have enjoyed substantial growth and increasing
market share as the worldwide demand for PV systems has expanded. China now exports
PV systems, proof that many companies are now meeting international standards; several
of these companies were beneficiaries of the TI component.

Global Environment Objectives

The global environment objective to reduce greenhouse gases (which with other
pollutants was also a sector-related CAS goal) was more than fully achieved primarily as
a result of the rapid growth in wind farm capacity in China over the period of the project
with avoided CO2 emissions estimated to be 130 million tonnes, compared with an
expected 38.6 million tonnes (GEO Indicator 1). The direct contribution of the Shanghai
wind farms to the achievement of the target was modest at an estimated 33,700 tonnes per
year or about 700,000 tonnes over the project lifetime. The question of attribution of the
demonstration effects of the project to the wider achievement of the target cannot be
effectively answered in a report of this nature.

Cost reductions in the renewable energy technologies were mixed. The installed cost of
wind capacity (GEO Indicator 2) was the same at the end of the project as at the start, at
$1,300/kW compared with a target of $900/kW for the end of project. Installed cost of
the Shanghai wind farm was $1,264/kW, however estimates suggest that in 2002-2003
installed cost of a typical wind farm probably fell to about $860/kW before climbing
again as a result of turbine shortages and the rise in the value of the Euro.

PV systems costs (GEO Indicator 3) started at about $16/Wp and had fallen to $9 by
project close, well below the target of $11/Wp (Annex 2, Figure A2.5) despite materials
shortages caused by the worldwide increase in demand. Because this is based on data
from participating PV companies, the project linkage is strong since it is clear that these
companies collectively dominate the market for off-grid PV. In turn, these companies
attribute cost reductions to their own efforts, part financed by the project to compete and
innovate.

No separate indicator was established for the fourth GEO objective of removing barriers
to the large-scale commercialization of wind and PV technologies. It would, nonetheless,
be hard to argue other than that both wind and PV are fully commercial in China, based
on the analysis of the PDO indicators together. In both technologies there are large and
growing markets in which genuinely commercial transactions take place. In the PV
market this is wholly unsubsidized. In the wind sector, market support ­ including for



                                           14

example mandated market shares ­ have been introduced through the Renewable Energy
Law, which ensure that turbine suppliers and developers operate under strongly
competitive conditions and respond to commercial incentives.

These different cost outcomes underline the consequences of choosing a cost target as an
indicator of impact when market conditions are exogenous to the project. It also
illustrates how, in far exceeding expected installed capacity, a PDO indicator and in
consequence GEO Indicator 1, there has been a shortfall in GEO indicator 2.

3.3 Efficiency

Wind Farms

The wind farm component covers the full loan amount of $13 million. Economic and
performance at appraisal and completion and financial performance at completion are
compared in Table 1.

            3 CO2 valued at $15/ton.

The justification at appraisal for proceeding with the wind farms was for the
demonstration effects, even though they were not economic; this was formalized at
restructuring by assuming a willingness to pay for the demonstration benefits by the
Shanghai authorities that made the project economically viable.

The improvement to economic and financial returns ex post are the result of a higher than
anticipated 'regular' tariff being agreed for the project by SMEPC, of Y0.897/kWh (taken
in the economic analysis to represent willingness to pay). In addition, a 'green' electricity
scheme was introduced during implementation, with Bank support though under separate
funding. In the scheme, environmentally-conscious firms and households can voluntarily
pay a premium for wind-generated electricity, which accounts for about 25 percent of
total wind farm output. The premium sets the tariff at approximately Y1.15/kWh. Only
if the avoided cost of coal is taken as the economic benefit of the generation, implicitly


                                             15

not taking into account actual willingness to pay for wind electricity or any environment
externalities, is the project not efficient. This is discussed in more detail in Annex 3.

The NPV is presented at 12 percent discount rate for ex-ante and ex-post comparison
purposes. It should be noted, however, that the current discount rate applied by NDRC
for national projects is eight percent; the NPV would be commensurately higher at this
lower discount rate.

Actual costs were nearly identical to forecast, despite some delays in procurement and
higher than expected turbine foundation costs. The benefits of the demonstration effect ­
which include the learning about foundations ­ cannot be assessed in financial or
economic terms, but as discussed elsewhere have been positive, given the plans for
further development of wind in Shanghai.

Of the TA associated with the wind farms component, a total of $600,000 which was
directly attributable to the wind farms themselves has been included in the analysis. The
balance (of $900,000) has not been included in this analysis because the activities
financed were not associated with the wind farms, but aimed at supporting further
development of wind in Shanghai.

PV and TI Component

No economic or financial analysis was carried out at appraisal, because it was considered
at the time that the PV systems were to be sold in areas where there were no viable
alternatives.

About 60 percent of the total GEF financing was for the direct PV grant support; most of
the rest was for indirect support of market development and technology improvement
activities, and for project management. The ex post analysis covers the full amount of
the grant allocated to the PV and TI components, totaling $25.5 million. All TI
expenditures were allocated against the verified PV systems sold under the project. This
conservative assumption did not take into account any systems sold during the last six
months of the project, sales by companies participating in the project which were not
eligible (such as domestic sales to non-project provinces, or exports). Nor were spillover
effects ­ whereby other companies benefit from TI and market development ­ included in
the analysis.

With these conservative assumptions, the economic rate of return on the systems sold is
estimated at 93.4% including global environment externalities using the willingness to
pay method. The corresponding financial return to the purchases is 88%. The returns are
robust to PV system life, levels of carbon emission reduction, and assumptions about
willingness to pay. These high returns are supported by three observations from the
market. First, systems are bought for cash, which suggests a high benefit perceived by
households. Second, the cost of the PV system is modest compared with income. Third,
the initial cost of a PV system in China is much lower than in other countries.

The economic analysis is presented in depth in Annex 3, and in turn relies on information
in Annex 5, drawn from beneficiary surveys.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Achievement of PDO is rated Satisfactory

All the PDO indicators have been achieved except the abatement of SO2 emissions which
was less than expected. Intermediate indicators have also all been achieved or exceeded
though in some cases late ­ the wind farm entry into service, preparation of wind farm
plans, the PV testing facilities and some minor shortfalls in wind farm staff training and
TI projects. The project was economically and financially efficient and the objectives of
the project are today of higher relevance to global priorities, GoC's sustainable
development objectives, the Bank's assistance strategy for China and its corporate goals.

Given that there are minor shortcomings, balanced by other achievements above
expectations, good efficiency and relevance, a rating of Satisfactory is justified.

Achievement of GEO is rated Moderately Satisfactory

Two of the three GEO objectives, avoided CO2 emissions and cost reduction for PV, have
been exceeded by a considerable margin, but that for wind was not. Barriers to
commercialization have been demonstrably reduced. These were accomplished in an
efficient way, while focus on global environment and climate change has grown in China,
the Bank and the wider global community in the lifetime of the project, with a strong
emphasis on mitigation. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to bring down
the long term costs of renewable energy technologies continue, with increased focus on
those which are commercially ready.

Given that all but one of the objectives has been exceeded by a wide margin, but that one
objective has not been achieved, the project was Moderately Satisfactory in achieving its
global objective.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project did not have a poverty alleviation objective and so poverty impacts were not
monitored. Nonetheless, the surveys reported in Annex 5 indicates that on average
purchasers of SHS have only slightly higher incomes on the population as a whole
(median income of SHS purchasing households of Y13,000 per year compared with a
median for the population as a whole of Y12,000). Moreover even the poorest quintile of
households reported purchasing SHS.

Hence many of the more than two million people in western China who benefited from
access to modern electricity through PV systems delivered under the project were poor.
The survey reports that 95 percent of SHS users claim that the system has increased their
incomes, though only 15 percent claim the increase is significant. Although further


                                           17

quantitative analysis of this unexpected finding is not possible with the survey data
available, there are strong indications that poverty impacts have been achieved among a
considerable number of people.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

During project implementation, China's interest in scaling up renewable energy grew
stronger. REDP was followed by CRESP which focused on institutional issues and long
term sustainability of grid-connected renewable energy in China. The renewable energy
law took effect in 2006 and was followed by several regulations promoting the
development of renewable energy with a major focus on wind, including onshore wind
farms of one GW or more and plans for offshore development. Several lessons drawn
from REDP informed these institutional changes.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

While the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) noted that the project, if successful, could
affect PV prices globally, the Chinese PV sector has undergone a transformation in the
past ten years:

     · Some of beneficiaries of the TI grant have become major players in the
         international market. Some are listed on stock exchanges in Europe and the US
         and are operating in markets the Europe, Japan and the US. China is now the
         second largest producer of PV equipment in the world, and the third largest
         exporter.
     · At the 2007 European PV Industry Exhibition, Chinese companies were the third
         largest cohort of exhibitors, and at the May 2008 Lighting Africa Conference in
         Accra Ghana, 30 Chinese companies exhibited off-grid lighting products.
     · Some REDP supported companies have won competitive bids for World Bank
         financed PV systems in Lao PDR, Mongolia and Papua New Guinea.

Attribution is difficult to assess; these companies would likely have succeeded without
the small grants provided by the TI component. However, it is clear that their exposure
through REDP to international industry experts and the incentives provided to focus on
quality contributed to, and most probably accelerated, their success. Many of the
unintended positive impacts of REDP are documented in a paper prepared at the request
of the MoF entitled "Photovoltaics, An Innovation Success Story."

A two-tier market for wind equipment has developed in China. One follows best
international practice, but the second tier relies on local suppliers of turbines using older
technology which do not meet international standards. Some developers use these to
maximize installed capacity rather than power generation. As with any new and fast-
growing market this is to some extent unavoidable, but to the extent that the wind
component helped foster a general interest in wind it has contributed to this.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops


PV and TI Components

Because of the innovative nature of the PV and TI components, the closing stages of the
project sought feedback from participating PV companies, TI companies, buyers of SHS
and others to draw out lessons for future projects of this kind. While not required for a
core ICR, the findings are recorded, for future projects of this kind.

Beneficiaries are mostly animal herders or farmers, having paid Y700 ­ 1,000 for an
18-25Wp system within the past five years. They report that:

    · Over 60 percent are satisfied or moderately satisfied with their systems.
    · The systems provide either great or some improvement to their lives and incomes.
    · Over 90 percent of those who have given up systems did so because the gained
        access to the grid or otherwise no longer need them

Stakeholder discussions find that:

    · Project participants ­ PV and TI companies alike ­ found that the design and
        implementation of those parts of the project relevant to them met their needs,
        were fair, transparent and well administered.
    · Slowness in verification and disbursement was a common problem.
    · The work of the PMO was highly rated.

More detail may be found in Annex 5 which describes the beneficiary surveys and Annex
6 which describes the stakeholder discussions.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment
Outcome

Rating: Negligible to Low

The risks to sustaining the development outcomes are minimal and longer term
sustainability of the achievements of REDP are highly likely.

Development of wind based electricity is now among the highest priorities of the Chinese
government. The industry is growing strongly and challenging targets have been set by
the government for on-shore wind and interest for off-shore wind is growing. Pricing
arrangements for wind are covered by the renewable energy law and the government is
developing policies to encourage local manufacturing capabilities, reduce cost and
increase the competitiveness of wind-based electricity.

The policy and market frameworks for PV are in place: demand growth is strong and
stable, technology and business capabilities have been substantially strengthened,



                                           19

investments are being sustained by the private sector, and quality products are available.
The high number of suppliers ensures sustained competition and downward pressure on
price.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The QAG Quality at Entry Panel noted that "while the project approach is audacious, the
Bank team is well aware of the risks, and has worked hard to devise strategies to manage
risks to the extent possible. The Panel commended the team for its creativity, openness
to outside ideas, and above all its candor in the process of developing the project. The
quality of project documentation and technical analysis is excellent..." The Panel rated
quality at entry Highly Satisfactory and considered preparation to have been best
practice.

The QAG review took place after Board approval but before project restructuring ­ in
other words when the PPA issue was known. Preparation had estimated the chance of the
PPA risk materializing as low, which was judicious and well flagged and consciously
accepted. The reaction of the corporate entities at the central, regional and provincial
levels of SPCC was stronger, and government willingness to intervene weaker, than
expected. The Bank was proactive in its efforts to find ways around the impasse,
developed an effective contingency plan which was implemented through restructuring.

The Bank overestimated the power companies' understanding of the specific
characteristics of wind projects. The original project design relied on goods and works
procurement and the use of SPCC's expertise to integrate the wind farms. This was not in
line with wind industry practice, but was felt during preparation to be manageable given
SPCC's extensive engineering skills and experience, albeit limited, of wind farm
development. The more usual single responsibility approach was adopted following the
restructuring.

During implementation of the PV component, two minor shortcomings that might have
been given more attention and addressed during preparation became apparent:

    · The excessive effort and cost of the physical verification of PV systems was
        presaged when the market survey was conducted in the winter. This should have
        alerted the team that verification through physical visits, as used in similar bank
        projects in other countries, was not appropriate for trying to reach people in
        northwestern China who were by and large semi-nomadic, living in some of the
        most remote least populated parts of the planet.




                                            20

    · The level of support needed for participating PV companies so that they could
        become effective commercial entities proved to be significantly more difficult
        than expected.

Taking into account the project's innovative profile these shortcomings are considered
minor especially in view of all the other dimensions of identification, preparation and of
appraisal and hence the overall rating of quality at entry is assessed as Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

A QAG panel judged the quality of supervision in FY 03-04 to be "...Highly Satisfactory
overall, with the focus on development effectiveness and the supervision inputs and
processes being the strongest aspects of the assessment." The panel also judged the
supervision of fiduciary and safeguard aspects of the project as well as project reporting
to be fully satisfactory.

The supervision team was adequately staffed and established excellent working relations
with all parties involved in the project implementation. Budgets were adequate and
benefited from additional TF support.

A pragmatic and flexible approach towards supervision was adopted. Faced with events,
unforeseen during preparation, that delayed the signing of the project, the team proposed
and Bank management approved the restructuring of the project to adapt it to the changed
institutional environment without compromising the development and global objectives.
The Bank continued to fine tune the project to changing conditions and to address
implementation issues based on feedback from stakeholders, especially participating
companies.

At the same time, the Bank was firm and persuasive when arrangements proposed by the
executing agencies threatened the quality of the project and/or the achievement of the
PDO or GEO. The change of the verification system is illustrative of the former and the
adoption of the single responsibility contract for procuring the wind farms in Shanghai is
illustrative of the latter. The Bank also maintained strong fiduciary oversight throughout
project implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Given a satisfactory performance during preparation and a highly satisfactory
performance during supervision, overall performance is rated Satisfactory.




                                           21

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The GoC's commitment to renewable energy started strongly and grew throughout
preparation and implementation. It remained committed to the project concept and
objectives even during the institutional rearrangements before restructuring and the
transition of the project from SETC to NDRC. Nonetheless, it could have done more to
avoid the need to restructure in the first place, especially had there been better
cooperation between all the parties and could have reacted more quickly to the changed
circumstances. The slow transition to NDRC delayed implementation of the PV and TI
components. It coordinated and supported project closing well. Overall rating of
government performance is judged to be just within the Moderately Satisfactory range.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Performance by SMEPC and SWPC was satisfactory. SWPC was established before
project start. The transfer of the wind farm implementation responsibilities from SMEPC
to SWPC after the separation of generation from transmission and distribution was
carried out smoothly without delaying the procurement and construction of the wind
farms. Both showed strong commitment to the project and cooperated with the Bank to
identify and address the issues hindering implementation in a timely manner. Monitoring
was carried out regularly and reported to the Bank. Transition to regular operations was
smooth

The PMO's performance was satisfactory. It was established and started working before
project signature. It quickly formed good working relations with and was highly rated by
participating PV and TI companies and other concerned agencies. It made commendable
efforts to develop a culture of quality and good service, established service standards and
monitored those standards. It made good use of management tools including the MIS and
its website for monitoring, guiding and managing the program. Fiduciary management
was satisfactory. It disseminated knowledge through periodic newsletters, a website,
numerous training and dissemination workshops and published two books: under REDP:
"The Sun and Us" in early 2005 and "Run with the Sun" mid-2008. It managed the
transition and closing of REDP well.

Participating PV companies were quite open to change, worked well with the small
business expert to improve their management practices and were involved and proactive
in adapting the TA components to meet their needs. TI companies were also proactive
and inventive, and took well to the cost-shared approach to TI. Their performance was
satisfactory.




                                            22

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Taking into consideration the satisfactory ratings for all the implementing agencies, and
that the performance of the Government falls within the moderately satisfactory range, a
moderately satisfactory rating overall is warranted.

6. Lessons Learned

Take specific country circumstances into account when designing off-grid
electrification. Lessons learned in other countries should be applied with caution.
Analytical work conducted during the early stages of preparation should not be confined
to market conditions, prices and affordability but should extend to technology options,
market and growth analysis, the need for credit and implementation arrangements.
Design of monitoring and evaluation should take into account practical implementation
issues (Sections 2.2. 2.3 and 2.4).

Foster synergies between market and technology development. Empower the market
participants through decision making; cost shared grants are particularly effective
whether for technology development or market development. Ensure fair and
transparent allocations in designing cost shared programs (Sections 2.2 and 3.2).

Adapt procurement method to implementing agency capacity and technology and
provide adequate support. For wind farms, especially when knowledge of the
technology has not taken root, single responsibility contracting methods are preferable.
Include support from consultants well versed in international best practice in
procurement and implementation (Sections 2.2 and 3.2).

Design TA programs to be flexible and responsive to changing circumstances.
Consideration should be given to adapting TA as the project implementing agency skills
and experience grows. Design the TA program so that changes can be implemented
quickly. Avoid designs which require frequent amendment of legal agreements
(Sections 1.8, 1.9, 2.2, 2.5 and 3.2).

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

                                    A. WIND COMPONENT

Wind Farms

The component financed a total of 21MW of wind generation capacity, on two sites. On
the Nanhui site, 11, 1.5MW wind turbines including their towers and foundations were
installed, together with wind farm electrical and control cabling, a control room, offices
and accommodation for wind farm staff and a switchyard and connection to the local
electricity grid. The Chongming wind farm of 3, 1.5MW wind turbines consisted of a
similar installation to that at Nanhui.

Following rolling commissioning of each turbine as soon as it was installed and
connected, the wind farms entered commercial operation on December 1, 2005. Some
teething troubles were encountered with the wind turbines, with one suffering from
misalignment of the gearbox and generator which necessitated remanufacturing the
generator. All gearbox oil cooling systems were retrofitted with extra heat exchangers
following initial gearbox overheating.

In the first year of operation (to November 2006), the wind farms produced 39.9 GWh.
Because of year-on-year variations in wind, it is too early to tell whether the long term
average annual production will equal the planned level of 42GWh. Wind turbine
availability was 98.3 percent (compared with the warranty value of 97 percent) and at 99
percent of the theoretical power curve (compared with a warranty value of 97 percent).

Installed cost was $1,264/kW, almost exactly half way between that estimated at
appraisal ($1,350/kW) and the estimate at restructuring ($1,160). Wind farm costs varied
significantly over the project period as the combined effects of the increase in demand
worldwide for wind turbines created shortages of supply. In China wind turbine prices
increased by about 50 percent between 2004 and 20071 while the Euro: US dollar
exchange rate fluctuated markedly between 2001 and 2003 (see figure A2.1), of
significance given that cost estimates were made in US Dollars and Chinese Yuan (which
was pegged to the US Dollars) while wind turbines are largely produced in the Euro zone
and priced in Euros.

At its lowest point, when turbine costs were about $600/kW in China in 2002-2003, an
'average' wind farm cost would have been about $860/kW, taking the normal benchmark
of turbine costs being 70 percent of total wind farm costs. That the Shanghai wind farms
did not reach this low point is in part due to the timing of the procurement ­ prices had
started to increase as a result of the increase in the value of the Euro ­ and in part because
of the unusual soil conditions in Shanghai, causing turbine foundation costs to be higher
than for normal wind farms.

Technical Assistance

Eight discrete technical assistance activities were planned, of which four were fully
completed and three partially completed. One activity was dropped.

Development of financial management system. It was planned to support the
development of a financial management system for SWPC. SWPC financed this activity
itself, so this activity was dropped and the budget was reallocated to the communications
and outreach package.

Operations and management support. The purpose of this activity was to help SWPC
develop its operations and management systems and standardize them. The technical
assistance supported visits to other wind farms in China and hiring consultants to assist in
the compilation of procedures. The procedures were prepared and adopted by SWPC.

Wind resource assessment in Shanghai. The technical assistance supported rehabilitation
of existing wind measurement equipment or the procurement of new equipment sufficient
for eight sites. Consultants were hired to collect and analyze the data, establish which
sites were suitable for wind farms, and prepare optimization studies for those sites where
wind farms were feasible. Based on this work, Shanghai municipal government adopted
a plan to develop 310MW of wind by 2010.

Effects of windpower on the grid. This activity aimed to establish the maximum level of
wind power that could be accepted by the grid without jeopardizing system stability. The


                                                                                 28

evaluation demonstrated that in the short term 300MW could be accepted, and that up to
1,000MW would be possible by 2020.

Communications and outreach. The purpose of this package was to broaden knowledge
of wind energy, particularly among school and university students. It financed several of
the exhibits at a visitor and education center constructed at the Nanhui site. By project
closing, some 46,000 people had visited the center, including nearly 30,000 school and
university students, and the center had won an award in 2006 for the best specialist
education center. Linked to the education center was funding for information
dissemination and the establishment of a website. The website had not been completed at
project closing.

Study tour. Early in the project implementation phase, senior staff from SMEPC and
SWPC attended a study tour in Europe and the US, which focused on best practices in
procurement and construction of wind farms. This was particularly valuable as SWPC
subsequently adopted a procurement approach based on supply and installation and bid
evaluation using whole life costs which has been replicated for two other wind farms
financed by the Bank.

Project management. One part of this was to provide international consultant assistance
to SWPC during procurement, and to support its supervision of the contractor during
construction and commissioning of the Nanhui and Chongming wind farms. This activity
was successfully completed. The second part was intended to support a scoping study for
offshore wind in the Shanghai area, but although terms of reference were agreed and a
consultant selected, the study was never carried out.

Optimization of foundations. Soil conditions in Shanghai are particularly difficult and
the foundations for the wind farms at Chongming and Nanhui had cost considerably more
than budgeted. A study was thus conducted to review the foundation options, with
particular emphasis on more economical designs.

                                     B. PV COMPONENT

More than two million people in western China have been provided with access to
modern electricity services through PV systems. Sales are concentrated in Tibet, Qinghai,
Sichuan and Xinjiang (Figure A2.2). Total PV systems sales reported by the PV
companies exceeded 500,000 with REDP-verified sales exceeding 400,000 units with an
aggregate capacity of 11.1 MWp compared with a goal of 350,000 units with a capacity
of 10 MWp (Figures A2.3 and A2.4).

Twenty eight PV companies actively participated as retailers of PV systems with
manufacturing and systems integration facilities and extensive distribution networks
reaching to the remotest parts of north western China. PV sales revenues by company
estimates grew more than four-fold; employment and distribution networks doubled.
Annual sales grew from about 40,000 units in the first year of the project, peaking at
100,000 by mid-term and declining to 80,000 in 2007 (due to PV module supply
constraints). Total sales of systems and average costs by year is shown in Table A2.1

An examination of seventeen of the most active participating PV companies found that:
    · Revenues grew 363 percent from 2002 to 2007 to Y225 million while sales in
       MWp expanded 651 percent from 0.9 MW to 6.6 MWp (indicating a significant
       reduction in costs or reluctance of companies to share actual revenue data);
    · Employees more than doubled from 378 to 843 and number of retail outlets
       tripled from 266 to 721;
    · High competition (market share of the top four companies was 37 percent),
       continues to keep margins low at about 13 percent and innovations high; and



                                                                             31

    · 14 companies invested in new and expanded factories and offices with factory
                           premises more than doubling to 12,000 m2 and office space increasing 50% to
                           6,000 m2.
    · At least 13 of the 28 companies have invested in small PV module laminating
                           plants as a way to secure access to module supplies, control costs and capture
                           more margins along the supply chain. However, as PV module manufacturing is
                           now a commodity business with significant economies of scale, the viability of
                           these small module lines is questionable.

China is the world's third largest manufacturer of PV modules with production capacity
of over 2,800 MWp a year compared with 10 MWp in 2000. Actual production in 2007
was 1,088 MWp of PV. Ten of the Chinese PV companies are listed on the New York
and London stock exchanges with a market capitalization of over US$24.4 billion on
May 15, 2008.

Exports of modules and systems are growing. Companies are undertaking aggressive
international marketing (at the 2007 European PV Industry Exhibition, Chinese
companies had the third highest number of exhibitors, and at the May 2008 Lighting
Africa Conference in Accra Ghana, 30 companies exhibited their off-grid lighting
products). They have so far, won Bank financed procurements in, Lao PDR Mongolia
and Papua New Guinea.

Consumer confidence coupled with increasing incomes and higher expectations is
reflected in the steady rise of the average size of PV systems purchased. After the first
three years of REDP where the average system size hovered around 20 Wp, it has
steadily risen to 45 Wp in 2007 Figure A2.5). For details of user responses, see
Beneficiary Survey Results section, later.

Average unit cost in Yuan declined up to 2004 and then rose due to PV module supply
constraints and price increases of batteries and other components due to the global surge
in commodity prices, as well as companies beginning to supply PV modules that meet the
higher quality standard (which was expected to add about $0.50/Wp or about a 12%
increase in module prices or 6% system price increase). The unit cost of a representative
20 Wp system declined to Y54/Wp in 2004 and then rose 30 percent to Y69/Wp. The
2007 unit price in dollar terms is $9/Wp, compared with $16/Wp before the project,
partly due to dollar depreciation (Figure A2.6).

The TI Component included:

            · Providing grants, on a cost sharing basis, from the Competitive Grant Facility
               (CGF) and the Quick Response Facility (QRF) for technology improvement
               investments proposed by PV component and system manufacturers to improve the
               quality of their products.
            · Funding activities initiated by the PMO for training, awareness, advisory
               activities, information dissemination, and comparative performance tests of
               components and systems. These activities were funded through the TI Program
               Support Facility.




                                                     33

The CGF and QRF

The CGF issued a request for proposals each year specifying (i) the type of priority
projects targeted that year; (ii) the available budget; (iii) the standard proposal format;
and (iv) the eligibility and the evaluation criteria. Proposals were evaluated, ranked and
funded top-down up to the available budget.

The Quick Response Facility (QRF) used a similar approach without request for
proposals. Interested manufacturers could submit proposals at any time, using a
simplified standard application form. Proposals were evaluated in the order in which
they were received.

The indicators to measure the success of the TI subgrants, as mentioned in the revised
PAD, are given in Table A2.2. The number of cost shared TI projects carried out was
slightly less than projected. The number of projects that met the contract targets, as
assessed by the PMO, was substantially higher that projected.

                               Table A2.2: Revised PAD Indicators
                                                                      End of        End of

Share of proposals of which contract targets have been met            80%           95%

The CGF was competitive and selective. Table A2.3 shows that only 48.6 percent of the
submitted proposals were selected for support and that only 28.5 percent of the requested
TI grant amounts were approved. The CGF was by far the most competitive sub-grant
facility.

The TI grant disbursements are given in Table A2.4. The actual numbers are marginally
different from the projected numbers as mentioned in the grant agreements. The actual
proven eligible total project cost is 4.5 percent lower than the estimated project cost and
the actual TI grant paid is 3.0 percent lower than the approved TI grant. The REDP cost
share was about 30 percent, well below the allowable maximum of 50 percent. For every
$1 TI grant, beneficiaries invested $2.32 in technology improvement.

The participating TI companies can be divided into three groups:

      ·     Provincial market driven companies. Usually located in the western provinces
            and close to the rural PV market, they used the TI grants to improve the
            design and the quality of their products to meet the more stringent standards
            and adapt them to the needs of more demanding customers in the market.


                                                 35

      ·     National technology driven companies. Located in the eastern provinces
            around Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities, they used the grants to bring
            the quality of their products up to national standards and participate in
            government and bilateral donor supported programs.
      ·     Export oriented companies. These companies used the TI grants to introduce
            innovation and bring their products up to international standards with focus on
            exports to fast growing PV markets in Europe, Japan and the US.

Based on analysis of the 81 TI supported projects for which fact sheets have been
produced and for which sales data was available2, ninety-five percent of the projects
produced the intended outputs. Sales of a selection of products developed under the TI
grants are:

      ·     3.2 million DC lights.
      ·     21,000 PV systems of various sizes.
      ·     75,000 PV controllers for systems of various sizes.
      ·     18,000 integrated controller and inverter systems.
      ·     550 Wind/PV hybrid systems.
      ·     9500 improved small wind turbines.
      ·     900,000 m2/year EVA, 1 ton aluminum paste, and 1.4 ton silver paste for
            module manufacturing.
      ·     115 PV module laminators.
      ·     45 solar simulators.
      ·     1500 monitoring devices for wind/PV hybrid systems.
      ·     3 PV array testers.
      ·     25,000 LED systems.
      ·     200 kWp PV concentrator cells.

The TI subgrants also supported 23 testing and certification projects and contributed to
increasing awareness on the importance of quality and on the need to provide consumers
information on quality aspects.

Many QRF projects contributed to technology improvement. Still, the QRF did not work
as intended. Projects proposed were not always urgent with short term impacts and the
evaluation and contracting process and implementation time were lengthier than
envisaged. The QRF ended up supporting small size projects but similar in nature to the
ones funded by the CGF.

Loans to Support Technology Improvement Projects

A concern during preparation was that TI companies would not be able to obtain capital
to invest in production of the innovations financed by the TI cost shared grants.
Consequently, an SETC financing facility was agreed but never implemented. Although
no financing was available under REDP, at mid term, it was found that at least $187


2   Some sales data is from 2005, and so final numbers are probably higher


                                                 36

million had been invested by TI subgrant beneficiaries (from their own resources or bank
loans), which was over 12 times the amount originally targeted. The indicator was not
subsequently monitored.

TI Program Support and Institutional Strengthening

Other quality improvement activities under REDP were carried out both under the TI
Program Support Facility and the Institutional Strengthening sub-component of the PV
component. They were initiated and managed by the PMO to assure the quality of PV
systems eligible for the GEF subsidy while the quality improvement activities under the
TI component were intended to improve the quality of all PV components and systems
available in the Chinese market, with special focus on those manufactured in China.

There were four groups of activities under REDP to guarantee the quality of systems
supported by the project. These were (i) standards; (ii) approved components list;
(iii) enforcement of standards; and (iv) training and awareness creation.

Standards

REDP project standards were discussed and prepared during preparation and agreed
during negotiations. They were based on standards used in other World Bank projects
and national standards and international standards. The quality level chosen was high
enough to guarantee a minimum quality without excluding suppliers with potential for
improvement. The Standards Committee established during the project preparation
continued to work during implementation and was instrumental in modifying existing and
developing new standards. Certified testing laboratories were selected to ensure
compliance with project standards. Technical assistance was provided to these
laboratories to further strengthen their capabilities.

The Standards Committee also worked on the development of national standards for PV
systems and components, adopted by China in 2003 as GB9535-1998. The new national
standards were more stringent than those of REDP. REDP adopted them, with some
small exceptions, for disbursement of the grant.

Approved Components List

To control the quality of PV components used in systems supported by REDP, the PMO
established and maintained an Approved Components List based on quality tests carried
out by the selected testing laboratories. REDP participating PV companies could access
the GEF subsidy only for PV systems using components from on the Approved
Components List. Eligibility to the subsidy was later extended to components with
recognized international certification such as ISO9000 certification. Components that
were found not to meet project requirements during one of the many component tests
conducted during the implementation of REDP (especially the last three years) were
taken from the Approved Components List.




                                           37

Enforcement of Standards

To enforce the standards and quality related rules, the PMO tested samples of the systems
for which a GEF subsidy was paid. The inspection of systems sold to the end users
proved significantly more difficult than expected. It was very costly and time-consuming,
especially for nomadic end-users and those living in remote and sparsely-populated areas.
After a number of trials with disappointing results this approach had to be abandoned and
replaced by an inspection during unannounced visits to sales agents and factories and
testing of randomly chosen samples in the selected laboratories to ensure compliance
with the required technical and quality standards. Over the implementation period, the
PMO conducted five of these surveys. Based on the surveys PV companies and PV
component manufacturers, the PV companies were penalized by reducing their PV
subgrant. PV component manufacturers were penalized by removing their components
from the REDP approved components list.

A total of $1,118,000 was deducted from the PV subgrant entitlement because of quality
control problems. Figure A2.7 depicts the financial penalties imposed on participating
PV companies from 2004 to 2007. The system component with most problems was the
charge controller.

Training and Awareness Creation

The results of the REDP quality surveys conducted by the PMO in 2004 and 2005
showed that some participating PV companies and component manufacturers did not


                                           38

completely understand the REDP and national SHS technical standards. In some cases,
the tests conducted in the laboratories gave results quite different from the companies
own test results because of inadequate calibration of testing equipment and insufficient
knowledge on PV quality control and testing processes.

To address this, the PMO organized a PV Component Testing training seminar for the
companies which products did not to meet the REDP quality standards. In addition to the
seminars, the PMO sought to increase quality awareness through quarterly newsletters,
hand-outs and the REDP website. For instance, the approved component list was printed
on the back page of the newsletters to assist PV companies decide where to buy
components. To increase awareness among end-users and other stakeholders, the PMO
published brochures and reports on PV technology, systems and components and on
quality related issues.

The PMO and World Bank staff and consultants carried out field visits to the project
provinces throughout the implementation of REDP. They visited PV companies, PV
component and system manufacturers, markets, trade fairs, testing institutions and end-
users.

Quality related issues were discussed during the annual REDP summary meetings at a
dedicated session which participating PV companies were required to attend. During the
discussion, the results of tests and measures taken by the PMO were presented. The
companies provided feedback which was used to improve quality supervision.

Upgrading Testing Laboratories

Upgrading of PV component testing laboratories was started during preparation of REDP
and continued during implementation. During project preparation, four testing
laboratories were identified to undertake tests according to the project technical
requirements. Two of them were PV module testing laboratories, one battery, controllers
and inverters testing laboratory and one DC lights testing laboratory. During
implementation, the PMO supported capacity building of the testing laboratories through
training, access to international best practice and in some case state of the art hardware.
In addition, testing laboratories could apply, on a competitive basis, for CGF funding to
strengthen their capabilities

Testing laboratories which received support from the project include:
    ·   PV Module Testing Laboratory
    ·   Testing Laboratory for Controllers and Inverters
    ·   PV System Testing Laboratory
    ·   DC Light Testing Laboratory
    ·   PV Battery Testing Laboratory

Two cases illustrate the support provided by the project for testing laboratories.




                                            39

The main PV Module Testing Laboratory supported by the project was the Tianjin
Institute of Power Source (TIPS) which received testing equipment and training. TIPS
was accredited by the national accreditation organization, according to ISO/IEC 17025,
to perform the tests according to GB9535-1998, which is equivalent to IEC 61215-1993.
In addition, in September 2006 TIPS was accepted by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) of
the US as a third party to perform tests according to IEC61215-2005. TIPS has thus been
established as a PV module testing laboratory of international caliber, able to perform
tests according to UL 1703, IEC 61730-1 and IEC 61730-2.


  Quote from TIPS: Before 2005, there were only a few module manufacturers in China.
  Our testing capacity was quite limited, and we could only conduct electrical
  performance tests. With the support of REDP we have, since 2006, conducted tests not
  only for more than 200 domestic module manufacturers but also for foreign
  manufacturers. Well-known manufacturers such as Wuxi Suntech, NEPV, Changzhou
  Trina, and Solarfun are now our customers.


During preparation of REDP, the Post and Telecommunication Industry Products Quality
Surveillance and Inspection Center under the Ministry of Information Industry (PTPIC)
was selected for testing controllers and inverters according to the project standard. In
2006, the PMO supported PTPIC through the Competitive Grant Facility to further
strengthen its testing capabilities. The impact of the REDP support, according to PTPIC
is given in the Table below.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

This Annex summarizes analyses undertaken upon completion of the two components.
The wind farm component was completed in mid-2006 while the PV component was
completed in early 2008.

                                          WIND FARMS
After restructuring only the two wind farms in Shanghai were financed: one at Nanhui
(11 x 1.5MW), the other on Chongming Island (3 x 1.5MW). Key assumptions for
appraisal and completion are shown in Table A3.1. TA financed by the GEF grant has
not been included in this analysis on the grounds of its relatively small size ($1.5 million,
or 5% of total cost). The benefits from the TA not related directly to the Shanghai wind
farms are widely dispersed, so making analysis quite infeasible.

Economic Analysis

The economic analysis at appraisal was conducted in two steps: (a) a least-cost study to
determine under what conditions wind farms were part of the optimal generation mix;
and (b) a cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment. In both steps, the analysis was done
with and without estimated local and global environmental costs of thermal power
development.

The Shanghai wind farms were not selected as least-cost alternatives, even with
consideration of both local and global externalities. As shown in Table A3.2, even when
local and global externalities were included as benefits, the ERR was below the hurdle
rate of 12%.

At appraisal the benefits of wind power were assessed at the average generation tariff,
plus estimates of the avoided local and global environmental damage costs. Now that the
Jade 'green' electricity scheme is in place, the economic analysis can make use of the best
possible indicator of economic benefits, namely the consumer's actual willingness-to-pay
(WTP) for wind electricity. Total sales under the Jade electricity scheme are shown in
Table A3.3.

It follows that the WTP of consumers purchasing green electricity is the sum of the green
tariff and the non-green tariff (Table A3.4).

Adjustment of this benefit estimate for incremental network capacity costs is not required.
There is no reason to suppose that the Nanhui and Chongming wind farms incur higher
transmission capacity costs than if an equivalent fossil plant were built elsewhere. Indeed,
the wind farms are closer to the load centers than several of the other generating plants
that serve Shanghai, and may therefore even warrant a network capacity credit. Any such
network capacity credit would be offset by a generation capacity penalty, given the non-
dispatchability of wind power. These may be assumed to offset each other, and are not
therefore considered in the economic analysis.

On the other hand the analysis should adjust for the energy losses in transmission and
distribution. In the absence of estimates of the LRMC and losses by voltage level, the
following assumptions are made:
    · Average transmission losses to high voltage industrial consumers: 4%
    · Average transmission & distribution losses to low voltage residential consumers:
        11%

The detailed breakdown of project expenditures does not identify the sources and uses of
funds during construction, including breakdown of local and foreign costs, IDC and VAT
on construction outlays. Consequently it is difficult to estimate the economic cost of the
project (i.e., excluding taxes and IDC). Nominal rates of VAT are rarely incurred in
practice, and the terms and conditions of the domestic loan are not known. As a result, it
is assumed that taxes and duties, VAT and IDC make up 7.5% of the total financial
investment cost of Y211.8 million. This makes the estimated economic capital cost Y197
million.

Table A3.5 shows operating costs as stated in the 2006 financial report as compared with
the June rolling financial plan which underlines that actual operating costs in 2006 were
significantly greater than forecast in the rolling plan. The extent to which some of the
operating costs were incurred in connection with an ongoing wind farm expansion at
Chongming is not clear.

The resulting economic analysis in shown in Table A3.6, under the assumption that the
energy production in 2006, 39.9 GWh, is representative of the long-term average.3 The
economic rate of return, without consideration of avoided carbon externalities, is 12.9%,
substantially better than the corresponding figure at appraisal of 7.6%. On the other hand,
if the wind farm output is valued at the avoided cost of coal generation (estimated at
about Y0.5/kWh), the ERR falls to 0.7%, worse than the appraisal estimate of 5%. With
the additional benefit of avoided GHG emissions (estimated to be 37,150 tons per year at
$15/ton CO2 ­ See Annex 7), and under the plausible assumption that wind energy
displaces coal generation, the ERR increases to 15.2%.

Since the project output is valued at the Jade tariff (for green sales) and the PPA for non-
green sales, the economic returns may be argued to be internalizing the avoided local
environmental damage costs of coal generation, so the use of a further environmental
damage cost adder (for example using the data taken from the appraisal analysis) would
double count.

Financial Analysis

The classic World Bank methodology for estimating financial returns is to add to the
economic flows taxes, duties and transfer payments, but maintaining the cost of capital at
the discount rate, i.e., estimate a financial return independent of the capital financing
structure (the so-called project return, rather than the investors return to equity). As
shown in Table A3.7, the financial returns are slightly lower than the economic returns, at
9.5 percent.

This analysis assumes the figures from the rolling financial forecast made in the last year
of the project (2006 for the following eight years). That forecast assumed production of
42 GWh/year, as determined by the feasibility study. Limited information about SWPC's
debts and restructuring (the World Bank loan was refinanced in 2005-2006) makes
comparison of the project financial return with the weighted average cost of capital
difficult. However, that this restructuring was successfully achieved in the face of further
wind farm expansion suggests that the project is financially feasible. The borrower's
completion report also notes that SWPC will seek CER sales to further enhance revenues.




3   If one uses the long term average of 42 GWh as estimated in the feasibility studies, the ERR increases
    by about 1.4%.

The allocation of REDP funds to the various project activities is shown in Table A3.8.
From the perspective of economic analysis, the PV sub-grants ($15million) are a pure
transfer payment (from GEF to the PV system companies).4 However, all of the
remaining ("non-grant") expenditures represent real economic costs that need to be
accounted for in the economic analysis.

Economic analysis at Appraisal

A formal economic analysis was completed for only the wind component of REDP at
appraisal. The justification for not presenting a formal economic analysis for the PV
component was that the PV systems were to be sold in areas where there were no viable
alternatives. Subsequent development of economic analysis techniques for such




4   Households surveyed in one of the Gansu counties also received grants for PV system purchase from
    the provincial Government.


                                                47

circumstances do now permit analysis (and may have been able to demonstrate the lack
of viable alternatives had they been available at the time)

Methodology for economic analysis at ICR

The lower bound of economic benefits can be measured from the avoided costs of the
alternative: if a PV system replaces the expenditure on kerosene and other fuels for
lighting, dry cells for radio listening and other portable uses, then the benefits of the PV
system must be at least as great as those avoided costs. Very often, however, the quantity
of the corresponding energy service provided by the PV system ­ e.g. the quantity of
lighting measured in lumen-hours ­ is much larger than that previously provided from
kerosene, as is the quality of light (PV-provided lighting is free of smoke and smells,
largely free of fire dangers and provides better color light). Hence avoided costs are
often negative

It has been shown that many consumers are willing to pay more ­ i.e. spend a larger share
of their disposable income - for a PV system than for kerosene and dry cells. This
behavior is captured by the consumer's demand curves for lighting and other services,
and economic theory provides the basis for measuring the total benefits of a given level
of consumption of the service as the area under the demand curve. The methodology
presented here compares results from the avoided cost and the consumer surplus methods.
A more detailed explanation of the theory of the consumer surplus method is in the
attachment to this Annex.

Environment benefits

The calculation of global environmental benefits that arise from avoided emissions of
carbon is straightforward. Estimating the local environmental benefits that arise from the
reduction in emissions of particulates, NOx and SOx associated with fossil fuel electricity
generation (or from kerosene or ghee combustion to provide lighting in wick lamps) is
much more difficult. They are likely to be quite small in the case of the northwestern
provinces of China since consumption is quite low. Consequently the analysis does not
attempt to quantify these benefits.

Indirect social benefits

The indirect social benefits of electrification are well recognized, and include improved
educational outcomes for children, higher household incomes made possible by home
businesses (and better educational outcomes), and the improvements in quality of life
provided by access to modern telecommunications, TV, radio, and music players. These
indirect benefits are often distinguished from the direct benefits of cheaper and better
quality lighting, and power for appliances such as TV and radio and, in northwest China,
milk separators. The perception of potential consumers that modern lighting brings a
range of social benefits ­ from better fire safety in the hometo improved outcomes of
child education ­ is already expressed in their WTP for a more expensive PV system. An
attempt to estimate these indirect social benefits and add them to the direct benefits (of



                                            48

more and better lighting, radio use and productive purposes) may well double-count and
has not been undertaken in this analysis.

Technology improvement and market development

Only 60 percent of the total GEF financing was for the direct PV grant support: most of
the rest was for indirect support of market development and technology improvement
activities, and for project management. Whatever may be the benefit of the TI
component to the costs and quality of systems sold under REDP, the technology
improvements will benefit all PV system sales, including exports not only of complete
systems, but also of components.

Industry-wide benefits cannot be easily estimated, hence the only reliable method of
capturing the economic benefits of the TI and market development outlays is to treat
them as one of the input costs, to be balanced against the consumer benefits. For the
economic analysis, the allocation of the TA expenditures to each PV system is simply the
total non-grant funding ($10.5million, Y75.5million) divided by the number of (verified)
PV systems sold (401,908 as of end November 2007) = Y 187.9. This is likely to be a
conservative assumption: not only are systems sold during the last six months of REDP in
January-July 2008 excluded, but also reporting companies participating in REDP have
sales not eligible for the REDP grant, domestic sales in provinces not covered by REDP,
and, in some cases, export sales.

Data Collection

Data drawn from a survey conducted in Gansu and Tibet has been used for the purposes
of the economic analysis. A more comprehensive survey of all areas in which
participating PV companies were active during the project would have been desirable, but
given the difficulties of reaching consumers in the more remote area, these four counties
were chosen as reasonably representative of consumers as a whole. This tends to be
supported by the findings of the beneficiary survey reported in Annex 5, where the Gansu
and Tibet survey is also reported in more detail.

In general, the use of expenditure data is preferred for classifying households. In the
survey of Gansu and Tibet, the differences between income and expenditure are
unusually large, with average expenditure only 41% of average income. In this analysis
income rather than expenditure quintiles have been used, which is also consistent with the
1998 survey of four REDP provinces5.

Household energy use

Table A3.9 shows household energy quantities before and after PV system purchase, by
income quintile. The most unusual feature (compared with other countries) is that
consumption of ghee for lighting ­ on average some 4.4 liters per month before PV
system purchase, and still 3.5 litters afterwards ­ exceeds consumption of kerosene. This
is a reflection of the significant proportion of the sampled households that are semi-
nomadic herdsmen. For many households, ghee is not a purchased fuel, and continues to
be available after PV system purchase. As expected, once SHS were acquired, the
number of households using candles and kerosene falls considerably.

The observed changes are consistent with earlier surveys conducted by REDP. For
example, while the 2007 survey showed a reduction of kerosene users from 19 to 4.3% of
households, a 2004 survey of Dingqing county in Tibet showed a decline of kerosene
users from 12.9% of households before PV system purchase to zero after purchase.

Operation and maintenance costs of SHS

Among operating costs for PV systems, the most widely reported cost was for lights, with
699 of 948 households incurring an annual average expense of 27.4 Y (Table A3.12).
When averaged across all households with PV systems, the total average operating cost
was Y23.7/year.

Appliances and their use

For the calculation of economic benefits, usage of appliances is the critical variable and
is set out in Table A3.13. The predominant appliance in use after purchase of a PV
system is lighting (91%), followed by radio (80% of all SHS), and flashlight (recharging)
(40%). Most households have one or two lamps, with an average total wattage of 23W
(median 15W). Significant TV use was found only in Naqu County, which is the least
remote of the counties surveyed: whether there is reception at all in the other counties
(other than with satellite dishes) is unknown.

Kerosene and electricity consumption

For the 164 users of kerosene before purchase of a PV system, the average reduction in
consumption is 3.17 liters/month. 128 PV system users eliminated their entire previous
kerosene consumption. The estimated annual electricity consumption using PV systems
when averaged across all households is presented in Table A3.14.

GHG emissions

The PAD estimates of CO2 emissions were based on the assumption that a 20Wp PV
system would replace two kerosene pressure lanterns per household, each used four hours
per day, with a consumption of 0.05Kg/hour ­ equivalent to 14.8 liters of kerosene per
household per month. This was consistent with findings in other countries: for example,
in Indonesia, kerosene consumption fell from 25.9 liters/month before PV system
purchase to 6.3 liters/month after purchase, a saving of 19.6 liters per household per
month.

Not only is this consumption significantly greater than that found in the survey, the
proportion of households using kerosene lighting before PV system purchase (19.5%)
was found to be significantly lower than in the corresponding 1998 survey which showed
98.5% of Gansu households reporting use of kerosene. Details are compared in Table
A3.15.

Thus the benefit of PV systems in reducing GHG emissions based on the survey results is
considerably lower than that estimated at appraisal, given that the actual displacement of
kerosene is only 3.2 liters/household/month. The 19,426 tons of lifetime avoided CO2
(Table A3.16), when valued at $15/ton CO2, represents a benefit of $US0.29 million.
Neither ghee lamps nor candles are included for lack of detailed information on which to
base calculations but given the relatively small benefit from kerosene reduction, carbon
emission reductions benefits are also likely to be small for these two sources.

Economic costs of a PV system compared with alternatives

To calculate the lifetime costs of a PV system, the following (conservative) assumptions
have been made. Prices are assumed to include 17% VAT, so for the economic analysis
the VAT is deducted:
    · System life is 15 years.
    · Battery replacement is assumed to be necessary every two years, costing 300 Y.
    · Controllers are assumed to be replaced every five years, costing 27 Y.
    · The annual kWh produced by the PV system requires an assumption about the
       average number of hours per day at peak output, taken here as 5.5 hours. A 20Wp
       system therefore produces 20 x 5.5 x 365 = 40.15 kWh/year.
    · Financial cost of system: 1200 Y (average system price in the survey). For the
       economic cost we deduct 17% VAT =930Y.
    · Discount rate of 10%
    · General O&M costs, including replacement of lights, Y22.3/year, as found in the
       survey.

The cost of electricity from a 20Wp PV system then calculates as shown in Table A3.17
with a levelized cost of $0.99/kWh (Y7.19/kWh).

Table A3.17 shows the lumen-flux provided by different fuel-based lighting devices.
There is little in the literature on Ghee lights, so the same flux as for a candle is assumed.

Demand Curve for Lighting

The demand curve for lighting can be derived based on the foregoing analysis and
assumptions using the methodology described in the Attachment to this Annex. The
demand curve for kerosene lighting is shown in Figure A3.1. The net economic benefit
per month is the increase in consumer surplus, calculated at 43Y (areas B+C).

Since there are no data for the number of radio/TV listening hours before the SHS was
acquired, we cannot derive a demand curve for this service.6 However, it is reasonable to
assume that the value ascribed to using PV-generated electricity to radio listening hours
is at least equal to the value given to lighting, so the total willingness to pay can be scaled
up from the above lighting value using a scale factor of 0.58, the proportion of lighting in
total consumption; the total monthly benefit per household is Y43/0.58=Y74.1 (or
$10.24)7



6   Radio listening prior to the PV system would necessarily have been provided from dry cells, the costs
    of which range from 880$/kWh for AAA cells to 80$/kWh for D cells. This reflects the high
    willingness-to-pay for stored electricity for high value uses such as flashlights and radios.

7   In comparison, the Philippines, using a comparable methodology, the average monthly benefit was
    $9.90/month

Economic Returns

Avoided cost method

In most other countries, the lower bound to the economic benefit of a PV system could be
estimated based on the avoided energy cost. In Tibet and Gansu, before the PV system,
monthly energy expenditure is 26.6Y. After PV system purchase, expenditure on fossil
fuels decreases to Y16.8/month, so the avoided cost is only Y10/month (Y120/year).
Since the cost of the PV system ­ including amortization of the capital cost over 15 years
at 10%) is estimated at Y30/month, total energy expenditure increases by Y20.6/month,
and the avoided cost calculation becomes meaningless (showing a negative economic
return).

In most countries where significant amounts of fossil fuels are used before PV system
purchase, the total expenditure on energy decreases rather than increases, because many
households in other countries use expensive car battery charging, or have access to diesel
generators (or, as in Vietnam, make extensive use of pico hydro generators). The
consumption of kerosene in unelectrified Tibet and Gansu households is particularly low
by international standards, a difference that in large part is explained by lifestyle
differences rather than poverty per se.

Consumer surplus method

The total area under the lighting demand curve (ignoring the initial consumer surplus area
A) is the area B+C+D+E = Y58.8/month. Table A3.19 estimates the total benefit. Note
the previously discussed allocation of non-grant REDP expenditures (for TI, Market
development and instruction strengthening activities) of Y188 per system.

The resulting economic rate of return (ERR) calculates to 93.4 percent. The
corresponding financial return to the purchases is 88 percent. This implies that the users
perceived a payback of expenditure within a little more than a year. Evidence supports
very high values of willingness-to-pay and high economic returns. First, systems are
bought for cash, which suggests a high benefit perceived by households. Second, the
cost of the PV system is modest compared with income. Third, the initial cost of the PV
system in China is low; much lower than that reported elsewhere (Table A3.20).

Sensitivities

Based on earlier surveys, much higher kerosene displacement is achieved in the other
project provinces, and thus it can be argued that the Tibet/Gansu results should not
therefore be extrapolated to REDP as a whole as above. Nonetheless, the calculation at
appraisal of the kerosene displacement of 14.8 liters of kerosene per household per month
seems to have been an over- estimate. To investigate the impact, 78% of households ­ as
found in the 1998 survey ­ have been assumed to stop using two liters of kerosene per
month as found in Gansu and Tibet surveys. Under these conditions, the benefits of
GHG reduction are $5 million, with a modest increase on the ERR, to 93.8 percent. Even
inclusion of the original assumptions from appraisal would only increase the ERR by just
over three percentage points to 97.8 percent.

Robustness of the project returns to system life was tested over a range of lives from one
to 15 years. At an average system life of two years, returns are 71%. Monte Carlo
simulation of the following multiple variables was also carried out:

    · Proportion of households using kerosene and candles
    · Actual displacement of kerosene and candles
    · Price of kerosene and candles
    · Battery replacement frequency (1-4 years, median two years)
    · PV system life

The resulting distribution of ERR is shown in Figure A3.2. The biggest level of
uncertainty is in the WTP estimation itself, both with respect to the methodology as well
as the high level of uncertainty in survey estimates of lighting demand. Using Monte
Carlo analysis and assuming an asymmetrical distribution for the WTP estimate of
benefits (small probability of higher WTP than the baseline estimate, large probability of
lower WTP than the baseline estimate), with a median WTP of Y0.60, then the mean

estimate of returns is still 51 percent, with a 3.7 percent probability of not meeting the
hurdle rate of 12 percent economic rate of return.

   METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING CONSUMER BENEFITS FROM DEMAND CURVES

The methodology adopted here to establish the benefits of rural electrification follows
that used in a number of other countries for rural electrification projects (Philippines,
Bolivia, and Vietnam, among others). Economic theory holds that the benefit of
consuming a given quantity of a good, at some given price, is equal to the area under the
demand curve. Such a demand curve is illustrated in Figure A3.1.1 for the case of
lighting: the x-axis represents the quantity of lighting service consumed (say as
kiloLumen-hours/year), and Y shows the price, in Yuan/kilolumen-hour).

                     PE

                           D         E



                             QKERO                        QE

                                           service level



The demand curve is drawn as downward sloping, and typically has a shape that is
concave (with respect to the origin). This shape frequently emerges where more than two
points on the curve can be plotted (here only the points x and y are assumed known). The
concave shape also follows from the (convenient) assumption of constant elasticity (an
assumption often made in econometric models).

For simplicity, assume that the lighting service is provided by kerosene lamps only: the
quantity of services so consumed is QKERO, at the price PKERO. Thus the total household
expenditure on lighting is QKERO x PKERO, equal to the area B + D.

The total willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the service at level QKERO is the total area under
the demand curve to that level of consumption, i.e. areas A + B + D. This is the total
benefit to the consumer. However, the cost is area B + D, and therefore the net benefit
consuming QKERO, also called the consumer surplus, is the difference between the two,
namely the area A.




                                                61

After electrification, the level of service (in the case of lighting, the number of lumen-
hours) typically increases substantially; consumption increases from QKERO to QE, but the
price paid for the electrified service also falls (typically) from PKERO to PE. Now the
household's expenditure for electricity is PE x QE, equal to the area D+E. At this level of
consumption, the total area under the demand curve to QE, i.e. the total benefit, is now
the area A + B + C + D + E. Therefore the net benefit, or consumer surplus, after
subtracting the cost D + E, is A + B + C. Thus it follows that the net economic benefit of
electrification is the increase in consumer surplus, which is the area B + C.

Areas B, D and E are readily calculated from knowledge of consumption before and after
electrification, from the household budget for kerosene (and battery charging), and from
the tariff of electrified service: i.e. given knowledge of the two points on the demand
curve x and y, the areas B, D and E are immediately calculable. But area C is more
difficult to estimate, since it requires knowledge of the shape of the demand curve
between points x and y. The most convenient assumption ­ and therefore the one most
frequently encountered ­ is that the demand curve is linear.

Such an assumption will usually lead to an overestimate of the area C, and of the net
benefits of electrification, because the empirical evidence is that in fact the demand curve
is much more likely to have a concave shape of the type shown in Figure A3.1.1. Given
some functional form for such a demand curve, the area C is readily calculated as the
definite integral: here we use a standard functional specification with constant elasticity .

                              
                      Q = Q0 PP  
                                 
                              0 

whose corresponding area C (e.g. between QKERO and QE) easily calculates from the
corresponding definite integral.

This approach of estimating changes in welfare by consumer surplus has a number of
issues and limitations. One must recognize that the demand curve shifts outwards with
increases in income (for a so-called normal good, for a given price higher income implies
a greater demand). However in the case of an inferior good ­ of which radio listening is
a good example, as discussed below ­ consumption decreases with increase of income.
In addition, the implication of such curve is that at zero price, the quantity consumed
would be infinitely large. Yet in fact, even in face of very dramatic electricity price
decreases (as are achieved by gird-connection as against car battery use), in the short run
consumption will be constrained by the (limited) stock of appliances required to actually
use larger quantities of electricity.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

This Annex reports on two surveys that were undertaken on behalf of the PMO at project
completion. One was conducted in one province, Qinghai, and two autonomous regions,
Tibet and Xinjiang (also reported as Sinkiang); it is referred to here as the Qinghai, Tibet
and Xinjiang survey. The second was conducted in two counties each in Gansu and Tibet
and is referred to here as the Gansu and Tibet survey.

During project preparation, a survey was carried out in Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai
and Xinjiang, all of which became part of the project area8. Field investigations were also
carried out during project implementation in Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Tibet and
Xinjiang.

A comprehensive survey of all project areas would have been desirable but the
remoteness of some of the areas, the low population density and people's semi-nomadic
lifestyle combine to make any survey of actual beneficiaries of project-provided PV
systems impractical, as was discovered early in project implementation. Necessarily,
given their different purposes, these surveys have different emphasis and the quantitative
combination of the Qinghai, Tibet and Xingjiang and Gansu and Tibet surveys would be
statistically unsound, nonetheless, the qualitative information that can be gained is useful.
It also adds further to the confidence in the findings of the economic analysis reported in
Annex 3.

Qinghai, Tibet and Xinjiang Survey

A total of 1505 people were surveyed in the Qinghai, Tibet and Xinjiang survey, equal
numbers being drawn from Xining, Lhasa and Urumqi. Interviewees were drawn
randomly at bus stations and markets where rural people from remote areas of the
provinces gather. Based on the sample about 75 percent of respondents were owners and
users of SHS, while 25 percent either had never owned or had owned but given up using
systems. The province/autonomous region (AR) breakdown is in Figure A5.1

About 95 percent of respondents had one SHS in the household but some had two and
three reported having three systems. Multiple systems in one household reflects the
nomadic lifestyle in which households are often split between different locations,
especially during the summer months. Brand awareness among respondents was strong
with only about 15 percent not knowing the make of their system. Six companies
represented just over 50 percent of all sales.

Systems cost between Y500-1500, with most being in the range of Y700-1000, as shown
in Figure A5.2. Systems in Xinjiang tended to be somewhat cheaper than those in
Qinghai and Tibet, which may correspond with the apparently rather larger market.

The bulk of systems owned were in the range of 18-25Wp (Figure A5.3) taken together
with system cost, this corresponds to buyers paying about Y38-40/Wp, on the assumption

that smaller systems cost less. This is somewhat lower than the prices reported by
participating PV companies, but may be distorted by incentives paid to purchasers by
local governments.

Buyers purchased their first PV system as early as 1998, and about 58% of systems are
more than six years old. A small subset of respondents ­ 65 in all ­ reported replacing
their systems with new ones. The main reason for doing so was because the systems had
faults (20%), the systems had been lost (23%) or because a higher power system was
needed.

Systems appear to be reliable. About 80 percent of systems do not need repair during the
warranty period, and 65 percent of all owners have not yet replaced the battery, although
those with smaller batteries are more likely to need replacement sooner.

Almost everyone uses their systems for lighting (99.4%), and the second most popular
use is radio (85%), followed by the use of blenders (about 40%) and milk separators
(15%). Uses by province are shown in Figure A5.4.

People are broadly satisfied with their PV systems with those feeling satisfied or
relatively satisfied comprising about 65 percent of all users. Only 5% feel dissatisfied or
relatively dissatisfied.

Of the whole sample of 1505 respondents, 389 reported having a system but had given up
using it. Most had bought the system in the period 2002 ­ 2005, and most had given up
using them in 2005 ­ 2007. Interviewees overwhelmingly (97%) reported that their
village had now gained access to grid electricity (probably mini grids). Those who gave
up their systems for other reasons cited unstable power and lack of reliability or
difficulties in getting the system repaired.

Gansu and Tibet Survey

As a starting point for the economic analysis, a household survey was undertaken in 2007
in Gansu province and Tibet Autonomous Region. The four sampled counties were:
    · Naqu county, Tibet. Naqu prefecture is one of the most important centers of
        animal production and carries about 7 million head of various livestock on native
        grasslands, mainly yak and ovines.
    · Bange county, Tibet: Also in Naqu prefecture, but much more remote.
    · Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous region: although located in Gansu, it is quite similar
        to the two Tibet provinces.



                                               68

   · Minqin county, Gansu: This is the only county among the four sampled where the
       predominant occupation is farming.

Tibet and Gansu are among the poorest parts of China and also stand at the bottom of the
provinces targeted by the REDP PV component (Table A5.2). Shaanxi rural income
stands between those of Tibet and Gansu.

Income and expenditure

Annual household income is shown in Table A5.3. In three of the four sampled counties,
farmers had higher income than herders (the exception being Bange county in Tibet,
where herders had higher incomes). This finding is in contradiction to that of the 1998
survey which found that in general, farmers were poorer than herders (in Gansu, Inner
Mongolia, Xinjiang and Qinghai).

For the sample as a whole, the distributions of incomes of households with and without
SHS are quite similar. The most reliable inference one can draw is that households with
higher incomes have more savings, and are therefore more likely to be able to purchase
PV systems than households on lower incomes. Rural incomes in China have been
steadily increasing over the past five years, so the ability to separate out the effect of the
PV system from the overall growth in household incomes is limited.

One explanation for the high income of Bange county herders is income from Cordyceps
harvesting (dong chong xia cao or "summer grass- winter worm", (Cordyceps Sinensis).
It is a product that has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine, and more recently
recognized as prophylaxis against cancer. Ten years ago, retail prices were around
Y3,000/kg; five years ago Y10,000/kg, and presently as much as Y60,000-100,000/kg.
The Tibetan plateau (including areas in Qinghai and western Sichuan) is the main area of
supply: reports are that herdsmen (and others) adept at spotting winter-worm can easily
make Y1,000-2,000/month selling this in urban markets. PV systems have a role to play
in that they are used by the herdsmen when on winter-worm collecting expeditions.

Energy use across all fuels, prior to PV system purchase in Tibet and Gansu is low, and
significantly lower than in other counties: only 19.5% of unelectrified households report
use of kerosene in Gansu and Tibet, compared with 57% in rural Peru, and 67% in the
Philippines. These differences appear to be a consequence of lifestyle rather than
income: rural households in Gansu and Tibet are no poorer than those in other countries.

As expected, once SHS were acquired, the number of households using these fuels falls
considerably, notably candles and kerosene but the percentage of households that use dry
cells slightly increases. The observed changes, illustrated in Figure A5.5 are consistent
with earlier surveys conducted during project implementation. For example, while the
Gansu and Tibet survey showed a reduction of kerosene users from 19 to 4.3% of
households a field survey in 2004 in Dingqing county Tibet showed a decline of kerosene

Conclusions From Beneficiary Survey

The correlation between the findings of the two surveys, where they overlap, appears to
be quite strong and tends to be supported by the evidence from other sources, particularly
that provided by participating PV companies. This engenders a reasonable level of
confidence about the market characteristics, and the way in which people in the target
provinces are benefiting from the project.

One particularly striking finding is the 75% take up of PV systems among the
respondents to the Qinghai, Tibet and Xinjiang survey. Major growth in ownership
appears to have started in about 2003, which coincides with the period in which the
project started to support substantial market development efforts in the target provinces
and when system sales started to grow. There is strong evidence that the project reached
its intended beneficiaries.

It is also noteworthy that the prices paid and the system sizes are quite close on average
to those reported by participating PV companies. This suggests that the cost reductions
resulting from increased competition and technical progress have been passed on to end
users. Moreover, market-driven system designs, particularly relating to system size
appears to have been important, and vindicates project design which avoided prescribing
designs or sizes and encouraged innovation.

The finding that people will only discard their systems in favor of upgrading it for a more
powerful one, or the arrival of their grid also indicates that the market is likely to
continue to thrive for some years to come as does indications that households purchase a
second or even third system. There remain large tracts of western China inhabited by
semi-nomadic people that simply cannot be reached by static systems such as grids.

The evidence of the poverty reduction resulting from the project is unexpected. Median
income of PV purchasers is little more than non PV purchasers and people in the lowest
income quintile have purchased SHS. Combined with the finding that 95 percent
consider that their income has increased as a result shows that access to modern energy is
perceived by beneficiaries to improve their incomes. Further analysis of the survey data
is not possible to quantify this finding.

Other Components (Wind and TI)

Beneficiary surveys were not carried out for the Wind and TI components.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Six stakeholder workshops were held during the closing stages of the project. All related
to the PV and TI component. Of these, four were for PV and TI companies alone, one
was for the PMO and one was a closing workshop in which the findings were reported to
the Government of China.

Workshops for PV and TI Companies

The four workshops were held in Beijing (December 21, 2007), Shanghai (January 15, 2008),
Xining (January 22, 2008) and Urumqi (January 23, 2008). A total of 54 stakeholders
attended the workshops. In Beijing and Shanghai participants were mainly TI only
companies (73%), while in Xining and Urumqi the majority was PV only companies
(52%). The workshops discussed individual actions of the project, the PV subgrant, the
Market Development Support Facility (MDSF), the Competitive Grant Facility (CGF),
the Quick Response Facility (QRF), the quality actions and supporting activities for
quality, capacity building and the PMO's performance.

Reactions at each workshop were mixed: in general participating PV companies
expressed strong support for PV related activities, while TI companies expressed similar
sentiments for the TI related activities. Views of the more affected party are reflected in
the summaries that follow.

The PV Subgrant

PV companies were positive about the PV subgrant, considering that it was a successful
mechanism by which to develop the SHS market and the PV companies, particularly
supporting their ability to compete in the market, improving the capacity of their
management and the quality of their products. With clear and detailed principles and
procedures set out it was easy to operate. Some considered that the mechanism was
becoming outdated but that the principles could be applied to other projects.

Asked what they would have done to improve the design of the PV subgrant,
participating companies would have liked to extend it to demonstration systems, extend it
to all China and to support exports. They also thought that increased differentiation
between different quality standards would be useful.

In implementation, PV companies felt that the approved supplier list changed too often,
that there were too many PV companies, and more companies could have been allowed to
join, and more companies removed if they failed to meet performance standards. PV
companies generally appreciated the verification system but considered that it was slow,
complex, did not adequately foster competition, and created delays in disbursement of the
grant. PV companies considered it unfair to punish PV companies for product quality of
qualified suppliers (which in the majority of cases were the PV companies themselves).
They also were of the opinion that penalties for non compliance with quality standards



                                             73

should have kept the same for each batch and not as practiced by REDP increase over
time.

The Market Development Support Facility

Medium and small sized participating PV companies most appreciated the MDSF as it
had helped to improve their capacity. The design was sound and flexible, allowing it to
cover a large number of different areas of company business and the evaluation
procedure was considered reasonable. It was particularly helpful for financial
management, market development and internal quality control.

Some considered that the MDSF should have been open to non-participating PV
companies, and that the amount of the grant should have been increased for good projects
providing an incentive to improve project quality. Additional checking during
implementation would have been appreciated by recipients of cost shared grants, and
feedback from experts could have been more prompt.

The Competitive Grant Facility

TI companies liked the CGF mechanism and considered it strict but fair, open and
transparent in the way projects were selected for grants. It reached its aim of helping to
develop the Chinese PV industry and was considered to be efficient. It was particularly
appreciated given that R&D investment funds were difficult to obtain from other sources
at the time.

Weaknesses included poor monitoring of progress during implementation of the CGF,
and a complicated closing procedure which would also have benefited from a more
objective basis on which success could have been evaluated. The amount of support for
each grant should be increased, and the upfront costs met through a higher first payment
(more than 30% of approved support). Disbursement could have been quicker.

The Quick Response Facility

In all workshops the QRF was rated lower than the CGF. Still the QRF was considered
important because by design it was quicker and closer to requirements of the market.
Further, participants regarded it flexible and able to help companies achieve results. It
was considered not to be quick enough in deciding whether to support a proposal or not,
few applicants received support, and both disbursement and the closure procedures were
slow.

Quality Actions Through TI Program Support and Capacity Building

Nearly all participants evaluated positively the quality actions undertaken by REDP, in
particular the introduction of the SHS standards, and the promotion of the Golden Sun
mark, and quality checking actions directly with the participating PV companies.
Participating PV companies also considered that the qualification of suppliers help



                                             74

protect the market and their customers. Checking could have been more frequent and
more often unannounced. Participating PV companies wanted to see the continuation of
the mechanism after the end of the project.

Capacity building for PV quality, particularly upgrading testing centers and helping PV
companies to have their equipment tested was appreciated as a means of improving
product quality and also creating the link with international standards. The main
criticism stakeholders had was that more could have been done: continued support to
increase acceptance as an international testing organization and to create competition in
China to avoid monopoly.

Conferences, workshops, exhibitions study tours and international training were among
the most highly appreciated areas of support. Most participants wanted more such
activities (the reader may wish to note that most of these activities were cost shared with
participants). More could have been done to help communications within the industry,
particularly through providing data, and through providing market intelligence.

The PMO was held in high esteem by participants, considered to be a good bridge
between government and the companies, and to be fair and open. It was considered to be
understaffed, and contract and project checking and disbursement speeds could have been
better.

Workshop for PMO

In November 2007, PMO and Bank staff conducted a workshop on the implementation of
the project.

Implementation Generally

Implementation of REDP without a full time PMO would have been impossible. The
PMO's operation could have been improved by increased capacity building for PMO staff
and by reducing the high staff turnover during REDP implementation (3 component
managers resigned during REDP implementation). The latter may have been achieved by
better incentives (net payments, training, etc.).

PV Component

PMO staff considered that the provision of output and quality based grant support
directly to the PV companies worked well and that financial verification and the MDSF
worked as intended. By far the main difficulty the PMO experienced in implementing
the PV component was the verification of PV system sales (first field verification and
later financial verification). Implementation of the PV component could have been
improved in particular by conducting bi-annual quality verification from the start and not
just after the problems with quality of REDP supported systems became apparent.




                                             75

TI Component

The PMO considered the TI component vital for improving the quality of PV components
and systems, both those supported by REDP PV subgrants and more generally. The CGF
and upgrading of testing laboratories worked well. The main difficulty faced by PMO
staff in implementing the TI Component was the management, monitoring and closing of
the TI grant facilities (CGF and QRF) projects. The PMO was of the opinion that these
facilities could have been improved by simplifying the calculation of eligible grant
payments. The PMO would further have liked more resources allocated for the
establishment and maintenance of the REDP approved components list.

Bank Supervision

In general the supervision was considered crucial for achieving the REDP objectives, but
better mutual understanding would have made implementation easier and less stressful.
The PMO considered the World Bank supervision team dedicated, efficient, creative and
helpful. The supervision team provided suggestions for improvement of REDP
implementation and solutions to problems encountered. The PMO appreciated the
frequent supervision missions and found the detailed Aide Memoires prepared by the
supervision team helpful to follow-up agreed actions. The supervision team diligently
monitored implementation of the agreed activities.

The PMO appreciated in particular the capacity building conducted by the supervision
team. Especially the junior staff learned a lot from the supervision team. Although the
assistance from the supervision team was appreciated, the PMO felt that the supervision
team was at times too impatient and listened too little, insisting too often on its view
being carried forward. This could have been improved by more frequent field visits to
better understand Chinese culture and actual problems faced and the PMO's position. The
PMO was also too often caught between the supervision team and NDRC. In these cases,
a better dialogue between the parties would have made the PMO's work easier.

Closing Workshop with GoC

The closing workshop hosted by the Government of China, with attendance from most
project participants, several donors and, the PMO and World Bank staff focused mainly
on project outcomes. Of these three main ones were noted by several participants.

Energy Development As Part of Rural Development

One of the outcomes of the project had been the Government's growing recognition of the
role of energy development as a contributor to rural development, in particular under the
'New Socialist Countryside' policy. PV had a particular role to play, as it had been
demonstrated to be suitable not only for small, individual applications, but also for mini-
grid applications, electrifying remote villages and townships. Further scale-up is needed
to make PV cost effective for this kind of application, which may result in the industry
having to understand the trade-offs between mini-grid and off grid applications.



                                             76

Industrialization of the PV Sector

Workshop participants highlighted the growing industrialization of PV, turning from a
relatively small industry dominated by small and medium enterprises, into one in which
industrial sized companies were required. Several companies noted China's role as a
producer in the world, and that further growth would be beneficial to China itself, as it
scaled up its electrification efforts, as well as to the world at large. For this to be a
realistic objective, however, further focus on sustainability and quality was required

Technology improvement was seen as a particularly important dimension of the
industrialization process, and the kind of capital provided by REDP ­ essentially first-
stage equity ­ was particularly welcome. The Golden Sun program was highlighted as an
important part of this effort as well.

The Importance of Financing

A number of speakers mentioned that the importance of system financing had not been
tested. Some noted that the PV component had relied on cash sales, and the absence of
financing had not appeared to be a hindrance to sales. Others noted that the absence of
formal financing for some of the participating PV companies had been an issue, both for
their own growth and to help them make additional sales.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Because the project was implemented by two separate implementing agencies working
independently of one another, they each prepared a completion report. Both were long
and have been summarized; the one on the wind component by Bank staff, and the one on
the PV and TI Components by PMO staff which has been lightly formatted for easier
reading.

Wind Component

The project followed a 1998 feasibility study that eventually chose the Nanhui and
Chongming sites. The project was completed in 2005 by SWPC, a special-purposes
company established by SMEPC in November 2001. In general, the operating results are
satisfactory, with wind production of 40GWh lower than estimated but within the actual
variation caused by annual variations in wind speeds.

Implementation progress compared with plan is shown in Table A7.1.

Delays in implementation were caused by SWPC inexperience in procurement of wind
farms, and particularly of World Bank procedures, SARS, and inexperience of the
contractor in construction of wind farms on the shoreline. In addition one turbine
suffered a major fault on installation, necessitating the remanufacturing of the generator
and thus delay in its commissioning.

Total planned cost was Y219,701,700 ($26.53 million) compared with the actual project
costs of Y211,773,711 ($25.58 million). Cost savings were attributed to local
manufacture of the towers (compared with the original estimate which expected towers to
be imported), and lower installation cost, especially of the switchyard and network


                                                78

connection. Costs were higher as a result of high civil work costs and domestic price
inflation.

Environment impacts were expected to be dust, vehicle movements and noise during
construction and noise and effects on birds during operation. Construction impacts were
modest because the wind farms are on newly reclaimed land, with few residents in the
area and none in the immediate vicinity.

Wind turbine noise effects during operation are mitigated by siting the wind farm away
from residential areas and requiring the wind turbines to meet IEC 61400-14; monitoring
after construction is continuing. Effects on birds have been extensively studied. Only
one migratory cycle had been observed between the start of operations in June 2005 and
writing the completion report. Long term observations continue but no bird strikes have
been observed.

The wind farm is estimated to avoid emissions of about 37,150 tonnes of CO2 per year
given installed capacity of 21MW and the feasibility study assumptions of production of
42GWh per year and a capacity factor of 22.8 percent.

Land occupation is shown in Table A7.2. No houses were demolished or permanent
residents displaced. In Chongming, land had been rented to fishermen and for seasonal
planting. In Nanhui the area outside the berm was unused state owned land, and an area
designated for a forest park.

Total land costs, including purchase, compensation and transfer fees amounted to
Y1,401,148 in Chongming ($169,221) and Y645,491 ($77,958) in Nanhui. Positive
social impacts include commercialization of renewable technologies and development of
wind power markets in China. Some local job opportunities during construction and
operation have been created.

A visitor center has been set up adjacent to the Nanhui wind farm, and between April
2006 and April 2007 about 46,000 people visited the center. Of these, about 29,900 are
school and university students. The education center has received a positive response.




                                             79

The technical assistance component played an important part in the project, enriching the
experience of SMEPC and SWPC, and providing support for future project development.
The activities included: financial management; operations and management support;
planning of wind resources (as a result of which SMEPC plans to develop 200MW by
2010 and Shanghai government plans to reach 310 by then and 1,000MW by 2020);
investigation of the impacts on the grid of wind power; support for the wind power visitor
center; study tours abroad; international consultant support during procurement,
construction and commissioning; and design research into wind turbine foundations.

The project is considered sustainable with a calculated FIRR of 6.28 percent. Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) funding at $13/ton would improve the FIRR to
10.2 percent and will be applied for.

SMEPC and SWPC assess Bank performance positively, noting its support in financial
management, procurement and technical assistance. Regular supervision helped SWPC
understand international project management.

Borrower performance is assessed positively, particularly in procurement, contract
management, construction and operations and maintenance. Cost control was good.
Liaison between SMEPC and SWPC was good. Communications with Bank staff and
GE was difficult so improved language skills are needed. Frequent changes of
management affected consistency of working. More data collection would have helped
government decision making to start with. The positive experience has positioned SWPC
well for procurement of further wind farms, including the planned Donghai offshore
project.

PV and TI Components

REDP is a project of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and
the World Bank (WB) in order to establish sustainable markets for wind and PV
technologies, with international grant financing provided by the GEF. It has had two
main components: (1) PV component; (2) TI component. A third component for
institutional strengthening supported activities to eliminate barriers to market
development and promote technology commercialization.

During implementation, there are some issues happened which affected the
implementation outcomes and results: (1) Delayed project start; (2) Strong sector growth;
(3) Low domestic inflation and stable currency; (4) Strong official support for PV and
development of western China; (5) No consumer finance and no bank credits for private
PV companies; (6) SARS ­ 2003; (7) Polysilicon shortage and increasing module prices,
2004 ­ 06; (8) Renewable Energy Law ­ 2006.

And based on the external context, the design was also improved and changed: (1) MDSF
was shifted to demand driven; (2) Addition of three provinces; (3) Extension of project
closing date by one year; (4) Increased direct REDP cooperation with official programs;
(5) Raised subsidy for systems with higher standard modules; (6) Permitted larger



                                             80

systems; (7) Imposed penalties on PV companies and suppliers; (8) Introduced multiple
sales verification methods; (9) Assisted PV companies to enter international markets;
(10) Did not implement SHS customer and PV company credit pilots.

These improvements and changes helped REDP to realized its objectives and targets,
although it faced some challenges before implementation, such as REDP's large scale,
uncompetitive China PV sector, low affordability of last consumers, low product quality /
high cost.

The main achievements of REDP are:

(1)     Contribution to rural electrification. More than two million people in western
China have been provided with access to modern energy through PV systems, solving the
basic electricity needs of households.

(2)     Promotion of rural PV businesses and service networks. 28 companies have
developed and expanded their rural PV businesses, establishing sustainable access to PV
based electricity services in remote communities in western China. The companies have
established commercially sustainable sales and service networks that reach the deepest
rural areas in China and increasingly they are selling in world markets with certified
products.

(3)     Establishment of market frameworks for PV standards, tests, certification. REDP
supported the establishment of a comprehensive market framework of standards, testing,
and quality verification and certification capacities for PV components and SHS that will
contribute to the long term sustainability of product quality and consumer protection in
China's rural PV markets. This framework is now being used in other projects in China
and is being drawn upon in the design of PV projects in other countries. REDP supported
the establishment of a quality seal ­ China Golden Sun ­ that can be the basis for
continued growth of domestic and international markets for China's quality PV products.

(4)     Step by step improvements to product quality. REDP supported companies to
upgrade their technology capabilities and products, including improved modules, lights,
controllers, inverters and other components. 74 companies now offer products that meet
REDP requirements. Also, 24 SHS systems have been certified as meeting IEC 62124
and 25 companies have products or systems that have received the Golden Sun quality
seal.

(5)     Gradual lowering costs and prices. REDP's parallel support for market
development and technology improvement resulted in better quality PV products and at
the same time reductions to the costs. Through market competition and technology
improvement, REDP contributed to 30% to 40% reductions in the costs/prices of PV
products. Before 1997, the cost of off-grid PV stations was about RMB120-140/Wp,
while now it is RMB80-100/Wp; the price of SHS was reduced from RMB80-100/Wp to
RMB50-60/Wp.

(6)     Maintain competitive market. The commercial SHS market has remained
competitive with the top firms having little if any market control.

(7)     Mobilizing private financing. The companies succeeded in accessing private
financing to support sales growth and investments. While the private firms in interviews
report continuing not to have access to bank financing, they also report raising loans and
investments from family, friends, employees and investors to finance multiple expansions
of the businesses. Several owners referred to a rough standard of paying 1% per month on
private loans. The companies have reinvested profits as a main source of growth
financing. After improvements in management, business skills and financial systems,
some companies have received access to commercial bank credits and financial support
of other institutions.

(8)     Neutral product / business model; demand driven capacity building. REDP's
approach was open to a full range of types and permutations of business models, allowing
the business to make their decisions in line with market signals. The project established
the technical specifications of the systems, the broad potential market areas and basic
consumer protection requirements covering warranties, truth in advertising and similar.
While all the companies depended on cash sales as their revenue model in the
commercial market, each developed its own supply chain and distribution arrangements,
product line, pricing and other elements of their business plans. The performance based
subsidy covered PV systems from small portable systems to larger, professionally
installed ones, from 10 Wp up to 500 Wp, This allowed the companies to size and
procure their products to fit their target customers' affordability and preferences. REDP's
main business and market development support was the cost share grants of the MDSF.
Each company applied individually based on their own assessment of their shortcomings
and needs.

(9)     Increased use of PV in official programs for western China development.

(10)    Development of China's PV sector.

(11)    Level playing field and transparent, professional project management.


From REDP, there are also some lessons that should be learned:

(1)     The absence of consumer finance for SHS purchasers is typically viewed as a
barrier that limits affordability and hence restricts sales and rural market development
and penetration.

(2)     Lack of access to formal financial institution credit services for small and medium
enterprises is frequently assessed as a constraint on market development. All of the
private SHS companies participating in REDP were SMEs; in practice, during REDP
none had access to formal financial institution credit services.

(3)     Before the start of PMO implementation, there was no opportunity to organize the
PMO and conduct PMO staff training. There was no significant pre-start up capacity
building for the PMO staff in the best practices and guidelines for project management in
accordance with the World Bank's procurement or other requirements. This learning-by-
doing approach, while eventually effective, contributed to a slower than expected pace
during the start up of implementation.




                                               82

(4)     When establishing the PMO and when replacing staff, it was often difficult to
recruit qualified staff due to the temporary nature of the positions, the salary levels and
the long time required by the process of contracting a staff person. This problem grew as
the time remaining in the project grew shorter.

(5)     Also, the nature of the remote PV rural market and the fiduciary responsibility of
the PMO for the grant funds required caution and due diligence in disbursements of grant
funds, which led to delays in disbursing sales performance grants and cash flow problems
for the PV companies. These delays led to negative feedback at times from PV
companies.

(6)     The QRF did not work well. It was never quick as it took the PMO a long time to
evaluate the proposals, to obtain the required approvals and to sign the sub-grant
agreements. Furthermore, the projects often ended up not being for the intended purpose
and not meeting the criteria of being urgent and small. To be effective, QRF proposals
would have to have been evaluated, approved and contracted within three weeks and this
did not happen. The QRF should also not have been used by companies who wished to
by-pass the CGF competitive process. Except these, QRF still was very successful.

Overall, the project was implemented very satisfactorily. The NDRC maintained the
project's results oriented focus, while encouraging flexibility to adjust to changing
market conditions, the learning being generated while implementing the project and
international best practices.

The World Bank management and staff also encouraged flexibility while maintaining a
focus on achieving results and the project objectives. The World Bank supervision teams
operated professionally, visiting PMO periodically, suggesting actions to improve project
performance. The World Bank staff and consultants had rich knowledge and worked hard,
which contributed to the successful implementation of REDP. The Chinese participants
learned about many project management experiences from them. In linking REDP with
international PV expertise and best practices for PV market development projects, World
Bank staff ensured that REDP benefited significantly from international as well as
Chinese knowledge and experience. They carried out their fiduciary responsibilities
effectively. The World Bank staff and consultants of the Washington and Beijing offices
maintained good relations with the PMO.
