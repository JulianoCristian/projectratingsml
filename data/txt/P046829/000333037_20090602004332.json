         Development Project for China were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, Global environment objective (GEO) outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the risk to GEO outcome was\n            low or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: take specific country\n            circumstances into account when designing off-grid\n            electrification. Lessons learned in other countries should\n            be applied with caution. Analytical work conducted during\n            the early stages of preparation should not be confined to\n            market conditions, prices and affordability but should\n            extend to technology options, market and growth analysis,\n            the need for credit and implementation arrangements. Design\n            of monitoring and evaluation should take into account\n            practical implementation issues. Foster synergies between\n            market and technology development. Empower the market\n            participants through decision making; cost shared grants are\n            particularly effective whether for technology development or\n            market development. Ensure fair and transparent allocations\n            in designing cost shared programs. Adapt procurement method\n            to implementing agency capacity and technology and provide\n            adequate support. For wind farms, especially when knowledge\n            of the technology has not taken root, single responsibility\n            contracting methods are preferable."}, "docdt": "2009-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
