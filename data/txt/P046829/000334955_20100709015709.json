Lessons include:\n            for interventions in rural Photovoltaic (PV) markets, it is\n            important to conduct a rigorous and extensive market study\n            early in the preparation stage to provide information on\n            market characteristics and barriers and to lay a solid\n            foundation for effective project design. Linking subsidies\n            to quality improvements can be effective in situations where\n            consumer perception of and feedback on quality are limited.\n            A technology-neutral and bottom-up approach that avoids\n            prescribing designs and sizes can be critical in unleashing\n            the creativity of businesses in developing products that\n            meet local needs. Clear policies supporting development,\n            access to the grid and mechanisms for cost recovery are\n            critical preconditions for private sector-led renewable\n            energy development. A market-based approach to PV\n            dissemination requires a consistent and well coordinated\n            approach by all PV project supporters. Market-based\n            approaches risk limited uptake if they compete with heavily\n            subsidized approaches."}, "docdt": "2010-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
