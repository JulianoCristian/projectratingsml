INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE LIEERIAN BANK FOR
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT (LBIDI) WITS THE
GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Liberian Bank for Industrial Development and Investment (LBIDI),
with the guarantee of the Republic of Liberia, for the equivalent of US$1.0
million to help finance foreign exchange coats of projects to be financed
by LBIDI in 1972 and 1973. Amortization would conform substantially to the
aggregate amortization schedules applicable to the specific investment pro-
jects financed out of the proceeds of the loan, with a maximum period of 15
years from the approval of an investment project. The interest rate would
be 7 1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE EOONOMY
2.        An economic mission was in Liberia in 1970 and its report (AW-25b)
dated June 1, 1971, was distributed to the Executive Directors. Country
data are given in Annex II. The next comprehensive economic mission is
scheduled for early 1973. An updating mission visited Liberia last December.
Its main conclusions were discussed in my Report to the Executive Directors
on the First Education Credit (P-1044), dated March 14., 1972, and were sum-
marized in nm report on the recent Integrated Agricultural Credit (P-1054),
dated April 6, 1972. The econamic analysis in these reports remains basic-
ally the same except for one important new development. The Japanese group,
which was considering whether to participate in opening up a major iron ore
mine at Wologisi, now appears to wish to postpone any decision. If this
delays the exploitation of the mine it may someihat weaken the prospects for
exports and Government revenues. The Government and the Bank are exploring
the implications of this new development.



3$.       While Liberiafs GNP has grown at an average annual rate of about
14 in real terw during the last decade, most of this growth originated in
the large enclave sector -- primarily iron ore, but also rubber. nd logging
which altogether contribute about 35% to GDP and 85% to merchandise exports.
There haa been little growth, hawever, in the large underdeveloped rural
econonqr. The econic situation improved markedly in 1969 and 1970, because
of higher export prices for irom ore and rubber. However, in 1971, economic
activity lost some of itB buoyancy, mainly because of the adverse external
market. Iron ore production, wbich accounts for some 70% of the value of
exports and 25% of GDP, failed to expand, largely owing to the general eco-
nomic slowdown in industrial countries, and especially the reduced ELuropean
demand for iron ore. The rubber industry was even more adversely affected
in 1971. Pricee received by Liberia rubber producers fell sharply through-
out the year.
4.        The1se developments weakened the budgetary eituation. A a result,
last December the Government negotiated an fl standby arrangement for
4 million SDRts. The Governmentl' letter of intent included a commitment
to introduce tax reforms, to exercise greater.expenditure control-, to limit
domestic bank credit and not to incur or guarantee any external debt of less
than 12 years' maturity.
5.        The recesosin in the iron ore market, together with the continued
decline In rubber prices, clouds the imediate prospects for Liberia's
growth. The unfavorable iron ore market is expected to last for at least
another year. The longer term prospects are more favorable although there
are some uncertainties regarding the expansion of idning. Outside the
enclaves, development continues to be oonstrained by the shortage of invest-
ment programs and projects, limited public savings (caused primarily by the
heavy debt service burden on the budget), and by the shortage of experienced
administrators and civil servants.
6.        The new administration of President W. R. Tolbert took office last
July.  It has taken encouraging steps to piovide more effective economic
leadership and to cope with the main development constrainta. In the past
there was no systematic development plwaning in Liberia, but the new adminis-
tration intends to prepare a development plan to begin around the.mid-
seventies. Preparation of the plan will be helped by the completion lait
month of the report of a comprehensive ILO mission; The mission visited
Liberia in November to prepare a development strategy and polioy guidelines,
with emphasis on employment.   The Bank economic mission scheduled for early
1973 should also assist the Government in preparing its plan. Fwrthermore,
the Government has requested the Banksa assistance to introduce an effective
system of economic planning. This request io now under study.



- 3 -
7.        Although there are, as yet, no formal development objectives in
Liberia, public statements by the new administration have placed primary
emphasis on more widespread economic development, promoting rural develop-
ment and reforming the civil service, while maintaining Liberia's tradi-
tional "open door policy". In his Annual Message laat December, the new
President declared agriculture to be the Governmentl' first priority and
stressed the importance of integrated rural development to "offer the
masses the greatest degree of participation and involvement in the develop-
ment effort".
8.        The proposed tax reforms and budgetary restraint should help to
mobilize domestic resources for development. ut' the Government also
intends to obtain more revenues by improving the enforcement of the con-
cession agreements and renegotiating same of them. A central administration
for formulating concession policies, and enforcing concession agreements
will be established shortly with UNDP assistance.  To improve the capacity
of public administration, the Government has established a Coumission to
undertake "a complete evaluation and reorganization of the civil service".
The most apparent needs are for better training of middle and upper level
civil servants, and the establishmnt of uniform salary scales, a merit
system for selection and promotion, and a peniion scheme.
9.        Public capital expenditure in 1971  continued at the level of
about $10-20 million for the fourth consecutive year, reflecting the short-
age of well-prepared projects and reduced external assistance. However,
if the capacity to identify and prepare projects improves, public invest-
ment is expected to rise to about $17 million annually over the next several
years. There were no new aid comitments for capital projects in 1971,
whereas they averaged about $9 million in the previous two years. IBRD
loans accounted for about 61 percent of these comitments, the U. S. for
32% and the African Development Bank (AfDB) for 7%.
10.       External debt outstanding at the end of 1971 is estimated at
$164 million. About 65 percent is owed to the United States (mostly loans
from AID), 11 percent to Germany, 9 percent to IBRD and 14 percent to
suppliers (mainly Italian). In the past two years debt service has absorbed
about 13 percent of net export earnings and about 24 percent of current
government revenues and these proportions are not expected to change sig-
nificantly over the next several years.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
11.       The Bank has made five loans for projects in Liberia. totalling
$20 million and the. Association has made two credits totalling $8.4 million.
The latter two were signed May 17, 1972 but are not yet effective. IFC,
which helped establish LBIDI in 1965, has subscribed 25 percent ($250,000)
of its share capital of $1 million. The Bank's loans have been for roads,
port expansion and power and the credits are for education and agriculture.
Project execution and loan disbursements have been generally good. Annex I
contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments
as of April 30, 1972, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
12.       Until recently, Bank Group lending has been almost exclusively
for infrastructure.. It is now intended, however, to broaden the scope of
Bank Group lending to include agriculture and education and the two credits
signed on May 17, 1972 reflect this change. The agricultural project
provides for carrying out pre-investment studies in two regions and preparing
investment proposals for at least one rural development project in each
region. The project also provides assistance for a pilot rubber scheme,for
strengthening the planning effectiveness of the Ministry of. Agriculture, for
assistance for rice research and for a study of the Liberian-owned rubber.
industry. The Liberian-owned rubber industry which produces about one-third
of Liberia's arubber output (the other two-thirds being produced by foreign
concessionaires) has been suffering from low yields and more knowledge of
its problems and prospects is necessary before any significant expansion
plans are 'initiated. Lending for agriculture and education will continue,
in conformity with the reordering of priorities by the new Liberian adminis-
tration. Because of the serious scarcity of local expertise to prepare- and
implement development projects in agriculture and education, techiical
studies and training are important features of both the agriculture and
education projects. The aforementioned studies should pravide the basis for
further Bank Group lending in both sectors in the immediate future. Two
important studies dealing with transportation have recently become available.
The Government is anxious to act on their recommendations and a Bank mission
is scheduled for August to discuss possibilities for transport financing
with Government representatives, and other prospective lenders. Since Govern-
ment gives high priority to highway maintenance, including equipment and
technical assistance for personnel, the Bank is considering a project for
this purpose which should be ready for presentation to Executive Directors
in FY 1973.



13.       Prospective development projects in Liberia would require Bank
Group lending of about $5 million annually over the next few years. This
would provide less than half of estimated external capital requirements
of some $12 million. The United States and Germany are expected to provide
the remainder. On the basis of the present forecaat of project preparation,
public investment is expected to rise to an average of about $17 million a
year. Liberia qualifies for a blend of Bank/IDA financing. On the one
hand, further IDA assistance appears justified in view of the new adminis-
tration's efforts substantially to improve economic policies; the wide-
spread poverty (60 to 70 percent of the population are engaged in eubsistence
agriculture, have derived little benefit from the development of the enclaves
and have an average per capita income of lese than $50, compared to the GNP
per capita of $235) and the time required before the budgetary constraints
on debt servicing capacity will be overcome. On the other hand, Liberia's
rich resources, being developed by foreign private capital, provide the base
for long-term economic growth and should make an increasing contribution to
the resources available for development of the backward areas of the country,
provided there are improved yields from renegotiated concession agreements.
Moreover, since the overall level of Liberia's external indebtedness is
still relatively moderate -- despite the current debt servicing pressures --
the country is in a position to assume some lending on Bank terms.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL SECTOR
14.       Liberia is in the very early stages of industrialization.
Manufacturing accounts for about 5% of GDP and involves less than 8% of
employment in the monetized sector. Most Liberian industries are engaged
in import substitution with only a few (fisheries, logging, explosives)
exporting on a commercial scale. The most important enterprises are an
oil refinery, a cement factory, and firms producing food and beverages,
wood and furniture, textiles and shoes. Industrial development has been
constrained by the size of the market and shortages of skilled and aemi-
skilled workers. These shortages provided the reason for including a
technical training component in the recently approved education project.
15.       The Government took several actions in the 1960. to encourage
investment and employment in Liberian enterprises. It established the
Liberian Development Corporation (LDC) in 1961 and sponsored the creation
of LBIDJI in 1965; an Investment Incentive Code was adopted in 1966.
16.       The Liberian Development Corporation (LDC) was established to
conduct feasibility studies, help prepare and assess investment proposals
and provide technical assistance to local enterprises. Its functions also
include reviewing applications for investment incentives and guaranteeing



-6-
commercial bank loans. After over 10 years of operations, however, LDC
has not fulfilled its expectations. Its guarantees are ineffective because
of legal complications and have been limited by a shortage of funds. LDC
has little capacity for project preparation and has suffered from a serious
shortage of competent staff. There has been little co-ordination with
Government departments or with LBIDI. These deficiencies are recognized
by the new administration. A government investigation is now underway,
aided by UNIDO, to determine whether LDC as presently set up can be
strengthened, whether its operations should be merged with the existing
Bureau of Industrial Development in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry
or whether an entirely new mechanism should be created. The UNIDO study
will also prepare a program of assistance to small firms and help establish
an industrial estate in Monrovia. The Bank will follow the studies closely
and help Government formulate a program to promote industrial entrepreneur-
ship and the climate for industrial development.
17.       The Investment Code, introduced in 1966, is consistent with the
traditional "Open Door" policy of attracting foreign investors. It affords
import duty exemption for capital goods and raw materials ranging from
one to seven years; income tax exemption for one to ten years for approved
projects; and protection frcm competing imports. Forty-four projects have
been approved for such incentives with a total capital investment of $8.1
million. There has been growing Liberian dissatisfaction with the Code on
the grounds that the incentives are too generous. Government officials
consider that, compared with the benefits to the investors and the number
of jobs created for Liberians, the loss of government revenues has been
excessive. President Tolbert has called for a review of the Code, as well
as for more effective machinery for its implementation. This review is
now being conducted by a team in the Ministry of Commerce. and modifications
in the Code are expected to be proposed shortly.
18.       While these various investigations are essential, their objectives
are limited and Government has sought Bank Group assistance to review and
supplement these efforts with suggestions for a broader study that would
include specific recommendations for improving the climate for industrial
development. (See para. 19).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Introduction
19.       A central objective of this project is to help the Government
expand and improve Liberia's industrial sector. LBIDI can make an important
contribution towards the needed improvements but its success will be greatly



- 7 -
dependent on better Liberian Government policies and an improved milieu
for industrial development. The proposed loan was negotiate on the basia
of understandings aimed at prcmoting these objectives. At the requeat of
Government, a Bank mission is being considered for the near future, which
will, among other things, review Government proposals to modify the
Investment Code and review the work of the three-man UINIDO team (see para.
16). The mission would conaider how these inquiriea could be implemented
by a. wider study that would produce specific recommendations for improving
the industrial environment. The Bank would be prepared to asaist the
Government in formulating such a study and help the Govement obtain
financing, if necessary.
Background
20.       An appraisal report (No. DB-92a dated Nay 26, 1972, is being
distributed separately. LBIDI, a Liberian statutory corporation, was
established in 1965 with the help of IFC, whieh subscribed 25 percent of
LBIDI's share capital of $1 million. Tle Goveremet, IEC and private
Liberian investors (class A shareholders) together hold 51% of LBIDI's
share capital. At the time of LBIDIta inception, Government provided 8 $1
million loan which is subordinated to other debt as well as to share capital.
This loan is interest free end is to be repaid by LBITI over 10 years
beginning in 1985. Financial institutions, Firestone plantations and two
mining companies (clasa B shareholders) own the remaining 69%. In 1965,
LDDI obtained a loan of DM 1 0 millicn from the Kreditstandtalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW). This loan axceeded LBIDI' s noeds at the tine, parti-
cularly since LBIDI found it more advantageous to conit,, at no cost, its
own equity funds than to use the 4 1/2 percent [W loan. LBmI was thus
unable to comnit the whole KW line of credit before it expired.
21.        nI December 31, 1971,p LBIDI's positimn was as follows:
U3$ 000
Equity                                            1,t33

Total resources                  3,166
Lesat Net Portfolio                               1,640
Undisbursed commitmenta                               8
Government notes (redeemable 1972-81)             1,000
Net fixed assets                                     26
Total commitments                2,674
Resources available for comitment                   492



- 8 -
22.       Substantially the wh'ole of the resources available at the end of
1971 have now been committed.LBUt'has therefore applied for loans to the
African Development Bank (ADB) and to the World Bank. A Bank appraisal
mission, accompanied by a representativerof the ADB, visited Liberia in
December 1971. Negotiations for the proposed loan were held May 15 and 16.
The Liberian delegation consisted of Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaft, Assistant
Minister of Finance for Fiscal Affairs, and Mr. Clarence Parker, president
of LBIDI. The African Development Bank is now considering a loan of
$500,000.- If the ADB approves this loan proposal, the Bank loan and the
ADB loan together would provide LBIDI with sufficient funds to meet its
expected commitments over the next two years.
Objectives and Role of LBIDI
23.       LBIDI was established to promote private enterprise through
loans, equity participations, guarantees and underuiritings. It is the only
Government-supported institution for. financing industrialisation and the
sole source of long-term capital in Liberia. 'LBIDI's influence on the
Liberian economy has been disappointingly small, however, owing to the
small scale of its operations. When IFC participated in LBIDI's share capi-
tal in 1965, annual operations of $1 million were envisaged but have never
been'achieved. Since its operations began in 1967, LBIDI has invested or
lent $2 million, an average of $4I00,000 per year. A peak was reached in
1969, when investments and loans reached $860,000. In 1971, LBIDI approved
eleven investments or loans totalling $266,000. The simill-scale Of opera-
tions has been due to several factors:
a. an insufficiently aggressive search for business;
b. unduly rigid collateral and security requirements (which
resulted in cancellations of six projects for $260,000
in 1971) and maturities and grace periods not much
longer than those of commercial banki, from which poten-
tial LBIDI clients were able to obtain medium-term loans;
c. lack of coordination with LDC and other public agencies.
24.       LBIDI has served mostly small-scale firms; only five of 46 loans
exceeded $100,000 (amounting to 75% of its loan portfolio) and 29 loans
were for less than $10,000. Most of the small loans have been made to
rubber farmers. Others have financed small coffee or cocoa farms. In the
sectoral distribution of LBIDI's operations, industry leads (59% of amounts
approved), followed by agribusiness and livestock (28%) and by tourism,
transport and other services (13%). Industrial loans have been predominantly
for food processing, wood and furniture-, while agricultural projects financed
include palm oil, tobacco, poultry and rubber.



- 9 -
25.       While its performance to date has not been wholly satisfactory,
LEIDI has made a positive contribution in several wys. Mtre than two-
thirds of its financing has been for locally owned companies, which con-
trasts favorably with other African development banks. Most investments
have gone to projects involving a high proportion of domestic value added.
Most projects, furthermore, have been labor intensive and export oriented.
Board of Directors and Management
26.       The Board of Directors consists of eight members, four of whom
represent class B shareholders and four representing class A shareholders.
The Government has two seats in the Board, while IFO and private Liberian
shareholders have me each. Mr. P. M. Mathew, the IF& representative, was
elected to the Board on December 15, 1971. Mr. Stephen Tolbert, the
Minister of Finance and a dynamic businessman, haa recently been appointed
Chairman of LBIDI's Board. Most Board members take a strong interest in
LBIDI's affairs. The Board, which meets twice a tear, has delegated author-
ity to an executive committee to approve investments up to $100,000 and to
exercise moat of the Boardts other powers when it is not in session.
27.       Mr. Clarence Parker, who has been with LBTDI since its inception,
was appointed president in May 1970. He previously had been acting chief
executive.  The general manager is Mr. R. Chellappah, a Ceylonese who was
recruited with the help of the Bank Group and appointed in May 1970. There
have been significant improvements in the past year, particularly in manage-
ment, record keeping, operating procedures, project appraisal and loan
reccveries. LBIDI is taking advantage of Mr. ChQllappah'B presence to
hire and train qualified liberian staff who can provide continuity of manage-
ment upon Mr. Chellappah'a departure1 sometimo in 1974. To that end, it has
recently hired a project director, who will coordinate appraisal and follow-
up work and a new project appraisal manager.
Lending Operations
28.       LBIDI s staff, which has been strengthened considerably in recent
months, now totals 17, of whom nine are professional. The staff is suf-
ficient in number and quality to cope with increasing activities. LBIDI'a
appraisals are good, particularly on market, organizational and financial
aspects. Until recently, economic analysis was weak. To ensure that pro-
jects financed will be economically as well as financially viable, LBIDI
has started to calculate the economic rate of return an projects as part
of its appraisal procedure. LBIDI agreed during negotiations to undertake
this calculation for all investments of over $50,000. LBIDI has also agreed
to establish an effective follow-up system to give management advance notice
on problem cases and to obtain information for investment operations. LBIDI's
books are now better kept, and past errors have been corrected. Ccotrol of
disbursements has improved recently.



- 10 -
29.       LBIDI's Policy Statement precludes it from financing enterprises
in the public sector, and sets the following exposure limits: (a) a maxi-
mum of 10% of LBIDI's resources may be invested in a single enterprise;
(b) a maximum of 10% of LBIDI's equity may be invested in the share capital
of a single enterprise, and (c) total equity investments are limited to 100%
of LBIDI's own equity. The Policy Statement allows LBIDI to consider
agricultural projects associated with or contributing to manufacturing
enterprises.
30.       LBIDI charges interest rates of 10% on loans outstanding plus
a commitment charge of 1/2% and an administration fee of 1% of the amount
of the loan. Since 1971, it has been adding a 1% penalty charge for loans
in arrears of over three months. LBIDI's charges on loans and its security
requirements are comparable to or somewhat higher than those charged by com-
mercial banks. Maturities, which have averaged about five years, and grace
periods have occasionally not been long enough to allow borrowers to service
their debt comfortably.  On balance, LEIDI appears to be rather inflexible
and very cautious in its lending practicea with respect to maturities',
grace periods and collateral requirements. While some caution is under-
standable in view of the poor repayment record of several of LBIDI's borrow-
ers, it also means that borrowers often prefer to deal with comiercial bankz
for medium term loans and come to. LBIDI only when they need a particularly
long-term loan which LBIDI is willing to grant to more established sponsors.
LBIDI's management is now aware of this problem and has 'proposed more flexi-
ble terms for loans submitted to its Board.
Portfolio
31        In the past two years arrears in LBIDI's loan portfolio have risen
substantially. As of June 1971, some payments were in arrears on 40% of the
total loan portfolio. However, a strong effort by LBIDI since last September
to improve the situation has succeeded. Only 13 loan with an amount out-
standing of $79,200 (4.7% of LBIDI's loan portfolio) were in arrears by more
than three months at the end of 1971. LBIDI's serious risks in its port-
folio include two relatively large loans for $126,000 of which LBiDI might
lose as much as 50%, and eight small loans for $19,1:00 which oould be entirely
lost. Potential losses are amply covered by provisions of $190,000 and
reserves of $133,000.
Profitability and Financial Position
32.       After very modest profits in previous years (not more than 3%
on equity), LBIDI suffered a net loss of $135,000 in 1971 due to extra-
ordinary losses of $155,000 as a consequence of the reviluation of the
German Mark. However, with the expected future growth in operations,
profitability is expected to increase 8-10 percent in the next three years.



Leverage is very low, since long-term debt equals only 32% of equity plus
the subordinated Government loan. LBIDI has a strong liquidity position
and a sound financial position with reserves and provisions equivalent to
17% of its outstanding portfolio.
Projected Operations
33.       LBIDI has business prospects sufficient to justify the proposed
loans from the World Bank and the African Development Bank. There is further
scope for import substitution in such induatries as flour milling, meat
processing, beverages, textiles, footwear, and furniture. The processing
of local raw materials offers some possibilities for pulp and glass manu-
facturing, vegetable canning and rubber produots. There is scope for the
development of agribusiness projects in oil palm, coffee, cocoa and rice.
LBIDI's project pipeline at the end of, 1971 included 22 projects requiring
investments of $800,000. Four projects for $400,000 were ready for Board
action, 11 for about $300,000 were at an advanced stage of appraisal and
seven more for $100,000 were at a preliminary stage. In addition, four
projects with a total capital cost of $750,000 have been studied by LDC and
will be referred to LBIDI for financing in 1972. They are in agribusiness,
pharmaceutical products, tiles and cosmetics. LBIDI has based its forecast
of operations on loan approvals of $1 million for 1972, increasing by 10%
annually. Although it is difficult to quantify the company's business
prospects, LBIDI 's experience in 1969, when comitments were near $1 million,
its substantially improved management team, its darnamic new Board chairman,
its improved operational outlook and loans being processed -- all indicate
that LBIDI's goals are attainable.
Resource Requirements
34.       LBIDI's commitments for 1972 and 1973 are expected to reach $2.15
million of which $1.45 million (67%) would be used to purchase imports and
$0.70 million (33%) would be for local procurement. The proposed World
Bank and African Bank loans would meet the foreign exchange needs. The local
currency requirements will be available from the pale of equity investments
and net loan collections ($0.48 million), profits and depreciation ($0.20
million), and the $0.2 million of Government notes to be redeemed in 1972
and 1973. After 1973, LBDI will need additional' foreign borrowing to
finance its foreign exchange requirements. The domestic content of its
commitments will continue to be met from internal cash generation and from

The Proposed Loan
35.       The proposed loan would be on normal DFC terms - i.e. amortization
to conform substantially to the aggregate amortization schedules applicable to
the specific investment projects financed out of the loan proceeds. However,
since LBIDI has not had the opportunity to build up its operations, i.e. amortiza-
tion schedule, to an adequate level, it is recommended that LBIDI receive con-
cessional treatment regarding commitment charges. Accordingly, the normal
commitment fee would not be charged until specific projects are authorized for
withdrawal. Each project requiring $50,000 or more of the proceeds of the proposed
loan would require the prior approval of the Bank. The proposed aggregate free
limit of $200,000 would ensure that at least 80% of the amount of the loan
would be subject to Bank approval.
36.       During loan negotiations understandings were reached with representatives
of LBIDI and of the. Government that measures would be taken to: (a), Establish
an effective system for project follow-up; (b) increase the use by LBIDI of
economic analysis in project appraisal; (c) strengthen the staff and management;
(d) establish greater flexibility in lending terms and (e) strengthen co-operation
with government agencies.
37.       The improvement and expansion of the operations of LBIDI should con-
tribute significantly to more rapid, soundly-based industrial development in
Liberia.'
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTSW-AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Liberian Bank for
Industrial Development and Investment (LBIDI), the draft Guarantee Agreement
between,the Republic of Liberia and the Bank, the Report of the Committee-
provided for in Article II, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. With the exception noted in para. 35 the
draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loens for development finance
company projects.
39.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECdKKENDATI0N
40.       I recommend that the Executive Direotors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Project execution and loan disbursements have generally
been satisfactory. However, late last year the Government
decided to add several new functions (radio, television and tele-
communications) to the existing power, water and sewerage functions
of the Public Utilities Authority (PUA). This appears to conflict
with assurances obtained in connection with Loans 684-LBR and
778-LBR. The Bank's basic concern is that the expansion of PUA's
operations might be an excessive burden on management, and that
its efficiency might suffer as a result. Government's position
is that PUA's new management structure is specifically designed
to accommodate the additional functions, and to do so in a manner
that will make operation of the utilities more efficient. These
matters were discussed in April with the Minister of Finance.
A Bank mission is scheduled to visit Liberia in mid-June to pursue
the matter further.
The off-shore costs of both power projects have increased
in terms of U. S. dollars, partly because of the devaluation of
the U. S. dollar and partly because of the installation of units
larger than those originally planned. A supplementary loan may
be necessary but it would have to be accompanied by substantial
improvement and clarification of the accounts receivable position
of PUA which has shown some deterioration. PUA has taken some
steps to remedy the situation.
