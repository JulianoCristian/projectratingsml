(i) introducing improved tubewell\n            technology; (ii) undertaking a phased program to\n            rehabilitate and modernize most of Bihar's existing\n            public tubewells (PTWs); and (iii) strengthening the\n            institution responsible for PTW activities, Bihar's\n            considerable groundwater potential will be expanded\n            resulting in an increase in agricultural production. The\n            tubewell irrigation systems to be rehabilitated or\n            constructed under the project will be distributed in 26 of\n            Northern Bihar's 38 administrative districts. The Bihar\n            PublicTubewell Project will comprise a seven-year program\n            and will support several components. They will comprise:\n            (i) construction of about 500 new public tubewells; (ii)\n            modernization of about 1000 existing tubewells; (iii)\n            rehabilitation of about 3700 other existing tubewells; and\n            (iv) construction of power lines to about 5200 tubewells so\n            that sufficient power is available to achieve planned\n            irrigation intensities.  In addition, the project will\n            include (v) improvements to management capability, through\n            construction of buildings, provision of vehicles and\n            equipment, training, monitoring and evaluation; and (vi)\n            provision of technical services to undertake special studies\n            including management, socio-economic performance and cost recovery."}, "docdt": "1986-08-15T00:00:00Z"}
