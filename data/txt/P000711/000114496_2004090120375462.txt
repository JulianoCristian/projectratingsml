Dear Sir:
     FAMILY HEALTH PROJECT (CREDIT 1913-ET) AMENDMENT TO SCHEDULE 1
     We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Family Health
Project) dated July 14, 1988 and Amendment of Schedule I dated
January 15, 1991 between the People's Democratic Republic of
Ethiopia (the Borrower) and the International Development
Association (the Association).  We also refer to your letter of
November 29, 1991 requesting a reallocation of proceeds of the
above-mentioned credit.
     We are pleased to inform you that the Association agrees to
your request, and that the Association has accordingly shifted the
funds from the unallocated category to a newly created
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Supplies category.  We have also taken
the liberty to shift the unspent balance of SDR 576,480 under the
Project Preparation Advance to this new category. The attached
amendment of Schedule I reflects this reallocation.
     We will advise you later about the overall cost-sharing
percentage which had been temporarily increased from 75 to 90
percent as per our letter of December 27, 1990.
                         - 2 -
     Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by
signing and returning the enclosed copy of this letter whereupon the
amendment shall constitute a binding agreement between the Borrower
and the Association.
                   Sincerely yours,
                   Francis J. Lethem
