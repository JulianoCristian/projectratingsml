In order to achieve these objectives, the\n            project will comprise the following components; an area\n            development component to upgrade the MCH/FP services in the\n            Shewa regions; a manpower development component, to upgrade\n            the training for nurses, laboratory technicians, and\n            sanitarians in five schools. The Family Health Project will\n            also include strengthening of key MOH units, establishment\n            of a building and vehicle maintenance unit and a health\n            education component. A pharmaceutical development component\n            is also funded, aiming to rationalize local manufacturing\n            operations, improve procurement, distribution and quality\n            control, and to train pharmaceutical technicians.
