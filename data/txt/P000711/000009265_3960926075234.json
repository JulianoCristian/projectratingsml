quality, coverage and cost-effectiveness of\n            maternal and child health (MCH) services, to increase the\n            availability and use of family planning (FP) services, and\n            to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of\n            Health (MOH). In order to achieve these objectives, the\n            project will comprise the following components; an area\n            development component to upgrade the MCH/FP services in the\n            Shewa regions; a manpower development component, to upgrade\n            the training for nurses, laboratory technicians, and\n            sanitarians in five schools. The Family Health Project will\n            also include strengthening of key MOH units, establishment\n            of a building and vehicle maintenance unit and a health\n            education component. A pharmaceutical development component\n            is also funded, aiming to rationalize local manufacturing\n            operations, improve procurement, distribution and quality\n            control, and to train pharmaceutical technicians. Finally,\n            studies will be initiated in health financing options and\n            the hospital's subsector."}, "docdt": "1988-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
