    Maintenance Project, the country hopes to ameliorate its\n            inadequate road network which is now in need of an\n            integrated program for construction, modernization,\n            rehabilitation maintenance, to meet the burgeoning demand\n            for road transport.  To this end, the project specifically\n            includes civil works and an institutional development\n            program.  The first component of civil works comprises (i)\n            road rehabilitation; (ii) deferred maintenance works; and\n            (iii) supervision.  In line with this, the institutional\n            development program comprises:  (i) preparation of a Road\n            Master Plan; (ii) implementation of an action plan for\n            improved road maintenance; and (iii) implementation of an\n            action plan to strengthen the construction industry."}, "docdt": "1987-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
