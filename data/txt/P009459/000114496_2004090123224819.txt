Dear Mr. Shah Jahan:
Re:
Credit 1827-BD (Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance
Project) - Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Road Rehabilitation and 
Maintenance Project) between the People's Republic of Bangladesh (the Borrower) 
and the International Development Association (the Association) dated September 
2, 1987 and your letter of April 12, 1994, requesting the Association to amend 
Schedule 1 in the Development Credit Agreement by reallocation of about U`S$1 
million, equivalent to SDR 715,000, from Category 4 (Unallocated) to Category 
1(a) Rehabilitation Works (Phase I). The Association hereby also proposes to 
increase the percentage of expenditures to be financed by the Association under 
Category 1 (a) from 57 percent to 70 percent as stated in the original 
Development Credit Agreement, because the original funding provided by OPEC has 
been drawn down.
Accordingly, the Association proposes to amend the Table in Schedule 1 to 
the Development Credit Agreement, which was last amended by the Association in a 
letter dated July 6, 1993, to read as follows:
Amount of the Credit

(b) Phase II
     39,000,000

(4)

      3,385,000
Total       78,100,000
All the conditions of the Development Credit Agreement, as amended hereby, 
shall remain in full force and effect.
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing and 
dating the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us. This amendment 
will become effective upon the date of your signature.
