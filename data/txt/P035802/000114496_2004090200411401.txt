Re:

Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Ms. Grybauskaite: 
 
We refer to the Loan Agreement (
Municipal Development Project
), dated 
December 7, 1999, between the Republic of Lithuania (the Borrower) and the International Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank).  We also refer to your letter of April 6, 2003 to 
the Bank notifying the Bank of the reorganization of the Housing Urban Development 
Foundation (HUDF), the project implementing entity, and the assumption of all its obligations 
under the Loan and respective Agreement by the Central Project Management Authority.  In 
order to reflect the new institutional changes in project implementation, the Bank has agreed to 
the following amendments: 
 
1. 
Section 1.02 (e) of the Loan Agreement is amended to read as follows:   
“(e) “HUDF” means the public institution Housing and Urban Development Foundation 
operating pursuant to its by-laws approved by Resolution No. 202 of the Minister of 
Finance of the Borrower, dated July 29, 1999 and registered in the City of Vilnius on 
August 5, 1999, (Registration No. VS97-138) or its successor thereto;”  
2.  
 Paragraph 3 (b) of Part A to Annex 1 to Schedule 5 of the Loan Agreement is amended 
to read as follows: “Applications made pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this 
paragraph shall be presented to the Bank on or before June 30, 2004. 
 
All the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, as amended hereby, shall remain in 
full force and effect.
