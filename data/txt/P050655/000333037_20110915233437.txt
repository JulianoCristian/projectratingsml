A. SUMMARY
1.      The proposed changes will support cancellation of an amount of SDR 6.875
million (US$ 11 million equivalent) from the Rajasthan Health Systems Development
Project (Credit No. 3867-IN).


B. PROJECT STATUS
2.    As of September 5, 2011, of the IDA Credit of SDR 61 million, approximately
SDR 47.96 million (78.6%) has been disbursed. The key project data are as follows:

               Project Data                       Current Project Performance Ratings
Board Approval:      11/03/2004            Achievement of Project Development Objectives S
Effectiveness Date:   21/07/2004           Implementation Progress:      MS
Original Credit Closing Date: 30/09/2009   Risk Flags:        nil
Revised Credit Closing Date: 30/09/2011
Credit Amount:      SDR 61 million
Amount Disbursed: SDR 47.96 million

3.      The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) of RHSDP are: (i) to increase access
to health care of the Below Poverty Line (BPL) and underserved population by upgrading
health care facilities in the remote areas, promoting public private partnership and
improving health care seeking behavior through demand side interventions; and (ii)
improve the effectiveness of health care through strengthened institutional framework for
policy development, program implementation and management capacity, and increase in
the quality of health care.
            i) Under Component 1: project management, policy development and
                capacity building, the project developed model contracts for engagement
                with the private sector; strengthened integrated management information
                systems at 238 project facilities; developed clinical, management and
                administrative training capacities for the health sector; undertook studies
                to inform policy decisions; completed evaluations of project initiatives;
                and disseminated best practices.
            ii) As part of Component 2: development of primary and secondary health
                care services in public sector, 238 project facilities were strengthened
                through investment in infrastructure and equipment and supply of essential
                drugs and consumables; collection, treatment and disposal of health care
                waste management through a network of Common Treatment Facilities
                was funded; monitoring and evaluation systems were introduced for
                                                4
               recording performance of facilities against key output indicators; and
               Health System Improvement Teams (HSITs) were established in the 238
               facilities to sustain quality improvement processes.
           iii) Under Component 3: health care innovations for the disadvantaged, the
               project used print, electronic and traditional media for information,
               education and communication (IEC) on health issues amongst target
               vulnerable groups, initiated facility-based counseling services, and held
               outreach camps in remote and inaccessible villages of nine priority
               districts. The camps included free-of-charge provision of maternal and
               child health services, necessary medicines, immunization, essential lab
               services, and health information. Significantly improved quality of
               services at project facilities and outreach camps and increased uptake by
               disadvantaged populations are demonstrated by hospital performance data
               and validated by independently-conducted patient satisfaction and
               utilization studies.

4.       Good planning and procurement practices resulted in substantial credit saving of
around US$30 million at the original credit closing date of September 30, 2009. The
credit was extended by two years with a category reallocation to continue the health
system strengthening activities summarized above as well as pilot several innovations.
Ongoing activities were maintained while several new initiatives were successfully
implemented. Training on geriatric care, disaster management and skill upgrading for
doctors was completed, as well as training on rational use of drugs, disability
management and medical law. A web-based Health Management System (HMS) was
operationalized in nine district hospitals. The project supported infrastructure
development of the State Institute of Health and Family Welfare (SIHFW) and the state
resource center, as well as trauma and rehabilitation centers, Intensive Care Units (ICUs)
and burn wards. A consumer feedback and complaint redressal system was piloted in 23
facilities. Print and electronic IEC was created and disseminated through a contracted
agency to encourage improved health behaviors. A pilot program supporting health
communicators was rolled out in nine priority districts, leveraging the role of Accredited
Social Health Activists (ASHAs) in the field.

5.       Frequent turnover of personnel in project management impeded implementation
of some activities planned for the extension phase. Activities not completed included a
number of training programs, accreditation of two district hospitals, a social
accountability pilot, development of a medical equipment repair and maintenance system,
establishment of a drug logistics and supply chain management system,
institutionalization of a special purpose fund for major infrastructure maintenance and
repair in the Health Sector for district level hospitals and below, and pilot private sector
contracting for service delivery. The state government and the National Rural Health
Mission (NRHM) have ensured support for a number of these planned activities,
including initiating citizens’ report cards as a social accountability mechanism,
supporting drug logistics and supply chain management, and establishing a medical
equipment repair and maintenance system through the newly-established Rajasthan
Medical Services Corporation Limited.


                                             5
6.     Over the entire period of implementation, the project has achieved substantial
progress towards its objectives. Access of BPL patients to both outpatient and inpatient
secondary care has doubled: in 2006 8.1% of all outpatients were BPL, rising to 16.6% in
2011, while among inpatients in 2006, 8.3% were BPL, increasing to 16.9% in 2011.
Similarly, access of patients from tribal communities to secondary level inpatient care has
almost tripled; in 2006, 7.6% of all inpatients were from tribal communities, rising to
20.2% in 2011. Access to secondary health facilities providing obstetric services
improved, demonstrated by a 35 percentage point increase in the number of facilities
conducting more than 10 deliveries per month. The proportion of facilities maintaining a
stock of 15 essential drugs rose from 69% in 2008 to 86% in 2011. 85% of project
supported facilities participate in the monthly Hospital Systems Improvement review
process. Over the life of the project, the availability of nurses has improved from 89.5%
in 2006 to 116% in May 2011, although the availability of doctors and lab technicians
continues to be a challenge.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES
Financing

1.      Due to partial completion of the planned activities during the extension phase, a
portion of the credit will not be spent during the remaining project implementation
period. Consequently, IDA has received a request from the Government of Rajasthan
through the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs
(DEA) requesting cancellation of US$ 11 million. Accordingly, the revised allocation is
given below.
