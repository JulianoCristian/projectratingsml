Activities not completed included a number of\n            training programs, accreditation of two district hospitals,\n            a social accountability pilot, development of a medical\n            equipment repair and maintenance system, establishment of a\n            drug logistics and supply chain management system,\n            institutionalization of a special purpose fund for major\n            infrastructure maintenance and repair in the health sector\n            for district level hospitals and below, and pilot private\n            sector contracting for service delivery. The state\n            government and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) have\n            ensured support for a number of these planned activities,\n            including initiating citizens' report cards as a social\n            accountability mechanism, supporting drug logistics and\n            supply chain management, and establishing a medical\n            equipment repair and maintenance system through the\n            newly-established Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation\n            Limited.
