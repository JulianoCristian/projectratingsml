                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Rajasthan Health Systems Development Project (RHSDP) was approved in March 2004 (SDR 61 million, US$ 89 million) and was extended in 2009 by two years, with a closing
                         date of September 30, 2011. Due to savings stemming from exchange rate changes as well as partial completion of some project activities during the extension phase, SDR 6.875

                         million was canceled from the credit, so that the final credit amount is SDR 54.125 (US$ 84.5 million). RHSDP has made a significant contribution to revitalizing and strengthening
                         the health system in the state. In the past decade, in tandem with increased government health spending to which the project contributed, health indicators have improved
                         significantly. For example, the infant mortality rate fell from 67 per 1,000 live births in 2004 to 43 in 2010-11, and the proportion of deliveries taking place in health facilities rose from
                         30% in 2002-04 to 71% in 2009. Through capital investments and technical assistance, the project has largely achieved its development objectives, supporting health service

                         delivery to disadvantaged populations, particularly secondary-level care. The project rolled out several activities in nine focus districts located in desert areas and/or with significant
                         tribal populations to support achievement of its first objective, which is to increase access of the poor (BPL) and the under-served population to health care. These activities included
                         outreach camps in difficult to reach areas; provision of counseling services to facilitate information and physical access of disadvantaged populations; behavior change training for
                         service providers; and several print, electronic and interpersonal communication campaigns for encouraging preventive, promotive and curative behaviors. Data available from
                         Hospital Management Information Systems of 238 project-supported health facilities indicates that, as a proportion of total outpatients and inpatients, attendance of below-poverty-line
                         (BPL) patients doubled during the project lifetime. Moreover, inpatient attendance of patients from scheduled tribes has trebled during the period. Achievement of the second project
                         objective, which is to improve effectiveness of health care through institutional development and increase in quality of health care, is indicated by the sharp increase in the number of
                         public facilities conducting more than 10 deliveries --the infrastructural and skill up-gradation supported by the project and improved staffing and availability of appropriate skill mix at
                         government health facilities since baseline, contributed to this. The capacity developed by the project within government has been harnessed by the state to establish the Rajasthan
                         Medical Services Corporation and roll out of a scheme for free medicines to all patients at public health facilities. The project has also catalyzed the development of a drug logistics
                         and supply chain management system in the state and introduced a concept for institutionalization of zonal medical equipment maintenance and management workshops in the state.
                         The state government has taken steps to continue project-supported activities, such as outreach camps, and effectively maintain capital investments.
