Health Systems\n            Development Project for India were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: capacity of\n            procurement staff in Project Management Units (PMUs) and\n            procurement support agencies needs to be more rigorously\n            assessed. Despite the fact that all procurement plans, bid\n            documents, technical drawings etc. needed for the first year\n            of implementation were already prepared during project\n            preparation phase, and that procurement support agencies\n            were contracted, the project still experienced major\n            procurement delays which resulted in slow disbursements.\n            Teams need to more carefully assess whether planned\n            activities designed to overcome procurement bottlenecks are\n            likely to work, paying careful attention to the capacity of\n            the project procurement staff and the selection of the\n            procurement support agencies. Faced with implementation\n            difficulties, teams tend to focus on the project\n            implementation issues that require resolution. However, they\n            also need to make a concerted effort to use the\n            opportunities provided by an active project to engage in\n            policy dialogue with clients on overall health systems\n            development which could potentially have a far greater long\n            term impact. In particular, baselines should be in place\n            early, evaluations should be planned and changes to the\n            results framework should be made as soon as possible to\n            reflect project restructuring and any changes to targets;\n            waiting until late in project implementation may negatively,\n            and unnecessarily, affect project outcome ratings. This is\n            an area that may need greater management attention."}, "docdt": "2012-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
