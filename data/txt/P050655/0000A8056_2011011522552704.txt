                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Rajasthan Health Systems Development Project has completed the first year of its two year extension phase. The progress towards achievement of the project objectives while
                         on track, needs focused attention. While the data indicates an improvement in the access and utilization of both outpatient and inpatient services by disadvantaged groups like below


                                                                                                                                                                                                            Page 1 of 7

                         poverty line population (BPL) and scheduled caste/scheduled tribes (SC/ST) at the project facilities; two of the indicators for BPL population continue to lag behind the revised year 6
                         targets: (i) percentage of BPL populations among out patients seen at all project facilities i.e. district hospitals (DH) and sub divisional hospitals (SDH & CHC) - 16.9% against target

                         of 21%; and (ii) percentage of BPL among inpatients seen at all project facilities - 16% against target of 17%. This implies that the activities to improve the access of the BPL
                         population to health services need to continue to be implemented and monitored in order to meet the end-line targets of 27% and 21% respectively for (i) and (ii). In addition, while
                         GOR remains committed (increased recruitment of nurses at the primary level and doctors at first referral units) to addressing the human resources constraint issues, the availability
                         of doctors according to staffing norms continues to be low - 65% (and 48% for tribal facilities) against a target of 90%. This target may be difficult to achieve considering the
                         constraints of availability of doctors and /or retaining them in difficult remote areas. The project has made significant progress in building linkages with the State Pollution Control
                         Board, State Environment Department, Directorate of Health, NRHM and other Legislative Bodies to address issues related to Health Care Waste Management. The Hospital
                         Systems Improvement Teams in each project facility continue to work towards enhancing quality of care available at these institutions. Progress on the two newly initiated activities,
                         namely strengthening of Drug Warehousing System and establishment of the Medical Equipment Maintenance and Management Workshop is slow - while contracts for all works
                         have been awarded, completing the works, followed by equipping/furnishing, and operationalizing the drug warehouses and equipment workshop need to be implemented within a
                         tight time-line.
