                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress against the PDO indicators on hospital service utilization indicate a stable or improved performance. In comparison with data from December 2009, most recent data from
                         December 2010 indicates that access of BPL to both outpatient and inpatient care at secondary level hospitals has improved from 13.9% to 18.8% and 14.1% to 15.8% respectively.

                         The access of Scheduled Tribe groups to inpatient care too has stabilized at 24.96%. In the past six months the project has executed several information, education and
                         communication (IEC) initiatives to improve awareness of the availability of secondary health care services. Ongoing initiatives to improve access for disadvantaged populations like
                         the outreach camps and patient counselors continue. 96.2% of CHCs in the state are conducting more than 10 deliveries a month; 91.2% of project facilities are submitting
                         performance related data before the 15th of the subsequent month; there is a gradual decrease in the number of facilities conducting monthly Hospital Systems Improvement Team

                         meetings, which in December 2010 were being conducted by 81% of facilities. Staffing with respect to doctors and specialists, continues to be a challenge. Over the past year, there
                         has been an improvement of 5.5 percentage points in availability of doctors; 2.1 percentage point improvement in availability of nurses and 4.1 percentage point decrease in the
                         availability of lab technicians. A similar trend is observed with staffing in Tribal districts with the decrease in lab technicians showing a drastic 14.3 percentage point decrease.
