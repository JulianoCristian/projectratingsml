N.GERIA
THE NIGERIAN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK LlIMITED
SU111KARY
i. *The Nigerian Industrial Development Bank Limited (NIDB) was
formed in 1964 with the active help of the Bank Group. NIDB obtained
its first loan of US$6.0 million from the Bank in March 1969.  This loan
is likely to be committed soon and NIDB has asked for a second.
ii.       In 1969, NIDB's volume of business rose rapidly.  Total ap-
provals amounted to £N 2.4 million (including about £N 1.2 million in
foreign exchange) or more than three times NIDB's total approvals in
1968. Projects already approved and NIDB's present project pipeline
indicate that 1970 approvals will exceed last year's level. The up-
swing in NIDB's business became possible because of contirnued stability
in areas outside the war zone, the Nigerian Governmentts stress on im-
port substitution, and the attraction to clients of NIDB's foreign ex-
change resources in a setting of import and exchange stringencies.
Even so,, NIDBts business is not yet large for an economy as sizeable as
Nigeria's.
iii.      The significant volume of business that NIDB did last year with
resident foreign companies has increased criticism of NIDB for not doing
enough to support Nigerian businessmen. NIDB's support to Nigerian spon-
sored projects has not been unsubstantial, but it is a minority in NIDB's
portfolio. NIDB is now making special efforts to seek out suitable pro-
jects sponsored by private Nigerian interests. It will continue to co-
operate with the Government seeking new ways to assist Nigerian entre-
preneurs, especially small businessmen.  In addition a new policy,
agreed with the Bank, will permit NIDB to finance Government companies,
subject,however, to the restriction that not more than 2570 of its port-
folio will be invested in such companies. This policy change reflects the
Government's w-ish to associate NIDB 'with the atteimpt to reconstruct
Government companies affected by the wiar, and Tith new Government in-
vestment in other public sector enterprises. NIDB wfill apply its normal
investment standards to Government projects and will, be free to reject
them if th-ese standards are not met.
iv.       NMJB has also been criticized for making heavy investments in
businesses controlled by a resident foreign group. To offset this criti-
cismn, it has adopted a policy that wtill restrict to 15% of its portfolio
its exposure to any group of interlocked businesses.



- ii -
v.       laDB has been able to strengthen further its capacity to appraise
projects. It still has to do more to improve its assessment of the
economic viability of its clients against a time when Nigerian industry may
be less protected than now -  It rust -1so improve. the quality of its project
supervision and of its accounting and internal administration. The
appointment of a deputy, to relieve the General Manager of some of his
burden is also needed. Understandings were reached during the recent
loan negotiations on action needed to deal with these problems, including
the active search for a Deputy General Manager.
vi.      NIDB's portfolio is considerably better now than at the time
the first Bank loan was considered. This is due to three factors:
(i) the six projects situated in the former war zone were recently
fcind to be capable of reconstruction and NIDBTs losses on them
should not be excessive, (ii) NIDBts portfolio has grown and includes
now some large loans to well-established companies and (iii) the
problems which a number of NIDB's client companies were facing
in 1968, have diminished or been solved. Even assuming somewhat larger
losses than NIDB itself has assumed, WlIDB1s portfolio is more than adequately
covered by reserves.
vii.     NIDB's income has improved samewhat over the levels of previous
years because of increasing dividend earnings from companies entering
production and somewhat lower administrative expenses. A large part of
NIDBIs income is still derived from temporary investments of liquid
assets awiaiting investment in the business of NIDB. Taking together
NIDB's improved portfolio and its good results in the past two years,
NIDB:s financial position now is sound.
viii.    The most important development for NIMts business outlook
is the cessation of the civil war. Taking into accaont the general
upsurge of business this is expected to provide, the projects coming
to NIDB through rehabilitation activities, and its new ability to
finance some public sector enterprises, 111DB can look towards a rising
volume of business in the nextfew years. To carry out its program up
to the end of 1972 NIDB needs to replenish its foreign exchange rescurces
by about US$10 million. At present, the Bank is N4IDB's only source for
fresh foreign exchange resources and NIDB has therefore requested a
loan of US$10 million. On the basis of its present satisfactory
conditions, business expectations, and plans for further strengthening
of its organization, MIDE would be a suitable and creditworthy borrower
for a Bank loan in that amount.



- iii -
ix.       The terms of the proposed Bank loan should follow generally those
applied to recent Bank loans to development finance comrpanies. NIDB should
no longer receive concessional treatment regarding the Bank's commitment
charge. Recognizing some improvement that has taken place in the recent
past in NIDB s project appraisal, its "free limit" for the use of Bank fund
should be raised from $ 100,000 under the first loan to $ 200,000 under the
proposed loan. However, not more than a quarter of the proposed loan in the
aggegate should come under this limit. Bank funds should be available to
finance Government projects, but only up to 25% of the amount of the loan.



APPRAISAL OF
THE NIGERIAN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPIIENT BANK L'IITED
1.        The Nigerian Industrial Development Bank Limited (NIDB)
obtained its first Bank loan in an amount of $6 million on M'arch 5, 1969,
about five years after it had been created with the help of IFC. This
loan is being committed more rapidly than foreseen last year. In view
of a well-stocked pipeline of Drojects, NIDB is now seeking to replenish
its resources and has requested another loan from the Bank.
2.        A Bank mission visited NIDB in November 1969 and this report
is based on its findings, as well as subsequent information derived from
close and continued contact with NIDB. The report brings up to date the
situation and prospects of NIDB, since report No. DB-12a was presented
to the Executive Directors (R69-18) on January 30, 1969. It also takes
into account recent developments and the scope for resumed peaceful
economic development in Nigeria.
I. THE ENVIROMNIT
The General Setting
3.        The most important recent development in Nigeria is the end of
the civil war, following the surrender of the rebel forces on Janu-
ary 12, 1970. The repercussions of this event on the country's economy
cannot yet be assessed fully. It is clear, however, that the Federal
Government wants to go ahead with a major reconstruction effort as soon
as possible after the immediate war relief needs have been met. The
four-year Reconstruction and Development Plan which the Government is
working out is not yet available. Tentative information indicates that
the Government envisages a total investment during the next four years
of £N 1.6 billion (US$4.5 billion) of which EN 780 million, or one half,
will be in the public sector and the other half in the private sector.
Government investments in industry are to amount to about £N 130 mil-
lion or 20%. It is also known that the Government, as part of a new
industrial policy, is considering major participations in a number of
important new ventures such as an iron and steel complex, petrochemicals,
a second oil refinery and automobile assembly plants. There is a pos-
sibility however that the tentative targets may be too ambitious.
4.        In spite of the war, Nigeria's economy in 1969
registered increases in production, especially in manufacturing. Even
before the war ended,petroleum production resumed its upward trend



-2-
and exceeded the one-million b/d mark 1/ last April. Output in 1970
is expected to total about 60 million Tons, With attractive prospects
for further oil output growth, Nigeria's foreign exchange receipts from
petroleum are, on a conservative basis,expected to rise to about $400
million in 1970/71 and to about $800 million by 1974/75.
5.        Even with recent improvements in oil revenues, Nigeria's foreign
exchange position is still tight as a result of the war and will probably
remain so for the next year or two. It is not surprising, therefore, that
foreign exchange resources available for investment, including the Bank's
first loan to NIDB, have proved attractive to enterprises in Nigeria.
This is so because imports of capital goods and production materials,
requiring licenses since mid-1969, were hampered by administrative delays
in license approvals. The Central Bank's gross foreign exchange reserves
at the end of April 1970 amounted to $129 million or less than 2 months
of current imports, Current liabilities totalled $218 million, of which
$148 million represented arrears in payments for commercial imports and
$70 million of accumulated and unremitted investment income. Some of
these war-time symptoms will soon be mitigated because the Government has
just announced that 40% of the accumulated investment income will be freed
for remittance during 1970/71, and that the trade payments arrears (the
"pipeline") will be gradually reduced.
6.        The war effort, the attendant deficit financing by the Federal
Government, and import restrictions, have produced a high degree of
liquidity in the banking system and in the economy, resulting in infla-
tionary pressures. It can only be hoped that despite the large-scale
outlays now likely to be made for reconstruction, inflation can be avoided
by an increase in imports and by judicious Government policies.
7.        Given the war-induced import restrictions, and existing Govern-
ment incentives, manufacturing industry responded swiftly to the op-
portunities of import substitution. Particularly, the production of
textiles expanded significantly, from 219 million square yards in 1968
to 282 milliorn square yards in 1969.. In order for Nigeria to become
independant of imported raw materials, the Government decreed a backward
integration of the textile industry to be accomplished by 1972. Manu-
facturing industry has also entered into the production of a wider range
of consumer goods, though this is not exclusively the result of the war.
Protection of industry in Nigeria is considerable and on present indi-
cations, will only be reduced gradually, if at all, over the next few
years. Some of the recent investments may have difficulty in standing
up to severe competition, especially if the present highly protective
regime should be relaxed.
1/ 1,000,000 barrels per day is equivalent to 50 million tons per year.



6.        Nigerian entrepreneurs are increasing in number, but the major
portion of recent initiatives towards establishing new enterprises and
expansion works have been carried by resident foreign business communities.
This has become an issue which is also important for NIDB.
NIDB's Relations with the Business Community, the Government and
Financial Institutions
9.        NIDB has participated in and, in fact, aided the industrial
investment boom favored by import substitution policies. Since the maJor
part of the boom was initiated by foreign resident entrepreneurs, it is
not surprising that the bulk of NIDB assistance (70%) in 1969 went to
foreign-sponsored companies. This development added to criticism levelled
in earlier years by Nigerian Government and business circles that NIDB
does not do enough to help Nigerian entrepreneurs.
10.       NIDB has stepped up its efforts to meet the criticism to which it
has been exposed. NImDB is trying more actively to explain its role to
the public as to what it has done to help Nigeria's enterprises. More
importantly, in the past few months NIDB has presented to its Board some
important projects of Nigerian-owned enterprises. Furthermore, NIDB's
present project pipeline includes, among a total of 27 proposals, 15 that
are Nigerian-sponsored representing, in terms of requested commitments,
about two-thirds of this pipeline. NIDB is also discussing with the
federal authorities a proposal to help small-scale industry. The proposal
calls for NIDB's administration of a public loan fund at the Government's
risk for the benefit of small Nigerian enterprises. It is not certain
whether the proposal will come to life in the suggested form, but some
role for NIDB in assisting small industry in the future may emerge. NIDB
has also been approached by state governments who wish to identify projects,
but these inquiries have not been pursued systematically by NIDB since it
is not appropriately staffed for such work.
11.       NIDB's desire for greater involvment in Nigerian enterprises
and, secondly, for an active role in the country's reconstruction effort,
has led to two important policy decisions of NIDB's Board. NIDB just
revised its statement of investment policies to allow its financing of
public sector enterprises; this activity is limited, however, to 25% of
NIDB's industrial portfolio and would, therefore, not detract from NIDB's
main function, the financing of private productive enterprises. NIDB's
involvement in a limited manner in Government projects can be beneficial
because it would help ensure that these projects are put together properly.
This is especially important for the Governmentts announced decision to sell
Government-sponsored enterprises to private Nigerian investors once these
companies are operating profitably. In any event, NIDB will be free to
reject Government-sponsored projects which, in its judgment, do not meet
NIDB's normal investment criteria.



- 4-
12.       The other important decision was to limit to 15% of NIDB5s indas-
trial portfolio NIDB's financing of any group of companies where the control-
ling interests rest in one specific business group. This decision was
prompted by a recent and steep increase in NIDB's comitments to firms
controlled by a single resident foreign group. Although these comnitments
are sound, NIDB has judged that concentrated support of resident foreign
firms seriously jeopardizes its image in the country as well as the support
of the higerian authorities. NIDBM's decision appears timely.
13.      NIDBts work has been appreciated by both Nigerian and foreign
businessmen.  NIDB is considered the most professional Nigerian insti.tuti.on
in the development finance field, and its help in working out projects
properly has been recognized. The large amount of equity participations
by NIDB, which has improved the capitalization of enterprises _s vell as
the Nigerian stake in them, has, however, not yet received widespread
understanding in Nigeria, perhaps due to the fact that significant sales
from portfolio to Nigerian investors have not yet taken place.
14.      At present, long-term financing for manufacturing industry and
other private business can only be had in sifnificant amounts from NIDB
and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC). NIDB is the only
Nigerian institution active in this field. Former regional institutions,
such as NNDC in Kaduna and DFC in Enugu in the East, are intended to be
dissolved and their functions to be given to the contemplated state
development corporations. These corporations have yet to be created
and this process will probably take time. With few institutions active
in term financing in the country, there has been little joint financing
recently; only two transactions involved NIDB with other financial
institutions in 1969.
15.      As in the past, foreign financial institutions which are among
NIDBts shareholders, continue to be helpful to it in various ways.
16.      NIDB's relations with the World Bank Group have continued
to be good. The IFC Director has attended Board meetings frequently.
An NiDB staff member participated in the Bank's 1969 Industrial Projects
Evaluation Course. The Bank Group has organized training for senior
NIDB staff in Washington and elsewhere. The Bank has also arranged for
an Adviser whom NIDB undertook to engage under its first Loan Agreement
with the Bank. Irir. Z.R. Ahmed, formerly Deputy Managing Director of
the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan and now a member of the Bank
staff, was seconded for two years to NIDB and has been working in Lagos
since January 1970. NIDB continues to turn to the Bank Group for
advice and help on various matters.



II. THE C01HPA71
Resources
17.       NIDB's resources have risen sharply over the past year.  This is
in part due to the availability of the first Bank loan. Furthermore, as
arranged during negotiations for the first Bank loan to MIDB, the Govern-
ment in June 1969 paid in the second EN 1.0 million tranche of the second
loan it made to NIDB, in 1966. As detailed in Annex 1, LN 2.9 million of
NIDB's total resources of somewhat over LN 9.0 million as of March 31,
1970, comes from share capital and retained earnings, LN 4.0 million from
NIDB's two Government loans and £N 2.1 million from the Bank's first loan
($6.o million equivalent), so far NIDB's cnly foreign borrowing.
Organization and Procedures
18.       Shareholders and Board of Directors.  There have been no note-
worthy changes among -IDBIs shareholders or in the Board's composition
since 1968. Ilallam Ahmadu Coomassie continues as Chairman. Annexes 2
and 3 give details of NIDB's shareholders and Board. That the Permanent
Secretary of the 'Ninistry of Industry is an NIDB Board member is an
important factor for NIDB at a time when Nigeria is formulating newr in-
dustrial policies.
19.       IIanagement.  Hlr. Silas Dantyan has continued as NIDB's General
IMIanager. The position of Adviser, vacant since mid-1967, was filled in
Janauary 1970. The General Ilanager has indicated to the Bank that he
will make increasing use of the Adviser in all aspects of NIDB's work.
The post of Deputy General lanager h&s been vacant since mid-1968. The
General Manager is now actively seeking appropriate candidates.
20.       Staff and Procedures.  NIDB's organization chart is given in
Annex 4. There have been changes in all three of NIDB's middle manage-
ment positions. Two vacancies which occurred last year (one by the
return of the incumbent to the Nigerian civil service and another by
the return to the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
of a staff member borrowed from that institution) were filled, one by
promotion from within and the other by direct recruitment. A new posi-
tion of Assistant General Manager (project supervision) was added and
also filled by promotion. The position of company accountant has been
vacant for some time. Six new staff members (two engineers and four
financial analysts) have been hired. Except for filling another four
existing vacancies, no large addition to staff strength is presently
contemplated.
21.       The net result of the changes in middle management and recruit-
ment of more staff has been a strengthening of NIDB's Operations Department.



- 6 -
The growing experience and training received by the members of that
department have improved it. Also of benefit has been the process
of sub-project review by the Bank since the Bank loan was mate.  The
weaknesses which persist are insufficient assessment of the long-range
competitiveness of projects (against the present situation of high
protection in certain fields), of the capability of management, and of the
market for products. Remedies for these weaknesses have been discussed
with NIDB representatives during negotiations, and are being pursued
further.
22.      Follow-up activities are now more important than before as
more of NIDB's projects begin commercial production. The Investment
Supervision Department is staffed mainly by new personnel, with the
result that NIDB's management or its Operations Department is not yet
receiving the degree of support from follow-up work that they should
have. This problem was also discussed during negotiations and some of
NIDB's staff will be diverted to supervision work.
23.     With a department head relatively new to his work and some
staff departure, NIDB's Administration and Accounts Department needs
strengthening to keep its work current, to pursue collection of arrears
and to coordinate its work with the Investment Supervision Department.
The General Ilanager has asked the Adviser to focus on improving the work
of this department.
2h.      ICONSEC, NIDBIs stock dealing and underwriting subsidiary,
is being looked after by NIDB's General Mlanager with the help of two
assistants. ICONSEC's activities have been at a low level since 1966
except for one issue in 1969. With several new issues now possibly
in the offing (see paragraph 67), the General Manager is looking for
an experienced Director-in-Charge. He is confident that a suitable
appointment can be made before the end of this year.
Operations
25.      Policies.  NIDB's operational policies are set out in Annex 5.
Since the _Bnkls first loan was made to NIDB, there have been four
important amendments.  In 1969, NIIDB. abandoned its 8-,§ interest ceiling
and in its place adopted a resolution on setting the criteria for fixing
interest rates.  In practice the rate is now 9% ,/. On July 1, 1970,
1/  NIDB also levies a commitment charge of 1-1/2% on undisbursed loan
amounts. If 6 months elaps without disbursement after NIDB has com-
unicated its project approval to a borrower, an additional commit-
ment charge of 1/2%  is -levied.



- 7 -
NIDB made three other changes on which it had obtained the Bank's
agreement:   one involved the broadening of NIDB's business scope to permit
financing of sone public sector enterprises, and a sec6nd the restrictionfl
on commitments to interlocking groups, both of which are discussed in
paragraphs 11 and 12; the third allows NIrB to finance hotels and related
facilities.  Up to 1969, NIDB conducted its business within the limits
of its Policy Statement. In June 1969 it departed for the first time
significantly from the limit set for commitments to a single enterprise,
equivalent to 10 percent of NIDBts net worth.  Three such departures in
1969 and one in 1970 were specifically approved by NIIDB s Board and involved
foreign exchange loans to textile companies financed from the first Bank
loan; these exposures amounted from -N 350,OOO to E  700,000, compared
to a policy limit of >N 275,000.  NIDB's Board considered excess exposure
justified, in view of the quality of the projects; and the Bank agreed.
26.      Volume of Operations.  Despite the civil war,  NIDB's operations
have expanded substantially since 1968, reflecting practically undisturbed
economic activities in the areas not immediately affected by hostilities.
The last major effect on NIDB of the unsettled conditions affecting the
country, were several cancellations totalling IN 806,000 early in 1968
in respect of seven unutilized project approvals of earlier years.
When business resumed in 1968 in more settled circumstances, NIB
approved eight projects for a total of WU 722,000 in 1968, spread over
a variety of industries.  Since Government started substantially to restrict
imports in 1968, and since NIDB had obtained foreign exchange resources
through its first Bank loan, NIDB's business boomed; gross approvals
by NIDB in 1969 covered 20 projects and amounted to IN 2.4 million, over
three times the volume in 1968. A similar level may be attained in
1970, as discussed in paragraph 59.  Furthermore, ever since the spring
of 1968, project cancellations have been small and approvals have, by
and large, become real commitments or become eligible for disbursements k,/
although it has taken between 4 and 17 months to reach those stages.
Most of the 1969 upsurge of project approvals has been in loan form,
with the share of equity investment decreasing.  Participation in public
debenture issues, an important activity of NIB in its early years,
has disappeared entirely as there has been only one fresh capital issue since
1966. Although NIDB accomplished a substantial enlargement of its business
in 1969, its business volume is still modest for an economy of the size
of Nigeria.
/ Disbursements can start if the only remaining action to make an
-WIDB loanagreement effective is the State Government consent needed
by the borrower to give a mortgage to NIDB. Obtaining the consent is
another source of delay.

27.     'Cuity Investments.  Since its creation in 1964, NIDB has had
a very high proportion of equity investarents in its operations. For
most of its existence, NIDB has been seeking to increase the Nigerian
stake in companies through its equity investments and has pursued this
objective particularly in its commitments to foreign-controlled enterprises 2/.
As a result, JIUB' s equity investments took up almost 30% of its total
indastrial portfolio by 1969, among the highest equity percentages in
portfolios of development finance corpanies associated with the World
Bank Group.  In the past two years, however, NIDB has been reluctant to en-
hance its heavy equity exposure.  New equity commitments dropped to 10%
and 18% of total approvals in 1968 and 1969, respectively. NIIB expects
to reap in the next years the fruits of the earlier investments as more
of the companies in which it holds shares start operating and become
profitable; for that reason, NIDB has not yet sold its good equity
investments. The desire for reward is understandable, but NIDB should
not lose sight of possibilities of sales to potential Nigerian holders.
28.      Import Financing.  About 60 to 70% of NIDB's loans finance
imported goods.  In earlier years, before NIDB had foreign exchange
resources at its disposal, such imports were financed with Nigerian
pounds which were converted. With the availability, however, of the
World Bank line of credit and with the increased foreign exchange
stringency about half of NIDB's loans are financed with foreign exchange.
The remaining import component of its project loans continues to be
financed with the use of Nigerian pounds. NIDBrs foreign exchange
loans made with Bank funds are not required to go through complicated
governmental clearance procedures. Otherwise, converting Uigerian pounds
into foreign exchange involves administrative delays.
29.      Geographical and Industrial Pattern. An important characteristic
of the -past two years was the high incidence of NIDB projects located
in Lagos. State. Assistance approved for the projects in Lagos State
account for about 65% of total cumulative approvals up to March 31,
1970, as can be seen from page 1 of Annex 6. The portion of projects
near Lagos in NIDBB s portfolio was almost 606f (as shown on page 2 of
the same Annex). This is a high proportion and N4IDB would have to spread
itself more into other areas of the country if it wants, as it should,
to retain a national character. To help that objective, NIDB recently
decided to open early in 1971 an office in Kaduna, the capital of the
North Central State. (It is encouraging that from among 27 projects for
which NIDB is now considering commitments totalling almost IN 3.0 million,
nine for a total of about iN 700,000 are in areas which have so far had
little attention from NIDB). Until mid-1968, nearly one quarter of
NIDB's industrial portfolio was represented by investments in the East
but this percentage has since come down to about 13%.
%/ This objective is also being helped by the fact that most loans,
especially to foreign enterprises, contain conversion rights or stock
options; 11 projects, approved in 1969 and 8ainly involving foreign-
sponsored enterprises, contain such rights.



30.      The spurt into textile operations during the past year will
change the industrial composition of NIDB's portfolio. Textiles accounted
for about one third of portfolio both in mid-1968 and late in 1969
and rose to almost 45" as of lMarch 31, 1970. Although the enterprises
financed are potentially quite profitable, 45% representing textiles
in NIMB s portfolio is a high proportion, considering that some of these
enterprises have a good market only because textile imports are restricted.
NIDB now has somewhat less textile projects in sight 1/, but those that
will be taken up require searching scrutiny by NIDB as to how they would
stand up if a greater degree of competition were to prevail in the
Nigerian textile market. iJot all nay justify NIDB' s finance;
and this possibility could have consequencesfor NIDB as discussed in
paragraph 35. Other important elements in NIDB's industrial portfolio as
of March 31, 1970 were food and beverage products (14%) as well as investments
in enterprises making metal (11%), wood (11%) and rubber products (7%).
Further details are given in Annex 7.
31.      Controlling Ownership in Companies financed. As shown in
Annex 8, almost one-third of both-the number of enterprises and the
amounts approved for them by NIDB up to March 31, 1970, went to companies
in which Nigerians hold controlling interest. A figure for Nigerian
control of industries for the country as a whole is not available.
Nevertheless. there is some reason to believe that the volume of Nisgrti-nst
investment in industry as a whole is less than the Nigerian-controlled
proportion of NIEB's approvals. This is almost certainly true with respect
to the modem sector of industry in which NIDB's interest is concentrated.
Although NIDBts assistance to Nigerian enterprises continues to be a
minority in NIDBIs portfolio, NIDB's contribution to such enterprise has
been significant and the recent changes in NIDB's Policy Statement are
expected to increase that contribution.
32.      Overruns in Project Costs. The only significant overrun since
1968 has been experienced by the Swiss-Nigerian Wood Industries project,
largely due to delays resulting from the war, inefficient management
and underestimates of the investment costs; NIDB is financing one-fifth
of the overrun of LN 300,000 bringing its total exposure in the company
to IN 310,000.  Other overruns, which some of NIDB clients are experiencing,
are in manageable proportions and are principally due to delays resulting
from difficulties in obtaining property title deeds and slow construction.
33.      ICONSEC.  Icon Securities Limited (ICONSEC) has suffered from
the general business slowdown in the securities market which followed
the outbreak of hostilities in 1966. After a period of three years,
in which no public issues had been placed on the Lagos capital market,
ICONSEC successfully underwrote, in July 1969, an ordinary share offering
by the Nigerian subsidiary of Tate and Lyle Limited, a well-known
British sugar company, for EN 262,500. The public issue was over-subscribed
by more than 100%. As can be seen frcx Annex 9g ICONSTC's stockjobbing
;/ Eight projects for IN 850,000 or about 30' of its whole active projec t

activities have been of limited significance in the past three years.
ICCNSEC acted in 1968 as broker for Government securities. This role
is shared by ICONSEC and two other brokerage houses in Lagos %/ each
undertaking the function on a rotating basis for a year at a time.
3L.       NIDB's Contribution. It is still not possible to obtain a
good quantitative measure of 1IDB's impact on the Nigerian economy.
In the first years of its establishment, NIDB made an important contri-
bution to the development of industries new to Nigeria. Also, before
the onset of the political difficulties in early 1966, ICONSEC played
a major role in arranging and placing new industrial issues, i.e.
by raising about iH 8.0 million in new capital for industrial ventures)
or about 11.5 times its own and NIDBts direct financial contributions.
While up to 1968, nearly 75% of NIDB?s project approvals related to
the financing of new factories, NIDB's assistance in 1968 and 1969
has primarily gone to expansion projects which amounted to about 60%
of NIDBs assistance.
35.       About half of the amount of NIIBts financial assistance to
the recent expansion projects was for the backward integration of
the textile industry, and some for the diversification into various
finished textile products.  Nearly all of these investments were induced
by demand and the need to reduce dependence on imports for raw material
supplies. As said in paragraph 30, some of the import substitution
activities may not have been economic. During negotiations and subsequent
contacts, NIDB representatives were advised that the Bank would critically
examine HIDBEs textile projects as to their long-range economic viability.
If textile projects, or othersfor that matter, were viable only due
to high levels of protections, such projects would not qualify for
financing from the proposed Bank loan. To enable the Bank to make
appropriate evaluations, arrangements were made that in future NIDB
would calculate the incidence of effective protection.
36.       Already 30 out of the 43 companies, to which NIDB funds
have been disbursed since 1964L, are producing and making a considerable
range of goods; other being either in the stage of construction or
facing difficulties in starting up. Considerable output advances
were achieved by NIDB clients making food products, metal products and
radios, items typically serving markets served earlier by imports.
37.       Overall, NIDB's principal contribution, as in previous
years, has been an intangible one, namely the upgrading of Nigerian-
sponsored projects to meet bankable standards. For instance, INIDB's
most important Nigerian project, the Oke-Afa Farm Enterprise, took
over a year to be properly shaped. Other recent projects, such as the
Bauchi-Nieat plant, required substantial efforts of NIDB. NIDB has
served as a catalyst for the investment of entrepreneurial funds, i.e.
by successfully combining in projects about six times as much as its
own investments in the past two years. However, NIDB has not been
successful in raising financial resources from the public.

38.      In quantitative terms, NIDB's financing is not yet large enough
in relation to the potential for investment in Nigeria despite the
uniqueness of NIMSts position as the only national long-tern financing
institution. After the dislocation caused by the civil war, NIMB has
begun making up for lost time; and, if the momentum it has achieved
can be sustained, it should become before long a significant source of
term funds to lNigerian industry.
Portfolio
39.      Industrial Portfolio.  This part of NIJB's assets amounted on March
31, 1970 to El 4,067,700 compared with LW 2,804,300 at the end of 1968.
The growth in the period does not yet reflect fully the effect of the
large 1969 approvals. Also, some of the 1968 approvals were slow in
getting started.   IDBl's portfolio is peculiar in the sense that, on
top of the customary risks inherent in arrears and difficult projects,
account also has to be taken of the risks affecting its (and ICONSECIs)
investments in the forner war zone, as discussed in the following paragraph.
Projects with problems are shown in Annex 10.
40.      NIDB's investments outstanding in the former Eastern Region
anounted as of ilarch 31, 1970 to WN 516,800 or 12.7% of the industrial
portfolio involving six projects. All these six projects were recently
visited by NIDB staff.  Though Textile Printers, NIDB's largest investment
(LN 200,000) in thle East, has been damaged by the war, NIDB's management
is confident that operations can be resumed by early next year. NIDB
may be asked to participate in the financing of the rehabilitation of
Textile Printers' facilities. Until recently, NIDB reckoned with a loss
of TI_N 100,000 in Textile Printers, but, based on recent findings, such
a loss seems avoidable. From the other five projects in the East only
Alcan (EN 74,600) is likely not to resume operations; the major portion
of lIDB's equity investment of bN 50,000 will probably be lost. Except
for one case (Calabar Veneer), an assessment has yet to be made about the
need for any financial reconstructions of NIDB projects in the East and
NMDB's involvement in such a process. Further details on NIDBMs projects in
the East are also given in Annex 10.
41.      Seven projects outside Eastern Nigeria (of which four outside Lagos
State) show7 varying degrees of difficulties, mainly caused by weak management.
They accounted for about 15% of NIDB's March 31, 1970 portfolio, and require
close supervision by and, in some cases, direct assistance from NIDM. They
include two large investments: Odutola Nigerian Industries Ltd. for EN 195,000
and Swiss Nigerian Wood Industries (mentioned in paragraph 32) for EN 310,000.
Swiss Nigerian Wood started production recently, over two years behind
schedule; management is very weak and the company has to contend with various
technical problems. NIDEB now doubts whether this project will become
viable.  Odutola Nigerian Industries (rubber) is beset by technical and
staff problems; the company, one of NIDB's biggest investments in Nigerian-
owned enterprises, is being watched closely by NIDB, which is also giving
it management advice. Of these two projects, only Swiss Nigerian Wood
was in arrears on March 31, 1970 (almost LN 17,000 since April 1969).



- 12 -
It is at present unable to pay and has asked NIDB to agree to a rescheduling
of its obligation.
42.       NIDB's total arrears over three months on both principal and
interest amounted on March 31, 1970 to about £N 40,000; they include two
cases which, according to NIDB, could have been current had there been more
pressing collection efforts by NIDB. NIDB has to be more energetic in
following up these cases.
43.      Ever since 1967, when NIDB had to write off an important equity
investment in Nigerian Lead-Zinc Co. (EN 100,000), no write-offs approximating
that size have been necessary. In 1969, NIDB wrote off an amount of EN 34,000
as follows: Nigerian  'arble Industries Ltd. (EN 15,000), Preforned Concrete
Ltd. (EN 6,900) 2/ and Dunlop Nigeria Plantations (IN 12,100); the first
two write-offs were necessitated by the conditions of the companies, the
other by an exchange loss on the collection from a sterling debenture after
the pound's 1967 devaluation.
44.      At present, NIDB's short-term portfolio, in the form of advances
under bank guarantees against eventual long-term investments, consists of
only one item, for EN 15,000, granted to the Nigerian Federal Industries
Ltd. (Another short-term advance of W 70,000 to Nigerian/Jakura Marble
Industries to assist the company in carrying on its operations was approved
in April 1969, but has so far not been disbursed.)
45.      A breakdown of ICONSEC's portfolio as of March 31, 1970 is given
in Annex 11. As of that date, ICONSEC's portfolio totalled !N 195,365
(at the lower of cost or market value). Investments in Eastern States
amount to about N 120,000 or 60% of ICONSEC's portfolio. In 1967
and 1968, diminutions in value of investments outside the East amounted
together to about EN 54,000. No provisions have been made so far for possible
permanent diminution in value of ICONSEC's Eastern investments.  ICONSEC's
largest single investment is in a precarious state however, due to the
recent war. It is the Nigerian Cement Co. Ltd., accounting for 75% of
ICONSEC's Eastern investments. Nigerian Cement's recent market value was
only RI 89,000 as compared with a cost of EN 115,048. NIB staff recently
visited this project. Reconstruction has already started and NIDB has
been asked to participate in the rehabilitation of this project. So far
no write-down in Nigerian Cement seems necessary. The other important
ICO0NSEC investment is Textile Printers, discussed in paragraph 40.
46.      The picture emerges that NIDB and ICONISEC may, taken together
and on a conservative basis, encounter losses of about ;N 300,000. The
figure would allow for some unforeseen losses, not including major amounts.
(The background of this figure is also contained in Annex 10.)
2/ This amount has meanwhile been recovered by NIDB after the sale of
the company's assets.
/ In 1967, NIDB made provisions for the full amount of its unsecured
short-term loan of WN 200,000 to the Nigerian lead-Zinc Mining Company
which is bankrupt.

47.       Reserves and Share Value. Reserves b, the end of 1968, after the
consolidation of accounts of NIDB and ICONSEC (see paragraph 56), stood
at EN 281,700 or 10% of the group's long-term loan and equity portfolio.
By December 31, 1969, the group's reserves had risen to EN 514.000-
(In addition, unappropriated profits for the first three months of 1970
amounted to nearly MN 40,000). Thus, NIDB's reserves are substantially
in excess of the conservatively estimated possibilities of Ic9ses indicated
in the previous paragraph. In any event, NIDB's recent net worth position
was considerably better than at the end of 1968. This improvement will
no doubt create  demands by shareholders for dividend pay-outs but has had
no influence on the marketability of NIDBIs shares; NIDB's ordinary shares
were last traded in October 1968 when only 50 of them were sold at par.
Operating Results and Financial Evaluation
48.       Balance Sheets. Annex 12 represents NIDB's audited balance
sheets for the years 1968 and 1969 and the unaudited balance sheet as
of March 31, 1970; the latter is summarized below (in EM  000):
Assets
Cash, short-term investments and
other current assets                       3,038.2
Loans and debentures                           3,005.0
Equity investments                             1,061.1
Investments in subsidiary companies              385.4
Fixed assets and amortized expenses               94.7
TOTAL                                     7j582.4
Liabilities
Current liabilities                               77.1
Government loans                               4,000.0
Foreign exchange borrowings                      554.6
Equity: share capital                          2,250.0
reserves                                 653.2
profit and loss account                   49.5
TOTAL                                      7 584.4
49.       Following the disbursement in June 1969 of the second tranche of
EN 1.0 million of the second Government loan, NIDB's short-term investments
rose to a high level. On MIarch 31, 1970, current assets still amount to
iN 2,734,100 or 36% of total assets.  As has been the case in the past,
the majority (70%) of the short-term investments is in Treasury bills
and Government bonds 1/, yielding 4% and 5.75%, respectively.  The balance
has been invested in bank acceptances and deposits yielding about 4.3%. The
weighted average yield from NIDB's short-term investients at the end of 1969
was 4.52% as compared with 5.25% in September 1968, reflecting generally
/ Government bonds, held by NIDB for several years, account for EN 650,QoCo



- 1.4 -
lower interest rates resulting from the high liquidity of the banking
system in Nigeria.
50.       After the near-stagnation in 1966, NIDB's industrial portfolio
grew by 17% in 1968 and by 29.5% in 1969. (A further considerable increase
is likely in 1970 taking into account the large volume of £N 2.25 million
of net approvals in 1969 and the expected disbursements on 1970 approvals.)
Equity investments, which rose by 50% in the two-year period 1966-1967,
grew by 20% in 1968 and 21% in 1969.
51.       Except for the increase by £N 1.0 million in long-term loans from
the Federal Government and IBRD, NIDB's capital structure, reflected in its
balance sheet as of March 31, 1970, is in line with that at the end of 1968.
NIDB's long-term debt/equity ratio increased slightly from the low level of
1.1 on De-ember 31, 1968 to 1.54 as of March 31, 1970.  As defined in the
Bank's first Loan Agreement with NIDB, the ratio was 0.5:1 on March 31, 1970
leaving NIDB wfith an additional berrowing power of over $N 6.0 millicin
(nearly $17 million).
52.       Profitability.  Although NIDB has had no financial expenses until
1969, NIDB's profitability has been low from the beginning.  However, it has
improved in the past three years. Profits, before taxlV and provisions as
a percentage of NIDB's average net worth, increased from 5.6% in 1966 to
9.4% in 1968 and to 10.1% in 1969.  The details of the income statements for
1968, 1969 and the three months ending l,arch 31, 1970 are shown in
Annex ]3. The principal income streams and expenses, as percentages of
average total assets, were as follows:
% of average
total assets
1968    1969
Income from equity investments                   0.8      0.9

for tax are, however, being made against certain disclaimable items.

53.       NIDB's net income as a percentage of average total assets is low.
Three factors are responsible for this- First, a large proportion of NIDB's
assets (38% in 1969 and 36% as of .--arch 31, 1970) is held in the form of
short-term assets and earning only a gross return of about 5%. This de-
presses total income, a typical feeture of companies that have not yet
developed their business to high and sustained levels. Second, NIOB has
heavily invested in equity (26% of portfolio) as a result of deliberate
policy. These investments are still largely unseasoned. However, dividend
income is increasing; in 1969 it amounted to £N 57,300 as compared to
LN 43,900 in 1968 and £N 21,900 in 1967. Nine NIDB clients paid a dividend
in 1969 against five in 1968. The most important contribution to this
favorable development came from NIDB's £N 50,000 investment in Afprint on
which NIDB received cash dividends of 20% in 1967, 25% in 1968 and 37.5% in
1969. Furthermore, bonus issues raised NIDB's holding in Afprint to
£N 168,750. Third, NIDB's earnings have been depressed by high adminis-
trative costs. But with its industrial portfolio growing, and personnel
costs dropping somewhat, there has been some decline in NIDB's administra-
tion expenses which, as a percentage of average total assets, dropped from
2.4% in 1968 to 2.0% in 1969.
54.       So far, NIDB has only paid the 5.5% dividend on preference shares
and none of the ordinary shares. The rest of its net income has been re-
tained as reserves in the company.
55.       ICONSEC.  ICONSEC's audited financial statements for the years
1968, 1969 and the provisional one for March 31, 1970 are shown in Annexes
14 and 15. ICONSEC, after having contributed significantly to NIDB's pro-
fitability in the latter's early years, has suffered losses ever since 1966
and it has no reserves.  Cumulative losses as of Narch 31, 1970 amounted to
LN 149,264. These losses were due to a combination of factors. Business
and gross income were low, interest payments and management fees to NIDB
continued, and there were also diminutions in both 1967 and 1968 in value of
ICONSEC's investments. ICONSEC's management fee to NIDB is £N 35,000. In
turn, NIDB provides ICONSEC with a credit line for working capital at 5% per
annum; this line of credit amounted on March 31, 1970 to ZN 385,400. As
ICONSEC's affairs are closely related to those of NIDB, one has to consider
the consolidated position of the '1MIDB Group".  ICONSEC's loss record in the
last three years raises the question whether NIDB should maintain it. The
reason for doing so is, essentially, that ICONSEC has developed an ex-
pertise and a reputation in the capital market and will, when market con-
ditions improve, be able once again to contribute significantly to raise
capital for industry in Nigeria.
56.       Consolidated Financial Statements.  Consolidated accounts for
NIDB and its subsidiary iCONSEC were prepared and audited for the first
time in respect of 1967 results.  Consolidated accounts for 1968 and 1969
are set forth in Annexes 16 and 17, together with an unofficial consoli-
dation of the NIDB and ICONSEC accounts as of March 31, 1970.  They show that
the group's profit, after provisions, taxes and taking into account ICONSEC's



- 16 -
losses, equalled 10.4% of NIDB's share capital in 1969 as against 8.1% in
1968. (In 1967 there was a loss equal to 6.3$ of NIDB's capital when full
provision was made to cover an advance of LN 200,000 to the Nigerian Lead-
Zinc Company.)
III. THE OUTLOOK
General Setting
57.       The resilience of the Nigerian economy underlines the basic eco-
nomic strength of the country. It is remarkable that despite a substantial
military effort, there has not been more dislocation, inflation and dis-
ruption in supplies. A quick and substantial recovery of oil production
is underway and efforts to repair and improve the transport, communication
and power systems have started, both inside and outside the former war area.
It is not clear, however, whether Nigeria will be able, in a relatively
short time, to fully utilize the financial resources that she might be able
to mobilize both from home and from outside sources. Furthermore, it appears
unlikely that the Federal Government will permit a complete return to a
situation prevailing before the outbreak of the war of almost unrestricted
imports of capital and consumer goods. Government initiative to obtain for
Nigerians a greater share in industrial investment is likely to strengthen.
There are currents in Nigeria favoring a stronger role for the public sector
in industry. They will probably result in Government investments in larger-
scale basic manufacturing activities, such as metal or petrochemicals. But
it is improbable that, with the expected heavy preoccupation of the Government
with rehabilitation works, the operating area of private enterprise (includ-
ing that of foreign investors) waill be significantly curtailed. To the con-
trary, recovery should be a fillip to private industry.
58.       With peace having returned, an existing market and some industrial
base already established, it is likely that Nigerian development financing
institutions will have more operating scope than in the past two to three
years. This generally favorable outlook may not necessarily result in an
evenly expanding flow of projects, but a large country like Nigeria shou].d
over the years justify the expectations that investors, at one time, had in
its future. In any event, NIDB at present is the only national Nigerian
financial entity equipped to meet the likely future demand for industrial
investment in the country. With the support from its shareholders and the
Bank, it should be able to deal effectively with the demand for its re-
sources and services. Indeed, there are already very practical opportuni-
ties because NIDB has currently a well-stocked project pipeline.
NIDB's Future Operations and Resources Requirements
59.       The large increase in NIDB's approvals in 1969 over 1968 was re-
ferred to earlier. Approvals in 1970 are expected to reach LW 2.6 million
of which an estimated £N 600,000 for the rehabilitation of companies in the
former Eastern Region. Total approvals of LN 2.6 million in 1970 seam, at
first sight, high considering that in the first half of this year, N1fB



- 17 -
approved only nine projects for £N 820,000. However, the number of pro-
jects NIDB has appraised or is in the process of appraising indicate that
it is reasonable that NIDB will approve another £N 1.8 million before
the end of this year. A particularly noteworthy feature of NIDB's present
project pipeline is that there is less emphasis on textiles than in the
past.
60.       With the return of peace, the pent-up demand during the war
years is bound to provide substantial stimulation for investment. To
this will be added some additional projects resulting from the Government's
plan to establish Government-sponsored enterprises which NILB is likely
to be asked to support. Over the period 1970-1974 NIDB's business is likely
to grow. However, because of an extraordinarily high amount of rehabili-
tation projects which NIDB will approve in 1970, it would be prudent to
allow for a drop in expected business as between the current year and
1971. For the period 1972-1974, an increase in NIDB's business by about
10%a appears reasonable.  The foregoing expectations are estimated to re-
sult in commitments for local currency and foreign exchange financing
as in the following table (in £N'OOO):
Loan and equity      Of     Equity and Loan Commitments
approvals, net    which                  Of which in
of cancellations  equity   Total       foreign exchange
Actual     1969          2,254           365      1,570            790
Estimated  1970         2,600            156     2,392           13489
'1     10171         2,400           144      2,466          1,761
it      1972         2,600            156     2,534           1,816
1973         2,900            174     2,800           2,131
1974         3,200            192     3,100           2,203
61.       The above figures indicate that NIEB's total foreign exchange
requirements in the period   July 1970-December 1972, will be the equivalent
of £N 4.9 million or $13.6 million. As against this, NILB had available
out of the present Bank loan an amount of nearly $3.2 million on June 30,
1970.  Tlis amount is likely to be conmitted by August or September of this
year. The balance of NIME's needs in foreign exchange is somewhat over
$10 million. As NIDB has now no practical chance to replenish Its foreign
exchange resources from other sources, it looks to the Bank for a loan of
$10 millionL/. The coverage of NIDB's expected local currency commitments
appears assured well into 1972, from both its available liquid resources
and its internal cash generation.
j/ Including about ZN 0.6 million in respect of 1969 approvals.
j An estimate of the disbursement pattern of a loan in this amount is
given in Annex 18.



- ld -
Financial Projections
62.       The business expectations for the period 1970-1974 shown in
paragraph 60 are the base for NIDB's financial projections detailed in
Annexes 19, 20 and 21. (They do not allow for fresh Government projects
that have yet to be developed and for which there is no basis of quanti-
fication at this stage). The projections assume the availability of a
second Bank loan.
63.       Profitability.  The rise in NIDB's dividend income is expected
to continue-and in 1977  to reach a level double that of 1969. While this
is a good showing, NIDB's projected dividend yield in the period is not
expected to exceed 7% on its average equity portfolio because it would
continue retaining a portion of investments either not yet producing or
not yet paying. NIDB expects to reduce its fresh equity operations to
about 6% of its overall commitments during the next few years.  As a
result, the percentage of equity investments in NIDB's total portfolio
will decrease to about 15% in 1974 and the contribution of dividend
income to NIDB's gross income will decline from 13% in 1969 to 10% in
1974. The projections do, however, not yet reflect NIDB's expected
equity investments in Government-sponsored enterprises.
64.       NIDB expects a substantial rise of interest income in the next
few years. But there is a feature of particular importance to NIDB's
future profitability. Starting in 1970, NIDB has significant financial ex-
penses. They are higher on NIDB's foreign exchange resources derived
from the Bank's first loan than on its local resources, the only resources
available to NIDB and used in its earlier years.  New foreign exchange
resources are likely to be even costlier. Since NIDB's projected opera-
tions iill build up the proportion of foreign currency operations in
its outstanding loans from about one-third in 1970 to nearly three-
quarters in 1974, NIDB's spread of borrowed funds declines significantly
over the five-year period. Compared to a 7.5A spread in 1969, it becomes
4% in 1974. Annex 22 shows that, as a result, there is a decrease in
NIDB's profitability, in relationship to NIDB's average total assets,
from 4.4% in 1969 to 2.1% in 1974. The projected profitability situation
causes concern though it is not critical in the next year or two.
However, NIDB has little room to save on its expenses and it would
therefore have to work on raising its spread. The alternatives avail-
able are a higher interest rate or an increase in NIDB's local currency
lendings or a reduction in local currency borrowin or a combination of
these. On present forecasts, a very large proportion of domestic
currency debt is held in cash, deposits and short-term securities on which
the net return will be negligible.



- 19 -
65.       Capital Structure.  Aside from foreign exchange borrowings, NIDB
also contemplates borrowing local funds from the Government or the Central
Bank. As a result, NIDB's present long-term debt/equity ratio is ex-
pected to increase from its low level of 1.5 in 1969 to about 3.5:1 in
1974. Under the debt limitation with the Bank, the ratio, as defined,
would amount to 2.0:1 in that year and until then not necessitate an
addition to the borrowing base. The projected capital structure is sumi-
marized below (in £N '000):
Actual  1969         1970        1971         1974
Current liabilities                 54.5        108.0       105.0        125.0
Senior long-term debt            2,271.2      3,776.1     6,3b1.0    11,291.2
(of which in
foreign exchange)             (271.2)   (1,b42.7)   (3,547.7)   (8,143.4)
Subordinated long-term debt      2,000.0      2,000.0     2,000.0      2,000.0
Share capital                    2,250.0      2,250.0     2,250.0      2,250.0
Reserves                           653.1        812.1       947.7      1,497.4
7,229.1     U,946.2    11,6d6.7    17,166.6
NIDB appears to plan for local currency borrowings in excess of need.
As noted in paragraph 64, NIDB should consider reducing these borrowings
if it cannot increase its yield on investing them. However, even if the
projected borrowings are carried out, the debt service coverage during the
life of the proposed loan would not be less than about 1.4. This appears
adequate.
66.       Reserves and Dividends.  Reserves reached by the end of 1969 a
level equivalent to somewhat over 13%o of NIDB's and ICONSEC's total
industrial portfolio. This coverage would not drop below l10o through
1974. It would seem therefore that i\IIDB will have no difficulty in
starting to pay, as projected, dividends on ordinary shares in respect
of 1970 and 1971 and a subsequent increase to 7.5% (or a pay-out ratio
of about 30X) in 1973 and 1974. Indeed, such- a decision would be highly
justified.
67.       No financial projections are available for ICONSEC.  At present,
income from ICONSEC is expected to decline as a percentage of NIDB's
total income despite the fact that NIDB projects an increase in its
credit line to ICONSEC (from £N 395,100 in 1969 to £N 616,100 in 1974)
to accommodate future issue business.   ICONSEC is now investigating and
discussing possibilities for new issue business.

TV. CCNCLUSIONS AND RfECOMEDNDATIONS
68.       After the recent troublesome years of NIDB, the last year has
been marked by a substantial increase in the volume of NIDB's approvals.
NIDB's portfolio has grown very rapidly since 1971, especially its long-
term foreign exchange loans and this will have a salutary effect on NIDB's
earnings in the coming years. Some aspects of NIDBIs activity give cause
for concern which featured in the recent loan negotiations. In considering
textile projects in the future, NIDB will have to be careful in regard to
its clients' long-range competitiveness, both to assure itself of the eco-
nomic merit of projects financed and to guard against difficulties at a
time when there might be less governmental protection of the industry.
Secondly, the 1969 increase in NIDB's business volume has mainly bene-
fitted businesses sponsored by resident foreigners and NIDB has attracted
criticism for not doing enough to help Nigerian businessmen. Also NIDB's
financing concentrated heavily in projects relating to a single group of
interlocked enterprises. Recent amendments of NIDB's statement of policies
should help remedy the latter two problems.  Understandings were also reachod
with NIDB to strengthen methods to ensure that the projects NIDB finances
will be economically competitive.
69.       Despite criticism, NIDB's help to Nigerian businessmen is not
unsubstantial. Nevertheless, NIDB needs to do more in this area. NIDB
should continue to press the Government to find an effective device to
assist small scele industry and to continue to offer its cooperation. The
Bank itself should be prepared to help the Nigerian authorities develop an
appropriate program.
70.       Another important development has been NIDB's recent decision to
support public sector enterprises. Such financing will be limited to 25%
of NIDBts portfolio and the decision would therefore not detract from
NIDB's main function of financing private enterprises. The new policy will
help strengthen the Nigerian element in NIDB"s portfolio and should help
ensure that Government projects supported by NIDB will be sound.
71.       In the last year NIDB has improved its ability to appraise pro-
jects. At present, strengthening is needed in project supervision,
especially since more of NIDB's projects are entering commercial production,
and in administration and accounting work. A Deputy General Manager should
be found at an early date, and ICONSEC needs a Director-in-Charge. NIDB's
General Manager is actively seeking suitable candidates for both jobs.
72.       NIDB has continued making important contributions to Nigeria's
economy, both financially and through working for better project pre-
paration by its clients. NIDB is regarded in Nigeria as an entity that
operates professionally. Considering that it is the only active Nigerian
institution in its field, it has a good opportunity to contribute to in-
dustrial development financing in Nigeria.

72.    NIDB has continued making important contributions to Nigeria's
economy, both financially and through working for better project pre-
paration by its clients. NIDB is regarded in Nigeria as an entity that
operates professionally. Considering that it is the only active Nigerian
institution in its field, it has a good opportunity to contribute to
industrial development financing in Nigeria.
73.    The past financial year has seen a considerable improvement in
NIDB's financial position. Likely losses on investments, including those
in the former war zone, are not excessive. Secondly, equity investments
made some years ago have started paying dividends, NIDB's reserves stand
now at a satisfactory level. Even if the conservatively estimated losses
were realized, they would be nearly covered by NIDB's reserves. On the
other hand, ICONSEC has been doing poorly but its losses have not
jeopardized the financial position of the parent.
74.    Hostilities have come to an end in Nigeria.  There is little doubt
that the return of peace has brightened NIDB's prospects. NIDB has already
a well-stocked pipeline of projects under study and can look forward to
a rising volume of business, some of it accounted for by reconstruction
projects to be approved this year. NIDB's commitments in the period
1970-1972 are expected to require resources totalling EN 7.4 million
(nearly $21 million equivalent). While the needed local currency
resources will be available, NIDB's present foreign exchange resources
derived from the Bank's first loan are insufficient to cover the expected
foreign exchange commitments beyond September 1970. NIDB should therefore
obtain new resources. Though the end of the civil war may result in
more foreign exchange availabilities in Nigeria, supply during the next
few years will probably not be such as to lessen the demand for foreign
exchange assistance from NIDB. The business projections over the period
1970-1972 imply the need for another $10 million of fresh foreign exchange
resources to finance NIDB's operations; at present the Bank is the only
practical source of fresh foreign exchange resources.
75.    Considering its prospects, its financial position, plans for the
further strengthening of its organization, and its foreign exchange needs,
NIDB would be a suitable and creditworthy borrower for a second Bank loan
in an amount of $10 million. This loan should allow for some financing
of Government projects but not more than 25% should be available for that
purpose.
76.    The terms of the proposed Bank loan should follow generally those
applied to recent Bank loans to development finance companies. NIDB
should no longer receive concessional treatment regarding the Bank's
commitment charge. Because NIDB has improved its performance over the
past year, the present free limit should be raised to $200,000. This
free limit should apply only to one-quarter ($2.5 million) of the proposed
loan. All loans to Government-sponsored projects should require prior
approval. Cn this basis, it is likely that somewhat over 80% of the pro-
posed loan will be used for projects requiring the Bank's approval.

NIGERIAN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK LIIMTED
Policy Resolutions
I.  (Adopted by the Board on January 22, MAarch 18 and August 19, 1964 and
wnended on February 25, 1966, February 25, 1969, April 14 and July 1 ,1970)
IT WAS RESOLVED that:
The Company shall carry on its business in accordance with the follow-
ing policies and procedures:
(a)  The Company has been established to provide medium and long-
term financing to enterprises operating in Nigeria. As an
investment institution it will not engage in operations of
a commercial banking nature and will not accept time or
demand deposits.
(b) It will limit its operations (save in exceptional circum-
stances) to the industrial and mining sectors.
(c) It will finance enterprises which, by reason of their size,
will make a significant contribution to the economic develop-
ment of Nigeria.
(d) It will finance only enterprises that are privately owned
and managed. The existence of a government or other public
interest in an enterprise wTill not necessarily preclude
financing by the Company, providing the Government's interest
as measured by voting power or control of the management
of the enterprise is not predominant and especially if
the Government's investment is only temporary, pending
its selling out to private interests.
>/In special cases, where an enterprise is important for
economic development and appears likely to be economically
viable but is unable initially to raise sufficient capital
or any substantial capital from local or foreign private
investors NIDB may in association with such private investors
as are available and with any government or governmental
organization assist in financing such an enterprise with
such a capital structure as seems appropriate notwithstanding
that NIDB's own investment in voting shares may initially
exceed 25% of the total (but not more than 49%).
1/ This paragraph was inserted following adoption by the Board on February 25,
1966.



ANTEX 5
Page 2
PROVIDED however that NIDB and the Governmental investors
shall mutually agree that:
(i)  the enterprise shall at all time be managed
on sound business lines;
(ii)  each of them will sell their shares to private investors
as rapidly as may be consistent with good marketing
practices and in equal proportions in accordance with
a Sales Programme to be developed for the purpose;
(iii)  private investors including NIDB shall at all times
own not less than 60% of the voting shares.
(e)  It will diversify its financing (except for temporary
investment of liquid funds in short-term securities) among
different types of enterprises and through different types
of financing; and will not contribute in loan and equity
subscription to any single enterprise an amount equivalent
to more than 10 per cent of the Company's paid-up share
capital and free reserves; provided that commitments to
underwrite issues of shares exceeding the above limitations
may be undertaken if the Company believes at the time
of making any such commitment that it will not be called
upon actually to take up such number of shares as will
make its contribution to any single enterprise exceed
such limitations.
(f) It will refrain from seeking a controlling interest in
any enterprise or any other interest which would give it
primary responsibility for the management of such enter-
prise; it shall not assume responsibility for the manage-
ment of any enterprise in which it has invested except
in case of jeopardy or threat of jeopardy; it will not
take up more than h9 per cent of the shares of any
single enterprise; provided that commitments to under-
write issues of shares exceeding the above limitation may
be undertaken if the Company believes at the time of
making any such commitment that it will not be called
upon actually to take up such number of shares as will
make its holdings more than 49 per cent of the shares of
any single enterprise.



tATEX 5
page 3
(g) It will select projects, subject to sound investment criteria,
on as broad a geographical basis as possible.
(h) It will conduct its operations so as to assist in the growth
of a capital market in Nigeria and improve facilities for
marketing of shares and securities, and will revolve its own
portfolio whenever it can do so on satisfactory terms.
(i) It will build reserves consistent with sound financial practice;
these will include reserves for bad debts and losses on in-
vestments and, in addition, supplementary reserves; at least 50
per cent of net profits (after deducting the amount of the
preferential dividend on the 250,000 5 1/2 per cent Cumulative
Participating Preference Shares) will be put to supplementary
reserves until such reserves reach £ 150,000, and thereafter
at least 25 per cent.
(Q)  It will finance undertakings which are souldly managed and
which appear, on careful investigation, to be economically
viable; it will watch the operations of such undertakings;
and will give technical assistance to management when necessary.
(k) It will build and strengthen its own management and staff
so as to achieve a well-balanced organization, including
financial and economic analysis, technical, accountancy
and legal services, and supervision of previously concluded
investments.
(1) It will take all steps within its power to prevent any one
person or company or group of affiliated persons or companies
from gaining effective control of the Company.
(m) It shall not assume the foreign exchange risk in respect of
relending of any non-Niigerian monies borrowed by it.
(n) It will aim at engaging Nigerians who are suitably qualified
for its senior staff positions and may employ expatriate
staff in such positions for such period as is thought fit
on condition that such expatriate staff will provide training
for the Nigerian staff with a view to equipping them to
take up the senior staff positions when vacated by such
expatriate staff.

II.  (Adopted by the Board on March 18, 1964)
(a)  It was noted that the predominance or otherwise of the
interest of Government or other public bodies in an
enterprise cannot be related only to their minority position
in the equity capital but must be determined in the light
of all the attendant circumstances.
(b) IT WAS RESOLVED that:
(i) NIDB avoid financing service industries, Agriculture
proper should also be avoided except to the extent that
it is an integral part of a processing or manufacturing
project.
(ii) A lower limit to NIDB's assistance need not be fixed at
present. However, cottage and small-scale industries
should be outside NIDB's sphere of operations.
(iii) Any project in which Government and/or Public entities
hold a predominant position in the equity capital, and
there is no undertaking to sell the shares to private
interests, would not qualify for NIDB's assistance.
The enterprise should also not be one in which
Government management is predominant.
(iv) In addition to the maximum limits to NIDB assistance
laid down in the Policy Statement approved at the
meeting held on January 22nd, 1964, loan proposals
should be scrutinized on the basis of a minimum fixed
asset coverage of 2:1, save in exceptional circumstances.
(v)  The rate of interest charges on NIDB loans should be
up to 8-1/2 per cent, allowin& for a reduction of up
to 1 percentage point. Commitment charge at 1 per
cent on undrawm amounts and a small necotiation fee,
should also be charged.
(vi) Legal morta-es if fixed assets, bank or parent company
guarantees, deposits of Government securities or market-
able shares or any suitable combination of these would
be eligible as security for NIDB loans.



ANNEX 5
(vii)  The period of NIDB loans should normally be 12 to 15
years with exceptions down to 5 years and up to 20
years.
(viii) The procedure for disbursement of NIDB loans should
ensure that funds are spent for the specified purposes
envisaged.
(ix) NIDB may undertake promotional activities with respect to
new projects which show promise of ultimately being
eligible for NIDB financing.
III. (Adopted by the Board on August 19, 1964)
IT WAS RESOLVED that:
(a)  Assembling units may be considered for NIDB assistance if
there are reasonable prospects of progressive manufacture
of the components within Nigeria, save in exceptional cir-
cumstances.
(b)  Semi-agricultural and animal husbandry projects may be
considered where hazards of nature are not pronounced.
(c)  Small-scale industry projects may be considered for NIDB
assistance provided they can be brought within the scope
of re-financing operations secured by Government guarantee,
subject to NIDB's usual limits of participation.
(d) Service industries would not be eligible for NIDB assistance.
IV.   (Adopted by the Board on February 25, 1969)
IT WAS RESOLVED that:
the Board of NIDB be hereby empowered to fix the rate of interest
for any loan granted by NIDB as the special circumstances of such
a loan may require, taking into consideration, prevailing rates of -
interest in the capital market, the practice of Banks and other
financial institutions, the currency of disbursement of the parti-
cular loan and the cost of borrowing by NIDB.



ANNEX 5
p age 6
V. (Adopted by the Board on April 14, 1970)
(a)  The Board approved the proposal to levy a finance negotia-
tion fee on applications brought to NIDB and agreed with
the General Manager that there shall be some flexibility
in the application and where it was considered necessary,
a waiver could be proposed.
Commitment Charges
(b)  The Board approved the revision of commitment charges on
the following lines:
an initial commitment charge of 1 1/4% on the undisbursed
amount of loan to take effect a month from the date of
sanction.
in cases where no part of the loan has been drawn after a
period of six months from the date of communication of  !,
sanction, an additional commitment charge of 1/2 of 1% wiil
be made on the undisbursed amount.
VI- (Adopted by the Board on July 1, 1970)
IT WAS RESOLVED that:
Government controlled projects
(a)  Notwithstanding the provisions of the Statement of Policy as
set out in the Resolution of the Board of January 22nd, 1964
paragraph (d) and in any subsequent amendments; the NIDB may
henceforth invest in productive enterprises in which the Gov-
ernment interest as measured by voting power or control is
predominant; provided that such portion of the portfolio of
the NIDB as shall be devoted to government sponsored or con-
trol projects shall not exceed 25% of the total portfolio.
Tourism
(b)   The NIDB may finance tourism in Nigeria to wit: the building
and equipment of hotels and all other incidental projects.

Interlocking Companies
(c)  With effect from the lst of October, 1970, it shall be a
primary policy of the NIDB that the total of financial assist-
ance to a group of interlocking private companies shall not
exceed at any given time 15% of the aggregate of all outstand-
ing loans and equity investment. For this purpose the term
"group of interlocking private companies" shall mean all private
companies, the management or policies of which, the NIDB,
after thorough investigation, determines to be lnder the con-
trolling influence of the same person or group of persons.
This amendment shall be read with paragraph (1) of the NIDB
Policy Statement of January 22nd 1964 which provides that
NIDB will take all steps within its power to prevent any one
person or company or group of affiliated persons or companies
from gaining effective control of the NIDB.
