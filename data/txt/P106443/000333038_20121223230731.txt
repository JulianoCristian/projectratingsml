          SUPPORT TO BASIC EDUCATION SECTOR REFORM PROJECT

                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.     The Support to Basic Education Sector Reform Project (SPHERE) was originally
approved on June 2, 2008 for a total grant amount of US$32 million (TF 91695-PH) from
the Australian Agency for International Aid (AusAID). In view of implementation
delays encountered by the project, the proposed changes include: (a) reallocation of grant
proceeds across expenditure categories; (b) extension of closing date from December 31,
2012 to May 31, 2013; and (c) adjustment of the results framework targets to reflect the
extension period and align these with the current targets in the Philippine Development
Plan 2011-2016.

2.    This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension was for 18
months, from July 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012.


B. PROJECT STATUS

3.      Overall project implementation is moderately satisfactory. Aside from meeting
its original targets for classroom construction, the project has made good progress in
terms of providing critical resources such as teaching and learning materials, furniture
and equipment. In line with the project components, technical assistance in key reform
areas such as on quality assurance, monitoring and evaluation, Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) in education, school-based management, teacher
policy, organizational development, assessment, and learning strategies was mobilized;
capacity building and training activities of regional and division officials in various areas
were also completed as planned. School-based Management (SBM) grants continued to
be downloaded to eligible schools to support the implementation of the School
Improvement Plan developed in collaboration with the school-community stakeholders.

4.       Based on the findings of the recent Implementation Support Mission on the
project, the project development objectives continue to be achievable within the proposed
period of project implementation. Elementary net enrolment rate, computed using the
2010 census data, was recorded at 95.96% for 2011, very close to the 96.10% target. The
project has also made good progress in terms of quality, with secondary cohort survival
and secondary completion rates having exceeded initial project targets. However, there
still remain challenges especially in terms of secondary participation rates, which will be
closely monitored and followed up on during the extension period.

5.    However, in view of the late release of the spending authority from the
Department of Budget and Management last year, and the late start in the procurement

                                             1
process for the civil works component of the project as a result of the change in
procurement method, there were delays in completing Batch 4 of the classroom
construction targets, the 32 Learning Resource Management and Development Centers
(LRMDCs) and the conduct of the capacity building activities for the Regional Offices
on quality assurance. Given implementation delays, the Project has yet to disburse AUD
13.45 million to date.

6.        Reallocation. Grant proceeds from the SPHERE will be reallocated as follows:

                                       Allocation (AUD)               % of Financing

       TOTAL                     39,451,025          39,451,025


7.      The proposed reallocation is intended to build more classrooms in areas with
acute shortage. The increased allocation for these items will mostly be taken from the
allocation originally intended for the printing and distribution of teaching and learning
materials for K to 12 programs. The non-availability of learning materials for the K to 12
programs for printing during the target procurement period led to the Department of
Education (DepEd) decision to request reallocation. In addition, all foreign exchange
gains will be added to classroom construction and school furniture.

8.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to enable the DepEd to complete the
project deliverable and, at the same time, support the Government’s efforts to fully
address the classroom shortages within the next two years.

9.       Grant Closing date. The closing date is proposed to be extended from the
amended closing date of December 31, 2012 to May 31, 2013 in order to allow for the
full implementation of the project activities which were delayed due to the late release of
the spending authority by the Department of Budget and Management and in turn
affecting the procurement of additional classroom units, works and goods. The activities
to be implemented during the extension period include the construction of classrooms,
toilets, and LRMDCs; mobilization of technical assistance in key areas of the reform; and
capacity building on quality assurance and accountability. An action plan, revised
Procurement Plan and Disbursement Schedule were prepared to complete the project.

                                              2
The Government has recently complied with all the grant covenants, which are necessary
to process the extension request. The time extension was approved by the donor, the
AusAID. The end disbursement date will be on November 30, 2013, and will also be
reflected in the amended Administration Agreement.

10.     Results Framework. The Project Development Objective (PDO) targets on
elementary and secondary participation; cohort survival, and completion rates for 2011 in
the original results framework as indicated in the Project Appraisal Document were
adjusted to make them consistent with the current targets in the Philippine Development
Plan 2011-2016 for the same indicators. PDO targets for 2012 were also added to reflect
the extension period.
