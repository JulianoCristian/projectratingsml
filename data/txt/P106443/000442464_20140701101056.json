     Basic Education Reforms Project for Philippines were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Grantee performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            institutionalization of reforms requires a long-term\n            commitment on the part of government and the donor community\n            to support the reform agenda. School based management (SBM)\n            is an important tool for decentralizing an education system\n            and improving learning outcomes. Public private partnerships\n            are important for ensuring the long-term availability of\n            adequate resources to support community schools. Solid\n            analytical studies on system reforms during the\n            implementation period are essential for making appropriate\n            decisions on the elimination of bottlenecks to the reform\n            agenda. Strong financial management systems are critical for\n            ensuring the efficient use and accounting of resources."}, "docdt": "2014-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
