                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
1.     In view of implementation delays, the proposed changes to the project include: (a)
extension of closing date to December 31, 2012; and (b) reallocation of grant proceeds
among expenditure categories.


PROJECT STATUS
2.      The Administration Agreement between the Government of Australia, represented
by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and the WB was
signed on July 31, 2007 and amended on March 24, 2008 while the Grant Agreement was
signed on March 27, 2008 and amended on September 18, 2008. The project became
effective on June 20, 2008. The project has been under implementation for almost three
years. As of June 21, 2011, only about 47.01% of the grant of AUD 39.451 million has
been disbursed.

3.       The supervision mission conducted in February 2011 concluded that overall
project implementation is Moderately Satisfactory. There was moderate improvement in
terms of several outcome indicators such as primary net enrolment rate and completion
rate although the pace of progress in terms of attaining the results indicators vis-à-vis the
targets was slower than expected.

4.        Of the three project components, only the targets vis-à-vis the classroom
construction component have been completed, with 507 new classrooms (including 478
toilets) constructed in high need locations in the last two years.

5.       The activities under the second project component, Translating system-level
policies into actions are of different stages of implementation and completion. Technical
assistance in several areas of the basic education reform such as on school-based
management, teacher policy, quality assurance, organizational development and learning
strategies was mobilized which engendered the formulation of policy instruments and
underpinned the preparation of action plans for nationwide implementation. These were
mainly provided through the engagement of individual consultants. Although the
Department of Education (DepED) intended to hire a consulting firm to provide technical
assistance in several other areas, there was a failure of bidding. Several capacity building
activities of regional offices on quality assurance and progress monitoring were also
undertaken, but scope and coverage over the last two and a half years were less than
planned. The construction and/or refurbishment of teaching and learning resource
centers (renamed as Learning Resource and Management Development Center) across
the country encountered significant delays in terms of procurement so only six Centers of
                                              6
the target of 32 have been completed as of February 2011. Procurement of
supplementary teaching and learning materials were also delayed because of weaknesses
in procurement planning and complex procedures used in selecting titles for printing.
Several in-service training programs of teachers were undertaken in the last two years but
the delays in the assessment of the teachers’ training needs slowed down the pace of
implementation of this sub-component. However, the DepED started to address several
of the bottlenecks or problems encountered, with the final selection of titles to be
procured, prioritization of learning centers to be constructed, improvement of
procurement planning and clearer delineation of roles and responsibilities and
accountabilities of staff involved in the implementation of activities so project
implementation is expected to pick up in the coming months.

6.      While there was progress in terms of installing the basic elements of school-based
management within the DepED, delays were encountered in the provision of SBM grants,
which is the third component of this project. These were mainly due to the delays in the
formulation of guidelines in allocating and distributing the grants and the late release of
the grants by the Department of Budget and Management and the DepED. The requisite
guidelines and procedures were recently developed and are expected to be issued in the
coming weeks to facilitate the provision of these school grants.

7.      However, there are two legal covenants that have not been met by the DepED.
These include a) submission to the Bank of a copy of the internal audit report sixty (60)
days after the end of each calendar semester; and b) submission to the Bank of the 2010
Annual independent validation report on the School Grants.

8.     Based on discussions with the FM team of the Bank and a commitment letter from
the DepED, the latter will submit the Internal Audit report by September 30, 2011 while
the 2010 School Grants Validation Report will be submitted by December 15, 2011.
Policy exception from OPCS VP and CTR VP to the requirements of OP 10.02
(Financial Management paragraph 5) was sought. The OPCS VP and CTR VP
subsequently approved the request for policy exception.

9.      The auditor issued a qualified opinion on the 2010 audited financial statements of
the project because of the unliquidated cash advances amounting to PhP 1.04 million
(USD 24,201) and unreconciled balance of PhP 49.16 million (USD 1.14 million) in the
Subsidy account issued by the Department of Education central office to the field offices
(due to errors in recording the transactions). The Department of Education has
committed to a 70 to 80% reduction of the unliquidated cash advances by June 30, 2011
and full liquidation by the third quarter of 2011. In addition, the Department committed
to the completion of the reconciliation of the Subsidy account by August 15, 2011. A
clear action plan to address the issues raised by the COA auditor will be submitted to the
Bank by June 30, 2011.

        TOTAL                   39,451,025       39,451,025


The reallocation is intended to build more classrooms in areas with acute shortage;
procure more technical assistance on critical areas of the reform program; conduct
trainings and/or capacity building activities for regional, division and school-level
personnel; provide more school-based management grants and provide for more
incremental operating cost for travel, project monitoring and meetings and other
operating costs incurred by the staff in the course of implementing the project activities.
The increased allocation for these items will mostly be taken from the proposed reduction
in the number of Learning Resources and Management Development Centers to be
constructed as well as from the original allocation for the procurement of the consulting
firm. Since the full operationalization of the Learning Resources and Management
Development Centers will require additional human resources and capacity building
activities, DepED management has decided to construct only one Center per division
from the original two per division, to enable them to focus technical assistance to fewer
divisions while the system in terms of structure, processes and tools are being refined.

11.    Closing date

Given the implementation delays, the Project has only disbursed less than half of the
grant proceeds to date. The closing date is proposed to be extended from the original
closing date of June 30, 2011 to the proposed closing date of December 31, 2012. The
time extension was approved by the donor, the Australian Agency for International
Development (AusAID) on May 6, 2011. The end disbursement date will be on June 30,
2013, and is also reflected in the amended Administration Agreement.

12.    Implementation schedule

The implementing agency, the DepED has submitted a work plan and procurement and
disbursement schedule for the remaining activities of the project. The revised schedules
are acceptable to the Bank. The DepED will also submit an action plan on the


                                             8
submission of the internal audit report on the project and the 2010 validation report on
the School Grants by July 4, 2011.

                                  Allocation (in million
                                   Australian dollars)

      School Grants              4,477,709       5,145,514                 100%
Incremental Operating Cost        200,000          350,400                 100%
        TOTAL                   39,451,025      39,451,025


2.      Overall project implementation is Moderately Satisfactory. There was moderate
progress in terms of several outcome indicators. Classroom construction targets have
been 100% completed. Activities under the two other components, particularly those
involving procurement including teaching and learning materials, construction of
Learning Resource and Management Development Centers, consulting firm have
encountered delays although the Department of Education has addressed several of the
bottlenecks or problems, including the final selection of titles to be procured,
prioritization of learning centers to be constructed, improvement of procurement
planning and clearer delineation of roles and responsibilities and accountabilities of staff
involved in the implementation of activities. Delays were also encountered in the
provision of school-based management grants to the schools but the requisite guidelines
and processes to facilitate provision have recently been completed.

3.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to allow the Department of Education to
implement the project activities which are deemed critical to achieving the project
development objectives, and contribute to the attainment of the Education for All and
Millennium Development Goals of the country.

                                     Restructuring Paper



1.     The closing date for Philippines SUPPORT FOR PHILIPPINES BASIC
EDUCATION SECTOR REFORM, P106443 (TF 091695) will be extended from July 1,
2011 until December 31, 2012.

2.      Overall project implementation is Moderately Satisfactory. Aside from
contributing to a reduction in shortages in basic resources, extensive technical assistance
was mobilized and capacity building activities were undertaken in key reform areas such
as on teacher development, school-based management, student assessment, learning
strategies and resource mobilization. Modest improvements in outcome indicators such
as primary net enrolment rate and completion rate vis-à-vis previous year’s levels have
also been achieved. The activities to be implemented during the extension period will
support the Aquino administration’s priority to plug resource deficits in classrooms,
furniture and teaching and learning materials in order to deliver quality basic education
services.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow for the full implementation of the
project activities which were delayed due to implementation bottlenecks. The
implementing agency, the Department of Education has prepared an action plan as well
as a revised Procurement Plan and Disbursement Schedule to complete the project. The
project development objectives continue to be achievable within the proposed period of
project implementation.

4.       The project is not in compliance with OP 10.02 due to the late submission of the project’s
internal audit report and the independent validation report on the School grants for calendar year
2010. The Government, however, through the letter of the Department of Education dated June
22, 2011, has committed to submit the internal audit report and the independent validation report
by September 30, 2011 and December 15, 2011, respectively. Policy exception to the
requirements of OP 10.02, which has been reviewed and endorsed by the FM Regional manager
has been requested from the OPCS VP and the CTR VP. This was subsequently approved by
the OPCS VP and CTR VP.

5. This will be the first extension of the project.
