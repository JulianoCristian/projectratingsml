                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been in a catch-up mode for the past several months following the delays encountered in implementation due to the delayed release of the Statement of Allotment
                         Release Order (or 'authority to spend' ) by the Department of Budget and Management in2011. Although to date, 40% undisbursed (AUD22 m) of the total grant funds remain
                         undisbursed, only 23% (AUD 5 m) are either undergoing procurement or have yet to start procurement while the rest have already been contracted and are undergoing
                         implementation.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1) Fast track the implementation of project activities to ensure maximum utilization of grant funds and achieve the milestones set under the project
                         2) Ensure compliance to the SPHERE grant covenant to avoid any potential delays in the payment of progress claims
