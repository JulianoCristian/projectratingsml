                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In terms of the performance vis-a-vis the higher order outcome indicators of the BESRA which the project has adopted in line with its support to the reform agenda, there were
                         achievements recorded in terms of expanding access to elementary education, with participation rates consistently increasing over the life of the project, and breaching the 95% level
                         in 2012 and exceeding the 92.09% target. A large proportion of this significant increase in elementary enrolment are children from poor households. In terms of efficiency,
                         elementary cohort survival rates and completion rates have remained steady over the project life; while the 2012 rates fell short of the year’s target for both indicators, the fact that the
                         elementary school leavers rate has stayed the same implies that members of the cohort are still within the education system. Secondary participation rate exhibited a generally

                         increasing trend from the baseline year, recording a 6 percentage point increase over the life of the project to 64.61% in 2012; the six percentage point increase from the baseline is
                         significant given that high school enrolment grew from 6.4 million to 7.1 million between 2005 to 2012. Although it fell short of the 70.79% target for the same year, the system was
                         nevertheless able to accommodate around 760,000 more students at the secondary level in 2012 compared to the baseline year, given the expansion of supply-side inputs and
                         interventions (including the project interventions). The 2012 target to increase the proportion of children enrolled at the secondary level at the correct age (11 to 15 years old) was not

                         achieved; this is explained by the fact that, based on recent analyses of household survey results and DepEd administrative data, either many poor households cannot afford to send
                         their children to high schools or that most children from poor households enter school at a late age. The targets for secondary completion rate has been exceeded. The increase of
                         more than twelve percentage points from the baseline year is a substantial achievement especially with the growth of secondary school enrolment by 760,000 during the project
                         period. While secondary Cohort survival rate missed the target by 2 percentage point, there was a positive trend from the baseline, with more than 5 percentage point increase
                         between 2005 and 2012.The increase implies that the system has been able to sustain a level of quality even with the expansion of secondary enrolment by 760,000.

                         In terms of the quality indicators, there were some gains in student performance recorded at the elementary level (from 59% to 69%). The 10 percentage point increase in the
                         Elementary Mean Percentage Score from the baseline value is significant especially given the significant increase in children attending school, particularly those from poor
                         households where factors associated with dropout and repetition are more prevalent. For the High School Achievement Rate, however, DepEd decided to administer the National
                         Achievement Test to Yr 4 and not Yr 2 High School students from 2011, hence the figures could not be compared. The ICR will look into any possible trends within the years the
                         tests were administered (ie up to 2011 for Year 2 and post 2011 for Year 4 assessments) to assess this indicator’s performance.

                         On the other hand, majority of the project’s intermediate indicators, the various components and activities of which are important to support the implementation of the Basic Education
                         Sector Reform Agenda, and subsequently support the achievement of the PDO, have been completed. More importantly, many of the reform measures supported through TA and
                         financial resources under the project have been institutionalized and mainstreamed by the DepEd.

                         The project was extended for an additional six months (from May 31 to November 30, 2013) to complete the construction of classrooms and Learning Resource Management and
                         Development Centers (LRMDCs) and the procurement of associated furniture and ICT equipment. 65 percent of the outstanding associated furniture and equipment for the
                         classrooms have been procured, while another 35% expected to be procured and delivered by end November 2013. The main outstanding items for procurement are the ICT and
                         office equipment for the LRMDC at the DepEd Central office, the ICT software for the 26 LRMDCs in the regions and divisions and office furniture for 16 LRMDCs and these are
                         expected to be completed by project closing date.

                         There is a need for DepEd to intensively monitor the remaining construction works and furniture and equipment procurement to enable completion before project closing date and
                         maximize fund utilization.
