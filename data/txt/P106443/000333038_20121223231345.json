The project was originally approved on June 2,\n            2008 for a total grant amount of US$32 million from the\n            Australian Agency for International Aid (AusAID). In view of\n            implementation delays encountered by the project, the\n            changes include: (a) reallocation of grant proceeds across\n            expenditure categories; (b) extension of closing date from\n            December 31, 2012 to May 31, 2013; and (c) adjustment of the\n            results framework targets to reflect the extension period\n            and align these with the current targets in the Philippine\n            Development Plan 2011-2016. This will be the second\n            extension of the project. The first extension was for 18\n            months, from July 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012."}, "docdt": "2012-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
