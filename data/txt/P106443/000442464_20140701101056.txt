1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1. Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Context. Over the period 1961-2003, the Philippines had a high average
annual population growth rate of 2.6 percent (compared to 1.7 percent in the region).
Over the same period, the Philippines had had a correspondingly modest 1.4 percent
average annual per capita gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate. This compared to
an average increase of 5.4 percent in per capita GDP for other East Asian countries over
the same period. In 2004, the GDP of the Philippines was estimated at US$84.6 billion up
from 6.1 percent in 2003. The GDP per capita in 2004 was estimated at US$1,025. The
major economic sectors included agriculture and industry, especially for processing,
textiles, garments, electronics and automobile parts. The economy was dominated by the
service sector, representing 54 percent of GDP and over 37 percent of workers were self-
employed. The unemployment rate in April 2005 was 7.5 percent. Inflation was on the
rise and in 2005 it was 7 percent, up from 5.5 percent in 2004.

2.      There was a lack of social inclusion in the Philippines. Inequality was high and
when coupled with low growth over the longer term, it translated into slow progress on
poverty reduction. The richest five percent of households accounted for nearly one third
of national income, while the poorest 20 percent accounted for only six percent. The
poverty incidence, based on household consumption, had declined marginally from 27.6
percent in 2000 to 26.1 percent in 2003, after an increase of two percentage points
between 1997 and 2000. Poverty severity remained about the same between 2000 and
2003 which meant that the living standards of those who remained poor had not
improved.

3.      Sector Context. In 2005, the total Department of Education (DepEd) budget
represented approximately two percent of GDP and 18.5 percent of the total Government
of the Philippines (GOP) budget net of debt service. Spending on teachers’ salaries and
other personnel services made up 89 percent of the DepEd budget. An additional four
percent was spent on educational infrastructure, which left seven percent of the DepEd
budget to cover other recurrent costs such as operating expenses, teacher in-service
training and the purchase of instructional aids. DepEd, with support from the World Bank,
had prepared a spending plan that showed a worsening fiscal pressure over time, which
would limit the country’s ability to achieve its 2015 Education for All (EFA) targets. The
three factors influencing the fiscal pressures were: (i) the high fixed costs of salaries and
personnel benefits; (ii) rapid growth of the school aged population, requiring the system
to expand rapidly at the expense of quality improvements;; and (iii) the need to increase
the number of public high schools to accommodate private high school students
following the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

4.     Education outcomes in the Philippines were low compared to the rest of the East
Asia region. The 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Studies (TIMSS)
showed that the Philippines ranked 34th out of 38 countries in Grade 8 mathematics and



                                             1
43rd out of 46 countries in Grade 8 science. For Grade 4, the Philippines ranked 23rd out
of 25 participating countries in both mathematics and science. In addition, there was poor
internal efficiency in the system. Participation rates in 2003 at the elementary level were
higher than high school level, 94.02 percent and 63.88 percent respectively. However, the
dropout rates were 7.34 percent for elementary and 13.1 percent for high school, which
meant that approximately 50 percent of students beginning elementary school graduated
from high school. The high population growth rates and the tight fiscal situation
contributed to these outcomes. There were also several teacher related concerns: (i)
teacher qualifications, particularly at the high school level, were low in mathematics and
science; (ii) no performance-related pay structure which made it difficult to reward top
teachers; (iii) quality pre-service teacher training was poor, and (iv) teacher deployment
to hard- to-reach areas was difficult due to provisions in the 1967 Magna Carta for Public
School Teachers, allowing teachers to refuse transfer.

5.     To combat these problems, the GOP developed a poverty reduction strategy that
was defined in the Government’s Medium-Term Philippines Development Plan
(MTPDP) 2004-2020, which gave high priority to achieving universal basic education.
The country’s education strategy was guided by the National Education for All (EFA)
2015 Plan and was intended to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). While remaining committed to the overall development
and poverty reduction strategies, the Government also acknowledged the particular
challenges for basic education. Important initiatives on rationalization were introduced by
DepEd following the passage of the Governance of Basic Education Act (Republic Act
RA 9155) in 2001 with its emphasis on decentralization and its declaration that schools
should be the heart of the formal education system. By 2005, consensus emerged on the
need for urgent sector-wide strategies, placing schools first and empowering local
communities to achieve school improvement. The strategies were articulated in a policy
called the Schools First Initiative (SFI) and translated into policy actions under the
Government’s Basic Education Sector Reform Agenda (BESRA). 1

6.       The overall objectives of BESRA encompassed universal access to basic
education schooling and success for children in that age group, with community support
enabling effective school-based management, and the provision of universal functional
literacy for adults using alternative learning schemes. The policy actions of BESRA were
collected under five key reform thrusts (KRTs): (i) continuous school improvement
facilitated by active involvement of local stakeholders; (ii) better learning outcomes
achieved by improved teacher standards; (iii) desired learning outcomes enhanced by
national curriculum strategies, multi-sector coordination, and quality assurance; (iv)
improved impact on outcomes resulting from complementary early childhood education,
alternative learning systems and private sector participation; and (v) a change in DepEd
culture from prescribing actions through orders and memoranda to facilitating school-
based initiatives and assuring quality.

7.      Project Context. Building on the lessons of the past and aligned to the
Government’s MTPDP, the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2006-2008 sought to
achieve economic growth and promote social cohesion. While improving education in
general would contribute to this overall objective, support for BESRA had a strategic
focus since it tackled two key challenges: fiscal reform in the short-term and making
public institutions more effective in the long-run. The strategy was designed to support
the Government’s overall, coherent reform agenda and in particular to align Bank and
other donor assistance to those strategic priorities in the existing national budget that
address reforms to achieve fiscal stability and improved governance. In addition, the
BESRA provided the government with the first opportunity to coordinate donor
assistance in an effort to meet reform goals. The government worked with international
partners to ensure that donor assistance did not overlap and that all aspects of the reform
agenda could be covered based on government needs.

8.       To support the BESRA the Bank provided funding for the National Program
Support for Basic Education (NPSBE) 2 which was the first Bank operation in the
Philippines that adopted a “National Program Support” approach. This approach required
a shift from financing discrete projects towards support for coherent programs. The Bank
assistance through the NPSBE facilitated implementation of reforms furthering
decentralization and rationalization of the system of basic education in ways that
improved equity, quality, governance and financing of basic education services. With its
program approach, the NPSBE provided the impetus to launch system-wide reforms. It
also sharpened the Government’s policy framework for coordination of donor assistance
and provided a roadmap for subsequent additional financing from the donor community
for implementation of the reform agenda. In order to support the BESRA, AusAID
provided trust fund money to be administered by the Bank for the Support to Philippine
Basic Education Reforms (SPHERE) 3 project, which mainly financed the needed
technical assistance (TA) for critical areas of BESRA that were not supported under the
NPSBE. SPHERE ran in parallel to the NPSBE and was instrumental in supporting
necessary studies to assess governance issues as well as provide technical and knowledge
support in critical areas of the reform agenda supported by the project. A SPHERE Bank-
executed grant for supervision and analytical work was also mobilized to provide
technical support to the government in various areas of the reform agenda (e.g., School


2
  The NPSBE project closed December 31, 2012 and a separate Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
was submitted June 30, 2013 for this project. Project financing represented approximately 1 percent of the
yearly DepEd budget and 5 percent of the line item support for one year. While the project resources were a
small portion of the overall government budget, it was viewed as important for leveraging additional
resources for the government’s education policy reforms.
3
  This ICR will report on the recipient executed trust fund. However, there were also two Bank-executed
grants, one for incremental supervision costs and another provided demand driven analytical work, which
includes: (i) Education Sector Contracting (ESC) program review; (ii) mobilization of technical assistance
in various areas of the reform such as SBM, organizational development, Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) in education, financial management, teacher development, etc; (iii) complementary
resources for the development of the medium-term expenditure framework; (iv) development of the Special
Education Fund budget manual; and (v) policy review of all DepEd policy issuances from 1970 to date with
the end view of improving policy formulation, identifying policy gaps and eliminating policy overlaps.


                                                    3
Based Management - SBM, Quality Assurance, Organizational Development, Teacher
Development, Public Financial Management, and Governance). These funds also
provided analytical underpinning to enhance the effectiveness of allocation and
utilization of government resources mobilized to support the BESRA (e.g., review of the
Education Service Contracting Program, updating of the medium-term expenditure
framework for basic education).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9.      The project development objective was to support the implementation of the
BESRA which in turn aimed to contribute to the achievement of the Philippines' basic
education goal of improving quality and equity in learning outcomes. The key indicators
selected to measure progress toward the PDO were: Elementary Participation: (i)
participation rate, 6-11 years; (ii) cohort survival; (iii) completion rate; and (iv) dropout
rate. High School Participation: (i) participation rate 12-15 years; (ii) cohort survival;
(iii) completion rate; and (iv) dropout rate. Quality and efficiency: (i) Grade 6
Achievement in mathematics, Filipino, English, science, and Hekasi (social studies); and
(ii) Year 2 mean percentage score on the national achievement test.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

10.     The PDO was not revised during project implementation, and the key
development indicators remained the same throughout the life of the project. However, in
2011, GOP through NEDA and the DepEd adjusted the targets for the education outcome
indicators in the Philippine Development Plan, which were the same indicators used for
the BESRA and the SPHERE PDO. These adjustments were made based on the 2010
census data, which showed a decline in population growth and the recognition that the
targets were too ambitious. The government only officially validated the new end targets
in December 2012. The Bank team restructured the results framework and revised the
targets. The adjusted targets will be used to assess system improvement and measure
project achievement. In 2012 the GOP Interagency Committee on Education Statistics
made the decision to no longer track dropout rates. This decision was after the 2012
restructuring of indicator targets therefore, the ICR reports on dropout rates for SY 2011-
12.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The targeted beneficiaries in the project consisted of: (i) the schools and their
communities, encompassing individual parents, the Parent-Teacher-Community
Association (PTCA), local government, the private sector, and non-government
organizations (NGOs); (ii) basic education teachers, principals, Division and Regional
staff and officials; and (iii) basic education learners.

1.5 Original Components

12.      Component 1: Translation of system-level policies into actions (AUD21.15
million). This component supported: (i) funding for short to medium term technical
assistance (TA) to translate policy ideas on reform into action plans and to build capacity
of key DepEd managers to implement and manage change in line with DepEd reforms;
(ii) training programs for capacity building in regional offices by supporting them to
undertake their quality assurance functions of monitoring progress in divisions and
schools, delivering support as required, and enhancing feedback on their performance;
(iii) funding for the construction and/or refurbishment of learning and resource and
development centers (LRMDCs) which also included ICT support, managed by regions
as part of their quality assurance work to enhance monitoring and to improve teaching,
learning and assessment, as with satellite hubs constructed at the division level; and (iv)
funding for the provision of teaching and learning materials (except textbooks) many of
which had already been developed by other donor supported projects and in-service
training programs.

13.     Component 2: Support for school-based management (SBM) through grants
for school improvement plan targeting disadvantaged elementary schools (AUD4.48
million). This component supported the provision of SBM grants which were to be used
to accelerate SBM in the most difficult situations. The grants were to be provided over a
five year period to eligible schools with year 3 funding allocated on the basis of
demonstrated performance.

14.     Component 3: Classroom construction in high need locations in Southern
Philippines (AUD13.82 million) with extensive community partnership. These
construction activities were thought to serve as a forerunner to inform policy reform on
cost sharing between the national government and other partners (such as the private
sector and local government units) and improved resource mobilization.

1.6 Revised Components

15.    The components were not revised during the implementation period.

1.7 Other significant changes

16.    On September 18, 2008, Section 2.03(c) for the grant agreement was amended as
follows: “By November 30, 2008, the Recipient, through the Department of Education,
will acquire through the Australia Philippines Partnership for Economic Governance
Reforms the services of a qualified independent auditing firm under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank.”

17.    On June 30, 2011, the Bank, at the request of the government, granted an 18-
month extension of the original project closing date from June 30, 2011 to December 31,
2012 in order to complete project activities which had been delayed due to capacity
constraints within DepEd, regions and divisions. At the time of this restructuring, there



                                            5
was also a reallocation of project funds which decreased the amount of money to be used
for the LRMDCs 4 and to: (i) increase funds to build more classrooms in areas with acute
shortage; (ii) procure more technical assistance on critical areas of the reform program;
(iii) conduct trainings and/or capacity building activities at the regional, division and
school level personnel; (iv) provide more school based management grants; and (v)
provide more incremental operating cost for implementation of the project.

18.     On December 20, 2012, the Bank, at the request of the government, granted a
second extension of the project closing date from December 31, 2012 to May 31, 2013 in
order to allow for the full implementation of project activities. There had been a delay in
project implementation due to the late release of the spending authority (Special
Allotment Release Order) by the Department of Budget and Management which in turn
affected the procurement of additional classrooms, works and goods. At the time of this
restructuring there was also a reallocation of funds from the printing and distribution of
the K-12 learning materials due to non-availability of appropriate materials to classroom
construction in areas with acute shortage. Furthermore, PDO indicator targets were
revised downward to align these with the adjustment in the associated BESRA targets
(which was a reflection of the 2010 census data which showed a declining population).

19.     On May 30, 2013, the Bank, at the request of the government, granted a third and
final extension of the project closing date from May 31, 2013 to November 30, 2013 in
order to complete construction of the remaining classrooms and LRMDCs and the
procurement of school furniture and ICT equipment.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.     Project Preparation. In 2005, the Government of the Philippines and the Bank
decided to support the BESRA with the NPSBE project which aimed to bring sector
expenditures, policies and performance in line with the BESRA. This decision was based
on an agreement with the government on the 2005-2010 sector investment program that
was predicated on the medium-term expenditure framework and sector policy reforms
necessary for the program to succeed. In addition, it was based on the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) 2006-2008 that called for a graduated response to policy reforms that
enabled public institutions to be more effective. The Bank preparation and appraisal of
the NPSBE took place in March 2006 and became effective in January 2007. The
SPHERE project preparation was based largely on work done by the NPSBE team, which
consisted of technical experts that were appropriate for the development of the project. In



4
  DepEd was responding to the President’s policy pronouncement and commitment in his State of the
Nation address to plug the classroom shortage within the first few years of the new administration and the
realization that there were existing structures, e.g. Regional Education Training Centers that could also
serve as LRMDCs/learning resource hubs.



                                                    6
addition, the preparation team conducted a thorough financial management and
procurement assessment of DepEd to determine if the financial management and
procurement capacity and systems were in place for implementation of the SPHERE. It
was determined that the project risks for financial management were substantial while
procurement risk was average. In each case mitigation measures were identified. The
Bank preparation team also worked with AusAID to ensure that the SPHERE project
activities were in-line with the priorities of AusAID which at the time had a strong focus
on teacher up-grading, SBM and school access at the primary level. In support of NPSBE
and SPHERE, the DepEd held meetings and workshops with donors, other government
agencies and civil society to build consensus around the BESRA. DepEd also created
technical working groups (TWGs) to focus on the implementation of the BESRA which
was supported by the SPHERE and NPSBE projects. The project preparation process was
thoughtful, collaborative, and technically sound and to the extent possible, based on
lessons learned from previous operations supported by both AusAID and the Bank.

21.     Project Design. The SPHERE project design fit squarely into the government’s
BESRA (2006-2010), MTPDP and the Bank’s 2006-2008 CAS. They shared the common
objectives of fostering economic growth and social inclusion through improved
governance, together with fiscal reform. Again, since the SPHERE project supported the
BESRA which was also the same reform program supported by the NPSBE project, it
benefitted from the fact that the NPSBE project underwent a thorough quality at entry
(QER) process which took into consideration comments from the November 2005 project
preparation review (PPR) 5, which included the need to provide: (i) more details on the
level of government commitment; (ii) clearer terms on the budget items to be financed;
(iii) an enhanced economic and financial analysis; (iv) a more in-depth financial
management and procurement assessment; and (v) a review of the National Government
Accounting System (NGAS). The NPSBE preparation team also incorporated lessons
learned from past sector investment loans (SILs), such as: (i) for SBM to promote school
effectiveness, schools require adequate and appropriate resources; (ii) clear delineation of
roles and responsibilities within a decentralized environment is critical to the success of a
reform strategy; and (iii) participation of local stakeholders in school improvement
planning and implementation is critical to achieve desired learning outcomes and to
mobilize needed resources. These lessons were also relevant to the SPHERE project.

22.     The project was designed with a three year implementation period that was to be
implemented in parallel with the NPSBE project with the same project closing dates. The
design included the appropriate activities to assist the government in reaching their
reform agenda goals of: (i) continuous school improvement facilitated by active
involvement of local stakeholders; (ii) better learning outcomes achieved by improved
teacher standards; and (iii) desired learning outcomes enhanced by national curriculum
strategies, multi-sector coordination, and quality assurance. The PDO which aimed to
contribute to the achievement of the Philippines basic education goal of improving
quality and equity in learning outcomes was appropriate since this was the objective of


5
 The PPR was the equivalent of a Quality at Entry Review as indicated in project preparation documentation.




                                                          7
the BESRA. As mentioned previously, the government requested that the Bank adopt a
National Program Support approach, which entailed a shift from financing discrete, ring-
fenced projects toward a program-based approach. Just like the NPSBE, the SPHERE
project focused on core mandates, functions, and service delivery improvements. The
request for adoption of BESRA outcome and most output indicators was justified by the
government as setting the stage for improved multi-partner collaboration and
achievement of BESRA goals. However, it also meant that direct attribution of
interventions may not be able to demonstrate direct impact on development results. The
importance of this design approach was that it supported the government’s reform efforts
through a comprehensive approach and was seen as having a higher chance of success
than a stand-alone operation. This outweighed the possibility of not being able to draw
causal links between inputs and development outcomes. Therefore, key indicators
included in the results framework were national in scope and derived from the BESRA
and, as stated above, were appropriate given the SPHERE’s direct link to the BESRA.
The project design also included intermediate indicators that measured implementation of
the project components. It should be noted that although there exist slight differences in
intermediate indicators listed in the grant agreement and the appraisal document, progress
was tracked for the full set of indicators and are being used for the purposes of the ICR
evaluation. Again, the PDO indicator targets were the BESRA targets, which were
adopted by the preparation team at the request of DepEd since the project design was
supportive of the BESRA. Section 2.3 provides more detailed information regarding the
decision to select national indicators.

23.     The NPSBE project supported the DepEd budget items of: (i) classroom
construction; (ii) SBM grants; (iii) textbooks; (iv) training, which included teacher and
capacity development training; (v) Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE)
support; (vi) school feeding; (vii) and hardship pay. The SPHERE project provided
additional support for the DepEd budget items of: (i) classroom construction in Southern
Philippines; (ii) SBM grants; and (iii) policy development to ensure that the BESRA
reforms related to decentralization, improved governance, and enhanced effectiveness of
government resources in basic education received adequate and sustained support. To
support the implementation of SPHERE and NPSBE, it was decided to mainstream
implementation within the DepEd units that were ultimately responsible for meeting the
objectives of the BESRA at the central, regional, division offices and schools as
mandated in the Governance of Basic Education Act (RA 9155). This structure was
appropriate to ensure continued ownership of the SPHERE and NPSBE projects and the
BESRA. The preparation team conducted an in-depth institutional capacity assessment at
all levels, giving the team confidence that DepEd had built the foundations required to
implement the BESRA reforms, including the subset of reforms contained in the
SPHERE project. Although the assessment indicated there was a foundation to implement
the project, in retrospect, a three year implementation period proved to be too short for
the SPHERE project design especially given the procurement activities included in the
design.




                                            8
2.2 Implementation

24.     Implementation began with workshop sessions for theme groups responsible for
implementing particular reforms, as well as for officers responsible for handling
procurement, financial management, disbursement and monitoring and evaluation. The
DepEd continued the TWGs with the mandate that they would be responsible for the
implementation of the reform agenda and the SPHERE and NPSBE activities. While
there were capacity concerns, the implementing units, through their daily work, were able
to ultimately implement most project activities. Where there was a need for support,
technical assistance was provided as well as capacity training.

25.      The SPHERE project was to be implemented over a three year period. During the
first 12 months of project implementation, disbursements were low due to limited
financial management capacity at the regional, division and school levels. By June 30,
2010 disbursements had increased from US$4.69 million to US$15.11 or approximately
40 percent of the total project which was due to the acceleration of implementation.
During this 24 month period the SPHERE project: (i) completed 98 percent of original
targets for classroom construction under the principal led school building program; (ii)
procured furniture for schools; (iii) provided SBM grants to 80 percent of schools
supported by SPHERE; (iv) trained 66 percent of SPHERE supported schools in the
simplified accounting procedures related to the SBM financial management system; (iv)
implemented school improvement plans (SIPs) related to SBM in SPHERE-supported
schools; and (iv) conducted a full assessment of SBM implementation related to
development of a SBM policy framework and standards, MOOE allocations, guidelines
for utilization of SBM grants, etc. In addition, progress was being achieved with regard to
the LRMDCs: (i) construction had begun on six LRMDCs; (ii) procurement and
distribution of National Competency-Based Teacher Standards - Teachers’ Strengths and
Needs Assessment (NCBTS-TSNA) and Individual Plan for Professional Development
(IPPD) primers and toolkits were underway; and (iii) resource materials were being
uploaded onto the LRMDCs. The February 2010 joint Bank/AusAID mid-term review
agreed that support for the BESRA, through SPHERE and NPSBE, continued to be the
most promising intervention to assist the government to: (i) achieve its educational goal
for all Filipinos to be functionally literate and meet its international commitments under
the MDGs for universal primary education; and (ii) meet the Education for All (EFA)
targets (see Annex 2 for more implementation highlights).

26.      Despite these achievements, project disbursements were lagging behind. The
project had one year remaining with 60 percent left to disburse and there were several
challenges impeding implementation progress. The February 2010 mid-term review and
March 2010 SPHERE independent progress review conducted by AusAID showed that:
(i) financial management capacity remained weak at all levels which led to problems with
submission of statements of expenditures (SOEs) as well as liquidation of funds; (ii) two
of the Special Allotment Release Orders (SARO 6) that needed to be obtained from the


6
    SARO is a document that allows the project to commit or enter into contracts



                                                      9
Department of Budget and Management were not released quickly enough which
prevented DepEd from making payments to contractors and delayed procurement of ICT
equipment for the LRMDCs; (iii) the hiring of an internal audit (IA) firm was delayed;
(iv) classroom constructions was slowed with the shift from the principal led school
building scheme (through shopping) to national competitive bidding (NCB) 7 ; and (v)
SPHERE and NPSBE indicator targets needed to be reassessed and revised in light of the
2010 census data which showed a decline in population growth over the period 2000-
2010. These implementation challenges led to the government requests for the three
closing date extensions from June 30, 2011 to November 30, 2013.

27.      During the two year extension period, the Bank and DepEd worked on
eliminating implementation bottlenecks, which led to: (i) hiring an internal audit firm
which did an assessment of FM, provided technical assistance to DepEd and performed
the project’s internal audit functions; (ii) notifying regions and divisions of the
appropriate construction methods and holding workshops on procurement procedures so
that classroom construction could be completed; (iii) increasing the DA threshold three
times to US$6 million to address administrative delays in the government transfer of
funds to the DA to ensure there was enough cash to accelerate implementation of project
activities and pay contractors and suppliers on time; (iv) modification of PDO indicator
targets to align them with the new BESRA targets; and (v) continuous support to DepEd
to ensure that the SAROs were issued on time. Ultimately, 99 percent of total planned
classrooms and toilets were completed 8 and accepted by the stakeholders; LRMDCs were
completed and ICT equipment installed; most of the procurement of furniture for
classrooms and LRMDCs was completed and delivered; and project funds have been
liquidated, resulting in a 93.42 percent disbursement rate (i.e., US$34.12 million
disbursed). These figures are based on information provided by DepEd (in collaboration
with the Bank’s disbursement department) on May 28, 2014 which are not yet reflected
in ClientConnection. Given the 2010 implementation constraints, however, this
disbursement rate is a considerable achievement.

28.     It should also be noted that BESRA, with support from SPHERE and NPSBE,
also introduced the National Competency Based Teacher Standards (NCBTS) and a
teacher self-assessment tool, which informed teacher hiring guidelines and in-service
training programs respectively. These standards were also incorporated into teacher
support materials, teacher professional development, and the national assessment. The
government also: (i) universalized kindergarten, making it officially part of the basic
education cycle, hiring and training kindergarten teachers 9 and the development of a


7
  DepEd discontinued use of the principal led school construction scheme for the SPHERE-financed
classrooms from mid-2011 based on recommendations from the independent procurement assessment
mobilized by AusAID.
8
  1,150 classrooms and 1,068 toilets were completed compared to a planned total of 1,160 classrooms and
1,124 toilets. However, the project did meet its initial target of 507 classrooms, which were completed
under batches 1 – 3.
9
  During FY 2011 and 2012, approximately 8,000 new Kindergarten teachers were hired, 42,880 trained as
part of the Kindergarten Volunteer program, 13,962 as part of the 2011 summer program and 633 as part of
the 40-week Kindergarten curriculum program. 471 teachers received scholarships to attend the summer,


                                                  10
kindergarten curriculum; (ii) revised the entire basic education curriculum content and
framework to accommodate the new Kindergarten to Grade 12 program (“K – 12”); (iii)
expanded Alternative Delivery Modes (ADM) programs; (iv) revised the grades 1–10
learning competencies; (v) developed an assessment framework; and (vi) piloted mother-
tongue based-multilingual education (MTB-MLE) in 20 national languages in 921
schools nationwide, and developed supporting materials for teaching and learning in the
12 main languages. 10 (See Annex 2 for more highlights of implementation)

29.     There were ten joint Bank and AusAID review and implementation support
missions from September 2007 through November 2013. In addition, the in-country Bank
team had regular monthly meetings with DepEd and during the last extension period,
there were weekly meetings with the government to ensure completion of the project
targets. The make-up of the Bank’s teams was well balanced with financial management,
procurement, and monitoring and evaluation specialists present on missions, as well as
other technical specialists 11 whenever necessary. As mentioned above, out of the original
AUD 39,451,025 (US$37,687,621 equivalent) 93.42 percent was disbursed by May 28,
2014.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

30.     Design. As stated previously, the results framework was appropriate for the
project design and reflected the goals of the BESRA. The indicators were linked to the
PDO and were adequate to measure achievement of the PDO. Moreover, DepEd agreed
that the Bank would take the leadership role among development partners to support the
reform agenda by adopting the BESRA outcome indicators as part of the project design.
The premise of the agreement was that by supporting a sector program, accountabilities
for development results between DepEd and its development partners would be shared
and a multi-partner collaboration (under the umbrella of government's leadership) would
be fostered. It was acknowledged that it would be difficult to show direct attribution for
specific project inputs using national level indicators. However, the benefits of
supporting the government’s BESRA goals and adopting its indicators outweighed the
possible difficulties of clearly linking interventions to outcomes. The Bank team was
willing to demonstrate that everyone could work together to achieve desired results,
which in this case, were reflected in the government's basic education indicators and
targets. Subsequently, after the NPSBE became effective, AusAID also agreed to adopt
the same government targets and indicators through the SPHERE project. This same
approach has since been adopted by UNICEF and other local and international


Institute-Based training for kindergarten teachers, and there was a 20-day training program offered by state
universities and colleges for the equivalent of a 9-unit Master’s degree course in Early Childhood and
Development. Although not financed by SPHERE or NPSBE, the projects served as a catalyst for
mobilizing additional support to develop and roll out these reforms and activities.
10
   The 12 languages include Tagalog, Ilokano, Pangasinense, Kapampangan, Bikol, Cebuano, Hiligaynon,
Waray, Maranao, Maguindanao, Yakan and Chavacano.
11
   The missions included SBM specialists, teacher development experts, quality assurance practitioners,
and data management experts when appropriate for review of project activities.

development partners. The positive outcome generated by the multi-partner collaboration
to support one set of targets and indicators through various interventions is reflected by
the increasing trend in performance of the higher order education outcome indicators over
the life of the project.

31.     The targets for the PDO indicators were projections based on the 2000 census.
The intermediate indicators were linked to the components and were appropriate to
measure intermediate level achievements. The design also included collection of data
using the web-based Enhanced Basic Education Information System (e-BEIS) to enable
performance reporting in real-time as well as to inform planning, resource allocation, and
performance reporting; and the Quality Assurance and Accountability Framework
(QAAF) to lay the foundation for redefining school input standards, including textbooks,
school infrastructure, teacher training materials, etc.

32.     Implementation and Utilization of Monitoring and Evaluation. The roll out of
the e-BEIS nationwide has allowed central offices to upload school data they received
onto the government’s website, allowing schools to access the information directly or for
divisions to download and share information with their respective schools. This has had
the intended impact of being able to provide real-time information at all levels of the
education system. In 2010, the government adopted the QAAF, along with the roll-out of
the Philippines Accreditation System for Basic Education (PASBE). PASBE is a unified
schools standards assessment tool that is applicable to both elementary and high schools,
and facilitates measuring their level of compliance with service standards. The QAAF
and PASBE laid the foundation for re-defining school input standards, and all schools are
now using these standards. DepEd, with support from AusAID, developed a learner
information system (LIS) that includes a learner reference number for each student
irrespective of whether enrolled in the formal or non-formal education system. This
system currently holds information on approximately 20 million learners and is providing
DepEd with valuable information on each learner, allowing for informed planning and
budgeting decision making. Under the BESRA as a whole, the M&E system includes: (i)
a learning resources materials development system that is being used to upload learning
materials; (ii) an asset management system, which is operational at the central level and
will be expanded down to the regional and division levels; (iii) a Training and
Development Information System (TDIS) being piloted in Regions 6, 7 and 8 and which
includes an inventory of training, research and development activities conducted at the
regional levels; (iv) the ongoing development of a project monitoring system being
developed under the Philippines’ Response to Indigenous Peoples’ and Muslim
Education (PRIME) program, which created a system of providing demand-driven grants
to respond to indigenous people (IP) education needs; and (v) the ongoing development
of a human resources information system, which has been put on hold pending the
government’s plan to roll out a government human resources information system (GMIS).

33.    The DepEd provided Bank missions with data and information that allowed the
teams to make judgments on progress toward achieving the PDO and the project’s
implementation progress. This information was regularly reported on by the Bank in
aides-memoire and ISRs. As mentioned, the targets for the PDO level indicators were



                                           12
adjusted in 2012 and are being used to measure project achievement. The intermediate
indicators were also monitored and reported on over the life of the project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

34.     Safeguards. The environmental rating of the project was “C” based on the fact
that no environmental risks were foreseen and construction would comply with national
environmental laws for environmental impacts. Therefore, OP 4.01 Environmental
Assessment was not triggered and no environmental assessment tools were developed as
part of the project. The project did, however, conduct a review of the environmental
safeguards at the time of project closing, which concluded that there was compliance with
local regulations. There were minor issues pertaining to two school building locations
that required DepEd to undertake remedial actions to safeguard the structures 12 from
harming those using the schools. DepEd is in the process of addressing these issues.

35.     The project did trigger OP 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples (IP) because the reform
agenda was to address both quality and equity especially for the poor and disadvantaged
groups, including indigenous peoples. The project was satisfactorily carried out in
accordance with the Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework – IPPF and the
government’s Philippines Indigenous People’s Rights Act – IPRA. Although
encountering initial delays, the government approved and disseminated the National
Indigenous Peoples Education Policy Framework in August 2011. The framework is to
ensure that IP’s basic education concerns and needs are taken into consideration as part of
BESRA implementation. DepEd supported several activities related to the promotion of
indigenous peoples education, which were: (i) piloting MTB-MLE in 20 languages; (ii)
disseminating the National Indigenous People’s Education Policy Framework; (iii)
issuing guidelines on the use of PRIME grants, which created a system of providing
demand-driven funding to respond to IP education needs; (iv) creating an indigenous
peoples education office (IPsEO); and (v) with AusAID support, conducting a baseline
survey on the educational situation in IP and Muslim households in PRIME priority
divisions and regions. The other IP activities included: (i) review of standards for the
recognition and accreditation of private schools for IPs; (ii) development of a national
curriculum framework on IP education for kindergarten, elementary and high school
levels; (iii) guidelines and standards for the development of indigenous learning
materials; and (iv) an IP education training plan for teacher and education managers.
School visits have shown that interventions through the school SIPs to support IP
students are designed but are often separate rather than an integral part of the plans. The
next steps are to fully integrate them into the SIPs. Safeguards compliance is therefore
rated satisfactory.



12
   Remedial actions proposed included: (i) appropriate reinforcement of the structure to prevent ground
settlement from water intrusion into the foundation, a risk associated with construction in sloping areas;
and (ii) slope-protection (i.e. retaining wall) for the Department of Public Works and Housing (DPWH)-led
(i.e., not SPHERE supported) building to prevent run off of silt/soil into the building in the event of heavy
rains.


                                                    13
36.      Financial management. As discussed previously, the project was designed to use
the government accounting system. In October 2001, the Commission on Audit (COA)
introduced the new government accounting system (NGAS) that followed international
public sector accounting procedures. The bookkeeping segment of NGAS was
computerized and was referred to as eNGAS. This was viewed to be a milestone in terms
of the government’s accounting procedures and processes. While the system was viewed
as a significant step forward, its implementation proved to be problematic for project
activities and financial management (FM) performance. The FM challenges were: (i)
establishment of an Internal Audit Service (IAS), which only became fully operational in
early 2011; (ii) DepEd central, regional and division offices had to be adequately staffed
and trained to carry out the high volume of FM transactions, which took time; and (iii)
the eventual roll-out of the eNGAS after it was suspended in December 2008 in an effort
to harmonize the general accounting standards of The Philippines with the international
public sector accounting standards. This led DepEd to consider developing its own web-
based financial management information system (FMIS), which is being finalized with
AusAID support. Since all the computerized systems were either put on hold or are still
being finalized, the project FM activities were carried out manually.

37.     Manual accounting for the central office staff was a challenge because they were
understaffed for such a large task. Given the large volume of financial transactions, weak
capacity and inadequate staff, the central office was unable to cope with the work load.
This led to: (i) delays in meeting grant covenants (i.e., timely submission of financial
reports, SBM validation reports or supporting documentation for auditing purposes); (ii)
timely liquidation of cash advances; (iii) unreconciled “Property, Plant and Equipment”
accounts; and (iv) subsidy account discrepancies amounting to PhP 6.7 million in
CY2012. In addition, COA re-instituted a selective pre-audit of cash advances and school
construction expenditures in 2009, which added to the transaction processing delays.
Although the IAS has been established and is functioning, its staffing level is limited to
17 staff per Department of Budget and Management (DBM) circular 2008-5, even though
that staffing number may not be sufficient to effectively handle the workload.

38.     Despite these difficulties and a slow start, DepEd was able to: (i) significantly
increase disbursement levels from 65 percent in September 2012 to 93.42 percent by May
2014, (ii) encode at least 90 percent of the 2004 – 2010 financial transactions in eNGAS
once COA lifted its suspension in 2011 (remaining 10 percent relate to transactions at the
Bureaus); (iii) partially mitigate the staffing issue by using FM staff from the division
offices to assist with FM responsibilities; (iv) by 2013, significantly improve its
compliance with time-bound financial statement submissions, 13 submitting all
outstanding audit reports and school grant validation reports; and (v) reduce the
outstanding cash advances from PhP 2.2 million in June 2013 to Php 57,445 in December
2013, mainly due to a strong stance taken by DepEd withholding salaries of central and
division officers with outstanding cash advances. As of May 28, 2014, the outstanding
cash advances amounted to PhP 21,283, which represents unliquidated cash advances of
resigned and deceased employees. These unliquidated advances are already included in


13
     Starting with the 2011 Q2 submission, all subsequent IFRs were received by the Bank on time.


                                                     14
the unutilized balance in the designated account being refunded to the Bank. DepEd is
also working on the reconciliation of their “Property, Plant and Equipment” accounts,
with initial reports having been submitted to COA on December 9, 2013. Efforts on
DepEd’s part to address COA’s comments on the 2007 Agency financial statements led
the COA to modify its opinion from “adverse” to “qualified” in 2010. Furthermore,
DepEd was able to either fully or partially implement all outstanding 2007 COA
recommendations by project closing. Unfortunately, the COA recommendation on FM
staffing, which might have helped avoid some of the issues encountered by DepEd, could
not be fully implemented. However, DepEd was proactive in rectifying a mistake it
discovered when reviewing sub-ARO releases in three divisions, where the same project
recipients received their allocation twice. This was efficiently resolved in close
collaboration with the FMS-Budget Division.

39.      The project also faced challenges due to delays in SARO releases, in that the
FY11 SARO was only released in October 2011, eight months after the original target
date. Given that SARO allowed the project to commit or enter into contracts, the delay in
its release meant that DepEd could not start contracting until the SARO had been released.
While this is beyond the control of the project, it nevertheless hampered timely
implementation, especially of classroom construction. Bank management and the task
team held several meetings with the concerned government oversight agencies 14 to
remove bottlenecks as SARO release delays were a portfolio-wide issue. Since DepEd
could not enter into contracts without the release of the SARO, cash flow was limited and
replenishment of the DA delayed. An additional complication was that there was a DBM
circular, stating that the amount that can be committed for disbursement and the
maximum SARO amount that can be released was only up to the amount allocated for the
Designated Account (DA). While the disbursements under the project in the early years
were usually below the US$1 million DA ceiling, the bunching of activities as a result of
the delay in the release of the previous SAROs necessitated larger SARO amounts. To
overcome these constraints, the Bank team worked with DepEd to increase the DA
ceiling three times from the original US$1 million to US$6 million by project closing15.
Lastly, it should be noted that the grant was the first AusAID-financed project to use
country systems, and was therefore a new approach for AusAID compared to their
previous project funding experience. This learning experience resulted in the need to
occasionally discuss and reconfirm with government and donor partners their respective
functions in relation to this new implementation approach. However, this need for
clarification also contributed to some of the previously-mentioned delays. Nevertheless,
the project disbursed 93.42 percent with only 6.58 percent undisbursed mainly due to a
combination of non-construction of classrooms and toilets, 16 and non-procurement of
LRMDC-specific software for the DepEd central office and some school furniture.



14
   i.e., Department of Finance, Department of Budget and Management, the treasury etc.
15
   The DA ceiling increases were processed on June 16, 2009, January 29, 2010 and December 9, 2011.
The DA was drawn down starting in 2011 due to the June 30, 2011 closing date but was replenished and its
ceiling increased on December 9, 2011 after that original closing date was extended.
16
   These include classrooms destroyed by the 2012 earthquake in Region VII. Other regions where
classrooms were not completed in time are Regions, VI, VIII, IX, XI and CARAGA.


                                                  15
40.      Procurement. Procurement performance also improved during the last six
months of project implementation. As mentioned in Annex 2, the project was able to
successfully procure supplementary teaching and learning materials, as well as primers
and tool kits to support divisions in the roll out of the NCBTS. The project also helped
organize and conduct workshops and trainings on various topics, including the new K-12
curriculum, mother-tongue based instruction, and the use of the learning management
resource system, benefitting almost 24,000 DepEd staff at the central, division and school
levels. This is an impressive coordinated effort. The project also successfully constructed
32 LRMDCs, of which one was destroyed as a result of the 2013 typhoon “Yolanda”, and
procured the associated furniture and Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
equipment. In addition, the project constructed 1,150 new classrooms, and built 1,068
toilets. Although missing the final planned numbers of classrooms and toilets by 10 and
56 respectively, the project did meet its initial target of building 507 classrooms under
batches 1-3. However, these successes were not without their challenges: (i) LRMDC
construction was delayed due to staffing constraints within the DepEd units in charge of
monitoring civil works, and delays in approving the “Program of Works” necessary for
contract award; (ii) changes to the classroom construction approach, 17 which also
required the re-orientation of divisions in January 2013 on the use of harmonized 18
procurement guidelines; (iii) delays in procuring ICT equipment/software and office
furniture for the LRMDCs due to lengthy equipment specification discussions and slow
follow up by division offices after initial bids failed to attract sufficient responsive
bidders; and (iii) delays in SARO release. These delays resulted in a cumulative
extension period of one year.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41.     A new lending operation and a series of analytical works are currently under way.
The Learning, Equity, and Accountability Program Support (LEAPS) project provides a
US$300 million loan to continue supporting the gains made under BESRA, SPHERE and
NPSBE. LEAPS aims to: (i) improve teaching and learning in early grade reading and
math through teacher capacity building, and develop and use mother-tongue based
reading and math assessment tools; (ii) strengthen accountability, which is a major part of
the SBM approach, especially at the school level while also strengthening DepEd’s
financial management capacity; and (iii) improve program designs targeting
disadvantaged groups by expanding the knowledge base on selected programs targeting
disadvantaged groups, such as the Alternative Learning System (ALS), and improve
program design and implementation capabilities. Furthermore, LEAPS will be disbursed
based on the achievement of disbursement-linked indicators, and incurring of eligible


17
   This change in approach also led to confusion at the decentralized levels regarding the procurement
documents to be used and steps to be followed, so that a number of classrooms having been completed
were found to have used non-Bank approved documents. The Bank therefore conducted a retroactive
assessment and determined that the overall principles of fair and open competition were followed and
agreed to cover the cost of these classrooms.
18
   “Harmonized procurement” refers to use of country systems and local bidding documents that have been
reviewed and approved by the Bank for the procurement of goods and works with project funds.


                                                  16
expenditures using the Reimbursement disbursement method, documented by th Interim
Financial Reports (the report-based documentation method), which will reduce the
number of required financial transactions and documentation, helping with project
implementation.

42.      A proposed series of analytical works will support the CAS objective of
improving access to quality education services. The analysis will be centered around the
following strategic pillars: (i) Efficiency and Equity of Education Finance and School
Funding, analyzing DepEd’s education finance policies for more equitable and better
quality of service delivery; (ii) Quality of Service Delivery Analysis, which aims to take
a comprehensive look at the determinants of effective education service delivery; (iii)
School to Work Transition: Skills Demand and Supply in order to shed light on skills
gaps/mismatches as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the basic education system;
and (iv) Basic Education Reforms Dissemination and Communication. The results of
these pieces of analysis are expected to provide DepEd with valuable information and
facilitate their efforts to sustain and expand the BESRA goals.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

43.     Relevance of Objectives. The project development objectives were highly
relevant to the country’s sectoral needs when the project was developed. The objectives
fit squarely into the government’s BESRA, MTPDP and the Bank’s 2006-2008 CAS.
They shared the common objectives of fostering economic growth and promoting social
cohesion. Like the 2006-08 CAS, the new CAS (2010-2012) also focuses achieving more
inclusive growth by supporting The Philippines increase access to better public services
for the poor. This is to be achieved by deepening the reform agendas in key public
services sectors and expanding basic service delivery directly to the poor. Therefore, the
project and BESRA continued to fit into the 2010-2012 CAS objectives. There is a new
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) currently under preparation that is expected to
continue the focus on supporting the Philippines reform agendas in key public services
sectors. In addition, it is expected that the government will continue its education reform
agenda through the BESRA.

44.      Relevance of Design. The relevance of the project design is high. The project
was appropriately aligned with the BESRA PDO and PDO indicators, and it included
appropriate activities to assist the government in reaching their reform agenda goals. The
mainstreaming of project implementation was also appropriate to foster improved
capacity within the system and decentralization of education services. The project risks
were correctly identified and mitigation measures were appropriate given the government
systems in place at the time of design. While the PDO level indicators were appropriate,
the three year implementation period was too short to implement large civil works
activities as well as to hire the necessary technical assistance to support new policy
reforms of the BESRA within DepEd. To fully realize the completion of project




                                            17
activities, it required three project closing date extensions, which was appropriate given
the overall nature of the reform elements of the project and the extensive civil works.

45.      Relevance of Implementation. The relevance of project implementation is
judged to be modest. As indicated above, implementation of the majority of project
activities was successful: (i) SBM has been institutionalized, system-wide monitoring
systems are in place and will continue to be expanded; (ii) NCBTS and MOOE
allocations have been institutionalized; (iii) classrooms and LRMDCs were constructed;
and (iv) a substantial number of experts were hired to provide technical assistance for the
implementation of DepEd policy reforms. The modest rating is mainly based on the
persistent FM and procurement implementation issues that slowed implementation. While
the project was able to disburse 93.42 percent of funds, and complete the majority of the
project activities, the LMRDCs are just now providing the support to teachers as
envisioned by the project, and some of the equipment is still in the process of being
installed with government resources. In addition, DepEd still has to produce required FM
documentation and reports manually.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

46.     The overall achievement of the project development objectives is moderately
satisfactory. The project contributed to a number of positive outcomes for the
Philippines education system. As indicated, the targets were revised downward during the
December 2012 restructuring. Therefore, this section evaluates the outcomes against the
results based on the new targets. The project development objective was to support the
implementation of the BESRA, which in turn aimed to contribute to the achievement of
the Philippines' basic education goal of improving quality and equity in learning
outcomes. The PDO level indicators selected to monitor achievement of the PDO were as
follows:

47.     Elementary participation. The participation rate for 6-11 year olds increased
from the baseline of 84.44 percent in 2004/05 to 95.24 in 2012/13 percent exceeding the
revised target of 92.09 percent. The overall enrollment numbers have also increased from
13 million to 14.4 million from 2003/04 to 2011/12. These are both substantial increases
for the system. Although the 2010 census reports a decline in population growth over the
period 2000-2010, the increase in enrollments seems to be attributed to the fact that more
children of elementary school age are going to school even though population growth has
declined. Enrollment increases have also been larger for the poorest households. For
example, between 2004 and 2011, attendance rates for 6 to 11 year old children increased
by 7.5 percentage points for the poorest 10 percent of households compared to a less than
1 percentage point increase for children in the wealthiest 30 percent of households (Reyes,
Tabuga, Mina and Asis, 2013). Increases in enrollment may be attributed to: (i)
improvements in the alternative delivery modes, which allow children (particularly boys)
to participate even though they have to work; and (ii) the conditional cash transfer (CCT)
program that provides resources directly to poor households to enable their children to
attend school and avail of health services. During project implementation, the CCT
program covered children ages 6-14. Cohort survival rate increased from 69.9 percent in
2005 to 75.27 percent in 2012/13, missing the revised target of 78.51 percent. Although


                                            18
the cohort survival rates did not meet the targets, the rates did improve, which implies
that the system has been able to sustain a level of quality even under such rapid
expansion. Completion rates increased from 67.99 percent in 2004/05 to 73.67 percent in
2012/13, missing the revised target of 76.61 percent. Again, although the completion
rates did not meet the targets, improvements over time implies that the system has been
able to sustain a level of quality even under rapid expansion. 19 This is a substantial
achievement. The dropout rate has declined from 8.9 percent in 2003/04 to 6.38 percent
in 2011/12. While this is an appropriate trend, the original target of 4.3 percent was
missed. It should also be noted that in 2013, DepEd decided that they would no longer
measure dropout. Instead, DepEd now measures school leavers and therefore, there is no
available data for dropout beyond the 2011/12 school year.

48.     High school participation. The participation rate for 12-15 year olds increased
from the baseline of 58.54 percent in 2004/05 to 64.61 percent in 2012/13, missing the
revised target of 70.79 percent. The overall enrollment numbers for high school have
increased from 6.3 million to 7 million between 2003/04 and 2011/12. While these
numbers do not mirror the increases in elementary enrollments, there have been some
improvements in equity in school attendance between poor and wealthy households. For
example, between 2007 and 2011, school attendance among 12-14 (15-18) year olds
increased by 5.5 (5.1) percentage points for the poorest 10 percent of households
compared to only 1.1 (0.6) percentage points for the wealthiest 10 percent of households
(Reyes, Tabuga, Mina and Asis, 2013). However, gaps between older children aged
between 15 and 18 widened slightly over the same period. The government continues to
develop policies to try and improve the enrollment numbers. Recently, the government
extended the CCT program coverage to children up to age 18. This policy change was
made in an effort to provide over-aged children entering the system with the means to
continue their education through high school as well as to respond to the additional years
of schooling in high school as a result of the implementation of the K-12 program. Cohort
survival rate increased from 67.32 percent in 2004/2005 to 78.21 percent in 2012/13,
slightly missing the revised target of 80.27 percent. Completion rate increased from 61.66
percent in 2004/05 to 74.81 percent in 2012/13 meeting the revised target of 74.51
percent. Drop-out decreased from 14.3 percent in 2003/04 to 7.82 percent in 2011/12.
Again, this trend is positive but as stated above, this indicator is no longer being collected
or monitored by DepEd.

49.    Quality and efficiency. The measure of quality at the elementary level was
measured based on the Grade 6 achievement test for mathematics, Filipino, English and
science, for both elementary and high school.




19
   The completion rate in The Philippines is measured by the percentage of first year entrants in a level of
education who complete the level in accordance with the required number of years. However, the
completion rate formula being used by the Bank and UNESCO, which measures the grade/year level of all
completers, shows that elementary completion rates have already reached 91 percent at the elementary level.
The achievement of this indicator is attributed to the improvements in the delivery system and the increase
in the demand-side interventions to improve participation of children from poor households.

 *The National Education Testing and Research Center test equated to allow valid comparisons across years.
 **The 2010/11 scores are being used for actuals due to the fact that for SY 2011/12 the high school test was
 administered to year 4 students. Since 2011/12, the national achievement test has assessed Year 4 high school students
 instead of Year 2 students. This is in preparation for the expansion of the basic education cycle from Grade 10
 (equivalent to HS Year 4) to Grade 12, In order to provide a meaningful time trend at the high school level, 2010/11
 scores for Year 2 students are compared with 2006/07 test scores.

50.     Test results at the elementary level have shown improvement in all subjects. In
the case of high school, test results have shown improvements in mathematics, Filipino,
and Hekasi (social science) with some declines in English and science. These
improvements are impressive considering the elementary and high school net enrollment
rates increased and approximately 2.3 million more children were attending school in
2012 than in 2005. In addition, a large proportion of these children are likely to have
come from poorer households, where support for education is more limited and factors
associated with dropout and repetition are more prevalent. This could explain why there
was some decline in English and science test scores. Additional evidence for improved
achievement come from the recent SBM impact evaluation, which confirms the
significant and positive impact of SBM on education performance (World Bank and
AusAID, 2013). The study measured the impact of SBM on learning outcomes by
looking at the differences in the roll-out of SBM and associated grants between 2006 and
2009. 20 The study found that, over three years, the introduction of SBM and the provision
of grants improved scores on the National Achievement Tests (NAT) by 4 to 5
percentage points (approximately 0.25 standard deviations). In that SPHERE provided
considerable support to the roll-out of SBM, this is a significant impact for the project
and the BESRA.

3.3 Efficiency

51.     The reform program introduced in 2006 was underpinned by significant increased
public education spending. Prior to the introduction of BESRA in 2006, public education
spending had been on a downward trend. In real terms, overall spending on education
declined from PHP 155 billion in 2003 to PHP 140 billion in 2005 (constant 2011 prices).
Over the same period, per student spending at the basic education level also fell by 10
percent in real terms (from PHP 7,998 (US$185) to PHP 7,285 (US$168)). However, in
2006, significant increases in public education investment began to reverse these declines.
Between 2005 and 2013, public education spending almost tripled in real terms while
spending per basic education student increased by around two-thirds. This increased
investment had some positive effects on education outcomes: elementary and high school
net enrollment rates increased and approximately 2.3 million more children were
attending school in 2012 than in 2005.

52.     SPHERE encouraged increased investment in areas that were important to the
success of the reform agenda (e.g. the rolling out of school based management reforms,
classroom construction and the strengthening of a learning resources and management
development system). As intended, areas of the education budget supported to which
SPHERE contributed (e.g. school construction and school based management grants)
showed significant increases over the implementation period. For example, school
construction spending increased fourfold between 2005 and 2012. Impact evaluation
results reported in Annex 3 show that support provided to school-based management (e.g.
SBM grants) raised learning outcomes significantly in a cost-effective way. Evidence
also shows some improvement in internal efficiency indicators: information on reduction
in the number of surplus teachers suggests that the efficiency of the education system is
likely to have improved. School construction costs under the project were initially
comparable with other government-led programs although the shift from the principal-led
scheme to competitive bidding (National Competitive Bidding) during the project
increased costs.

53.     During SPHERE, there was a significant shift in project resources away from
Component 1 and towards classroom construction (Component3). This was in response to
the President’s policy pronouncement to immediately address the classroom shortage.
While it is not possible to quantify the efficiency changes associated with this shift,
evidence suggests that increased investment in classroom construction is likely to have
improved learning. It is also important to remember that SPHERE was one source of
support of the overall BESRA reform program. This means that investments in other
areas continued to come in through programs, projects and other activities of several local
and international development partners supporting the reform program. Based on the
overall efficiency analysis in Annex 3, project efficiency is rated substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

54.      The overall outcome rating of the project is moderately satisfactory based on the
analysis above, which shows that: (i) the relevance of objectives was high, design was
high, and implementation was modest given the FM challenges for an overall relevance
rating of substantial; (ii) the PDO was achieved as measured by the significant
improvements related to PDO level indicators and overall upward trends in the education
system; and (iii) the project was implemented efficiently. These judgments differ from
the last project ISR because at the time the ISR was submitted, several key factors for
rating the project moderately satisfactory were unclear, such as: (i) key indicator data was
still being gathered and was therefore only preliminary; (ii) the project efficiency analysis
that helps substantiate the overall rating is only done as part of the ICR and was therefore
not available when the last ISR was prepared; and (iii) final disbursement information
was not yet available. However, all outstanding information was available at the time the
ICR was written, and based on this, the overall project outcome is judged to be
moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

55.     Education participation among poor households in The Philippines lags behind
wealthier households significantly. For example, in 2007, high school net enrollment
rates for children from the poorest 10 percent of households were 87 percent compared
with near universal enrolment for the wealthiest 10 percent. Elements of the BESRA
sought to address these inequalities by expanding access to basic education in
underserved, poor and remote areas. The BESRA also sought to improve the distribution
of teachers to ensure that schools serving poorer sections of the community are
adequately staffed. Other efforts by government are also addressing education deficits of
poor households. An impact evaluation of the national CCT program showed that
elementary enrolment and attendance rates of poor children had improved significantly as
a result of the program. However, the program had a more limited effect on older
children partly because its age limit prevented high school aged children from being fully
supported. The government has issued a policy to raise the age limit to 18 years to be


                                                       22
eligible for CCT grants to ensure a better fit with high school enrollment patterns. The
overall outcome of these efforts has been a more rapid improvement in school attendance
for the poorest. For example, between 2004 and 2011, attendance rates for 6 to 11 year
old children increased by 7.5 percentage points for the poorest 10 percent of households
compared to a less than 1 percentage point increase for children in the wealthiest 30
percent of households (Reyes, Tabuga, Mina and Asis, 2013).

56.      As mentioned, an impact evaluation found that, over three years, the introduction
of SBM and the provision of grants had a large impact on student learning. For example,
the study showed that mathematics scores on the NAT increased by 4 to 5 percentage
points (approximately 0.25 standard deviations) 21. A separate analysis also showed that
improvements in education quality (brought about through school based management and
associated interventions) had significant pay-offs for women relative to men in terms of
increased educational attainment, a greater chance of migration and higher earnings. 22
Both SPHERE and NPSBE had a positive impact with their support for the
institutionalization of SBM.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

58.      There were seven issues identified as risks during project preparation with an
overall rating of moderate. The ratings primarily were related to the reform process
sustainability and commitment; capacity constraints in a decentralized environment and
financial management. These risks remain pertinent. Positive developments to mitigate
these risks include the following: (i) DepEd with support from various stakeholders was
able to strengthen capacity, improve overall school-based management and
institutionalize a decentralized system; (ii) government commitment has remained strong

as evidenced by continued improvements to and expansion of the BESRA as well as
increased budget allocations for basic education in support of the reforms; (iii) significant
increases within the education budget for existing programs such as the MOOE, which
are critical for supporting SBM and improved school functioning; and (iv) stakeholder,
donor and private-sector participation in support of the BESRA continues, which is a
clear indication of their support to the reform agenda. Financial management
performance remains a challenge. While the government has initiated the development of
the “Government Integrated Financial Management Information System”, capacity at the
local level remains a challenge making it difficult to complete the liquidation of funds
and delays are still encountered in terms of financial management reporting. The
government remains committed to continuing the BESRA reforms through the
consolidation of lessons learned and expansion of the system with the K to12 program.
The Bank continues to support the BESRA, at the request of the government, through the
LEAPS project, which builds on the successes of SPHERE and NPSBE by providing
resources to further support the government’s efforts to improve reading and math skills
with a focus on disadvantaged groups. The main risk for future operations remains the
financial management system. While the government has made progress by re-instituting
the eNGAS, the institutionalization of the program will take time. To mitigate the risk,
the project will reimburse based on achievement of DLIs and not SOEs. Based on these
factors, the risk to the development outcome is rated moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59.     The project preparation team ensured that the project design was closely aligned
with the BESRA (2006-2010), MTPDP and the Bank’s 2006-2008 CAS. Project
preparation started with a pre-identification mission in February 2005, followed by two
additional missions prior to the project’s effectiveness in June 2006. During preparation,
the Bank team also used a “Policy and Human Resources Development – PHRD” grant to
conduct studies to inform project design which included: (i) a review of the SBM
framework implemented in earlier projects, (ii) an assessment of FM, and (iii) a review of
teacher competency standards. The PHRD grant was also used to inform the BESRA by
supporting several analytical pieces including: (i) a Medium Term Spending Plan; (ii)
four Education Policy Notes on improving quality, improving teacher development, SBM,
and improving equity; and (iii) a retrospective on education reform – which looked at
why education reforms failed in the past and which BESRA eventually incorporated as
lessons learned. The design team organized a series of workshops for and with the
government (including DepEd, DBM, National Economic and Development Authority –
NEDA, and Department of Finance) to formulate the BESRA. Once BESRA was
finalized, the NPSBE and subsequently SPHERE components were then selected based
on the BESRA Key Reform thrusts, aligning the project with the BESRA components.
The Bank team included the appropriate technical specialists to develop the project. The
team also actively engaged the Technical Coordinating Team of DepED through



                                             24
workshops and discussions on the design, content, and implementation arrangements of
the project. Consultations were held with oversight agencies of the government as well as
other donors, who expressed interest in re-aligning their projects with the BESRA and
explore opportunities for co-financing and technical assistance. The development
objectives, monitoring indicators and line items to be financed by the project were also
discussed and agreed upon, and were in line with the overarching objectives of the
BESRA. The Bank, working with the government, incorporated mainstreaming of project
implementation into the daily responsibilities of DepEd’s central, regional and division
staff. The project underwent a thorough QER process and the project team included the
recommendations. The results framework was aligned with the BESRA but the initial
targets established were too ambitious.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

60.     As previously mentioned, there were ten Bank review and implementation
support missions from the September 2007 through August 2013, with a final BESRA
review mission in August 2013. The project team was actively engaged in supporting the
government in its efforts to implement the project. The country-based team included the
appropriate technical experts, and missions always included fiduciary and safeguards
staff, as well as civil works, data management, teacher development and school-based
management consultants when appropriate. Given that the project was financed by a trust
fund provided by the Australian government, all subsequent missions were conducted
jointly with AusAID representatives and technical experts. Other donors such as
“Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit – GTZ”, Asian Development Bank - ADB,
Japan International Cooperation Agency - JICA, UNICEF and USAID also participated
in select missions. This attests to the efforts made by the Bank supervision team to
implement the project in a participatory and inclusive way, and which ultimately helped
streamline donor interventions in the education sector in support of the BESRA. The
team also used the Bank-executed SPHERE trust funds and the Bank’s programmatic
budget to help the government address challenges in implementing the project
components as well as the BESRA through just-in-time technical assistance and
analytical work. Key to the project’s ultimate achievements is the task team’s presence on
the ground, which allowed for a constant and open dialogue with government
counterparts and donors. The access to the Bank’s expertise and technical assistance was
repeatedly mentioned by the government as having had an important impact on their day-
to-day work. The Bank team based in the country proved particularly crucial to resolving
bottlenecks and accelerating implementation during project start-up and led to the project
being 93.42 percent disbursed by the closing date.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.   Based on the Bank’s quality at entry, the supervision discussion, and project
outcomes above, overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.




                                            25
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

62.    The government, through its various departments and commissions, provided the
necessary technical and financial support to DepEd to ensure implementation, and
showed its commitment to and comprehension of the project’s objectives. The DBM,
through the General Appropriations Act, maintained the budget line items of SBM, the
school accreditation program, hardship allowance, ALS, and policy formulation, program
planning and standards development for elementary education. The COA reviewed
DepEd’s financial statements regularly and provided its opinions in a transparent way.
NEDA coordinated the preparation of the 2011-2016 Philippine Development Plan that
included support for ALS and CCT. While the various government agencies supported
SPHERE and BESRA, some decisions hampered project performance such as: (i) delays
in implementing eNGAS after its development in 2001, culminating in a temporary
suspension in 2008; (ii) re-institution of selective pre-audits of cash advances and school
construction; and (iii) delays in approval and release of the SARO or Notice of Cash
Allocation for some expenditure items covered under the project items. Based on this, the
government’s performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.     DepEd, through its various bureaus and technical working groups, continued its
support for the implementation and operationalization of the project and the BESRA. As
mentioned previously, DepEd was able to address bottlenecks that hampered
implementation. As part of the BESRA, it was able to roll out and institutionalize school-
based management, promote teacher quality and standards development, significantly
increase the teacher workforce to deal with the influx of new students, and promote all-
inclusive education for minorities (see Annex 2 for complete list of achievements). These
are impressive accomplishments. However, throughout implementation, financial
management and procurement issues slowed implementation, and adherence to reporting
requirements was delayed during the first half of project implementation. Based on these
implementation issues, DepEd’s performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64.    Based on the implementation analysis above, overall Borrower performance is
rated moderately satisfactory




                                            26
6. Lessons Learned

Lesson 1. The institutionalization of reforms requires a long-term commitment on
the part of government and the donor community to support the reform agenda.
DepEd has remained committed to BESRA for eight years. The sustained commitment
has allowed for the key areas of decentralization, professional development, learning
strategies, access to education and organizational development to move forward. In
addition, it has allowed the government to coordinate donor support around the BESRA,
which has also contributed to the continuation of the reform agenda. DepED has gathered
lessons learned from implementation of the reform programs related to the five KRTs and
is now integrating those lessons into the BESRA. These lessons are now paving the way
for DepEd to take a more integrated approach to the reform agenda outlined within the
BESRA.

Lesson 2. SBM is an important tool for decentralizing an education system and
improving learning outcomes. SBM has had a substantial impact on the improvements
at the school level throughout The Philippines. Schools are now systematically preparing
SIPs, have governing councils and school report cards, and have been oriented to
simplified accounting procedures. There is solid evidence from the recent SBM impact
evaluation that schools with SBM experience improved achievement. While SBM
systems are in place, there is still some work to be done in terms of the strengthening the
roles of the governing councils specifically as they relate to accountability as well as
increasing community participation.

Lesson 3. Public private partnerships are important for ensuring the long-term
availability of adequate resources to support community schools. The introduction
and institutionalization of school-level planning and decision making has had positive
effect on their ability to raise funds from the private sector in support of their school
needs. Especially in cases where government assistance is not sufficient to address all the
needs of a school, securing additional funds to leverage government assistance can have a
positive effect on school functioning and performance. Schools now have their SIPs to
keep communities informed of school needs. Again, it will take more time for the private
sector to become fully engaged but systems are now in place through the support of
SHPERE and NPSBE.

Lesson 4. Solid analytical studies on system reforms during the implementation
period are essential for making appropriate decisions on the elimination of
bottlenecks to the reform agenda. With support from the SPHERE, Bank, AusAID and
other donors, there was an on-going attempt to provide real time evaluations and studies
to inform the implementation of the BESRA. Joint supervision missions identified
problems and then mobilized the resources to study the issues and provide
recommendations to DepEd on needed policy changes to improve the system. In many
instances DepEd made the needed changes that led to improved implementation.

Lesson 5. Strong financial management systems are critical for ensuring the efficient
use and accounting of resources. Lack of a fully functioning financial management



                                            27
system led to reporting delays and audit problems for the BESRA and SPHERE. The full
implementation of the Government-wide Financial Management Information System
becomes critical, especially for the DepEd with so many operating and implementing
units under its jurisdiction.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

65.     SPHERE supported a subset of activities and expenditures in the implementation
of the BESRA through targeting of activities and expenditures that are not covered in the
ongoing programs and/or areas with additional needs where the gaps are clearly identified
to support the essential building blocks of the reform agenda. The components and
associated outcome indicators to support this aim are listed below.

66.     Component 1: Translation of system-level policies into actions (AUD 21.15
million) This component had four sub-components: (A1) funding of short- to medium-
term technical assistance (TA) and capacity building of key DepEd managers (AUD 0.52
million); (A2) capacity building in regional offices to conduct quality assurance functions
in divisions and schools and provide support to them, and enhance feedback provision on
their performance (AUD 4.0 million); (A3) funding construction and/or refurbishment of
teaching and learning resource centers across the country (AUD 8.33 million); and (A4)
funding the provision of teaching and learning materials (except textbooks) and training
programs (AUD 8.3 million).

67.     The following indicators were used to measure progress: (i) BESRA TCT and
TWGs are operational/functional; (ii) National Quality Assurance and Accountability
Framework developed and adopted; (iii) Regional office personnel trained on quality
assurance/monitoring and evaluation, and providing technical assistance to divisions and
schools; (iv) functional quality assurance system established with stakeholder
participation at the regional level; (v) all regions monitor performance and report to
DepEd and other stakeholders on performance improvements; (vi) division (with their
schools) received feedback from EMIS; (vii) schools receive feedback from national
assessment; (viii) national learning strategies and action plan formulated and adopted;
(ix) Teaching and Learning Resource centers at the regional and divisional levels
operational; (x) policy on the procurement/production of teaching and learning materials
adopted; and (xi) increased percentage of schools with access to teaching and learning
materials.

   (i)     BESRA TCT and TWGs are operational/functional has been fully met: the
           project supported one TCT (i.e., the DepEd Executive Committee comprised
           of the Secretary, Undersecretaries and Assistant Secretaries) and 8 TWGs,
           which focused on SBM, alternative learning systems, Quality Assurance and
           Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), resource mobilization, IP and Muslim
           Education, assessment and learning strategies (see point viii below for more
           information) and organizational development;
   (ii)    The project contributed to the successful development and roll out of the
           QAAF in 2010, which spells out guiding principles of quality assurance and
           assigned roles and responsibilities within the quality assurance process (see
           points (iv) and (v) for additional outputs. The QAAF, along with the roll-out
           of the Philippines Accreditation System for Basic Education, laid the
           foundation for re-defining school input standards;




                                            30
(iii)   The     output     “Regional     office     personnel     trained    on    quality
        assurance/monitoring and evaluation, and providing technical assistance to
        divisions and schools” has also been met as 100 percent of regions have been
        trained in “Total Quality Management” by end-of-project. This came out of a
        pilot conducted in three regions (Region 6, 7 and 8) to put in place a system
        for the provision of technical assistance by regional offices to divisions and
        schools. Under the Australian-financed STRIVE project, a “Regional
        Monitoring, Evaluation and Adjustment – RMEA” technology was developed,
        which was subsequently used under this project and rolled-out nation-wide to
        track and improve “Regional Education Development Plans – REDPs”.
(iv)    100 percent of regions reported having a “functional quality assurance system
        established with stakeholder participation”, meeting the expected end-of-
        project target. All regions now use the RMEA technology as part of their
        M&E systems to help monitor their support for the delivery of basic education
        services and the regions’ overall performance. The RMEA technology also
        effectively operationalizes the utilization of M&E reports for decision making.
        Lastly, technical assistance was provided to all regions to raise the capacity of
        divisions to assist schools observe and capitalize on classroom practices that
        can improve the quality of learning. While the “Regional Improvement
        Support and Enhancement (RISE)” funds to institutionalize QMS were not
        implemented, DepEd instead provided funding from its own resources to
        ensure capacity building and technical assistance in quality assurance at the
        regional level.
(v)     All regions monitor performance and report to DepEd and other stakeholders
        on performance improvements. As mentioned above, the roll-out of the
        RMEA technology to all regions has allowed them to efficiently track output
        progress at the division level and propose adjustments to their work plans.
        With the support of SPHERE, M&E findings are now being communicated to
        relevant offices at the regional as well as the central levels through the RMEA.
(vi)    100 percent of division (with their schools) received feedback from EMIS,
        exceeding the end target of 75 percent. The roll out of the Enhanced Basic
        Education Information System (e-BEIS) nationwide has allowed central
        offices to upload the information they received from schools on enrollment,
        dropouts, graduates etc., allowing schools to access the information directly or
        for divisions to download and share the information with their respective
        schools.
(vii)   100 percent of schools receive feedback from national assessment, meeting
        the end target. Feedback (i.e., the National Achievement Test – NAT results)
        is being provided by division offices or can be accessed by schools directly
        through the National Educational Testing and Research Center’s (NETRC)
        website. The different test results and assessment outcomes are also used to
        adjust DepEd’s annual in-service teacher training programs, adjust teachers’
        strengths and needs assessment (TSNA) results as well as update/complement
        instructional materials. Furthermore, the project provided 191 division offices
        with primers and toolkits to support them with the roll out of the NCBTS




                                         31
            which, combined with the TSNA, informed teacher hiring guidelines and in-
            service training programs.
     (viii) the third and final phase of the national learning strategy action plan has been
            implemented and included the development of teaching and learning strategies
            in English, mathematics and science as well as the introduction of the
            following three major strategies affecting basic education: (a) the
            universalization of Kindergarten through the introduction of the “Kindergarten
            to Grade 12 Program (K to 12)”, making it officially part of the basic
            education cycle, hiring and training teachers and the development of a
            Kindergarten curriculum; (b) the revision of the entire basic education
            curriculum content and framework to accommodate the K to12 and revised
            ALS programs, the grades 1 – 10 learning competencies, and the development
            of an assessment framework; and (c) the piloting of MTB-MLE in 20 national
            languages in 921 schools nationwide, accompanied by the development of
            supporting materials for teaching and learning in the 12 main languages, basic
            literacy materials for indigenous peoples as well as training programs for
            2,557 Kindergarten and grade 1 teachers in MTB-MLE teaching methodology.
     (ix)   The indicator “Teaching and Learning Resource centers (LRMDCs) at the
            regional and divisional levels operational” has been partially met. All 32
            LRMDCs 23 have been constructed, but one was destroyed by the 2013
            typhoon. The respective ICT and office equipment was also procured and
            delivered to the remaining 31 centers 24. However, given delays in procuring
            the technology office equipment, installation could not be completed for all
            centers. Therefore, operationalization of all centers is expected by June 2014.
            However, the government has been successful in establishing the
            system/website that supports the LRMDCs in improving access of teachers
            and administrators to quality-assured electronic teaching and learning
            materials (see (x) below). Furthermore, DepEd has already identified “Lead
            Schools”, which already have the necessary equipment and connectivity, to
            play the role of satellite centers and thus expand coverage to more remote
            areas.
     (x)    The expected output of “policy on the procurement/production of teaching and
            learning materials adopted” has been exceeded. Not only has the Learning
            Resources and Management Development System (LRMDS) been adopted, it
            is also being applied as part of the development and production of teaching
            and learning resources. As part of the LRMDS, DepEd has developed the
            “Image Bank” platform, which allows teachers to upload materials they have


23
   The decision to reduce the number of LRMDCs from 150 to 32 was recorded in the June 2011
restructuring and was based on the pilot experience with LRMDCs in three regions and initial construction
delays. Criteria used to identify the 16 regions and 16 divisions to benefit from an LRMDC were: (i)
absence of a Regional Education Learning Center; and (ii) divisions with low-performing schools (see
footnote 26 for more information).
24
   The CARAGA regional center could not complete procurement in time due to non-responsive bids by
project closing. DepEd is therefore supporting the CARAGA center acquire the necessary equipment with
government funds. Furthermore, the LRMDC-specific software was not procured for the DepEd central
office before project closing.


                                                   32
             developed and submit for quality review. A team of technical experts (i.e.,
             textbook evaluators, subject specialists, etc.) review teaching material that was
             submitted and publish it if found acceptable, giving credit to the authoring
             teacher. This quality assurance mechanism, however, is not limited to
             materials being produced by teachers but applies to all new digital teaching
             and learning materials. The LRMDS was also crucial in disseminating part of
             the new “Kindergarten to Grade 12 – K-12” teaching materials, facilitating the
             efficient distribution to all regions and divisions in time for the new school
             year 25. There are currently 2,782 uploaded resources and 117,428 registered
             users, which is an impressive accomplishment. And because the LRMDS has
             been so successful, its portal is being strengthened/re-designed with
             Australian government funds to accommodate larger/heavier digital materials
             (i.e., videos, interactive materials etc.).
     (xi)    The percentage of schools with access to teaching and learning materials has
             increased to 50 percent but fell short of its 65 percent end-target. This is
             mainly due to the fact that this indicator measures access to digital resources,
             which has been impacted by the delays in operationalizing the LRMDCs.
             DepEd has, however, kept distributing hard copies of Kindergarten to Grade 2,
             Grade 7 and 8 materials to schools without access to the LRMDS. The project
             also supported the production of 518,000 supplementary teaching and learning
             materials for the 50 low-performing divisions 26 , covering 30 percent of
             poorest-performing schools in each division. DepEd plans to conduct an
             assessment during the 2014/15 school year of the possible impact of having
             provided these materials to inform future interventions aimed at supporting
             low-performing schools.

68.     In addition to these outputs, component 1 directly supported or mobilized other
resources to support a wide range of technical assistance and trainings/workshops. The
main achievement is the operationalization of the policies and implementation and action
plans of the various BESRA TWGs, which are in line with and supportive of the BESRA
Key Reform Thrusts. As previously mentioned, the training and workshop activities
benefitted approximately 24,000 DepEd staff at the central, division and school levels
and covered, amongst others: (i) SBM grant utilization and reporting; (ii) procurement of
printing and distribution, LRMDC-related equipment as well as harmonized procurement
for classroom construction; (iii) quality assurance and M&E, impact evaluation, and
strategic planning and budgeting; (iv) K-12 curriculum development and teacher training;
and (v) LRMDS. Furthermore, SPHERE successfully supported technical assistance,
which led to the following key accomplishments: (i) advocacy and communications plans
BESRA, alternative learning systems and SBM utilization, as well as a revised SBM
operations manual; (ii) a blue print for pre-service teacher education; (iii) the
development of the National Assessment Framework and Grading System Framework;


25
   DepEd is also in the process of developing new digital Grade 6 and 8, as well as MTB learning resources
to support the K-12 policy and will use the LRMDS to disseminate the materials.
26
   Low-performing schools are identified as schools that score low on the NAT and completion rate, and
have high drop-out rates.


                                                   33
(iv) the development of K-12 teaching modules and resources, including their
digitalization and upload into the LRMDS, and web-based social media advocacy
materials on K-12; and (vi) the development of the eBEIS.

69.     Component 2: Support for School-Based Management (SBM) through grants
for school improvement plan targeting disadvantaged elementary schools (AUD 4.48
million). This component provided grants to public elementary schools, which have
installed the basic elements 27 of School-Based Management (SBM).

70.     Progress was tracked through: (i) schools/clusters of schools received school
grants; and (ii) school-based financial management system established, which were both
exceeded. 78 percent of SPHERE-supported schools received SBM grants compared to
the 65 percent target. A total of US$4.38 million 28 were released over the life of the
project, with only US$400,000 undisbursed due to late liquidation by one region. With
only a few months before project closing, the concerned region would not have been able
to fully utilize these SBM funds, leading DepEd to re-align the resources to support the
2013 typhoon victims. Furthermore, the project supported a more rigorous application of
SBM eligibility criteria, where SPHERE schools had to have approved SIPs before
receiving the funds. The project also supported the simplification of the SIP template to
make it more flexible and adaptable to each school’s needs, which has been
distributed/rolled-out to schools nationwide in 2013. Through the simplification, it is
expected that all schools will be able to develop and approve SIPs irrespective of sources
of funding. The project also supported the revision of the SBM framework to become an
incentive-driven instrument and be able to better respond to the realities on the ground.
The realization that even better performing schools should benefit from SBM grants is
expected to address the perverse incentive for schools having to underperform in order to
receive SBM funds. Lastly, the project support to school-based management through the
provision of SBM grants contributed to laying the foundation for the adoption of
multiyear policy guideline to enhance the effectiveness of the utilization of the SBM
grant and improve the management of SBM resources. 29. However, timely liquidation
continued to be an issue and at times slowed-down SBM grant releases. DepEd is
currently trying to address this issue by working with relevant departments. The 2012
independent SBM grant review concluded that overall, there was general compliance
with the guidelines for SPHERE 2011 SBM grants in terms of identification of recipient
divisions and schools. Evidence gathered during the review disclosed that the Central,
Regional and Division Offices adhered to the set processes and conditions and that there
was general compliance with procurement laws. These findings are an indication of the
continued assistance provided by Division Offices to school heads in administering the
grants.



27
   i.e., with well-developed school improvement plans, established school community partnerships,
transparent reporting and accountability mechanisms at the school level etc.
28
   The SBM allocation was increased as a result of the decision to reduce the number of LRMDCs as
recorded in the June 2011 restructuring.
29
   This includes the continued practice of using multiyear guidelines for SBM utilization, improving
schools’ ability to plan their interventions over a longer period.


                                                34
71.     In terms of school-based financial management system having been established,
88 percent of school heads have been trained in Simplified Accounting Procedures (SAP),
and have adequate financial management systems in place, exceeding the 65 percent
target. In additional to these achievements, DepEd received technical assistance and
financial support from AusAID to develop a FMIS. This system had to be put on hold
pending the development of the government wide FMIS, called the “Government
Integrated Financial Management Information System - GIFMIS”. As a first step, the
government has developed the “Unified Accounting Code Structure – UACS”,
consolidating all accounting codes currently in use in the Philippines, which is expected
to be rolled out in the latter part of CY2014. With project support, the government was
able to conduct financial management training in “Strategic planning for budgeting and
planning”, which has already shown some positive effects on DepEd’s FM performance
as discussed under section 2.4.

72.     Component 3: Classroom construction in high need locations in Southern
Philippines (AUD 13.82 million). This component supported classroom construction in
identified priority schools under the DepEd-managed School building Program in
Southern Philippines and was to be done by DepEd with extensive community
partnership.

73.     Achievement of this component was measured through the percentage of cost-
sharing between DepEd and LGUs for classroom construction, including equity factors,
which was exceeded: 100 percent of classrooms constructed under the project followed
the cost-sharing scheme, which required a signed Statement of Interest between DepEd
and the LGU before construction could commence. Sharing the burden of construction
took the form of either cash or in-kind contributions (i.e., local engineers, site preparation,
extra LGU manpower etc.). As a result, the project was able to support 1,150 classrooms
and 1,068 toilets 30 compared to the final target of 1,160 classrooms and 1,124 toilets. The
decision to build additional classrooms was made in November 2011 following the
successful completion of the initial classroom construction targets of 507, which were
completed under batches 1-3, and the foreign exchange gains vis-à-vis the Australian
dollar. However, there were significant delays in finishing the additional classrooms due
to a change in the implementation approach 31 as discussed under Section 2.4, and which
required weekly meetings between the Bank and DepEd teams to track progress in the
last months, leading to 99 percent of classrooms having been completed. The quality of
construction is generally good and most schools were provided with toilets. A post-
review found that a small number of toilets was not connected to the water supply, which
DepEd agreed to rectify. This LGU-DepEd partnership, however, goes even beyond



30
   These include classrooms destroyed by the 2012 earthquake in Region VII. Other regions where
classrooms were not completed in time are Regions, VI, VIII, IX, XI and CARAGA.
31
   The Principal-Led School Building Program is an implementation approach using a decentralized mode
of implementation of school building procurement and contract administration, which was subsequently
replaced by a more centralized implementation mode using National Competitive Bidding.

funded by LGUs.




                                          36
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

74.     The economic rationale for the SPHERE project is based on the expected payoffs
of support to BESRA reforms in terms of accelerated economic and social development,
improved efficiency and reduced inequality. These payoffs will result from increased
access to good quality basic education which has been shown to raise economic growth
rates and improve other development outcomes. The SPHERE project contributes to the
broader BESRA by supporting a number of measures to increase basic education access
and quality as well as strategies aimed at making public education investments more cost-
effective.

75.     There was no economic and financial analysis in the appraisal document. Given
the project’s aim of supporting the overall basic education reform program, the economic
and financial analysis of the ICR focuses on assessing the extent to which public
investment in education increased and how the efficiency of the system has changed. It
also compares project costs with a number of alternatives and where possible assesses the
cost-effectiveness of the reforms that were supported.

76.     The reform program introduced in 2006 was underpinned by significant increased
public education spending. This reversed a decline in public education investment in the
early 2000s and supported a significant expansion in basic education enrolments.

77.     The SPHERE project and the parallel NPSBE encouraged increased investment in
areas that were important to the success of the reform agenda (e.g. the rolling out of
school based management reforms, classroom construction and support to a learning
resources and management development system). The analysis reported in this annex
shows that support provided to school based management (e.g. SBM grants) raised
learning outcomes in a cost-effective way. Evidence also shows that the efficiency of the
education system is likely to have been improved through improved teacher deployment.
In particular, the BESRA reform program and associated support from the NPSBE and
SPHERE projects, was associated with a decline in the number of ‘excess’ teachers
which reduced system costs. School construction costs under the project were initially
comparable with other government-led programs although the shift from principal-led
scheme (through shopping) to competitive bidding (National Competitive Bidding)
during the project increased costs.

78.     During the SPHERE project there was a significant shift in project resources away
from (Component 1) and towards classroom construction (Component 3). It is not
possible to quantify the changes in efficiency associated with this shift because
information on the efficiency of different components is not available. However, the
analysis shows that increased investments in classroom construction were likely to have
benefits in terms of student learning. In addition, given that SPHERE was one component
of the overall BESRA reform program it is possible that investments in these other areas
continued through other activities.

Trends in public education spending, 2002-2013

79.     The education system in the first half of the 2000s was characterized by declining
access to basic education and falling levels of public investment. Between 2002 and 2006,
elementary net enrollment rates (NERs) fell by 7 percentage points and the number of
children attending elementary school stagnated. Drop-out rates remained high particularly
in the first grade where 15 percent of students dropped out annually (World Bank and
AusAID 2010). Over the same period, high school NERs remained relatively stable and
enrollment increased in line with population growth (World Bank and AusAID 2010;
Department of Education (DepEd) 2012b). Poor education performance was partly the
result of underinvestment in the education sector (Figure 1). In real terms, overall
spending on education declined from PHP 155 billion in 2003 to PHP 140 billion in 2005
(constant 2011 prices). Over the same period, per student spending at the basic education
level also fell by 10 percent in real terms (from PHP 7,998 (US$185) to PHP 7,285
(US$168)).

80.     In 2006, significant increases in public education investment began to reverse the
declines in the education sector seen in the first half of the decade. In 2006, the Basic
Education Sector Reform Agenda (BESRA) was developed and at the same time public
investment into the education sector began to increase. Between 2005 and 2013, public
education spending almost tripled in real terms while spending per basic education
student increased by around two-thirds (Figure 1). This increased investment had some
positive effects on education outcomes; elementary and high school net enrollment rates
increased and approximately 2.3 million more children were attending school in 2012
than in 2005. Test results at the elementary level have also shown improvement across all
subjects (Figure 2). At the high school level, trends in achievement have improved in

Cost savings arising from changes in internal efficiency

81.     Internal efficiency. Improvements in the internal efficiency of the basic
education system have the potential to realize significant cost savings over time. For
example, reductions in repetition rates can reduce the time children take to complete
elementary schooling and hence reduce the costs of elementary provision. BESRA and
the SPHERE project were designed to raise the quality of basic education and improve
the efficiency of the education system through reductions in drop-out and improvements
in overall school completion. However, internal efficiency indicators did not change
significantly over the period of SPHERE and as result are unlikely to have led to any
significant cost savings. Table 3 provides information on trends in the main internal
efficiency indicators of elementary and high schools. There have been some small
improvements in survival and completion rates in elementary and high schools between
2006 and 2012. High school repetition and dropout rates also fell marginally over the
period of the SPHERE project. However, these trends are unlikely to have resulted in
significant cost savings over the period of the SPHERE project.

Note: The cohort survival rate is the percentage of a cohort of students in the first grade in a given school
year that are expected to survive to the last grade. Completion rate is the percentage of first year entrants
who complete/finish their full term. Repetition rates are for public schools only and along with drop-out
rates are not available for the 2012/13 school year because DepEd no longer tracks these indicators.

2013a).

82.     These relatively minor efficiency improvements need to be seen in light of the
SPHERE project objectives to increase access and narrow inequality. Approximately 2.3
million additional children have enrolled in basic education since 2005. A large
proportion of these children are likely to have come from poorer households where
support for education is more limited and the factors associated with dropout and
repetition more prevalent. A survey conducted in 2004 showed that completion rates for
the poorest household quintile were half those of the wealthiest quintile. This would
suggest that as poorer children entered school for the first time the efficiency of the
system would deteriorate. It is striking therefore that internal efficiency indicators
remained relatively steady over this period.

83.    Improvements in the efficiency of the system can also arise if excess teachers are
redeployed to deficit schools or are used to accommodate increased student numbers in
new schools/classrooms. In this way, classroom construction under the SPHERE project
could have improved the efficiency of teacher distribution in areas with excess teachers.

84.     Calculations based on reductions in the number of excess teachers point to large
cost savings. In order to understand fully whether the distribution of teachers has
improved, analysis of teacher surpluses and deficits at the school level is required. A
study estimated that there were 83,000 excess public teachers in the basic education
system (68,000 at elementary and 15,000 at high school) in 2003/04 (Department of
Education (DepEd) 2005). A follow up study, using 2012/13 data and the same
methodology, showed that the number of excess teachers had declined to around 28,505
basic education teachers (Department of Education (DepEd) 2013b). Assuming this had
the effect of reducing the need for new teachers by an equivalent amount this would have
reduced the overall salary bill by approximately 10 percent or PHP 14.2 billion.32
While these savings are likely to have been driven by a number of factors increases in the
stock of classrooms is likely to have played a role.



32
   This assumes the average teacher salary of PHP 261,376 reported in the latest medium term expenditure
framework (Department of Education (DepEd) 2013b).

85.     Despite reductions in the number of excess teachers, increases in enrollment have
meant that teacher shortages remain. The rapid growth, since 2005, of basic education
enrollment has given rise to an increased need for new teachers. This growing demand
has been filled by shifting excess teachers to schools with deficits as well as by recruiting
additional teachers. At the elementary level student teacher ratios were on an upward
trend until 2012 when there was a jump in annual teacher recruitment. In high schools,
the student teacher ratio has declined over the last five years and saw a significant drop
between 2011 and 2012 (Figure 2). 33 However, student-teacher ratios remain above the
level associated with existing staffing norms. Coupled with rising enrollment, this has
meant that the absolute size of teacher shortages initially grew. In 2005, it was estimated
that schools had a deficit of approximately 38,000 teachers but this had grown to
approximately 73,514 by the end of 2013. It is expected that with the regularization of
locally funded teachers in 2014 remaining teacher shortages will be eliminated.

Efficiency/cost effectiveness of project spending on key components

86.     During the life of the project, there was a significant shift in project resources
away from (Component 1) and towards classroom construction (Component 3). It is not
possible to quantify the changes in efficiency associated with this shift because
information on the efficiency of different components is not available. However,
evidence from the Philippines suggests that investments in classroom construction are
likely to have had a positive impact on education outcomes. Moreover, SPHERE was
only one part of the overall BESRA reform program and it is possible that investments to
support system level policy reform continued through other activities.

87.     The remainder of this section assesses the extent to which public investment
increased in these areas. It also explores the potential effect, efficiency and cost
effectiveness of the major items of spending supported by the SPHERE project.


33
         The pattern of regional student teacher ratios have also not changed significantly over time.



                                                                                                           41
3.1 Component 1: Translation of system-level policies into actions

88.    The bulk of spending under this component went to strengthening the
management capacity of the education system with a strong focus on quality. There were
three main areas of support:

       •   Development of a quality assurance framework and the introduction of
           associated monitoring and evaluation systems.
       •   Roll out of enhanced education information system to improve planning
       •   Feedback system from national assessments to identify teacher training needs

89.      These systems are vital elements of a well-functioning education system and
feedback systems introduced as part of the SPHERE project have the potential to match
resources more closely to need. However, it is not possible to isolate the impact of these
interventions on overall access and learning outcomes from the broader reform program.
It is also likely that the introduction of systems of this kind will take time to translate into
improved education outcomes.

90.     The component also supported the implementation of school based management
reforms through the revision of manuals and training on grant utilization. Evidence
suggests (see below) that these efforts in conjunction with the school based management
grants provided through the project will have raised learning outcomes in a cost-effective
way.

91.     Resources under this component were also devoted to the construction or
expansion of 32 regional and divisional learning resource management development
centers (LRMDC). These centers have provided the focal point for the nationwide
Learning Resources and Management and Development System and are the repository
for teaching and learning materials developed for elementary and high schools.

92.    The average cost of constructing or expanding LRMDCs were approximately 3
times the cost of classrooms constructed under the project (Table 4). Given the size of
LRMDCs the costs of construction are in line with the classroom construction costs under

amounted to approximately US$96,000 per LRMDC with ICT equipment and structural
cabling accounting for approximately 55 percent of these costs.

divisions.

3.2 Component 2: Support for school based management

94.     Public education spending on strengthening school based management increased
significantly after the start of the BESRA reform program (Figure 3). Maintenance and
other operating expenses (MOOE) allocated to elementary and high schools doubled in
real terms between 2005 and 2012. This also translated into significantly more resources
per student; MOOE at elementary (high school) increased from PHP 153 (PHP 447) in
2005 to PHP476 (PHP 772) in 2012 (constant 2011 prices). Overall allocations to grants
for school based management grants introduced as part of the NPSBE and SPHERE
projects doubled in size in 2011.

95.     School based management grants and maintenance and other operating
expenses. School based management is expected to lead to improvements in school
performance by placing decision-making authority and control over resources in the
hands of schools and the communities they serve. It is expected that this will raise
performance because local actors have better information to base their decisions on and
that the participation of local communities will improve transparency and strengthen
existing accountability mechanisms that govern resource use.

96.     World Bank studies of an earlier pilot of SBM demonstrated the potential benefits
of school based management in the Philippines. The Third Elementary Education Project
(TEEP) piloted the implementation of school based management in 6,000 elementary
schools in the Philippines in 2003 to 2005. A study of this initial pilot showed that
schools that had introduced school based management had been successful at raising
levels of learning at a faster rate compared to control group schools (Khattri, Ling et al.
2010). Another study also pointed to the importance of textbooks, instructional training
of teachers and new classroom construction in explaining these improved learning
outcomes (Yamauchi and Liu 2013). Improvements in education quality brought about
through school based management and associated interventions have also been shown to
have positive long-term development impacts for women. The improved levels of
learning associated with the earlier TEEP project were found to have significant pay-offs
for women relative to men in terms of increased educational attainment, a greater chance
of migration and higher earnings (Yamauchi and Liu 2012).

97.    NPSBE expanded the coverage of school based management and a recent impact
evaluation confirms its significant and positive impact on education performance (World
Bank and AusAID 2013; Yamauchi 2014). To assess the impact of SBM on learning
outcomes the study exploited differences in the roll-out of SBM and associated grants
between 2006 and 2009. 34 The study found that, over three years, the introduction of
SBM and the provision of grants improved scores on the National Achievement Tests
(NAT) by 4 to 5 percentage points (approximately 0.25 standard deviations).

98.     Simple comparisons with other common interventions to improve education
quality tentatively suggest that the SBM reforms have been cost effective. The impact
evaluation estimated simple education production functions using the same sample of
schools. For rural schools, reductions in pupil-classroom and student-teacher ratios were
both associated with better student performance on national achievement tests and these
results were statistically significant (see Appendix 2 World Bank and AusAID 2013). 35
The point estimates suggest that a reduction of 10 students in each classroom would lead
to an average improvement in test scores of approximately 0.5 percentage points. Using
classroom construction costs from the SPHERE project, an improvement of this
magnitude would cost around PHP 170,000.36 Applying a similar approach using the cost
of SBM grants shows that a 1 percentage point increase in student learning through the


34
   Propensity score matching techniques are used to develop an appropriate control group for the study.
35
   Coefficients for urban schools were not statistically significantly different from zero.
36
   This assumes that classrooms have an average of 45 students.


                                                    44
introduction of SBM is estimated to cost between PHP 12,500 and 50,000. These simple
calculations suggest that raising learning through SBM grants is likely to have been more
cost effective than constructing classrooms alone. Given that the size of SBM grants are
considerably smaller (PHP 50,000 on average - see Table 3) and their impact on learning
much higher (i.e. 4-5 percentage points), they seem to more cost-effective. Similar
conclusions can be made by comparing the cost-effectiveness of reducing student-teacher
ratios through SBM reforms. These calculations are not intended to give precise estimates
but they do suggest that SBM reforms are cost-effective when compared with some other
common interventions.

99.     SBM grants have covered approximately a quarter of all basic education schools
(Table 5). 37The criteria used to select schools for SBM grants have varied across the
years. Findings from a small and non-representative survey of schools suggested that it
was more likely for grant recipients to be in poorer municipalities. However, the
indicators laid out in DepED guidelines to select schools for inclusion in the program (e.g.
dropout rates, NAT scores etc.) were not strong predictors of grant receipt (World Bank
and AusAID 2013).

100. Grants provided as part of the school based management reform have also raised
overall levels of school financing. The impact evaluation found that SBM grants did not
displace other sources of funding. Schools receiving SBM grants were found to improve
their overall resource position and were successful at raising more resources from parent
teacher associations than in previous years.

101. Recent improvements in the size and financial management of maintenance and
operating expenses have also contributed to a rise in the share of education resources
controlled at the school level. A small survey of 150 schools in 3 provinces showed that
the resources available at the school level had increased significantly since 2005 (World
Bank and AusAID 2013). For example, average per student resources managed at the
school-level had increased, in real terms, from under PHP 200 in 2007 to nearly PHP 400
in 2010 (constant 2005 prices). These increases have partly been the result of increased
DepEd funding in the form of MOOE but also in improvements in the ‘downloading’ of

     SPHERE provided SBM grants for elementary schools


                                                     45
funds to schools. In 2007, only 13 of the 150 surveyed schools reported receiving DepEd
funding while in 2011, 115 schools reported receiving this funding. These trends are
encouraging given that better school financing in combination with the implementation of
school based management is associated with better learning outcomes.

102. Despite recent increases, overall resources that flow to the school level are still
very low and efforts to target these resources more effectively have only just begun.
School based management grants and MOOE at the school level represented only 4
percent of the overall DepEd budget in 2013. This is equivalent to approximately
PHP495 (US$11.4) per student and is very low in comparison to programs in other East
Asian countries. For example, the national school grants program in Indonesia that
supports school operating expenses has provided approximately US$65 per elementary
and junior high school student since 2012. During the lifetime of NPSBE, operating
expenses have been allocated to divisions on a per student basis which has the potential
to reinforce existing inequalities in education performance. However, a new funding
formula developed in 2008 has recently been applied and addresses differences in school
need across the different regions and divisions of the Philippines.

3.3 Component 3: Enhanced quality and equity through standards, assessment and
support

103. Investments in classroom construction and rehabilitation have risen rapidly since
the middle of the 2000s (Figure 5). These investments have led to a considerable increase
in classrooms allowing for greater levels of access to basic education (see below).
Between 2007 and 2013, on average 6 percent of the overall Department of Education
budget was devoted to classroom construction and rehabilitation. In line with government
commitments to eliminate all classroom shortages by the end of 2013, there has also been
an uptick in spending on classrooms since 2011.

104. Classroom construction. Increasing the number of classrooms was central to the
SPHERE objectives of improving the quality and equity of basic education. Previous
research in the Philippines showed the importance of reducing the pupil classroom ratio
for improved learning outcomes (World Bank and AusAID 2010; World Bank and
AusAID 2013; Yamauchi and Liu 2013). As part of the SPHERE project, 1,150 new
classrooms were constructed at a total cost of US$21.01 million

105. Classroom construction has facilitated the expansion in education access that has
occurred since 2005. Between 2007 and 2012, an additional 32,000 classrooms were
constructed (8 percent of the total stock in 2007) and this allowed the accommodation of
an additional 1.5 million basic education students in public facilities (Figure 6). Recent
estimates also suggest that classroom shortages have declined significantly. In 2010, an
estimated 67,000 additional classrooms were needed to comply with existing standards.
By 2014, classroom construction efforts had reduced this shortage to approximately
28,000 (Department of Education (DepEd) 2013b).

106. Recent classroom construction has resulted in significant declines in the average
student-classroom ratio in high schools. Between 2007 and 2012 the student-classroom
ratio fell from 67 to 59 in high schools. While raw student-classroom ratios at the
elementary level have remained relatively constant estimates that take account of the
multiple-shifts schools undertake show that issues of overcrowding are now less severe.
In 2013, average class sizes were approximately 34 students per class although this may
be a slight overestimate as it includes kindergarten. 38




38
   Patterns and trends in student-classroom ratios in the Southern regions of the Philippines (the focus of the
SPHERE program) were similar to those reported in the main text for the country as a whole. This reflects
in part the overall NPSBE program that supported construction across the Philippines.

Note: DepEd designed school building is based on Type II design which includes a kitchen and a two seater
toilet. SPHERE costs include a two seater toilet. PHP figures converted using US$ exchange rate for 2010
of 45.1 from World development indicators.
Source: Data for SPHERE and DepEd designed school building were provided by DepEd Physical
Facilities and Schools Engineering Department. Other information on principal led and DPWH costs are
from Government Watch (2010) and based on a sample of 24 principal-led and 24 DPWH construction
programs.

107. The initial principal-led approach to classroom construction that the SPHERE
project adopted was similar in costs to the alternatives (Table 4). Moreover, evidence
from a small monitoring study of school building projects suggested that the principal-led
classroom construction scheme was of better quality than public works-managed
construction. For example, a greater proportion of public works-managed classroom
projects had discrepancies with the program of works than the principal-led projects
reviewed (Government Watch 2010). In addition, principal-led classroom construction
was also likely to have wider benefits because placing the control of construction in the
hands of the school principal is likely to reinforce broader school based-management
reforms.

108. The Government Watch review also visited two construction projects developed
through the KALAHI community driven development program. Classrooms built under
community programs were generally not comparable with government programs. For
example, classrooms built through the KALAHI program were generally of smaller size.
While it is not possible to draw general conclusions the review found that the two
community construction projects were the highest quality and most cost efficient of the
various programs reviewed.

109. After two years of the SPHERE project, the principal-led classroom construction
approach was dropped in favor of an approach that used national competitive bidding
using harmonized bid documents to organize classroom construction at the division level.
The resulting costs of classroom construction in this later phase of the project were high
compared with other comparable classroom construction. On average, the costs of a two-
classroom block with a two-seater toilet block were PHP 1.5 million compared to
approximately PHP 1.1 million for a conventionally designed DepEd classroom block.
Costs of construction adopted by the SPHERE project were also higher to an earlier
World Bank project (Second Social Expenditure Management Program) that included
classroom construction (see World Bank 2008).

110. The Project – Support to Philippine Basic Education Sector Reform (SPHERE)
was a Grant from the Government of Australia in the amount of AUD 39,451,025 with
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) acting as grant funds
administrator. A Grant Agreement was executed on March 28, 2008 between the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Philippine Government.
The Project was created to support the goal of the government’s Basic Education Reform
Agenda (BESRA) on improving the quality and equity in learning outcomes.

Overview of Project Implementation

111. The original three-year implementation period (2008-2011) of SPHERE was
extended to two more years or until November 30, 2013 as a result of major restructuring
in its project categories.

112. The restructuring contributed in resolving the demand to immediately address
classroom shortages in the country. Hence, the Grant proceeds for classroom construction
was increased from US$11.61 million (2008) to US$19.86 million (2012).
Correspondingly, the Project’s targets were revised as explained below.

113. The third and last extension of SPHERE from June 1, 2013 to November 30, 2013
covered primarily the completion of the remaining 134 classrooms (in 67 sites) under
batches 4 and 5 and procurement for the delivery of office equipment and furniture at the
27 LRMDCs in the regions, select divisions and IMCS. Out of these remaining targets,
the Department was able to accomplish the following as of November 30, 2013:

      •   128 classrooms posted 100 percent completed (Cumulative accomplishment since
          2008 was 1,150 classrooms against a target of 1,160).
      •   14 LRMDCs (5 Regions and 9 Divisions) successfully procured the required
          items 100 percent while 13 LRMDCs (8 Regions, 4 Divisions and IMCS) were
          unable to procure completely the required item (32 LRMDCs nationwide since
          2010).

Overview of SPHERE’s Contributions to the Reform Agenda

114. SPHERE’s project design indicates complementary project components, which
inputs directly to address identified gaps in the quality of basic education resources and
services as already outlined in the government’s Basic Education Sector Reform Agenda
(BESRA). How? Mobilization of the Reform Agenda required policies and guidelines to
spell out specific reforms which the Consultancy/Technical Assistance (TA) component
of the Project provided. Other than development of policy reforms the TAs were also
instrumental in developing advocacy and communication strategies in specific reform
areas, e.g. information and communication protocols and materials for Alternative
Learning System and SBM or, identification of required trainings for gaps in skills such
as the trainings on basic M&E processes and QA which were delivered thru the training
component of the Project. While the NPSBE project financed In-service trainings of
teachers, SPHERE complemented this by financing the printing and distribution of the
advocacy and professional assessment materials of the NCBTS-TSNA 39 in all Regions
and Divisions and supplementary teaching and learning materials for the prioritized 50
Divisions. The training and learning resources requirement of the learners and teachers

   Validated results of the teachers’ professional assessment - TSNA would have provided a baseline on the
teachers’ training needs/requirements by school/Division/Region viz. results of the schools’ performance
outcomes, e.g. Achievement rate.




                                                   55
were addressed through the establishment of Learning Resource Management and
Development Centers in 16 Regions and 16 Divisions which are envisioned to
immediately provide the following:

          •   access to quality supplementary teaching and learning materials in print or
              thru the LRMDS portal or electronic copies;
          •   training facilities for teachers or curriculum specialists equipped with the
              necessary ICT and multimedia tools and,
          •   expertise and facilities in developing supplementary materials, e.g. e-
              books in MTB-MLE or K to 12 lesson guides in video format

115. The Project also funded about US$4.38 million worth of SBM Grants
complementing the government-funded SBM grants by focusing on schools with
approved School Improvement Plans (SIP) but are in difficult situations (conflict areas,
high incidence of poverty and remotely located).
Overall, SPHERE invested about 93.42 percent of its Grant proceeds to implement the
Reform Agenda and the current priority goals of the Department more importantly on K
to 12.
