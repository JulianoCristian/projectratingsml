"Ratings for the Targeted Budget Support\n            for National Education for All Plan Implementation Program\n            Project for Vietnam were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            low or negligible, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: sector wide\n            approaches (SWAps) with multi-donor financing offer a useful\n            vehicle to coordinate assistance in support of a government\n            program. While differences of opinion may well exist among\n            donors, the very process of coordinating, participating, and\n            working together with the government presents an environment\n            conducive to addressing those differences to present\n            'one voice' to the client. In complex\n            decentralized settings, which are often the SWAps\n            environments, it is important to make sure the central level\n            and other relevant agencies implement regular follow up and\n            assistance to decentralized levels to make sure fiduciary\n            processes are well understood and implemented. SWAPs do also\n            offer a good opportunity to address systemic sector issues,\n            such as, in this case, broad education quality and equity\n            issues, by coordinating with donors and Government around a\n            common sector strategy. It is important to use them to\n            maintain a vivid and continuous policy dialogue on technical\n            and strategic aspects. However, basic minimum requirements\n            for country systems need to be in place to maximize the\n            potential of this policy dialogue. In their absence, as was\n            the case for targeted budget support (TBS), too much time\n            and energy may be focused on getting fiduciary systems right\n            at the expense of the sector strategic dialogue. Instead of\n            relying on a parallel ministry of education and training\n            (MoET)/treasury reporting system difficult to reconcile, it\n            may have been wiser to maximize the role of the Treasury in\n            reporting given its overall more developed financial\n            reporting expertise and generally more reliable financial\n            reporting system."}, "docdt": "2009-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
