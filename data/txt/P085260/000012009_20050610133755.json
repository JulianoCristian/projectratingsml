{"cdata!": "The Targeted Budget Support for National\n            Education for All Plan Program Project will provide targeted\n            budgetary support for selected subcomponents of the\n            Educational National Targeted Program (NTP), designed to\n            enhance the quality of basic education, and, will strengthen\n            the administration of the Education National Targeted\n            Program. In addition, the project will also promote an\n            overarching policy framework in education finance, planning,\n            and governance that will act as an enabling environment for\n            improved service delivery. There are two project components.\n            The first component will support the establishment of the\n            Fundamental School Quality Level (FSQL) standard, providing\n            assistance to the Education National Targeted Program. The\n            component will focus on minimum service delivery criteria in\n            terms of physical infrastructure, instructional materials,\n            teaching staff qualifications, in-service professional\n            development, school organization and management, and\n            school-community linkages. It includes a framework to\n            enhance teacher capacity, school leadership, and community\n            participation, while promoting inclusive education for\n            traditionally disenfranchised communities. The second\n            component provides technical assistance, and capacity\n            building to strengthen the administration, implementation\n            and evaluation of the Education NTP. Project beneficiaries\n            will be children attending schools being upgraded to FSQL,\n            and out-of-school children who will be drawn into the\n            education system through NTP interventions. Activities are\n            targeted to disadvantaged groups or areas, hence, the\n            beneficiary group will contain a higher proportion of poor\n            children, and ethnic minorities than the population of\n            Vietnam in general. This component will be financed from a\n            parallel capacity building technical assistance fund. This\n            capacity building facility will be predominantly reserved to\n            support the central, provincial, and district levels on\n            planning, procurement, financial management, and\n            institutional strengthening issues, as well as to enhance\n            community consultation, and empowerment. Funds will also be\n            allocated to independent implementation progress reviews\n            (including procurement audits), some local-level monitoring\n            by social organizations (such as parent-teacher\n            associations, the Vietnam Women's Union, etc.), and, to\n            commission case studies on Education NTP administration,\n            monitoring, and impact evaluation."}, "docdt": "2005-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
