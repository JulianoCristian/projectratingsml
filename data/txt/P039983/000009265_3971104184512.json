objective of the\n            Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project is the\n            rapid increase of water supply and sanitation coverage in\n            the rural areas. The secondary development objective is to\n            modify the National Environment Sanitation Service's\n            (SENASA) role in the sector from an implementer of projects\n            to an efficiently managed promoter of activities.  The first\n            of four components consists of three subcomponents: 1) New\n            water systems built, basically consisting of a deep well, an\n            elevated tank and a distribution network of primary and/or\n            secondary networks. 2) The production, storage, and\n            distribution systems of ten existing systems will be\n            expanded. 3) New   systems in the department of Chaco will\n            be constructed to supply water to indigenous systems.  The\n            second component consists of two subcomponents: sewage\n            systems -where the communities have grown and there are\n            serious environmental problems from the lack of sanitation-\n            and the construction and distribution of concrete slabs for\n            latrines will be financed. The third component includes the\n            following subcomponents: institutional strengthening of\n            SENASA and newly formed Juntas by financing professional,\n            technical, and community training, and strengthening the\n            environmental management capability of SENASA; designing a\n            pilot program and building incentives for private providers\n            (Aguaterias); promotion of associations of Juntas; and\n            planing a National Rural Water and Sanitation Program.\n            Project component four consists of engineering design for\n            all of the systems; community mobilization and promotion;\n            supervision of the various civil works; and administration\n            and monitoring by SENASA and staff; and analyzing the\n            project's environmental impact."}, "docdt": "1997-08-06T00:00:00Z"}
