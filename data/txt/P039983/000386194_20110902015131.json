"loan_no": "4223;4222", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Fourth Rural Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project for Paraguay were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Rural and Small Towns Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project for Ecuador were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was significant, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: sector reform\n            and the related shift in institutional culture require\n            political support and time.  Both Ecuador and Paraguay\n            experienced delays in project effectiveness and\n            implementation due to political instability and social\n            unrest.  Formalization of consistent policies is critical\n            for reform. The comparison of the Water supply and\n            Sanitation (WSS) sectors institutional framework in Ecuador\n            and Paraguay reveals the importance of formalizing sector\n            policies through legal decrees and formal approvals by the\n            congress to ensure that the financial and investment\n            policies are enforced. While they may not be sufficient,\n            formalization of the policies and sector institutional\n            responsibilities seem to be necessary for the implementation\n            of reforms especially as the countries face political\n            changes. In Paraguay, rules for engaging various\n            stakeholders were embedded in laws and decrees. This\n            facilitated the implementation of coherent and consistent\n            financial and investment policies across the sector\n            regardless of who is funding the investments. In Ecuador, on\n            the other hand, the main elements of the institutional and\n            financial policies were not formalized prior to project\n            initiation. Instead, arrangements were agreed on an\n            investment by investment basis. Sanitation requires more\n            attention. Both projects included components to increase\n            coverage of improved sanitation, but the real outcomes\n            achieved through the project activities have been generally\n            poor or difficult to assess due to lack of available data on outcomes."}, "docdt": "2011-08-17T00:00:00Z"}
