Some lessons learned included:\n            while it may not be sufficient for implementation of reform,\n            sector policies and institutional responsibilities need to\n            be formalized through legal decrees and approvals by the\n            Congress as a precondition for the enforcement of financial\n            and investment policies, especially as the countries face\n            political changes. Long-term financial sustainability\n            depends on whether the institutional arrangements for\n            implementing cost recovery policies are sound and responsive\n            to local conditions.
