{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Fourth Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project for Paraguay were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: The successful implementation of six pilot water\n            supply systems under the project provides evidence of the\n            viability of private sector financing, construction and\n            operation of rural water supply systems. Participation of\n            local communities throughout the process not only made it\n            more transparent but it also facilitated relations between\n            the private sector and users. Some of the key elements for\n            success include informed involvement of the community\n            throughout the process (including in the determination of\n            tariff and connection costs), the ownership of the systems\n            by the community, and the participation of the government as\n            a broker between the private sector and the community. Pilot\n            projects offer a practical approach to institutional and\n            organizational change in the sector, as they provide\n            opportunities for learning by doing on a small scale while\n            reducing the severity of the consequences of failure. This\n            point is illustrated by the two pilots under the project,\n            which despite different outcomes provided valuable lessons\n            for future projects. Benefiting from these lessons means\n            allocating resources for the required systematic and\n            rigorous analysis and documentation of relevant experiences.\n            Thus, the design of pilots should explicitly address the\n            issue of what hypotheses to test, the methodology to test\n            them, and the methodology to draw the relevant lessons. It\n            should also address the issue of specialized human resources\n            in the Bank required to advise the borrower during pilot\n            preparation and implementation."}, "docdt": "2007-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
