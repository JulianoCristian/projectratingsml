                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) prepared by the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) for the Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation
Project (Loan 70350-EC) in Ecuador (PRAGUAS).

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan to the
Government of Ecuador was approved by the Board of Directors on October 17, 2000 in
the amount of US$32 million for PRAGUAS as the first phase of its sector program. At
appraisal the total project cost was estimated to be US$50.25 million, including the
municipalities’ and beneficiaries’ contribution of US$10.25 million and US$8 million,
respectively. The final project cost was US$45.57 million, of which the loan amount was
US$32 million and the contribution from the municipalities and the beneficiaries were
US$6.2 million and $6.9 million, respectively. The remaining $0.56 million was covered
by the Government. The closing date was extended by two years, from October 31, 2004
to October 31, 2006.

IEG prepared this report based on an examination of the Project Appraisal Document,
Implementation Completion and Results Report, Legal Agreement, project files and
archives, as well as other relevant report, memoranda and working papers. Discussions
were also held with Bank staff in Washington, DC and in the resident mission. An IEG
field mission visited Ecuador in December 2010 to review the results on the ground and
to hold discussions with relevant government officials, communities of beneficiaries, and
other sector stakeholders. The mission appreciates all support and attention given by the
borrowers and all concerned parties in Ecuador as well as in Washington, DC.

This project was selected for review as input into the planned IEG evaluation of World
Bank Group support for infrastructure. A separate PPAR is under preparation for the 4th
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project in Paraguay, which will distill lessons from
the two projects.

Following IEG practice, a copy of the draft PPAR was sent to government officials and
borrowing agencies for their review. However, no comments were received.

Summary
This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses development effectiveness
focusing on the institutional and financial aspects of the Rural and Small Towns Water
Supply and Sanitation Project (Loan 70350-EC) in Ecuador (PRAGUAS), which was the
first phase of a three-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL). PRAGUAS was approved in
2001 and closed in 2006, at a total cost of about US$45 million.

PRAGUAS combined investment in water supply and sanitation infrastructure and
technical assistance to improve the performance of key water sector institutions. At the
time of project preparation, Ecuador had rural populations with low access to water
supply and sanitation (WSS) services. Improving rural access to WSS was identified as a
government priority for the country.

Ecuador devolved the WSS service mandate for small towns and rural areas to municipal
governments in the early 1990s. Prior to PRAGUAS, a pilot project under the Second
Health and Nutrition Project tested the use of water beneficiary associations (WBA) for
the operations and maintenance (O&M) of the water systems in rural areas. This model
was scaled up under PRAGUAS. WBAs are non-profit organizations with a legal charter,
including a governing board with democratically-elected members. PRAGUAS supported
the institutional models promoting beneficiary contributions to financing investments,
creation of WBAs to operate and maintain the WSS infrastructure, and recovery of O&M
costs through user charges. Procurement of the investment contracts was managed by
municipal governments.

The project development objective for PRAGUAS was to increase WSS service coverage
and quality for beneficiaries in small towns and rural municipalities with the focus on the
poor. In addition, PRAGUAS aimed to improve water sector performance through the
application of coherent policies and the strengthening of sector institutions at the central
and local levels. The first objective of increasing WSS service coverage and quality for
beneficiaries with focus on the poor was substantially achieved. The number of
municipalities covered under the project was 109, far exceeding the target of 40 and
many of these municipalities were in poor geographical areas. The project achieved 82
percent of the access targets by increasing WSS services for about 288,000 beneficiaries
of whom 145,000 were connected to small piped water systems only, 14,000 received
sanitation facilities only (mostly flush toilets, hand washer sink and shower facilities),
and 129,000 received both water connections and sanitation facilities. While the
achievement on WSS service quality was difficult to assess since there were no baseline
data of service quality at startup, Ex Post PRAGUAS evaluation found 80 percent of the
piped systems built by the project had daily service at the time of project completion, and
20 percent had service with extreme rationing.

PRAGUAS’ second objective of reforming the sector through overhauling the sector
institutions achieved limited results. Though a new sector organization was put in place
in the central government to oversee the sub-projects, limited progress has been made in
defining key policy areas that affect the sustainability of the investments. By the end of
the project allocation of responsibilities to undertake sector investments at the national
                                             x


and sub-national levels had not been formalized, rules for asset ownership in the sector
had not been defined, and there was no consistent financing policy. The share of public
financing was, and still is, decided on an ad hoc investment-by-investment basis.
The relevance of the project’s objectives was substantial, but the relevance of the design
was modest. While a pilot project tested the demand-responsive approach, policies
related to investment responsibilities were not defined by appraisal, and the
municipalities were given the mandate to implement the investment sub-projects using an
overly complex project cycle that contributed to delays in project implementation. The
objective related to increasing WSS access was achieved, while the objective relating to
the sector reform was achieved only modestly. While there were delays in project
effectiveness and implementation, the benefits in relation to the costs are likely to be
substantial, given the high rate of return calculated at the end of the project. Putting
together the elements on relevance, efficiency, and achievement of objectives, the overall
outcome is rated moderately satisfactory.

Risk to development outcome is rated as significant because of the risks associated with
the communities’ and municipalities’ financial capacity to maintain their RWSS systems
over the longer term. In addition, the political and government ownership risk increased
significantly when the new administration cancelled a large part of the follow-on second-
phase APL. As for the Bank’s Performance, the overall rating is moderately satisfactory
because the project design was over-ambitious given the potentially politically sensitive
time period in which the project was being prepared, and poor quality of monitoring and
evaluation. The borrowers’ performance was moderately satisfactory, with shortcomings
on the government side due to the delays in sector policy formalization and
implementation of sector reforms.

Lessons

      Sector reform and the related shift in institutional culture require political
       support and time: It is important to identify the potential risks up front, to carry
       out proper stakeholder analysis, and to make a realistic projection of the time it
       takes to change the roles of the Government agencies and to devolve the WSS
       investment and O&M responsibilities to the local government or the community
       level.

      Formalization of consistent policies is critical for reform: While it may not be
       sufficient for implementation of reform, sector policies and institutional
       responsibilities need to be formalized through legal decrees and approvals by the
       Congress as a precondition for the enforcement of financial and investment
       policies, especially as the countries face political changes.

      The conventional WBA model shows stronger financial sustainability
       compared to the municipal models, in which tariffs are approved by
       municipal authorities: Long-term financial sustainability depends on whether
       the institutional arrangements for implementing cost recovery policies are sound
       and responsive to local conditions.
                                         xi


   Post construction support enhances the sustainability of community
    participatory water supply services: For the water systems to be sustainable,
    there also needs to be an institutionalized arrangement for technical assistance and
    post-construction support for continuous capacity building of WBAs.

1. Background
1.1      The water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector in Ecuador has undergone significant
institutional reforms since the early 1990s, when the Government created the Sub-Secretariat
of Water and Sanitation (Sub-secretaría de Saneamiento Ambiental, SSA) in the Ministry of
Urban Development and Housing (Ministerio de Desarrollo Urbano y Vivienda, MIDUVI).
The SSA absorbed the staff of what used to be the Ecuadorian Institute of Sanitation Works
(Instituto Ecuatoriano de Obras Sanitarias, IEOS) which was disbanded in 1992. The IEOS
had been in charge of strategic planning, policy making, implementation of investments, and
service provision in the WSS sector all over Ecuador –urban and rural-from 1965 to 1992.

1.2     At its creation, MIDUVI/SSA inherited national planning and policy-making
responsibilities from the IEOS, while the responsibility for WSS service provision was
transferred to local governments as part of decentralization reforms initiated in the early
1990s. IEOS’ WSS investment implementation functions had been left undefined and taken
over de facto by MIDUVI/SSA and the Ecuadorian Social Investment Fund, among others.
In the broader context, Ecuador had changed its constitution in 1998, which was changed
again in 2008 under the administration of President Rafael Correa. Both constitutional
changes formalized the responsibility of public services, including WSS at the local
government level.

1.3     With five presidents between 1998 and 2007,1 Ecuador was characterized by political
instability during preparation, appraisal, and implementation of the Rural and Small Towns
Water Supply and Sanitation Program (Programa Nacional de Agua y Saneamiento Rural,
PRAGUAS). The PRAGUAS project was designed amid the worsening socio-economic
crisis of the late 1990s, with GDP per capita falling, public debt increasing, and Ecuador
defaulting on its external debt payments in September 1999. According to the Bank's 1999
report "Crisis, Poverty, and Social Services in Ecuador", nationwide incidence of extreme
poverty rose from 12 percent to 17 percent between 1995 and 1998, and from 23 percent to
30 percent in rural areas. According to government figures,2 by the time of project start up,
only 39 percent of households in rural areas had access to water supply and 30 percent to
improved sanitation services.

1.4     The Adaptable Program Loan (APL) – the first phase of three planned operations --
was designed against the backdrop of Ecuador’s worsening socio-economic crisis and
specifically targeted investments to the rural areas and small towns where two thirds of the
country’s poor reside. Lessons were drawn from the US$3 million pilot project which
introduced the first demand-responsive approach in the country. This Project Performance
Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the first phase of the APL known as PRAGUAS and
also takes into account other literature and analysis related to the PRAGUAS project

2. Project Design
Development Objectives
2.1     The overall objective of the APL was to increase the coverage and effective use of
sustainable water and sanitation services in Ecuador, with a focus on the poorer populations
in rural communities and small towns. An associated objective of the program was to support
the government in the implementation of an overall WSS sector reform program, covering
both urban and rural areas.

2.2     The project development objective (PDO) in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
of the first phase of the APL, the PRAGUAS project, was: “the execution of investments for
increased WSS service coverage and quality for about 350,000 rural and small town
beneficiaries in about 40 rural municipalities as well as in about 6 municipal capitals. In
addition, the project development objective includes the improvement of sector performance
through the application of coherent policies, and the strengthening of sector institutions at the
central and local levels.” The PDO in the Loan Agreement (LA) was “to increase the
coverage and effective use of sustainable water and sanitation services with a focus on the
poorer populations in rural communities and small towns.”

2.3     The objectives in the PAD and the LA are compared in Table 2.1. Both include
coverage of WSS in their objectives. Sector performance and service quality are not included
in the LA, while effective use of WSS services and clear poverty focus are included in the
LA but not in the PAD. However, the objectives in the PAD are nevertheless broadly
consistent with those in the LA if one considers improved sector performance as evidence of
“effective use of sustainable WSS services.” Likewise, service coverage to the poor would
imply not only access to physical infrastructure, but to a minimum level of quality.
Consistent with the objectives of the LA, this PPAR will assess the following outcomes: (a)
coverage with a focus on the poor, including indicators of both access and service quality;
and (b) effective use of sustainable WSS services, with the evidence in terms of improved
sector performance (implementation of coherent policies, municipal company models with
autonomous operators, and strengthening of sector institutions at central and local levels).

2.4      The PRAGUAS project was designed as phase one of a three-phase APL operation to
improve WSS access to Ecuador’s rural population and to overhaul the WSS sector
institutions, policy and legal framework, and the investment and operation and maintenance
(O&M) practices at all government levels (Box 1). The Bank was expected to finance this
APL through three sequential loans of US$32 million, US$48 million, and US$50 million.

Box 1. Summary of PRAGUAS APL Key Targets for Each Phase
Phase 1 (2001-05): (i) 350,000 people in small towns and rural communities served by new/rehabilitated
water and/or sanitation infrastructure; (ii) policy reform initiated and SSA restructured; (iii) SSA
strengthening underway; (iv) draft sector legislation prepared; (v) service delegation models tested in at
least 8 municipalities.
Phase 2 (2005-08): (i) Policy reform deepened and new financial guidelines widely applied by other
sector financiers; (ii) institution building consolidated and expanded; (iii) about 980,000 people in small
towns and rural communities are served by new/rehabilitated water and/or sanitation infrastructure
(phase 1 + phase 2); and (iv) WSS service provision delegated in 20 small municipalities.
Phase 3 (2008-11): (i) Policy reform consolidated; (ii) improved sector efficiency, complete O&M and
investment cost recovery and widespread private sector participation in service delivery achieved; (iii) a
total of about 1.6 million additional people in small towns and rural communities are served by
new/rehabilitated water and/or sanitation infrastructure (phase 1 + phase 2 + phase 3); and (iv) WSS
service provision delegated in 50 municipalities.

Components
2.5    PRAGUAS had four project components: (1) Sector reform and institutional
development which included restructuring of SSA and policy reform, strengthening of
municipal governments, non-governmental organization (NGOs), and private WSS operators;
(2) Water and sanitation subprojects in rural areas which included promotion, community
                                              4


development, engineering designs and supervision, water and sanitation infrastructure,
community training, and hygiene education; (3) Water and sanitation sub-projects in
municipal capitals which included engineering studies and supervision and civil works; and
(4) Project Management (Table 2.2).

2.6     Under Component 1, the project intended to support far-reaching institutional reforms
at the central and local government levels and to introduce the creation of water beneficiary
associations (WBA) at the community level, locally called “juntas” in Spanish, to carry out
the O&M of WSS in the rural areas. The institutional reforms aimed at strengthening policy
and national strategic planning at the central level and responsibility for implementation of
investments at the local government level. For the long-term operational phase of
investments, the project envisioned the commercialization of water utilities in the
participating small towns and the mainstreaming of WBAs at the rural community level.

2.7     Under Component 2, the project supported water and sanitation investment
subprojects at the rural community level. These subprojects were identified by each
participating municipality covering the rural communities using participatory approaches that
incorporated stakeholders and direct beneficiaries in the decision making process of the
investments throughout the project period. To enhance beneficiary ownership of the WSS
systems, upfront contributions from the households in the case of rural schemes, and also
from municipal water utilities in the case of small towns were adopted. Beneficiary
contributions would range between 10 percent and 30 percent of the total investment costs.
The Project cycle for WSS investments included:

      1. Promotion of sub-projects at the rural community level. This involved the Project
         Management Unit (PMU), the Provincial WSS Team, the Municipal WSS Team,
         and a non-government Implementation Assistance Agency,
      2. Pre-selection of rural community sub-projects was carried out by the provincial and
         municipal WSS teams and the communities. Upon completion of this phase, a sub-
         project preparation grant agreement was signed between the SSA and the involved
         municipality,
      3. Pre-investment which involved the establishment of a WBA with help of an
         Implementation Assistance Agency and the provincial and municipal WSS teams.
         Upon completion of this phase an investment grant agreement was signed by SSA
         and the involved municipality,
      4. Investment, which involved the tendering of the project to local contractors by the
         municipal WSS team through two separate contracts for construction and
         supervision.
      5. Follow Up, which involved the collection of relevant information by municipal WSS
         team for monitoring and evaluation purposes.
2.8     Under component 3, the project intended to support delegated management models
for the commercialization of water and sanitation services of small municipalities. For doing
so, an incentive based financing policy was proposed according to which, those
municipalities that agreed to implement such delegated management models were going to
receive 100 percent grant to prepare expansion/rehabilitation projects and grant financing of

50 percent of investments needed. The balance was going to be financed by the utility’s tariff
revenues (30 percent) and by a municipal budget contribution (20 percent).

2.9      Under component 4, the project financed a PMU whose main objective was to
facilitate the work of the project implementation agencies. The project implementation
                                               6


agency for component 1 was MIDUVI/SSA; the project implementation agencies for
components 2 and 3 were the relevant municipal governments.

Implementation Arrangements
2.10 As described above, PRAGUAS was implemented by the MIDUVI/SSA through a
dedicated PMU for components 1 and 4 and small municipalities (populations less than
10,000 inhabitants) were the implementing agencies for components 2 and 3. Given that the
small municipalities had limited project implementation experience in general and no
familiarity with Bank procurement guidelines, support was provided by specialized firms
hired by SSA.

2.11 The responsibility for investments and project implementation was transferred from
MIDUVI/SSA to the municipalities under the project through provision of support for design
and implementation of WSS investments in the participating municipalities. However, this
shift was accepted only reluctantly by MIDUVI, because the MIDUVI/SSA staff was not
ready to give up their role and resisted the reform through continuing to construct water
supply schemes without ensuring financial contribution from the beneficiaries. This led to the
application of inconsistent financing policies in different parts of Ecuador, hampering the
sustainability of the sector investments in general, as described in the section on Efficacy.

3. Implementation experience
Project Costs
3.1     Actual project cost was US$45.57 million, or 91 percent of planned total cost of
US$50.25 million. The Bank loan (US$32 million) was fully disbursed, but about US$4
million was reallocated to the Rural WSS component (component 2) from the remaining
three components. The Bank’s planned financing for the Rural WSS component was US$22
million and actual financing was about US$26 million (Table 3.1). Reasons for reallocation
include:

   Strong interest of rural municipalities in participating in sanitation sub-projects – under
    component 2 - for which they were not requested to contribute any of their own cash;
   Low priority given by the Government to restructure MIDUVI/SSA (financed by
    component 1).
   Municipalities’ limited interest in getting financing from the PRAGUAS project for
    investments for which they could get financing on softer terms from other sources.
   Lower than estimated expenses incurred by the Project management unit.

3.2     Counterpart funding was expected to be about US$ 18.25 million: US$8.05 million
from municipalities and US$10.2 million from project beneficiaries. Actual contributions
from the counterparts were US$13.01 million, 71 percent of the original estimate (plus
US$0.56 million contributed by the Central Government to fill the cost overrun, Table 3.2)
due to the following.
                                                 7


      Municipal government contributed less than planned because: (i) they were more
       interested in implementing the sanitation projects, which required no counterpart
       funding; (ii) fewer than expected water systems were implemented for which
       municipalities had to contribute 20-50 percent of the project cost.

      Beneficiaries contributed less than expected because there was less demand for the
       investments which required community contribution. In some cases other entities (for
       example, NGOs and municipal governments) contributed the necessary cash on behalf
       of the communities. Beneficiary financing reported in Table 3.2 represents the US
       dollar value of labor contributions.

      The central government contributed US$0.56 million for additional spending on
       component 2 due to increased demand for sanitation facilities financed by the project.

Project Implementation
3.3     The original implementation schedule was four years and the project was expected to
be completed by October 31, 2004. The first extension was granted for 18 months to catch up
on implementation delays. These delays were due to the nine months it took to make the loan
effective, and the slow start of investments attributed to a weak capacity of municipal teams
to manage the procurement process.

3.4     The complex demand-driven project cycle which involved various agencies at the
central, provincial, and local levels, and the creation of institutions that did not exist prior to
project implementation were time consuming and led to a significant disbursement lag before
the project reached full implementation speed. It also took time to choose the right
technologies for the rural WSS systems.

3.5       Difficulties in convincing beneficiaries and municipalities to participate in a project
that required them to make 10-30 percent up-front cash contributions when other projects
where asking for nothing, also stalled the startup. By the mid-term review in September
2001, the Bank project team and its counterparts in Ecuador had outlined ways to overcome
these difficulties, including: (i) the option for the municipalities to contract out the integrated
subproject design and supervision to experienced regional contractors, (ii) the option for the
municipalities to use a trust-fund (fideicomiso) to contribute to the sub-project co-financing;
and (iii) in the rural areas/WBAs reduction of up-front beneficiary contribution to the capital
costs from 10 percent to 5 percent. Implementation sped up shortly thereafter as evidenced
from the increase in annual disbursement from $1.9-$3.8 million in FY02-03 to $7.1-$11.3
million in FY04-05, after the mid-term review.

3.6     The second extension of six months was granted to enable overlap with the second
phase of the APL, in particular to allow for the uninterrupted financing of the core project
staff. The project closed on October 31, 2006.

Fiduciary
3.7     Overall project financial management performance was poor due to shortcomings
related to: (i) limited financial management capacity of municipal governments that
prevented them to furnish timely financial reports; (ii) lack of systematic information
regarding cash contributions of local communities and other stakeholders; (iii) lack of a
systematized monitoring process of transfers made to municipalities; and (iv) delays in the
submission of timely support documentation.

Safeguards
3.8    The environmental category of PRAGUAS was B (Partial Assessment). Given the
small scale of the WSS investments implemented in the rural areas and small towns, no
major issues were reported. Minor environmental impacts, including proper disposal of
construction wastes and erosion control, were addressed by appropriate guidelines that were
incorporated in the technical specifications governing the work of construction contractors.
                                           9


Appropriate environmental screening criteria for WSS sub-projects were incorporated in the
project evaluation manual.

3.9     As for the social aspects, proper social assessment was carried out according to the
Bank guidelines. PRAGUAS created special mechanisms to include indigenous people, since
about 40 percent of the potential beneficiaries self-identified as indigenous people of
Ecuador. Technical options in indigenous languages or interpreters were available for this
group. The backbone of the project was community participation and stakeholder
consultation in WSS investments, and there were no adverse effects experienced with regards
to social safeguards aspects.

4. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.1   IEG assesses the quality of M&E negligible because of no baseline information, little
implementation, and no utilization of the M&E system.

Design
4.2     Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) was to be done by SSA with the support of
qualified consultants. In each province, the provincial project units (EPPs) and in each
Municipality, the Sanitation Municipal Teams (EMS) were expected to track PRAGUAS
program communities for a period of three years after water supply and sanitation systems
had gone into operation. This would include following-up on the social indicators and the
effectiveness of financial and operational arrangements.

4.3    This M&E framework would consist of three information systems:

     The Management Information System (MIS) designed to track contracts and financial
      flows associated with the PRAGUAS project as well as other indicators that track the
      performance in project implementation;
     The Social Impact Information System (SIIS) designed to capture the baseline surveys
      information undertaken in communities where PRAGUAS intervened;
     The Integrated Water, Sanitation, Sewerage and Solid Waste Monitoring System
      designed to capture the operational and financial performance of water service
      providers in the country. It was designed as a comprehensive sector information
      system that would benchmark performance of municipal water companies, whether or
      not they participated in the project.

Implementation
4.4     The PMU was responsible for the implementation of the MIS and SIIS systems,
however, these systems were never developed according to the initial plans and there was no
working MIS to provide management with information related to project outputs and
financial flows. A major reason for this shortcoming was that the PMU never took full
responsibility for approvals of investments under the PRAGUAS project and was not
obligated to implement the MIS. Approvals were done by the Budget Directorate (under
MIDUVI) and there was no real linkage between the two units. An Institutional Assessment
                                              10


of PRAGUAS stated in 2005 that PRAGUAS did not actually have a proper project
management unit and recommended that a PMU for PRAGUAS be established with full
responsibility for all activities, including budget approvals and financial management
(Guerra-Garcia Picasso 2005). Without an MIS, PRAGUAS overcommitted financial
resources for studies for basic sanitation units. As a result, the last PMU director had to
handle the management of such overcommitted financial obligations. SIIS was not
implemented as expected either; records – electronic or hard copies – regarding baseline
information requested by the IEG mission during the visit to Quito were not available at
MIDUVI. The early closing of the follow-on APL II project and its PMU could also explain
the lack of available information on the first Phase APL.

4.5     As for the Integrated Water, Sanitation, Sewerage, and Solid Waste Monitoring
System, SSA/MIDUVI has been unable to make it a part of its daily routine as the focus was
more on project implementation. Investment project implementation could have been used as
a leverage to introduce the Integrated Water, Sanitation, Sewerage and Solid Waste
Monitoring System rather than to introduce it in parallel to project implementation activities.

4.6      The M&E system, as it was envisaged at appraisal, was never put in place during the
life of the project. In relation to SIIS, the impact evaluation undertaken at the end of the
project, which included a survey on a sample of 1752 households in 72 communities,
reported that the baseline information for many communities did not exist in the case of
water services (Quintero-Rojas-Duenas 2006).

4.7     In relation to the Integrated Water, Sanitation, Sewerage and Solid Waste Monitoring
System, none of the municipalities visited by the IEG mission had any M&E systems to track
water and sanitation indicators in their rural areas. Staff working at both MIDUVI/SSA and
at the PRAGUAS project gave the following reasons for the poor implementation of the
M&E system: (i) cumbersome design of the data entry formats for feeding information into
the Integrated Water, Sanitation, Sewerage and Solid Waste Monitoring System databases
which produced user unfriendly reports; (ii) insufficient data cleaning mechanisms; and (iii)
lack of incentives to use information systems properly. For example, on the last point, there
was no financing for activities related to the generation and proper use of information
produced by the Integrated Water, Sanitation, Sewerage and Solid Waste Monitoring System.

Utilization
4.8    Because of the identified issues, appropriate data were not evaluated and used for
informed decision-making and resource allocation. In practice, contract data, for example,
were managed using an EXCEL spreadsheet in parallel to official information systems.

5. Relevance
Relevance of Objectives
5.1     Relevance of project objectives was Substantial. Project objectives were consistent
with the priorities of both the most recent country assistance strategy (CAS) covering the
period 2003-20073 and the CAS at the time of project preparation (March 1996), which
considered water supply and sanitation as key services through which to improve rural
welfare and alleviate poverty. At project appraisal, access to water supply and sanitation
services in rural Ecuador was among the lowest in Latin America; only 39 percent of rural
households had access to safe drinking water and 30 percent had access to improved
sanitation. Improving the WSS access to the lower income population was identified as one
of the important tasks for the country.

5.2     Project objectives were also consistent with the April 2003 CAS’s focus of
strengthening governance. The Water and Sanitation Sub-Secretariat (SSA) at the Ministry of
Urban Development and Housing (MIDUVI), was the central government agency in charge
of sector policy, planning and institutional development functions but its capacity was
limited and required strengthening. By devolving the implementation of WSS service
delivery from the central government to the municipalities who are closer to the consumers,
the project aimed to improving social accountability and governance frameworks.

5.3     Project objectives are still relevant at present. At the time of the IEG mission in
December 2010, institutional and policy changes were taking place under a new constitution
approved in 2008. Before embarking on the actual decentralization of investment functions,
the government is intending to put in place minimum accounting, budgeting, reporting, and
control standards. Also, under the umbrella of a new decentralization law, Código Orgánico
de Organización Territorial, Autonomía y Descentralización, the National Secretary of
Planning and Development (SENPLADES), along with the Ministry of Finance, are
redefining investment planning, implementation, and budget allocation responsibilities, and
the roles of various sector ministries and the governments at all levels. MIDUVI/SSA has
proposed to decentralize its core functions to eight regions. The current government has also
given high priority to improvements in access to WSS services by the poor.4

Relevance of Design
5.4     Relevance of project design was Modest. Use of the Adaptable Program Loan
(APL) as the lending instrument was well suited to a progressive process of major reforms,
one after the other, over the medium and long term. If the key triggers had been realistic and
achievable, and proper performance incentives had been in place, the triggers would have
been achieved by the country and the sustainability of the program would have been better
assured.

5.5     The sector reform and institutional development component in PRAGUAS contained
a large part of the reform elements which included the formulation of the sector policies and
norms as well as the preparation of new water and sanitation sector law. While the
components were relevant for achieving the overall objectives, key elements of reforms
supported by PRAGUAS were too complex and ambitious given the limited project time
frame in a potentially politically sensitive period. For example, transferring the responsibility
of implementing the WSS investments to the municipal level was premature as the
decentralization of national public financial management was not even taking place in
Ecuador during project preparation. In addition, choosing the municipalities to be the
implementing agencies of the investment components 2 and 3 delayed the implementation of
the sub-projects because the project design overestimated the municipalities’ capacity to
acquire the skills to undertake procurement according to Bank guidelines in a speedy manner.

5.6     The project design adopted a demand-driven investment approach, with paramount
importance placed on the participation of small municipal governments following beneficiary
consultations. However, rules for sub-project investments were overly complex5 and relied
on very weak implementing agencies (i.e., small municipalities) who took a long time to
familiarize themselves with World Bank procurement guidelines. Given the weak capacity
and heavy political influence that the municipalities faced, the relevance of the
implementation arrangements was modest.

6. Efficacy
6.1    The project performance indicators proposed in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD), along with their original targets and achievements at project completion are shown in
Table 6.1. Data to track progress in achieving the objectives was not produced by the project
on a systematic basis due to the weakness of the M&E system. The data presented in this




5
  The rules for sub-projects were: (i) Provincial Water and Sanitation Teams (EPPs) prioritize and select the
participating municipalities; (ii) selected municipalities set up a special water and sanitation team (EMS) which
prepare a list of rural communities that will participate; (iii) EMS and EPP pre-select subproject communities;
(iv) municipalities sign a preparation grant agreement with SSA; (v) EMS contracts out promotion support from
local private sector using the grant; (vi) private contractors prepare preliminary designs for communities, select
best technical alternative, and do final design while collecting financial contributions from the communities;
(vii) municipal government sign an investment grant agreement with SSA; (viii) EMS contracts out construction
companies and supervise them.

Increased WSS Coverage with a Focus on the Rural Poor
6.3     The PAD proposed proxy indicators for coverage which were the “number of
beneficiaries” and “the number of rural municipalities” benefiting from the project. The
project activities, especially those under the component on the water and sanitation
subprojects, have resulted in the following results.
                                                      14


ACCESS

6.4      According to MIDUVI the project increased water and sanitation services for about
288,000 beneficiaries, of whom 145,000 were connected to small piped water systems only,
14,000 received sanitation facilities only (mostly flush toilets, hand washer sink and shower
facilities), and 129,000 received both water connections and sanitation facilities. The target
number of beneficiaries was 350,000; the project achieved about 82 percent of this target.6

6.5     Since there was no baseline provided in the project documents, IEG used the 2000
and 2008 service coverage data collected by WHO/UNICEF (2010) to assess the
achievement to date. Nationally, the share of the rural population with access to water rose
from 78 to 88 percent between 2000 and 2008, a 10 percentage point increase over a period
broadly corresponding to the project implementation period. This corresponds to an
estimated 316,400 people who have gained rural water supply access; the number of project
water supply beneficiaries (274,000) corresponds to 87 percent of this increase (or about 9
percentage points nationally). The share of the rural population with access to sanitation rose
from 70 to 84 percent over this same period; the 14 percentage point increase corresponds to
an estimated increase of 515,200 people to have gained rural sanitation access. The number
of project beneficiaries who gained access to sanitation was 143,000 -- about a quarter (28
percent) of the total increase, or 3½ percentage points nationally. While some of the 274,000
and 143,000 project beneficiaries may have gained “improved” access rather than “new”
access, it is likely that the project has largely contributed to the improvements in the sector.
This outcome is therefore substantially achieved. According to MIDUVI, three years after
project completion, it is estimated that 80 percent of systems provide continuous (24
hours/day, seven days/week).

6.6     PRAGUAS reached 109 municipalities for the rural sub-projects, exceeding the target
of 40, with many of the additional municipalities located in the poorest provinces (Cotopaxi,
Chimborazo, and Bolivar) that were not in the original list. This target was therefore also
substantially met. While reaching a larger than planned number of municipalities is
remarkable, in reality this was the result of municipalities’ lower than expected financial
capacity and interest to participate in the project. Because the original 40 municipalities
could not provide sufficient counterpart funding due to budget limitations for the sub-
projects, PRAGUAS reached out to additional municipalities and encouraged them to
participate. The objective of increasing the access to WSS is rated as substantial.

QUALITY OF SERVICES

6.7     Indicators for tracking quality of service were not proposed in the PAD. The PPAR
has taken the indicators used in the Ex-Post PRAGUAS Evaluation Report prepared by
Quintero-Rojas-Duenas. For assessing the quality of service, daily frequency of service and
treatment to make water potable are used. Based on a sample of 1,752 households in 72
communities, the Ex Post PRAGUAS evaluation found 80 percent of the piped systems built

6
  The ICR report shows a 417,000 as number of beneficiaries; but this number includes double accounting of
129,000 beneficiaries that received both water and sanitation services; i.e., 288,000 + 129,000 = 417,000. The
targets were not set separately for water supply and sanitation.
                                                15


by PRAGUAS had daily service at the time of project completion, and 20 percent had service
with extreme rationing. Departments where the service is rationed include Manabi (where the
majority of systems were built) and Cotopaxi (Box 2). The beneficiary survey also reported
that insufficient attention was given by the WBAs to water quality. In many systems, proper
disinfection procedure was not followed, resulting in insufficient chlorine residuals in the
network. In a few cases, a poor choice of surface water source (prone to contamination or
high in turbidity) resulted in high costs of disinfection. There was no assessment of water
sources or planning/budgeting for protection of water sources in the majority of projects
assessed.

6.8     Since general WSS coverage in the rural population of Ecuador was low prior to the
project, there is some indication that the beneficiaries who are connected to water supply
networks under PRAGUAS have improved water quality. However, access to water alone
would not indicate quality service because quality could be affected by many factors,
including the intermittent supply and contamination of the water source, for which data were
not available.

6.9     PRAGUAS implemented flush toilets in rural households which might have
contributed to higher quality of sanitation service; however, indicators along with a baseline
and a comparison group to measure the functioning and use of sanitation services, changes in
hygiene behavior, and health impact on the development outcome were not available at the
time of the evaluation.

6.10     The efficacy of improving the quality of WSS is therefore rated as modest.

Box 2. Service Quality in PRAGUAS Sub-projects

In general, 88 percent of the population with water connections supported by PRAGUAS has daily
service. However, in Cotopaxi and Manabí, frequency of service is once a week for 23 percent and 44
percent of the population in the project areas, respectively.
(Source: Quintero-Rojas-Duenas 2006, Page 17)

The IEG mission visited 15 rural communities that benefited from PRAGUAS. Based on the
information collected from the beneficiaries, the findings of the ex post review were confirmed: 80
percent of visited systems have 24 hours of service per day, seven days a week, with good pressure;
20 percent were not functioning at the time of the visit, but were reported to work on a limited
schedule (some hours during the day). 10 percent of water systems reported some levels of turbidity
during times of heavy rains, which is low.


FOCUS ON THE POOR

6.11 According to the LA the focus would be on the poorer populations in rural
communities and small towns, and the PAD stated that the project targeted the municipalities
with low service coverage rates, high poverty indicators, and a high community demand for
improved services. PRAGUAS reached 109 municipalities (of 219 in total in Ecuador) for
the rural sub-projects, exceeding the target of 40, with many of the additional municipalities
located in the poorest provinces (Cotopaxi, Chimborazo, and Bolivar) that were not in the
original list. Results of the survey carried out during project preparation showed that nearly
                                                       16


100 percent of the potential direct beneficiaries lived below the World Bank’s estimated
poverty line.7 The achievement of this sub-objective is therefore rated as substantial.

Increase in the Effective Use of Sustainable WSS
6.12 The increase in effective use of sustainable WSS services was to be achieved by
improved sector performance, through the application of coherent policies and the
strengthening of sector institutions at the central and local levels. This PPAR will assess the
achievement of the objective through analyzing the three areas that characterize effectiveness
of the sector, proposed by PRAGUAS; (i) coherent policies8 in the areas of investment
financing and cost recovery, (ii) municipal company models with autonomous operators; (iii)
strengthened sector institutions at the central level; and (iv) strengthened sector institutions at
the local level.

COHERENT APPLICATION OF SECTOR POLICIES

6.13 Investment Financing Policy: By the end of PRAGUAS, only 30 percent of the
sector investments complied with PRAGUAS financial policy (summarized in Table 6.3) and
therefore it didn’t achieve the 90 percent target.

6.14 In the small towns, the proposed financing policy has not been implemented as
expected, mainly because of Municipal governments’ poor financial capacity and reluctance
to increase tariffs to generate funds for investments.

6.15 In rural areas, PRAGUAS financing policy was difficult to implement because of the
low ability of the beneficiaries to contribute 10 percent of investment costs. According to the
Ex-Post Evaluation of the PRAGUAS Project, the proportion of families that contributed
cash to the financing of water supply projects varied across provinces from 8 percent to 90
percent.9 The amount of cash contributed by family was also highly variable,
fromUS$12/family (about 1.7 percent of the average US$700 investment cost per
connection) to US$70/family.

6.16 At present PRAGUAS financial policy is not implemented officially by the
government or any donor agency. The WSS investments in the urban perimeter of the
municipalities are funded by a combination of central government grants and municipalities’
budget contributions without beneficiary contributions. In rural areas, WSS financing

6.17 The ICR stated that PRAGUAS played an important role in establishing the rules for
allocating Special Consumption Tax (ICE tax) revenues to the water utilities for funding their
O&M and other costs. The financial policy governing the use of the ICE tax for WSS was
formally adopted by Presidential Decree in February 2005. However, at the time of this
review, the ICE tax for WSS was being phased out and there was no consistent financial
policy for the sector.

The impact of these activities on the project requirement principles which is to cover 100 percent
outcome, however, is difficult to assess         of O&M costs. This principle is followed by most
because there are no clear causal linkages       WBAs that have benefited from the PRAGUAS
with the project’s intended outcome. Most        project.
WBAs have implemented a 100 percent O&M cost recovery policy over the project period
and up to the time of the IEG evaluation. PRAGUAS promoted such cost recovery, including
procedures to set tariffs to cover O&M costs (See Box 3 and Table 6.4). The WBA model
raised the beneficiaries’ understanding of their rights and obligations as well as the rules for
their WBA organizations. The application of cost recovery policies in the areas of
PRAGUAS intervention resulted in an average household water bill of about US$21 per year
and an average consumption of 70 liters per capita per day (lpcd). Both the average bill
(equivalent to about US$1.5 per month) and the consumption per capita are consistent with
the population’s ability to pay and the 60 lpcd minimum consumption set by the World
Health Organization. According to the Ex Post Evaluation report, by the end of project
completion 85 percent of WBAs collected enough funding for O&M through tariff revenues,
which gives high confidence to the finding of the IEG mission.

6.19 Good O&M cost recovery has translated into proper O&M, and this is evidenced by
the IEG mission which did not find any major issues with the physical sustainability of the

WSS schemes constructed under the project. This practice is likely to extend the life of the
assets and reduce the investment costs in the future.

6.20 For the municipal WSS companies, O&M cost recovery was about 50 percent on
average at the time of project completion. The major reason for municipal utilities failing to
achieve cost recovery is the resistance of municipal councils to approve tariff increases (to
avoid political costs). In Ecuador, at present, tariff approval authority rests with the
municipal council which considers water as a social service. Municipal council members
often run their campaigns offering water for free.

6.21 Overall, the objective was modestly achieved because the key sector policies have
not been implemented in Ecuador in a coherent and consistent manner.

MUNICIPAL COMPANY MODELS WITH AUTONOMOUS OPERATORS

6.22 The PRAGUAS project provided technical assistance and financial incentives to
municipalities interested in delegating their WSS services to autonomous (public, private,
cooperative etc.) operators. Out of the eight municipalities that received such incentive
packages, six chose the autonomous municipality-owned company model,10 one chose to be a
cooperative owned by beneficiaries, and one chose to be a mixed shareholding company (49
percent of shares held by customers and 51 percent by the municipality). The autonomous
municipal company delivers the services and carries O&M of infrastructure financed by a
combination of tariff revenues and recurrent transfers from municipal governments. The
municipal companies work on annual operating plans and report to their Board of Directors
appointed by the municipal councils. The mixed shareholding company and the cooperative
models, on the other hand operate more independently from the municipalities based on
commercial principles, according to 10 year performance contracts, and reporting to the
Board of Directors appointed by the shareholders. However, in all types of municipal
companies, tariffs approved by the municipal councils are typically not sufficient to cover the

10
  The ICR reports that at the time of project closure, out of 219 municipalities nationwide, 28 had adopted
municipal company model, against a target of 6, but IEG assesses that this good result cannot be fully attributed
to the success of the PRAGUAS project because only eight utilities received the incentive packages to
undertake their transformation. The eight utilities that received investment financing from the project as
condition to implement a form of municipal company model. The municipal utilities were: Caluma, Cayambe,
Echeandia, Guaranda, Pedro Moncayo, Pujili, and Riobamba.
                                                  19


O&M costs. In all cases, investments have been financed by a combination of central
government grant funding and limited municipal government contribution.

6.23 The objective of implementing municipal company models is modestly achieved
because they are unlikely to be financially sustainable.

STRENGTHENING OF SECTOR INSTITUTIONS AT THE CENTRAL LEVEL

6.24 PRAGUAS envisaged reorganizing the Sub-Secretariat of Water and Sanitation
(SSA) with full staffing structure, training, and portfolio of services in place in accordance
with the restructuring plan. However, only limited progress was achieved.

6.25 The Sub-Secretariat of Water and Sanitation has been replaced by the Sub-Secretariat
for Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste Management (SSA, same acronym for simplicity) and
a directorate of Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste Management has been created.

6.26 Although SSA prepared a new Water and Sanitation Sector Policy in 2002, 11
achieving consensus to implement such policy proved to be challenging. There was limited
progress in defining and implementing other key policy areas to improve overall sector
performance as well. To this day, there is no clear policy for the regulatory framework,
allocation of responsibilities for undertaking sector investments at the national and sub-
national levels, and rules for asset ownership in the sector. This objective is therefore
modestly achieved.

STRENGTHENING OF SECTOR INSTITUTIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

6.27 The project supported the capacity enhancement of municipal government, NGOs,
and the private WSS operators. As described above, PRAGUAS reached 109 municipalities
for the rural sub-projects, exceeding the target of 40. All 108 municipalities were
strengthened to oversee service provision in their jurisdiction and 28 delegated service
provision to an autonomous operator.

6.28 To build the capacity of the private sector and NGOs, PRAGUAS envisaged
increasing the capacity of at least 50 local implementation organizers through training and
certifications. By the end of the project, the target was exceeded four-fold and 206 local
implementation organizers had been trained by two large engineering and social consulting
firms. However, it is not known the extent to which this contributed to the performance of the
autonomous municipal models or the functioning of the WBAs. Overall, this objective is
substantially achieved.

7. Efficiency
7.1    The ex-ante economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated based on a sample of
19 sub-projects implemented during preparation, with an average ERRs of 28 percent
within a range of 13.6 to 54.1 percent. Average net present value (NPV) at appraisal was
US$35,543.

7.2         The Implementation Completion and Results Report’s ex-post ERR was
calculated for a sample of 28 sub-projects chosen randomly, including all relevant
technologies and located in all regions (Coastal, Mountains, and Jungle). Based on this
sample, the ICR estimates a 31 percent average ERR and an average NPV US$ 109,724,
both higher than those estimated at appraisal. And based on this estimates, the ICR
extrapolates to conclude that the NPV for the project is US$60.6 million. This sample,
however, represents only about 5 percent of the total number of schemes implemented
and therefore the characteristics of the water schemes in the 28 sub-projects may not be
generalized for the whole project. As the number of beneficiaries (288,152) served by the
project was lower than the number of beneficiaries estimated at appraisal (355,000), the
per beneficiary costs ended up being higher than those estimated at appraisal and this
would result in lower ERR and NPV.

7.3 Another factor that affects the efficiency is the time it took to implement the project.
With effectiveness delays and the two extensions the project took almost a year and a half
longer to complete, while the objectives and the target performance indicators remained
the same. On balance, however, IEG assesses that the benefits exceed the costs associated
with the project and therefore rates the efficiency of the project as substantial.

8. Outcome
8.1 The outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. Relevance of the objectives is
rated substantial and relevance of design is rated modest. Efficiency is rated substantial.
While the objective related to increasing WSS coverage with focus on the poor has
substantially been achieved, the key objective related to the reform aspects of the project
that ensure sustainability of the investments has only been achieved modestly.

9. Risk to Development Outcome
9.1 The risk to development outcome is Significant. Critical risks related to the
challenging sector reform elements, including the weak capacity of the municipalities and
the WBAs to carry out the investments and MIDUVI to take ownership of SSA
restructuring were identified, but the associated risk mitigating measures proposed in the
PAD were not sufficient. Many risks remained high even five years after project closure.
In this PPAR, financial, O&M, Institutional, and Political/Government Ownership risks
were identified to be the main risks to development outcomes.

    Financial risk – While the rural communities are achieving their O&M cost
     recovery, in small towns the tariff revenues cover only 50 percent of O&M costs.
                                         21


      This indicates the high uncertainty about the financial sustainability of the water
      supply schemes constructed under the project. In the absence of external regulatory
      control, proper incentives, and other measures to set proper tariffs, and collect
      revenues, the financial risk would continue to be high. The discontinuation of ICE
      tax also decreases the predictable financing for investments in the water sector.
      Financial risk is therefore rated significant.

     O&M risk – In both small towns and in rural areas, there is no institutionalized
      oversight function that ensures adequate maintenance of public infrastructure assets,
      introducing the risk of rapid infrastructure asset deterioration or malfunctions due to
      lack of maintenance, even if funding may be available. During the life of project,
      municipalities were supposed to play the role of external oversight of WBAs, but
      this does not have the force of law. O&M risk is therefore rated significant.

     Institutional risk – During the life of the project and up to the present time the water
      and sanitation sector (including rural and small towns) has worked under an
      uncertain legal and institutional framework. Until a new sector law is passed, the
      sector will continue facing legal uncertainty working under the old laws. The
      institutional risk is rated significant.

     Political / Government Ownership risks – Small town water utilities, and to a lesser
      extent WBAs’ Boards are vulnerable to political changes. In addition to the utility
      level risks, there are higher political risks at the country level which the three-
      phased water sector APL has suffered from. For example, during six years of the
      project, Ecuador had four Presidents, eight Ministers of Urban Development and
      Housing, and eight Subsecretaries of the Subsecretariat for WSS and Solid Waste.
      This caused difficulties and delays in project implementation. The political changes
      have affected the sector program as the new Administration cancelled a large
      portion of the loan in the second phase APL which resulted in an early closing of
      the project. While there is an indication that the sector may be getting ready for the
      intended reforms, the uncertainties faced by the political risk remains significant.

10. Bank Performance
10.1 Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Quality at entry and quality
of supervision are assessed below.

Quality at Entry
10.2 Quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank team learned from the
US$3 million pilot project where the first demand responsive approach was introduced in
the country, and designed PRAGUAS based on the lessons and Bank experience from
other community-driven development projects. The lessons include the importance of
involving the communities to ensure sustainability, building the capacity, and appropriate
legal framework. The project objective has been relevant throughout the implementation
period, and the project included innovative service delivery models given the country
context. The choice of an APL recognized the time needed to achieve meaningful
                                            22


reforms. While the PAD reckoned the required reform elements for PRAGUAS to be
modest, the assumption that the first phase of the APL and the related activities could be
implemented in 4 years may have been too ambitious especially in a potentially politically
sensitive time period. This is because the degree of reform required was significant, the
capacity of the municipalities was very weak to begin with, and the demand-driven project
cycle was complex and time-consuming. Delays in the reform component could have been
mitigated if the key elements in the institutional and financial policies, such as the
investment responsibilities were formalized prior to project initiation. Given that so many
time-bound indicators were set at appraisal, no proper arrangements were made to collect
data or to monitor them at the central government level. The project paid sufficient
attention to the economic analysis, but financial and affordability analysis to ensure the
viability of the cost recovery policies were not carried out.

Quality of Supervision
10.3 Quality of supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. A dedicated Bank team
enabled the project to partially succeed in an unfavorable political environment. This
entailed a continuous process of repeatedly briefing and motivating the ever-changing
government leaders the project had to work with. It also meant standing firmly against
political pressures to change key community-driven development implementation features
of the project. The Bank team was technically strong. However, the collection of the
baseline data was not done systematically, and the M&E was not implemented. The poor
project M&E hampered the achievement of the outcomes.

11. Borrower Performance
11.1 Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Government
performance and implementing agency performance have been assessed below.

Government Performance
11.2 Government performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Government
performance varied widely over time. During project preparation, support was generally
good; a strong preparation team was appointed, and the new community mobilization
approach was tested. However, performance was less forthcoming during project
implementation; a period of political turmoil, characterized by a rapid turnover of political
appointees caused great fluctuations in commitment. Also, implementation decisions were
often delayed, the SSA restructuring proceeded slowly, and there were frequent pressures
by politicians to reduce the counterpart contributions of municipalities and communities.
Without the Bank's strong advocacy role during this period, the project might well have
failed. Nevertheless, performance picked up towards the end of the project.

Implementing Agency Performance
11.3 Implementing agency performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The PMU
was committed and strongly staffed. Multi-year contracts provided continuity and shielded
the staff from the political turbulence affecting government's performance. High technical
                                            23


  and executive competence enabled strong support for the municipalities and acted as a
  buffer against the political volatility during implementation. The continuity and technical
  performance of PMU staff was the most important determinant in allowing a complex
  demand-driven project with a long gestation period to succeed. However, monitoring and
  evaluation and general reporting systems were weak.

11.4 Municipalities were also the implementing agencies for the project as they
implemented the sub-projects carried out under the rural and municipal WSS components.
Local municipalities’ weak budget and financing management capacity constituted a major
obstacle to their participation as effective implementing agencies.

12. Lessons
Sector reform and the related shift in institutional culture require political support and
time.

12.1 It is important to identify the potential risks up front, to carry out proper stakeholder
analysis, and to make a realistic projection of the time it takes to change the roles of the
Government agencies and to devolve the WSS investment and O&M responsibilities to the
local government or the community level.

12.2 Ecuador attempted to achieve the difficult reform objective of shifting investment
responsibility from the central government level to the municipal government level during
the first phase of the APL in a five-year time period. The reforms were particularly difficult
because the institutional culture of the Ecuadorian Institute of Sanitary Works (Instituto
Ecuatoriano de Obras Sanitarias), a central government agency that controlled the water
sector for almost 30 years, was still dominant at the time of the project, although its
responsibilities had been transferred to the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing
(Ministerio de Desarrollo Urbano y Vivienda, MIDUVI)/ Subsecretariat of Environmental
Sanitation (Sub-secretaría de Saneamiento Ambiental, SSA). The new organization under
MIDUVI/SSA was established eight years before the project was approved, but the WBA
model under the jurisdiction of municipal governments was introduced by PRAGUAS. The
project’s overly ambitious reform agenda aimed to establish 588 WBAs in the first phase of
the APL at the same time as building the capacity of the municipalities to implement the
investments.

Formalization of consistent policies is critical for reform

12.3 While it may not be sufficient for implementation of reform, sector policies and
institutional responsibilities need to be formalized through legal decrees and approvals by the
Congress as a precondition for the enforcement of financial and investment policies,
especially as the countries face political changes. In Ecuador, the main elements of the
institutional and financial policies were not formalized prior to project initiation. Instead,
arrangements were agreed to on an investment-by-investment basis, sending mixed signals
and incentives to communities and reducing the incentives for community contributions.
While PRAGUAS required community contributions to investment financing, other projects
led by the government provided new rural WSS systems for free. Lack of formal sector
                                              24


policies has caused the ad hoc approaches to community participation in WSS investments
and undermined the importance of community ownership through beneficiary contributions.
This has hampered the sustainability of WSS sector investments.

The conventional WBA model shows stronger financial sustainability compared to the
municipal models, in which tariffs are approved by municipal authorities

12.4 The physical sustainability of the investments depends not only on the level of cost
recovery from operations and maintenance, but on other factors such as the capacity and
incentives of the service providers to carry out proper maintenance. However, long-term
financial sustainability depends on whether the institutional arrangements for implementing
cost recovery policies are sound and responsive to local conditions. In Ecuador’s municipal
company models, in which private sector operators are paid for their services out of tariff
revenues, cost recovery is self-enforced, provided tariffs are set according to the cost
recovery rules. This is because the contractual obligations with the PSOs include clauses
related to tariff adjustments to compensate for cost increases. However, water utilities in
these small towns are experiencing difficulties recovering operations and maintenance costs,
as the tariffs are typically set too low. The municipalities’ Boards of Directors include local
politicians who see water supply as a public service that ought to be free. They believe that
general municipal revenues will be used to cover any deficits resulting from low tariff
revenues. In rural areas, WBAs won’t be able to operate and maintain their water supply
schemes if they do not collect sufficient tariff revenues. Knowing that cost recovery can help
avoid service interruption, local rural communities in both countries seem to be disposed
toward paying the necessary tariffs.

Post construction support enhances the sustainability of community participatory water
supply services

12.5 Demand-responsive, community participatory water supply services are key to ensure
successful implementation of the rural areas and small towns. For the water systems to be
sustainable, there also needs to be an institutionalized arrangement for technical assistance
and post-construction support for continuous capacity building of WBAs. The WBAs in
Ecuador that do not have such institutionalized systems for support are experiencing
sustainability issues, as the systems cannot be easily repaired or replaced by the WBAs and
the communities themselves

13. Epilogue
13.1 There were two triggers each for the APL Phase II in the areas of Policy Reform and
Institution Building, and one trigger for the investment program. The progress on these
triggers at the time of the PPAR is summarized in Table 12.1. IEG assesses that while the
physical investments have been completed and the institution-building is making progress,
policy reform is lagging behind.

13.2 In July 2006, three months before the closing of PRAGUAS, the follow-on
PRAGUAS II (the APL Phase II) was approved by the Board. The second Phase of the APL
was planned to continue supporting the Government with its reform process; however, the
                                                              25


change in the central government in 2007 brought in a new administration with concerns over
some of the PRAGUAS activities, including the organization of a national hand-washing
campaign and the provision of technical assistance for policy discussions.

13.3 In January 2008 the Government decided to cancel US$36 million of the total
PRAGUAS II loan amount of US$48 million. The remaining US$12 million was used to
complete the ongoing activities and commitments. The project eventually closed in March
2009, two years before its original completion date. All steps made in terms of sector reforms
came to a halt by the time the APL Phase II closed.

13.4 According to the ICR for the second APL, the Government failed to recognize the
growing disconnect between the technical work carried out by the PMU and its own policies
and strategies. The decision to dismiss high and intermediate level staff of the PMU that had
been hired through independent, competitive processes and the subsequent weaknesses due to
the high turnover in key personnel and the lack of key staff to perform project planning and
implementation activities, severely affected project implementation after December 2007.

With a new constitution approved in 2008, the National Secretary of Planning and
Development (SENPLADES) along with the Ministry of Finance is currently redefining
investment planning, implementation and budget allocation responsibilities, and the roles to
                                              26


be played by various sector ministries and at all government levels. In February 2010
MIDUVI reformed its Internal Processes Code, reaffirming the role of SSA to define the
sector policy, carry out national strategic planning, and define the technical standards for
WSS service provision. SSA has also been mandated to define norms related to control and
regulatory framework in the WSS sector in Ecuador. MIDUVI/SSA also proposed to
decentralize its core functions to eight regions
