innovative quality, and cost-effective\n            social, and communal services, as per the following\n            components. First, access to basic social, and communal\n            services will be provided to improve living conditions of\n            the target population, by empowering communities, and\n            vulnerable groups in decision-making processes, and informed\n            social services policies. This will be achieved through the\n            financing of community-based services micro-projects, and\n            targeted social-care services micro-projects. Second,\n            assistance to the Government in social protection reform\n            will be provided, particularly, for the preparation of a\n            social care reform strategy. This will be achieved by\n            strengthening the ministries of Labor and Social Policy\n            (MLSP), and of Finance (MOF) capacity to formulate, monitor,\n            and evaluate social care services policies, including the\n            definition, and implementation of social care service\n            financing, and contracting systems. Similarly, the regional\n            authorities' capacity will also be strengthened, which\n            should include professional training of social workers.\n            Third, project management, and monitoring and evaluation,\n            should ensure the efficient implementation of the project,\n            through institutional support to the Ukrainian Social\n            Investment Fund (USIF) Executive Office."}, "docdt": "2001-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
