Ukraine were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a) try to\n            maintain Bank staff continuity during project design and\n            implementation to avoid the loss of institutional memory and\n            to maintain a close relationship with the client; b) do not\n            include policy components in investment projects carried out\n            by one agency which are the responsibility of other\n            agencies; c) ensure early, realistic, and professional\n            arrangements for impact evaluation; d) do not underestimate\n            the need for early, substantial, and quality beneficiary\n            community and agency training; e) even in quite traditional\n            and centralized government systems, community-based micro\n            project processing leads to community confidence building\n            and, thus, more successful and sustainable outputs; f)\n            purely technical agencies such as Ukraine Social Investment\n            Fund (USIF) can play a useful role as inter-agency\n            coordinators, but policy implementation is then up to the\n            responsible line agencies; and g) delivery capacities for\n            social services such as USIF are always relevant but they\n            should be operationally efficient and flexible enough to\n            shrink in times of economic prosperity and expand as needed\n            during a crisis."}, "docdt": "2008-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
