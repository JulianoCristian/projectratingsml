The\n            project will support a comprehensive restructuring program\n            for TRC comprising:  (a) reform of the regulatory framework\n            governing the conduct of its business; (b) revamping of its\n            organization to strengthen its capacity to manage its core\n            railways activity; (c) restructuring of its operating\n            procedures and systems to make operations more efficient;\n            and (d) rebuilding of its capacity through reducing the huge\n            backlog of deferred maintenance on its assets.  The project\n            consists of:  (a) the rehabilitation of track,\n            telecommunications systems, locomotives, wagons and coaches;\n            (b) the replacement of obsolete and life-expired maintenance\n            equipment, vehicles and coaches; (c) organizational support\n            and training to strengthen management system and staff\n            capacity in all functional areas; and (d) support for\n            improvements in the working environment and incentives,\n            including enhanced pensions, for the workforce."}, "docdt": "1991-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
