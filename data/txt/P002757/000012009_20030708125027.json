project assessment, given its outcome is rated\n            unsatisfactory, with an unlikely sustainability, yet\n            institutional development impacts are substantial, and both\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower are rated\n            satisfactory. Lessons confirm in fact, that the project\n            succeeded much better than many similar railway projects,\n            with a rising freight traffic over the network of over\n            seventy five percent, having the Tanzania Railways\n            Corporation (TRC) achieved a much more commercial approach.\n            However, unless the basic incentive/sanction structures are\n            changed, technical assistance (TA) and training will have\n            little sustainable impact, unless the institutional culture\n            is substantially modified. Despite substantial emphasis\n            given to capacity building, institutional strength will not\n            necessarily be reflected in corporate performance, unless a\n            strong management orchestrates the entity. Likewise, the\n            corporate culture will change from within its continual\n            institutional framework, provided a new framework allows\n            full private management practices, as demonstrated by the\n            success of the Dar es Salaam Container Terminal stemming\n            from the time of its leasing to the private sector.\n            Moreover, while work unit targets were reached, with\n            incentive payments reaching an almost forty percent of the\n            basic salary cost, no improvement in corporate performance\n            was observed. The TRC incentive scheme needs to be carefully\n            designed, so as to be linked with corporate performance.\n            Further lessons demonstrate the importance of adequate\n            operation line management, which showed a rapid improvement\n            during the interim capacity enhancement program (ICEP)\n            following the concessioning decision aimed at increasing\n            locomotive availability, a proof of how the impact of\n            experienced, and motivated management can orchestrate the\n            potential capacity of an organization, and deploy it into\n            the corporate operational performance; and, the limited\n            private sector interest may be an understandable risk\n            aversion, but more interest may be generated through a\n            flexible criteria, that allows other interests to bid for\n            the concession."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
