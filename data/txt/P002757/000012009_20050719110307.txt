  About this Report
       The Operations Evaluation Departmentassessesthe programs and activitiesof the World Bank for two
  purposes:first, to ensure the integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocess and to verify that the Bank's work is
  producingthe expected results, and second,to help develop improveddirections,policies, and proceduresthrough
 the disseminationof lessons drawn from experience.As part of this work, OED annually assesses about 25 percent of
 the Bank's lending operations. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment,preferenceis given to thosethat are
 innovative,large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;thosefor which
 ExecutiveDirectors or Bank management have requestedassessments;and thosethat are likelyto generate
 importantlessons. The projects, topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessment support larger evaluation
 studies.
       A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the ImplementationCompletion
 Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
 PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interview operationalstaff, and in most cases visit
 the borrowing country for onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to
 validate and augment the information providedin the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
 OED studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED management approval. Once cleared internally, the
 PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then
 sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers'comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank`s
 Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosedto the public.


 About the OED Rating System
      The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad rangeof the World Bank's work.
 The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
 sectoral approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following is
 the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED website:
 http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
      Relevanceof Objectives:The extent to which the project's objectives are consistentwith the country's
 current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
 goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies,Sector Strategy Papers,
 Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy:The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expectedto be achieved, taking into
 account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency:The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higherthan the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
 Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
      SusfainafWty: The resilience to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: HighlyLikely, Likely,
 Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnstitutionalDevelopmentImpact:The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resourcesthrough: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability,and predictability of institutional arrangements andlor (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
institutionalarrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
project. Possible ratings: High,Substantial, Modest, NegIigible.
     Outcome:The extent to which the project`s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Bank Performance:The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
     BorrowerPerformance:The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparationand implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward the achievement
of development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory,
Highly Unsatisfactory.

 Preface

          This Project Performance Assessment Rcport (PPAR), prcpared by the Opcrations
 Evaluation Dcpartment (OED), covers two completed transport sector projects in the
 Republic of Tanzania: Port Modcrnization I 1 (Credit 2095-TA) and Railway
 Restructuring (Credit 2267-TA).

         An International Development Association (IDA) credit inthe amount of SDR
 28.9 million (US$37.0 million equivalent) was approved for the port project on February
 27, 1990. The final project cost was US$126.4 million (US$122.3 million at appraisal) of
 which the IDA contribution was US$37.1 million. Co-financiers contributed US$67.2
 million.

         The project closed in June 2000, three years later than originally scheduled. Most
 o f the extension was usedto prepare and carry out the privatization o f the container
 terminal at the port o f Dar es Salaam, which was not originally a project objective.

         An IDA credit o f SDR 56.1 million (US$76.0 million equivalent) was approved
 for the Railway Restructuringproject on June 13, 1991. The final project cost was
US$222.1 million (US$275.2 million at appraisal), o fwhich IDA contributed US$64.6
million. Co-financiers    contributed US$193.3 million. The project closed inDecember
2002, three years late. Most o f delay was used to prepare for privatizing the railway,
which, as inthe case o f the port project, was not among the original objectives.

         The two projects were selected for assessment because o f the addition o f
privatization as an objective. OED is preparing a review o f the Bank transport sector
lendingworldwide, and the two projects offer auniqueperspective on the issues
encountered inthe privatizationo fport and railways enterprises ina developingcountry.

         OED preparedthis report based on examination o f the relevant Staff Appraisal
Reports, Implementation Completion Reports, legal agreements, project files and
archives, as well as other relevant reports, memoranda, and working papers. Discussions
were also held with a number o f Bank staff. An OED mission visited Tanzania in
February2005, conducted site visits, and discussed the projects and effectiveness of Bank
assistancewith government officials and stakeholders. Their kindassistance is gratefully
acknowledged.

         Following standard OED procedures, copies o fthe draft PPAR were sent to
government officials and agencies for their review and comments. No comments were
received.

  Summary

           InTanzania, the poor cfficiency ofthe transport sector has historically been a
  blockage to the economy . This is largely due to poor roads and inefficient operations o f
  the two railway systems, the Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) and the Trans-
  Zambian (TAZARA) railway. High costs of land transport hamper communications, and
  this problem is exacerbated by the large size of the country and the scattered distribution
  o f population and production activities. The port o f Dar es Salaam(DSM) i s Tanzania's
  main ocean outlet and also serves several Tanzanian neighboring countries. Because o f
  this, the Tanzanian transport system, and especially the DSMport, is an important foreign
  exchange eamer. While major political changes inthe Eastem and SouthemAfrica region
  took place in the 1990s significantly reordering the transport pattems inthe region,
  Tanzania has remained an important transit country for most o f its neighbors.

          The two projects underreview, Port Modernization I1and Railway
  Restructuring, were approved inthe early 1990s, when both the railways and the ports
 were operated as public sector agencies. The two projects were originally intendedto
  improve performance o f two transport parastatal agencies, respectively the Tanzania
 Harbors Authority (THA), responsible for the ports, and the TRC. The D S M port was
 profitable under THA mainly because o f highrates and little competition, but its
 operational efficiency was low.

          However, the government inthe mid-1990s decided to privatize.its state-owned      '
 enterprises (SOEs), the combined losses o fwhich accounted for close to 10percent o f
 GDP. The privatizationprogram includedawarding concessions to private operators o f
 public utilities, among which were the DSMport andthe TRC. The two projects
 accordingly were restructured to incorporate the government privatization strategy into
 the projects' objectives.

          Intheport project, privatizationsucceededas the container terminal o fthe DSM
port was transferred to a private concessionaire in 2000 resulting insignificant
 improvements inoperational and financial performance.

          The outcome o f the port project is rated satisfactory. Institutionaldevelopment is
rated substantial, mainly as a result o fthe concession, but also on account of
management improvements made prior to privatization. Sustainabilityi s rated likely, as
facilities are ingood condition and private operators normally give priority to ensuring
that proper maintenance i s carried out regularly. Bank andBorrower performance are        ,
rated satisfactory.

         Inthe railwayproject, the first attempt to transfer TRC to aprivateoperator
failed, because bidconditions were difficult to meet andno bidder submitteda compliant
bid.A second roundo fbidding, taking into account the experience from the first round,
was underway at the time o f this assessment(early 2005). Before the privatizationwas
launched, the project had financed major track relaying (200 kilometers) and
rehabilitation(1,000 kilometers), the reconstructiono f 52 bridges, and had also helped    ,
rebuild rail track sections damaged by ElNino flooding. The efficiency o f railway
operations improvedinmany areas, and freight traffic reached record levels. However,

                                                   X




- thc projcct had sct ambitious operational targets, and, despitc improvements, none o f thc
  targets was met.

           The outcome of the railway project is thus rated unsatisfactory. The investments
  improved the physical condition o f the railway network as expected, and there were
  improvemcnts in the railway's commercial emphasis and in productivity. However,
  neither the operational goals nor the objective to transfer the TRC to a private operator
  were achieved. Financial performance improved, but only modestly, inpart because the
  government failed to provide TRC with compensation for the provision o f non-
  commercial passenger services. Institutionaldevelopment is rated substantial because
  significant progress was made inthe groundwork for privatization, starting with TRC's
  cessationof non-railway business and more recently inthe preparationo f a second round
  o fbidding; a Commercial Department was created; and, a modem program to track and
  monitor all movements and technical status o f locomotives and rolling stock was installed
  and is operating correctly.

           Sustainability is rated Non Evaluable. Under current conditions TRC clearly does
  not have adequate funds to maintain assets, and operational performance can therefore
  only deteriorate. However, the second round o f concession bidding for TRC i s quite
  advanced, and there are good prospects that a concession will be awarded soon. Ifand
  when a privateoperator takes over, maintenance and operational efficiency is likely to be
  satisfactory basedon international experience with privately managed railways. On
  balance, it is not possible at this stage to assess sustainability. Bank and Borrower
  performance are rated satisfactory. The Borrower ratingtakes into account the good
 performance o f the implementation agency inthe execution o fthe project and that the
 government, while failing to provide TRC financial compensationfor non-commercial
  services, realized that the parastatal framework was unsuitable to achieve satisfactory
 performance and then took the bold decision to try and privatize TRC operations.

          Four factors predominate in explaining the differences inthe outcomes o f the
 concessionprocesses o f the DSMcontainer terminal ando f TRC. The first factor i s the
 profit potential and risks, port container terminals are money-makers, while railways
 with relatively low traffic densities, as i s the case o f TRC, generally lose moneywhen
 operated as parastatal companies. Railway finances are affected by the government's
 failure to provide compensation for the non-commercial services that railways are
 required to offer. The second is the level o f investments; while the container terminal is
 practically new andrequires no further infrastructureinvestments, the railway, despite
 project-financed improvements, still needs substantial investments to ensure the whole
 system i s insatisfactory operating condition. The third i s the labor issue. As is common
 inparastatalenterprises, boththe port andthe railway were overstaffed. However, the
 railway employs many times more staff than the port. Inaddition, THA generated enough
 net revenues to pay compensation to laid-off staff, while TRC needed to obtain a
 government budgetary allocation. The fourth issue concems the complexity o fmanaging
 an enterprise like TRC with assets (the railtrack, depots and other facilities) located over
 a lengtho f2,600 kilometers, while the port container terminal has neatly defined
 facilities consisting o ftwo container berthsand a container storage area.

The expericncc from thcsc projects confirms a number of OED lessons:

  The frcedom to opcrate according to market principles potentially makes thc
  opcrational efficiency of privately run concessions superior to that o f parastal
  organizations for ports and railways;

  The concentration of investment with high volumes of traffic, lower operational
  costs and relative autonomy from government, generally makes port concessions
  a relatively low risk for investors;

  When railways are likely to incur losses andor are inadequately compensated for
  uneconomic services, investors will be hard to attract and therefore bidding
  conditions and the terms o f the concession agreement will need to take this into
  account;

  The designof projects preparing parastatal companies for privatization should
  take into account the capacity and commitment of government and management
  to carry through the reform process. Targets and timetables should be realistic.
  Special care should be placedinthe selection o f qualified consultants preparing
  biddingdocumentation.

  1.      Background

  1.1           With a GNP per capita of less than US$300, Tanzania is one o f the poorest
  countries in the world. Its population of some 30 million and its economy are highly
  dependent on agriculture. While the condition of the population has not changed much
  since the early 1990s when the two projects under review where approved, the
  government since the mid and late 1990s has undertakenmajor policy reforms, and
  significant progress has beenmade in moving toward a market economy. As a result,
 economic growth has averaged over 6 percent per year since 2000.

  1.2           One o f the radical reforms has been launching the privatization o f state-
 owned enterprises (SOEs), whose combined losses accounted for close to 10 percent o f
 GDP. The privatization program included the concessioning to private operators o f public
 utilities, including the Port of Dar es Salaam (DSM) and the Tanzania Railways
 Corporation (TRC).

 1.3            Tanzania's transport sector has historically beena blockage to the economy
 because o fpoor roads and inefficient operations o f its two railway systems, the TRC and
 the Trans-Zambian (TAZARA) railway. Highcosts o f land transport seriously hamper
 communicationsbecause o f the large size o f the country and the scattered location o f
 population and production activities. At the same time, becausethe port o f Dar es Salaam
 serves several mostly landlocked neighboringcountries, the Tanzaniantransport system,
 andespeciallythe DSMport are key foreign exchange earners. Major geopolitical
 changes in the Eastern and Southern Africa region occurred inthe 1 9 9 0 ~ ~ significantly
 reordering the transport patterns inthe region, yet Tanzania has remained an important
 transit country for most o f its neighbors.

 1.4            The two projects under review were part ofcontinued Bank assistance to
 Tanzania's transport sector. The Port Modernizationproject followed the Port
Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1536-TA), which closed on December 31, 1992. OED             '

assessed this project and found that port facilities were rehabilitated as planned and that
the port was making a reasonablebut low returnon fixed assets. The Railway
Restructuringproject, incontrast, was appraised when no Bank railway project was under
execution, and originated ina 1987 Transport Sector Donors Conference. More broadly,
the two projects were part of the Bank's longstanding support for the improvement o f
Africa's international transport corridors. The donor community strongly supported the
two projects, each o fwhich had six co-financiers.

1.5            The Bankcontinues to support Tanzania's transport sector through the
Central Corridor Project (Credit 3888-TA), approved inApril 2004.

1.6            Inaddition, the Bankhasprovidedstrong support to Tanzania' privatization
program throughthe Parastatal andPublic Sector ReformProject (Credit 2507, approved
infiscal 1993) amainobjective o fwhichwas to strengthen thePublic Sector Reform
Commission (PSRC) to handle divestitures. Duringimplementation o fthis project,

                                                    2


 government dccidcd to includc infrastructurc in its program of parastatals sales (or
 concessions in the casc o f some public utilities).

  1.7           A group of World Bank Executive Directors (EDs) visited Tanzania in July
 2004. One theme o f the visit was private sector development. While the visit to the port is
 not specifically mcntioned in the EDs report,' THA authorities mentioned to the PPAR
 mission that the EDs group had held discussionswith THA executives.

 1.8            The Operations Evaluations Department reviewedWorld Bank operations in
 Tanzania in 2000. The review focused on the 1995-1999 period. The report suggested
 that the Bank's lendingprogram and economic and sector work should be centered on
 key constraints to private sector and rural development. A companion report by the
 Operations Evaluation Group o f the International Finance Corporation (IFC) found that
 Tanzania had been difficult for private investors. The IFC report notedweak
 infrastructure as one o f the key obstacles to private sector development.

 1.9            Inthis report the objectives and components ofthe two projects are
 discussed together because of their similarities. This is followed by discussions o f the        '


results o f each project individually. Then, the experience with the concessions in the two
projects is compared and finally a numberof lessons are drawn.

 2.      Projects Objectives,Design, and Implementation

 2.1            The objcctives and componcnts of the two projects are shown in Box 1.

 Box 1. Project Objectives and Components
 Port Modernization
 Objectives
     0  The project's original objective was to expand the physical, managerial, and operational
        capacities of the Tanzania Harbours Authority (THA) to meet anticipated traffic volume
        inthe 1990s. Six sub-objectives were listed:
              o Execute the secondphase container terminal expansion to handle 2.4 million tons
              o Enhance THA's operational, administrative, andmanagerial capacity to manage
                  container operations
              o Improve THA's capacity to maintain and operate cargo handling equipment
              o Rationalize THA's financial management
              o Carry out a development study to determine the next phase ofport expansion
              o Establisha computer-based management information system (MIS)
 Components
     0  The project's original components consisted of:
              o Port civil works, mainly expansionof container terminal (US$65.50 million, 53.5
                 percent of project cost)
              o Port equipment (US$27.5 1million, 22.5 percent ofproject cost)
             o Engineeringservices and studies (US$5.36 million, 4.4 percent o fprojectcost)
             o Institutional development to assistthe Project Coordination Unit(PCU),
                 technical assistance to management, and technical assistance to the Customs        ,
                 (US$23.97 million, 19.6 percent o fproject cost)
 Railway Restructuring
 Objectives
     0  The objectives o f the project were:
             o Strengthenthe organizationo fthe Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC),
                 eliminate regulatory bottlenecks to its effective operations and set it on a path to
                 a commercially viable entity
             o Rehabilitateinfrastructureassets, replaceobsolete anduneconomic operational
                 assets, and provide limitednew investments consistent with the prospects for       '


                 growth indomestic traffic
 Components
    0   The project's original components consisted of:
             o Physical investments, includingtrack renewal, maintenance depot, signaling and
                telecoms, locomotive rehabilitation, rolling stock (US$161.6 million, 81percent
                o f project's base cost)
            o Institutional support, trainingand studies (US$37.9 million, 19percent of
                project's base cost)

2.2            Duringimplementationo fbothprojects andinline with a shift in
government policy toward the privatization of infrastructure and public utilities, the
CreditAgreements were amended to introduce a major new objective: concessioning of
the two utilities toprivate operators. In parallel, changes inthe components were
introduced inbothprojects to support the new objective, including hnding for the PSRC

                                                 4


  to finance concession transaction adviscrs and a number of supporting studics. Inboth
  cases, the PSRC bccamc a new implementation agency. Thc large number of
  componcnts, numcrous co-financiers, and the addition o f the privatization objective made
  implementation of thc two projects complex. The changed objectives were also the main
  factor in an extension of each project's closing date by three years.

  2.3           Ncither of thc projects was subject to Quality at Entry assessments. Inboth
  projects, thc ICRs assessed the quality at entry as satisfactory. Inthe context of
  improving thc performance of parastatal utilities, the PPAR agrees that the projects
  focused on the appropriate institutionaldevelopment objectives and components, and that
 the investments prioritieswere essentially the correct ones. Bothprojects included strong
 technical assistance components to help achieve the performance objectives. Therefore,
 the PPAR supports the assessment of quality at entry as satisfactory.

 2.4           During implementation a number o f revisions to the list o f the port project
 activities were made, with deletion of a few o f the smaller components, and addition o f
 some new ones. These changes may suggest insufficient project preparation, since some
 investment priorities had to be changed inmid-course. Inreality, however, the changes
 were mainly due to fast evolving economic conditions in Tanzania and inthe landlocked
 countries served by the port. Changes includednotably more support to Customs through
 the addition o f financing for the rehabilitationo f customs buildings and provision o f
 equipment.

 2.5           Neither the port nor the railway undertook major new construction or other
 physical aspects that could pose serious environmental concerns. Less significant
 environmental issues were addressedinthe projects by studies (port) or a combination o f
 immediate remedialactions and studies (railway). Inretrospect, a potential issue in the
 case o f TRC was people encroaching the railways' right o f way. Since those people were
 not affected by project activities, this issue was not dealt with under the project. Yet,  ,
 today, this has become an issue inthe concessioning o fthe TRC, since any private
 operator will demand to have the rail track's right-of-way clear o f encroachments. The
 ongoing Central Transport Corridor Project (Credit 3888) includes funding for the cost o f
 assisting people to move out o f TRC's right o fway to other suitable locations (assistance
 executed by local NGOs).

2.6            Regarding the concessioning process, (a) the decision to concessionthe port
inphases, starting with thecontainer terminal, was correct, since container terminals are
more attractive andthere i s ample worldwide experience showing successful
concessioning o f container terminals, and (b) the decisionto concession the railway as
one package appears to have been the right approach. Inhindsight, however, the
deadlines for completing the railway concessioning appear to have been overly
optimistic.

2.7           Inretrospect, the question arises as to whether some sort ofprivatization
could have been introduced or were intendedinthe original project objectives. Inthe case
o fthe railway, management contracts had already beenused inother countries -
                                                                                          ,
including the Sub-SaharanAfrica region-since the 1980s. Yet, actual concessioning of
the railway only started inthe early 1990s insome Latin American countries, while none

                                                 5


  had been undertaken in Africa up to the timc the evaluatcd project was appraised. In
  contrast, concessioning o f port container terminals hadbcen started worldwide at least a
  decade earlier, cspecially in Asia, and had demonstratcd their effectiveness.

  2.8           On the othcr hand, without a broad govemment policy aimed at privatizing
  SOEs it would have been difficult to makc an exception with the ports. At the same timc,
  much faith in the late 1980s and early 1990s was still placed in the effectiveness of
  performance agreements as a way for the governments to get higher efficiency from their
  parastatal companies, espccially the utilities, despite early evidence that such contracts
  rarely achieved the expected results. Inthe case o f TRC, such agreements were signed, at
  appraisal as a Memorandum of Understanding and later as a formal Performance
  Contract.



  3.     Outcomes of the Port ModernizationProject

 Outcome

 3.1           The overall project outcome is rated satisfactory based on substantial
 relevance, efficacy, and efficiency (discussed below). The key objective o f privatization
 was fully achieved, and i s proving successful. Most of the other objectives were also
 substantially achieved. Since the terminal has beenconcessioned, major improvements           8

 have been achieved in operational efficiency and reduction inthe time containers stay at
 the port. Port rates have been loweredevery year for five years. The result has been an
 overall increase inthe quality o f services to port users and significant growth inthe
 movement of containers inthe port, from about 100,000 in 1997 to 260,000 in2004.
 Growtho f container traffic continues to be strong in2005.

 Relevance

 3.2          The relevance o fthe project i s rated substantial, since the port is important
 to the Tanzanianeconomy andproject objectives were well conceived. The economic
 growth o f Tanzania inrecent years would have beenseriously hinderedhad the port not
beenimprovedunderthe project. The project was also aligned with the 1999 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), which specified that one o fthe six major objectives in
Tanzania was to "reduce sectoral andphysical constraints."

3.3           Becausethe DSMport serves several o f Tanzania's bordering countries as'
the most direct andeconomic linkto the rest ofthe world andtherefore the primaryocean
outlet, the project's relevance extended beyondTanzania to the East Africa region.

3.4           The project's added objective to support concessioning o fthe DSM
container terminal was clearly inline with the government's strategy to divest SOEs to
improve efficiency. The project also helped support a major policy reform inthe oil
sector: the government decisionto close Tanzania's inefficient oil refinery could only be
implementedwhenthe oiljetty at DSMwas upgradedunder the project to allow larger             '
tankers to berth carrying refinedpetroleumproducts and increasedunloading efficiency.

                                                 6


 3.5             Thc project also helped assist vulnerable populations. Tanzania has provided
 sanctuary to a large number o f refugees from Burundi and Rwanda, with a peak o f more
 than 600,000 in 1993, and hovering around 400,000 through the 1990sand 2000s who
 have receivcd assistaim from thc World Food Program (WFP). In 2005, the WFP is
 feeding some 400,000 people (250,000 from Rwandaand 150,000 from Democratic
 Republic o f Congo), and to this end it is importing 800,000 tons of foods per year
 through thc DSMport. The WFP program is also assisting the vulnerable Tanzanian
 population located northwest o f Dar es Salaam.

 3.6             The project's support to Customs, originally in the form of technical
 assistance but later adding investments for physical facilities, enhancedthe value o f the
project. The additional investment strengthened support to improve trade logistics
through the port.

Efficacy

3.7             Efficacy o f the civil works is rated substantial. The six major
subcomponents of civil works, amounting to over 90 percent of civil works costs, were
carried out as expected. The expanded stacking areas inthe container terminal
substantially increased its capacity. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) expected that with
the increased capacity some 125,000 containers would be moved in 1995 (up from about
60,000 in 1991when the project started). Infact, due to a shortage o f transit containers,
only about 75,000 containers were movedthat year. However, thanks to the increased
infrastructurecapacity, coupled with new equipment and a more efficient operation by
the terminal's private operator, the terminal's throughput in2004 had grown to 260,000,
containers.

3.8             Only two civil works subcomponents (Belgianwharf andpavingof
lighterage area) representing less than 10percent o f total civil works, were not carried
out. I t i s questionable why these subcomponents were included inthe original project. A
visit to the port found these not to bepriority facilities, andthat the lighterage activity i s
relatively low.

3.9             Additional works, namelydredging o fthe harbor channel and Customs
building, which were not originallypart o fthe project, were carried out andput into
service. Equipment for the port was carried out as anticipated and within the cost
estimate. The Kurasini Oil Jetty was upgraded andhas allowed bigger tankers and faster
unloadingoperations.

3.10            Only about 50 percent ofthe expected hndingfor technical assistancewas
utilized. This is mainly explainedbythe decision to privatize the container terminal (and
other parts of the port insubsequent phases), which made the intendedconsulting
services to improve operations andmanagement unnecessary.

3.1 1           The customs processingsystem ASCUDA (Advance Cargo in
Computerized andDocumentationSystem) was introduced on schedule, but efficient
operation o f the system took time to develop. For a period soon after the systemhad
become effective its operation had to be suspended due to inadequate staffing. However,

                                                7


 once this problcm was resolved, ASCUDA proved to be considerably more efficient than
 the manual processing that prevailedbefore the system had been installed. In May 2005,
 an improved vcrsion of ASCUDA, (known as ASCUDA++), is expected to be put in
 operation. This advance in technology will allow complete electronic processing o f
 foreign tradc documentation, eliminating the need for paperwork.

 Efficiency

 3.12           Efficiency is rated substantial. The ICR estimated the economic rate of
 retum(ERR) at 13 percent, and the net present value at US$20.8 million, both
 satisfactory but lower than the S A R estimates (ERR o f 20 percent and NPV o f $42.7
 million), becauseo f traffic lower than expected. The re-estimated ERR takes into account
(i)thecostsavingsgeneratedbytheimportationofrefinedproducts insteadofcrudeoil
 for processing inthe inefficient, and later closed oil refinery (closure made possible by
the upgrading o f the oiljetty) and (ii)actual surcharges imposed by the shipping lines on
D S M port being substantially lower than predicted by the SAR's simulation model. The
substantial increase intraffic inrecent years (see below) means that the ERR and the
NPV are higher than estimated inthe ICR.

3.13            The ICR estimated the financial rate o fretum (FRR) at 8 percent, lower than
the SAR's 14percent and consistent with the drop inthe ERR. Inview of the improved
traffic performance inrecent years, the FRR can be expected to be higher than estimated
inthe ICR.

3.14            Traffic, operation, and financial performance are discussed below.

3.15            Traffic.Total dry cargo by 1997 (the last year o fthe S A R forecast) was
considerably lower than forecast, mainly as a result ofthe loss o f transit traffic following
geopolitical developments inEastern and Southern Africa (Table 1). By 2003/04, the
DSMport hadregainedthe lost traffic andhadpracticallyreached the SAR forecast for
1997. Container traffic was also considerably below expectations in 1997. However, by
2004, mainly as a result of the improvedperformance o fthe container terminal achieved
bythe concessionaire, total container movementswere 70 percent higher than the S A R
forecast for 1997, andtwo and one halftimes the actual 1997 movements. Growth of
container movements is expectedto continue to increase at a fast pace in2005.

   3.16           Opcnrfions. The container tcrminal's operational efficicncy has substantially
   improved since the terminal was concessioned, as reflected by the drop in dwell time' and
   the increase in the number of container moves per hour per crane (Table 2). The latter
   indicator was in 2004 at a level comparable to many ports in industrialized countries.

  3.17           Other signs o f improved efficiency include port cargo handling rates and
  staffing. Inaccordance with the concessioning contract, port rates for handling containers
  have decreased 3 percent per year. The contract stipulates that rate reductions will happen
  during the first five years o fthe lease; therefore, no further rate reductions are expected.
I

  A further indicator o f efficiency improvements is the staffing at the container terminal. .
  While there were some 600 staff before the concession, the current staffing i s 420.

  3.18           Despite the efficiency improvements, congestion at the terminal has
  developed in2005 due to lack o f railway capacity for moving containers out o f the port.
  This has caused concerned maritime conferences (shippinglines) to threaten the
  imposition o f shippingtariff surcharges for the DSMport.

  3.19           The improved operations ofthe container terminal under the private
  operator, coupledwith increasing lack o f landtransport capacity to move the containers
 inandout oftheport, hasinducedshippersto finance purchase or repairso frailway
 wagons andpurchase of large trucks.

 3.20           Port operational efficiency is also affected by efficiency of the Customs.
 The introductiono fthe UNCTAD-developedAdvance Cargo inComputerizedand
 DocumentationSystem (ASCUDA) represented an important step incomputerizing
 customs management, including the handlingo f customs declarations, accounting
 procedures, and transit documentation. However, customs efficiency has beenhindered
 bytwo factors: (a) changes incustoms procedures and (b) the number and skillof
 customs clearance agents. A new destination inspectionsystem put inplace inJuly 2004
 (replacing a pre-terminal inspection) has generally resulted inlonger clearance times and,
 therefore, longer container dwell times. In 2005, a new scanner-based system o f container
 inspection has been at the center o f controversy, as some shippers regard the system as
 the source o f increased clearance time. The large numbers o fclearing agents are also a
 burdenon customs clearance, especially as many o fthe agents lack professional
 knowledge and experience. By some estimates, there are today over 300 clearing agents,
 while an efficient operation would probablyneedno more than 30 to 50 licensed agents.

 2. The dwell time is the durationof the stay of the container inthe port.

 3.21           Fiirtancinl. `I'he financial performance of thc container teniiinal differs,
 dependingon whethcr otic looks at THA's view or the government's perspective.
 According to THA's cstiniatcs, prior to privatization thc container terminal generatcd
 about Tsh 11,400 billion net revenues for THA. Thesc figures are impossible to validate
 since THA's financial statements do not include separatc figures for the individual ports,
 even less parts of a port, such as thc container terminal. With the concession, THA's
 revenue from the terminal consists of rent and royalties. This revenue has increased from
 Tsh 4,100 billion in 2000/01 to Tsh 6,400 billion in 2003/04. These figures would
 indicate that because o f the privatization THA has experienced a net loss on the order o f
 US$5 million per year. However, Tanzania lntemational Container Services Ltd.
 (TICTS) figures show that over the time o f the concession it has contributed more than
 US$22 million to THA in rental and royalties, and a further US$30million to the
 government in taxes and levies. Since taxes and levies, which THA did not pay when it
 operated the terminal, exceed the amount paid inrental and royalties, the financial
 benefits for the government, including THA, would be at least on the order o f the net
 revenues THA claimed it had from the container terminal operations. Further, the
 improved efficiency o f the terminal has brought significant economic benefits to
 Tanzania and its neighbors inthe form o f reduced tariffs, lower dwell time, and more
 efficient port operations overall, and has resulted in fast-growing container traffic which
 will further increase revenues for THA and the government.

 Institutional DevelopmentImpact

 3.22          Institutionaldevelopment i s rated substantial.Concessioning of the
container terminal has beena major achievement, and has resulted inmajor gains in
efficiency. The introductionof the customs management systemASCUDA, has
modernized the handlingo fmanifests and customs declarations, accountingprocedures,
transit and suspenseprocedures, and it generates useful trade data.

3.23           A further institutionaldevelopment impact helped bythe project was the
reform o f the oil sector, with the closing o f the inefficient oil refinery that was made
possible by the upgradingof the oiljetty

Sustainability

3.24           Sustainability is rated likely. Infrastructureand equipment financed under
the project are ingood condition five years after project closing, andprivate operators
normally give priority to ensuringthat proper maintenance i s camed out regularly. A
potentialproblem i s that the pavement o fthe container terminal that appears to be
damaged by a 6-high stacking o f containers (instead o fthe original assumption of 3-high
stacking) necessitated by the steep increase incontainer traffic and the limited container
storage areas. However, given the importance for the concessionaire o fhaving the
facilities ingood shape, an agreement likely will be reached betweenthe concessionaire
and the THA for a full repair and future upkeep o f the terminal.

Bank Performance

                                                10


  3.25           Bank pcrfonnance is rated satisfactory. The project was generally well
  prepared and the Bank respondedquickly when it was necessaryto make changes in
  direction, most notably the addition of the concessioning objective. Several other changes
  were made to project components, but those changes were small relative to the whole
  project, and were mostly the result of evolving conditions in the port.

  3.26           Thc project was mostly well supervised. Supervision missions were frequcnt
  and addressedthe key project issues promptly and decisively, although for a period of
  about three years (1993-1995) missions consisted o f only a port engineer. The project had
 two especially difficult dimensions for the Bank team: (a) dealing first with two (THA
 and Customs) and later with a third (PSRC) implementing agency, which had
  substantially different responsibilities and (b) coordinating six co-financiers.

 3.27           The Bank team devoted considerable time and performedwell inthese two
 dimensions. Comments by the three implementing agencies at project completion showed
 a clearly positive assessmentof the Bank team's role duringimplementation. The only      ,
 area noted (by Customs) as weak was the need to improve the speed for prior review and
 the provisionofno objections to help facilitate the procurement process.

 3.28           Supervision ratings duringimplementation appear to have beenoverly soft.
 At no point was the implementationprogress or development objective rated less than
 satisfactory. However, project documentation suggests that at times implementation
 performance was not satisfactory. For example, a supervisionreport in 1994,3three years
 into implementation, notes that the operational performance o f THA andDSMwas poor
 and deteriorating rapidly, that there is `management crisis' inTHA and that the Customs
 component o fthe project was dormant. This statement suggests that at least the
development objective rating should have been rated as unsatisfactory.

Borrower Performance

3.29            Borrower performance i s rated satisfactory. The three different
implementing agencies performedgenerally well, although there were weaknesses at         ,
times, especially inthe earlyyears, as notedinthe supervisionreport referredto above.

3.30            Theproject's coordinatingunit (PCU) was inadequate inthe beginning, but
later performedsatisfactory with the assistance of technical assistance and training.
Quarterly reports were well prepared and timely. Audit reports were mostly submitted on
time andcovenants mostlymet.

3.3 1           Thanks to its net revenues, THA contributed counterpart hndingon time
andinthe amounts required, thus preventing a blockage inthe procurement process.

3.32            The government's decisionto privatize the container terminal was crucial
for the project to achieve a successful outcome. Up to that time, while procurement had
been generally satisfactory, THA's operational efficiency hadbeen erratic, with periods
o f deteriorating performance, especially as noted inthe section above.

  3.33          `['he dccision to start port privatization with thc conccssioning o f the
  container terminal was appropriatc, and upon completion o f the project the PSRC has
  continued to preparc thc privatizationo f the rcmainingparts o f the port.



  4.      Outcomes of the Railway Project

  Outcome

  4.1           Outcome is rated unsatisfactory based on ratings o f substantial for
  relevance, and modest for efficacy and efficiency (discussedbelow). The key operational
  targets were not met and the railway's financial performance showed only modest
  improvements. More significantly, concessioning o f the railway to a private operator was
  not achieved within the timeframe o f the project, and had not been achieved by April
  2005. There were, however, some positive results, such as improvements o f railway
  infrastructure and o f operations. Rehabilitationo f the track significantly improved the
  safety and reliability o f railway operations. Repairs to locomotives and wagons, coupled
 with improvements in operations management resulted inbetter operational efficiency for
 most o f the project period. The railway gained traffic and reached its highest level by the
 end of the project. Significant progress was made toward the platform on which to
 privatize the railway. However, the bidto secure a private operator failed and without this
 inplace the railwayremains unsustainable with the present level of funding. It appears,
 though, that the experience with the failed first biddinghas beentaken into account in the
 designo f second round o fbidding(supported underthe on-going ongoing Central
 Transport Corridor Project), which establishes a more conducive environment for private
 sector involvement.

Relevance

4.2            Relevance i s rated substantial.TRC i s essential to the Tanzanian's
economy as well as to Tanzania's neighboring countries, which use TRC's services to
reach the DSMport. The road system, at the time o fproject preparation and even today,
i s not a viable altemative as it consists o f a very limited network and inmost places i s not
a cost-effective competitor to the railways. Inthe early 1990s, the weak performance and
capacity o fthe railway was causing diversion o f traffic to the more expensive road
services, and this diversion was estimated to cost some $40 millionannually to the
Tanzanian economy. At the same time, Tanzania's transport system, and especially the
DSMport, for which TRC is themainfeeder, remains amajor foreign exchange earner. It
i s also important for the delivery o f assistance to vulnerable populations, as noted in
Section 3.

4.3            Therefore, rehabilitating the railway facilities and improving its
management were relevant activities. The project's main component, rehabilitation o f
some 200 kilometers o ftrack, representing close to 40 percent o fproject cost, was a
priority, as were practically all the other physical components and institutional
components.

                                                 12


  4.4           The projcct's basic premise that a parastatal entity such as the railway could
  have been rcstructured and achicve satisfactory efficiency levels within the span of a
  single project appears today as questionable. The appraisal postulated that introduction of`
  a performance agreement betwccn the government and the TRC would cnsure that the
  efficiency objectives were met. The underlying assumption was that operational and
  financial targets and a good monitoringsystem would force TRC management to iniprovc
  efficiency to meet targets, and force the government to provide TRC with sufficient
  operating and financial autonomy. The latter would be achieved through public service
  obligations (PSO) regarding the railway's non-commercial services, with the govemment
  committed to provide TRC subsidies designed to cover the gap between the tariff charged
  for those services and the actual cost of runningthe services.


 EfJicacy

 4.5           Efficacy o f the project is rated modest because most, but not all, of the
 project components were carried out as expected. Inparticular, the objective o f
 concessioning TRC to a private operator was not achieved.

 4.6           The civil works, representing more than 50 percent o f the appraisal cost,
 were completed as expected, resultinginthe relaying o f 200 kilometers o f track,
 rehabilitation o f 1,000 kilometers of track and welding o f 560 kilometers o f rails, and the
 reconstruction o f 52 bridges (22 originally included inthe project and 30 additional
 bridges rebuilt following the ElNiiio flooding). Inaddition, 16 spots (totaling some 5
 kilometers) o f track damaged by ElNiiio flooding were repaired inrecord time, allowing
 fast restoration o f service.

 4.7           The civil works were completed at costs substantiallybelow original
 estimates, and allowed for the expansion o f the investment into rolling stock and
 locomotives. Some 2,400 wagons were overhauled (1,750 expected at appraisal), and 67
 new tank wagons procured (none at appraisal). While only 26 locomotives were
 overhauled, 15 mainline and 11 shunting (fewer than the 31locomotives foreseen at
 appraisal), the unit cost o frepairs was substantially higher, and resulted inthe investment
 inlocomotiverepairs almost 3 times as large as originally estimated. No IDAhndswere
 allocated to wagons and locomotives.

4.8            Various types of equipment (track maintenance, workshops) were procured
essentially as expected, while some downgrading was made inthe expected
communications systems, as it was found that there was insufficient traffic to justify
renewal of communications systems intwo railway sections.

4.9            The intended technical assistance (TA) services were substantiallymodified
uponthe government's decision to concession TRC. Instead o fproviding advisory
services to TRC management, the TA was shifted toward direct operational managemeqt.
This assistance continued well after project closing, under co-financing providedby
Belgium.The redirectedTA provedextremely effective, andresultedinrecordtraffic
levels in2002 and 2003, with a decline in2004 mainly as a result of lack o f hdingto
continue the program o f locomotive andwagon repairs.

                                                13


 4.10          The intendcd conccssioning of thc railway did not take place within thc
 period of the project, and had not been achieved by April 2005. Factors explaining the
 lack of succcss in the concessioning process are examined in Section 5.

 Efficieri cy

 4.11          Efficiency o f the project is rated modest.The economic rate o f retum, while
 not recalculatcd in this PPAR, is likely to be around 10 percent. The ICR's estimate of
 14 percent, while lower than the SAR's estimate o f 18 percent, still appears to
 overestimatc the economic return. Actual traffic was some 40 percent below S A R
 estimates (1.34 million tons actual versus 2.16 million tons inthe S A R for 1995, the last
 year of the S A R forecast). The traffic shortfall alone should bringthe ERR substantially
 lower than the S A R estimate. Further, while most assumptions for the economic analysis
 inthe ICR appear to be correct, two assumptions appear unrealistic and likely to
overestimate the ERR: (a) investments inpassenger equipment are not counted on the
basis that such equipment is not an economic investment, and (b) investments in
infrastructure are estimated to have 50-year life plus residual value, which i s overly
optimistic.

4.12           Railway operating efficiency was, as shown in Table 3, consistently below
expectations, even when compared with the generally lower targets established inthe
1995 Midterm Review (MTR). Some efficiency indicators peaked around 1999, when
one indicator, locomotive availability, surpassedfor only once the MTR target. Inthe
opinion o f several stakeholders interviewed for the PPAR, the better 1999 performance
was due to the strong technical assistance inserted inTRC's operating department. I t is
also noteworthy that freight traffic reached a record level in2003, although that level was
still substantially below the end-year forecast o fthe S A R (1995) and MTR (2000).
However, by 2004, most indicators had deteriorated again, largely because (a) practically
no investment inspare parts andrepairs to locomotives and wagons hadbeencarried out
since project completion, and (b) the margin for improving or even maintaining operating
efficiency'onthe basis o f better management appeared to be exhausted. Declining staff
morale due to the delays and uncertainties o f the concessioning approach were also
factors explaining the drop inefficiency.

 A=actual

 4.13             The comparison o f actual versus target operational performancemay be
 unfair to TRC because many targets were set unrealisticallyhigh.The extreme case i s
 locomotive reliability, where the distance between breakdowns was expected to improve
more than five times, from about 9,000 kilometers in 1990, to 50,000 kilometers in 1995.
 The very early supervision missions in 1992 and 1993 reportedthat targets had been
adjusted downwards to more realistic levels.

4.14              The railway's poor efficiency in2004/05 i s exacting a highcost to the user
o frailway services. For example, becausethe railway does not have the capacity and i s
unable to carry general dry cargo betweenDar es Salaam andDodoma, trucking must be
used for this section. The WFP estimates trucking over this section to cost food relief
operations an extra US$1.6 millionper year.

4.15              The financial return for the project-financed. statements was not estimated in
the SAR. The ICR, usingreasonable assumptions, estimates the FRR at 4 percent with
informationthrough 2002. This estimate i s likely to remain valid today.

4.16              The financial perfonnanceo f TRC showed some improvement over the life
o f the project, although the gains were less thanexpected. The working ratio (working
costs over working revenues), improved from 0.90 in 1990to 0.70 inthe late 1990s and
early 2000s. This improvement i s significant. However, with the investments made under
the project and expected increased cost efficiency, especially since traffic increased,
further improvements inthe working ratio would have been expected.

                                                15


 4.17           `IXC's provision of`non-comtiicrcial scrviccs is ccrtain to Iiavc affcctcd
 TRC's financial pcrfoniiancc. Thc financial implications for thc TRC of its non-
 comnicrcial services wcrc not quantified in tlic SAR, but they werc deemed sufficicntly
 important that thc 1091 Mcmoranduni o f Undcrstanding between thc goveniment and
 TRC, and a subsequent Pcrfomiancc Contract committed the government to provide TRC
 with appropriatc compcnsation for such scrviccs. Undcr such agreements, thc governmcnl
 undertook to make thc compensation paynicnts to TRC not later than 3 months after the
 submission of'the claims. By 1003, the TRC had submitted its first claims for
 compensation on two non-commercial lines (Mpanda and kid at^),^ and more claims werc
 submitted latcr. Yet, it appcars that no compensation was provided by govcmment to
 TRC through the life o f thc project.

 4.18           The Railtracker program, described below under institutional development,
 has helped improve efficiency o f TRC and helped large users monitor their shipments, as
 the program makes available (almost) rcal time information on shipments and rolling
 stock.

 Institutional Development Impact

4.19            Institutional development impact i s rated substantial. While concessioningo f
the railway was not achieved, muchprogresswas made inthis direction. Railway concessions
are highly complex, and are especially difficult to accomplish inrailways with relatively
low traffic densities, such as those on the TRC, and where assets still need significant
rehabilitation. The concessioning issues are discussed inmore detail in Section 5.

4.20            The creation o f the Commercial Department as envisaged has changed
attitudes and has been instrumental inthe railway's reaching high levels o f freight traffic.
The installation o f Railtrack, an UNCTAD-developed program to track all movements
and technical status o f locomotives and wagons, has been key inhelping improve
operating efficiency, although not at the levels expected, and provide better service to
TRC's customers. TRC management uses the Railtrack report (some 30 pages providing
informationby station, type o f equipment, shipments, etc) daily. Large TRC clients such
as the World Food Program use Railtrack regularly to monitor the status o f their
shipments. Clients access Railtrack information through TRC's Railtrack website, TRC
Control Room, or via telephone.

4.21           There were also other institutional impacts. Complying with conditions o f
effectiveness, TRC stopped managing non-railway business: it leased TRC's road and
hotel services and franchised TRC catering services. Inaddition, preparations are
advanced for TRC to hive o f f its Marine Services, with lake ports to be transferred to the
THA and ferries to be sold. While TRC is still highlyoverstaffed, from the time of
project appraisal through project completion TRC nearly halved its staffing levels.

  Sustainability

  4.22          Sustainability is ratcd non evaluable. Because o f lack o f budgetary allocations
  since donor financing ended when the project closed, TRC has been unable to carry out
  required maintenance o f locomotives and rolling stock in recent years, and, short o f spare
  parts, operational performance has deteriorated. Ifthese conditions do not change, further
  deterioration both o fphysical facilities and o f performance would be likely.

  4.23          However, the second round o f bidding to transfer TRC to a private operator
  i s quite advanced, and there are good prospects that a concession will be awarded soon. If
  andwhen a private operator takes over, maintenance and operational efficiency i s likely
 to be satisfactory, based on international experience with privately-managedrailways.
 The new operator will needto give priority to rail and equipment rehabilitation. It will
 also needto modemizethe Railtrack computer system, which i s DOS-based and needs to
 be converted into a Windows-based system as it is increasingly difficult to find DOS-
 based equipment. The conversion is inexpensive.

 4.24           Onbalance, it is not possible at this stage to take a firmer view o f the
 sustainability prospects.


 Bank Performance

 4.25          Bankperformance is rated satisfactory. Project conception consisting o f
 reforming the railway as a parastatal company was still the state-of-the art when the
 project was appraised in 1991,The intended reform was broad inscope, and covered
 most management aspects. The designand components proved mostly correct, and few
 changes to the key components were requiredduringimplementation. The Bank was also
 flexible in usingproject funds to help the emergency repairs to the track damages caused
by ElNiiio floods. The Bankteam was effective incoordinating from appraisal through
project completion the cofinanciers involved with the project.

4.26           The Bank effectively reactedto the government changed policies on
parastatals and privatization, andtook the necessary steps to change direction and support
launchingthe process. The Bank organized a useful field trip for key government and
railway officials, which included visits to railway concessions inAfrica and Latin
America.

4.27           On the negative side, the Bank appears to have been overly optimistic when
setting performance targets (traffic, availability, andperfomance o frolling stock) and in
adopting as a project target the government's goal to award a concession for the railway
beforeproject closing. Bank also bears responsibility inthe selection o f inadequate
transaction advisers (Section 5), as it approved the short list o f consultants to be invited to
submit proposals.

Borrower Performance

4.28           Borrower performance i s rated satisfactory. The implementingagency,
TRC, performed at a high level inimplementing the project. It managedto achieve

                                              17


 substantial cost savings in the track coniponcnt, which allowcd it to cover thc cost of thc
 works rcquired to put the railway back in operation in the sections damaged by El Niilo
 flooding. Thc TRC created a new Commercial Department and substantially improved its
 commercial oricntation. Although below targcts, TRC also substantially raised
 operational efficiency. Traffic reached record levels.

 4.29          The borrower complied with its commitment to have TRC hive off its
 various non-core businesses, as well as to significantly shnk (40 percent) TRC's
 personnel. The borrower's main deficiency was not complying with its financial
 obligations under the Memorandum o f Understanding and Performance Contract,
 especially its contribution to compensate the TRC for the provision of non-commercial
 services. Such a commitment i s made inmany railways in developing countries, but
 government's rarely comply with it. Had the government complied with this obligation,
 TRC would have been able to better maintain its equipment, and its financial situation
 would have improved, but TRC would not have become a profitable enterprise.
 Therefore, the government's realizationthat a parastatal framework was basically
 inadequate to attain satisfactory performance andthe decision to privatize operations was
critically important. Further, the government did move to transfer the TRC to a private
operator. While the expected concession award was not achieved within the period o f the
project as the government had wished, much progress was made. The government's
decision and actions regardingprivatizationdeserve credit.



5.      The Port and the Railways Concessions-Contrasting
        Experiences

General

5.1           Following the discussion of the results o f each project, this section discusses
and compares the concession experience inboth the port andthe railways before lessons
are drawn. The container terminal o fthe D S Mport (the `Terminal') was leased to a
private operator in2000, but the attempt in2001 to find a private operator for the
railways failed, and a new round o fbiddingis underway.

The Government'sMove TowardsPrivatization

5.2           The government decidedto privatize the SOEs, includinginfrastructure
parastatals such as the ports and the railways, as part o f its parastatal sector reform
program. The task was entrusted to the PSRC. The PSRC is similar to entities created in
other countries to take a consistent approach to privatization andto consolidate inone
agency the expertise requiredto design andcarry out the privatization process.

5.3           TheBank supported strengthening o fthe PSRC through Credit 2507,              *

approved inFY93 and closed inFY02.The Bank also provided PSRC funding from the
Port Modernization andthe Railway Restructuringprojects to finance the privatization
process for the two enterprises.

                                                18


 Regulation of Transport Services

 5.4           As port and rail services are privatized, monitoringof the concession
 contracts and regulation of services will become essential. For the port, the Tanzania
 Harbours Authority (THA) will monitor compliance by the private operator with the lease
 contract. For the railway, a new entity will be created labeled the Asset Holding
 Corporation (AHC) which will be responsible for railway assets and will monitor
 compliance with the concession contract once a concessionaire is inplace. Inparticular,
 the AHC will be the interlocutor to the rail concessionaire regarding rates and services for
 passenger services where the railway is the sole provider of transport services.

 5.5           Regulatory functions for both the port and the railways are the responsibility
 o f the Surface and MarineTransport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA).SUMATRA'S
 areas o f responsibility are safety, technical standards and eventually economic if disputes
 are not resolved in other ways.


 TransactionAdvisers

 5.6           Consultants to act as Transaction Advisers were recruitedby the PSRC to
 design approaches to the privatization o fthe port and the railway, prepare the bid
 documents and assist with bid evaluation and negotiations. Inall cases, the consultants
 were selected through a competitiveprocess and after the Bank approved the list o f
 consulting companies to be invited to submit proposals.

 5.7          The PPAR missionfound a general consensus among government officials,
 management o fthe THA and TRC and major users o fports and rail services that the
 Transaction Advisers did not live up to the expected standardso f quality. Many questions
 were raised about the approachesproposed for the privatizationprocess, delays in
 submittingreports, andadvice duringnegotiations. Overall, it appears that the consultants
 advising on the privatization o fthe THA performed substantially better than the
 consultants advising on the privatizationo f TRC.

 5.8          Regardingnegotiations between the selected private operator andthe
government, some of those interviewedbelieved that negotiations generally are bound to
be unbalanced, with the government transaction advisers rarely having the experience and
knowledge o fthe business inthe depth ofthe private operator sitting across the
negotiatingtable. Findingbetter qualified transaction advisers may be a critical issue in
the preparation o f future concessions.

Concession of Dar es SalaamPort

5.9           The Dar es Salaam (DSM) container terminal was built in 1984by
conversion of general cargo berths. The conversion was done under a two-phased
operation funded by Bank projects (Port Rehabilitation Project, Credit 1536, and the Port
ModernizationProject reviewed inthis PPAR). The terminal's wharf can accommodate
two ships o f about 40,000 GRT each.

                                                19


 5.10           Privatizationof the container terminal was part of the overall privatization
 processof thc `FHA. Thc govcrnnient's policy on privatization of the ports is for the
 government to maintain 100 perccnt ownership of THA's assets while the commercial
 activities are privatizcd in thc form o f concessions, leases or joint-ventures.

 5.1 1         The privatizationprocess was launched by a THA CommercializationStudy
 and a subsequcnt PrivatizationReview Study, both funded under the Port Modernization
 project. The latter study recommended awarding the concession o f the Terminal to a
 single operator. The process of privatization took 22 months from start of preparation o f
 the bidding document by consultants until award o f tender in April 2000 to the selected
 winner.

Investment Requirements

 5.12          The two-phased container development cost US$126 million, and was
completed inthe late 1990s.No major investments were required for the Terminal at the
time of the bidding

Labor Issues

5.13          The Terminal's staffof600 prior to the concession was reducedto 420 by
the private operator. Practically all the private operator's personnel was picked from
THA's staff, with the exception o f a few financial systems experts where THA lacked
qualifiedpersonnel and the operator had to bringthem from outside THA. Compensation
for retrenched staffwas paid for from THA resources.

5.14          Underthe private operator TICTS, staff inadditionto the salary get an
annualbonus and distribution o f 5 percent of TICTS' annual dividend.

TheBidding Process

5.15          The biddocuments statedthat the consortium offering the highest annual fee
payment to THA would win the bid. Inaddition to the fee, the bid documents required the
private operator to pay THA a royalty per container moved, and to establish a
Performance bond infavor o f THA

Bidders

5.16          The biddingprocess from letter ofintentionto award ofbidscan be
summarized as follows:

        7 firms submitted a letter o f intention
        5 firms were short listed
        4 firms submittedbids
       2 o fthe 4 bids were valid bids

                                               20


 5.17         The winning bidder was ICTS-Manila, a Philippines firm. After about otic
 year o f opcrations, Hutcheson HK, a very large worldwide port operator, bought ICTS
 opcrations worldwide, including the DSMcontainer terminal. Hutcheson was one of thc 7
 firms that had originally submitted a letter of intention, but did not submit a bid.

 5.18         The operator is a consortium that includes a local partner (not experienced
 inports, but with financial experience).


 Term

5.19          The concession's term is 10 years. This term for container terminal
concessions is common inAhca, but shorter than inother regions. Inthe case of DSM
port, the relatively short term was decided on the basis that lack o f credible operating and
especially financial data on the container would play against getting a good deal for THA
and the government. After 10 years o f a private operation, another round of bidding
should yield higher revenues for the government and could be for a longer term. A longer
term entices the operator to make more investments leading to higher productivity and
better service to clients.


Key Leasing Contract Provisions

5.20          The key contract provisions are the following:

        Fixed rental: US$3.68 million per year;
        royalty: US$ 13/TEU (20 foot equivalent container); and,
        a performancebond o fUS$ 5.0 million infavor of the THA.
Results

5.21          The main results o f the private operation of the Terminal are:
    -   Throughput increased from 126,000 TEUs in2000 to 260,000 TEUs in2004, a
    -   106percent increase;
        Transshipment o f containers to other destinations increased from 5,000 TEUs in,
    -  2000 to 56,000 in2004, a 1020percent increase;
       Gross crane rate, the number o f containers movedper hour per crane, improved
    -  from 8 in2000 to 23 in2004;
       Container dwell time (stay o f a container at the port) dropped from 45 days to 12

    -  days;
       There were also gains inimproved customer relations, improved availability o f
       equipment and expanded training for operational, engineering and finance staff,

    111. Singlc Buoy Mooring

  5.23          Discussions with people knowledgeable of the port business in Tanzania
  suggest that international corporations are unlikely to be interested in the general cargo
 concession, but that it may attract local entrepreneurs.However, the prevailing opinion is
 that awarding a concession for the general cargo berth is likely to take a long time.

 5.24           In2010, the current leasecontract for the operation ofthe Terminal expires,
 and a new lease or longer-termconcession would needto be signed.

 Concession of the Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC)

 5.25          Tanzania has two railway systems, the TRC, that serves the central and
 northern parts o f the country as well as transit traffic from Burundi, Rwanda, DRC and
 Uganda and TAZARA, that serves principally Zambian traffic and some local traffic in
 Southern Tanzania.

 5.26          The TRC network is approximately 2,600 kilometers o fsingle-track meter
 gauge. The network's two main lines are: (i)the Central line (Dar es Salaam to Tabora,     '
 850 km, one line from there to Kigoma, 453 km, and another line to Mwanza, 386 km),
 and (ii) Tanga line, that runs from Tanga to Moshi and Arusha, with alengthof 430
         the
 km.Inaddition, there are 3 branch lines totaling some430 km.The Central andthe
 Tanga lines were built at the beginningo fthe century, while the branch lines were built
 inthe 1980s and 1990s.

 5.27          The TRC started movingtoward privatizationo fits non-core assets inthe
 early 199Os, underthe RailwayRestructuring project, when it leased its hotels, contracted
 out catering services, hived offmarine services and corporatized the Marine Services
 Company.

5.28           Privatization o fthe TRC rail network was also launchedunder the Railway
Restructuring project, inline with government's decision to privatize its state-owned
enterprises. The project funded international advisers to analyze possible strategies for
carrying out the privatization o f TRC. InMay 2001, the govemment decided to
restructure TRC to allow for award o f a vertically integrated concession comprising
TRC's whole rail network to a private rail operator. The government decided to create an
Asset Holding Company (AHC) to retain ownership o fthe railway infrastructure assets,
while the rolling stock would be sold or leasedto a private operator.

5.29           Since the track i s to remain the responsibilityo fthe government through the
Asset HoldingCo, the concession would not requirethe operator to returnassets at the
end o fthe concession inapre-determined physical condition, a condition that is common
inthe concessions ofroadprojects.

5.30          Some stakeholders inTanzania opined that privatization o f TRC should
proceed more slowly, startingwith a management contract that would have improved
condition o f facilities, improve management andprepare,foran eventual concession.

                                                22


 Irtvestmertt Requiremerits

 5.3 1          While the Railway Restructuring project financed substantial improvements
 to the rail track, substantial additional investments are required to complete rehabilitation
 o f the TRC track to a satisfactory condition. The main need is to fully replace the rail
 track between ltigi and Tabora, about 200 km. The cost is estimated at US$33 million.
 Funding for this work is available from the ongoing Bank project Central Transport
 Corridor Project (Credit 3888). The project considers several approaches to carry out the
 required improvements. Under some o f the approaches, the government would fund the
 improvements using funds from the credit; under other approaches, it is assumed that the
 concessionaire would be prepared to finance the cost o f the civil works.

 5.32           Inaddition to the track investments,rolling stock and locomotives need
 rehabilitation and repair, inpart becausepractically no government budgetary allocations
 have beenprovided to TRC since the decision was made to privatize TRC in 1997.


 Labor Issues

 5.33           TRC historically has been significantly overstaffed. While TRC personnel
was significantly reduced between 1990 and 2004 (from about 14,000 to some 8,500), a
private operator would be expected to further shrink staffing.

5.34           Most of the staff to be retrenched are track maintenance personnel. TRC
uses 0.8 staff per kilometer o f line for track maintenance, which is considered not
excessive for African railways. The concessionaire would have the option to outsource
such work, or further mechanize track maintenance. Mechanization, however, is
expensive (investments o f some US$7.5 million would be required) andthe experience
with the existing track maintenance equipment is poor, as the five existing tamping
machines are currently out o f service.

5.35           Addressing the staff retrenchment issue has been one o fthe mainproblems
inthe launchingofthe biddingprocess for the TRC concession. Legislationpassed
duringpreparation ofthe concession improvedthe compensation for retrenchedstaff and
allowed to continue with the preparation o f the bidding.The law dictates a higher relative
compensation for the staff at the lower salary levels.

5.36           Staffretrenchment has beena major issue inmost railway concessions
elsewhere. Inseveral cases, governments have requested financial assistance to help         .
finance the retrenchment. Some Bankprojects have been solely devoted to providing
such financing. The Tanzania government has beenreluctant to follow this approach, and
no external fundinghas beenprovidedto help fund retrenchment programs for enterprises
to be privatized.

TheFirst Bidding Process

5.37           The first biddingwas launchedinDecember2001, with the Request for Pre-
qualification proposals. The biddocument stipulated that the winning consortium would
bethe one willing to pay the highest fixed annual fee to the government. Seven firms

                                                23


 subniittcd proposals, of which four wcrc prequalified. Inthe end, only one biddcr
 attcndcd the bidders confcrcnce (in October 2002) and intended to submit a non-
 compliant bid. Thc govcrnnient rejccted the bid.

 Why Did the Bidding Fail?

 5.38          Several factors may explain the failure o f the first biddingattempt:

         Bidconditions:
                o Requirements for ahighvalue performance bond; an international rail
                     operator to be part o f the concessionaire~sconsortium; and, the
                     concessionaire to purchase the rolling stock
                o Availability at the same time o fother rail concessions inAfrica
                     offering softer terms
         Government's unwillingness to negotiate with a single qualified bidder for fear it
         would hurt the credibility of the whole privatizationprocess

 5.39          Government officials as well as private stakeholders interviewedby the
PPAR mission believed that the first factor above was the keyreason why the bid failed.
This was largely the responsibility of the transaction adviser, who appeared to lack the
requiredexperience. As a result, the biddocument was not suitable for achieving a
successful biddingprocess.

TheSecondBidding Process

5.40          The secondbiddingprocess was launched inJuly 2003, with request for pre-
qualificationproposals. A new Transaction Adviser was hiredto amend the bid
documents used inthe first bidding.

5.41          As inthe first bidding, the decision criteriainthis second round will be the
amount o f fixed annual fee the consortiumoffers to pay the government. Inaddition to .
this fee, there will be avariable fee that will depend on the level o ftraffic.

5.42          The secondround o f biddinghas softened the requirements, by lowering the
amount of the performance bond, not limitingpre-qualification to a freight rail operator
providing at least 26 percent equity, intemational rail operators, andproviding the option
for the private operator to purchase or lease TRC's rolling stock. Further, the new round
offers the concessionaire the option o f getting World Bank Partial Risk Guarantee which
it canuse with its financiers andwould protect the operator shouldthe Asset Holding .
Companynot fully meet its obligations.

Term, Bidders and ServiceIssues

5.43          The term ofthe TRC concession will be 25 years. This is a typical term for a
railway concession. Forthe second round o fbidding, two bids from pre-qualified bidders
were received on April 13,2005, and are currently being evaluated. Two branch lines
which provide noncommercial services will needto be included inthe franchise under a

                                               24


  Public Scrvice Obligation (PSO) Agreemcnt. This is a potential problem givcn the
  govemment's lack o f compliance with PSO commitments with TRC under the project.

  Summary Comparison Between Port and Railway Concession

  5.44         The ease with which the concession o f the DSMcontainer terminal was
  completed and the failure of the first bid for the TRC concession raise the question: why
  such a big difference inthe outcomes between the two privatization processes?

 5.45          This section aims to answer this question, providing a brief comparison of'
 the two concessions and highlightingthe factors that favored one and hinderedthe other.
 Four factors appear to be the key to explaining the differences: (a) the profit potentialand
 risks; (b) the level of investments required, (c) the size o f the labor issue, (d) location o f
 assets


 Profit Potential and Risks

 5.46          Port container terminals are normally money-makers, and the DSMterminal
 was no exception. Further, with worldwide expansion o f the containerizationrate, a well
 managed container terminal will have little risk that demandmay fall or be stagnant.

 5.47          Incontrast, most Afhcan railways lose money and it is difficult to turn them
 into profitable enterprises. Further, because the road networks are still developing, the
 railway traditionally provides many services, especially for passengers, where no
 alternative transport service exists. Such services generally have been offered at
 unprofitable rates. Inconcessioning the railways, governments require that the private
operator maintains such services and the existing rates, against a government
commitment to provide the railway compensation inthe form o fpublic service
obligations. However, experience shows, as happened duringimplementationo f the
Railway Restructuringproject, that provision o f such compensation i s rarely complied
with. Thus, a private operator would face significant financial risks when providing non-
commercial services. Insuch cases, assistance from international lending agencies can
help mitigatethis risk.


I nvestments

5.48           The lower the investment the private operator will be requiredto make
upfront, the more attractive the concession will be, and the more bidders will apply. This
was the case o fthe port, where no major investment was needed since the container
terminal was practically new at the time o f the concession. Further, the container terminal
infrastructure was limited: just two berths and an area for stacking the containers. Cranes
andrelated equipment were available, althoughthe private operator decided to purchase
more modem and efficient cranes to increase capacity. Cranes are mobile equipment that
the operator can at any time take out.

5-49          Bycontrast, railway assetsare large, bothinfrastructureandequipment.
TRC's facilities are inneedo fmajor track repairs, costing tens o fmillion dollars. In

                                                 25


  addition, the private operator, at lcast in thc first bidding was required to purchase any
  TRC rolling stock that it intended to use. Ifthe operator intendedto increase traffic, it
  would be rcquircd to purchase substantial additional equipment and sparc parts. Such
  investments requirements are clearly a deterrent. Governments should endeavor to secure
  financing to fund at least a part o f the required initial investments. Except for urgent
 repairs, concessionaires should make the investment decisions to ensure that they are cost
 effective.


 Labor

 5.50          As parastatal companies, ports and the railways generally are overstaffed,
 and this was the case with the DSMport and TRC. However, there were significant
 differences in the magnitude o f overstaffing between the railway and the port container
 terminal.

 5.5 1         While TRC has some 8,500 staff, which would be expectedto be reduced to
 about 4,000 when a private operator takes over, the DSMTerminal employed some 600
 prior to the concession, and now has slightly over 400. Thus, the labor issue i s
 significantly smaller inthe case ofthe port, therefore involving significantly lower
 fimdingto provide adequate compensation to staffretrenched. The advantage o fthe
 Container Terminal i s even greater when considering that the Terminal i s a profit-making
 entity with enough revenues to fund compensation o f laid-off staff. Incontrast, TRC
 requires government subsidies andprovision of additional allocations to provide
 retrenchment compensation.

5.52          Inadditionto the financial aspectrelatingto compensation for staff
retrenchment, the related social and political issues are significant and may translate into
major problems for a private operator.


Location of Assets and Ease of Management

5.53          The DSMcontainer terminal is located inTanzania's capital, and is
concentrated inone specific location. This makes it easy for the management to supervise
operations and attend promptly to any issues.

5.54          The opposite i s true for TRC. Railway facilities are scatteredover some
2,600 kilometers, and significant resourcesneedto be akcated for the maintenance o f
the infrastructure andequipment. Monitoring the condition o fthe track and equipment,
and the locationof equipment at any time normally requires significant humanand
technical resources, including sophisticated systems such as Railtrack.

  6.     Overall Lessons

  Limits to the Improvement of Parastatal Companies

 6.1            The port and the railway projects illustrate the difficulties o f improving
 parastatal performance and the limits o f what can be achieved. In the port, the differencc
 inoperational efficiency, staffproductivityand the quality of services betweenthe
 privatizedcontainer terminal and the performance as a public agency i s striking, and has
 led to a dramatic increase inthe level of container movements. Inthe railways, despite
 much financial and technical support from the project, and some improvement in
 performance, efficiency overall i s far from the targets anticipated at the start o f the
 project, and efficiency varied from one year to the next. Since rail traffic demand is
 essentially constrained by TRC's service, there i s little doubt that a private operator
 would improve capacity and ensure that the railway would carry as much traffic as it is
 available.


 Complexity of Railway Concessions

 6.2           Concessioning railways inA h c a and other developingregions to private
 operators i s hard to achieve because such railways generally lose money, are hugely        .
 overstaffed, require major investment infixed assets and equipment to attain a
 satisfactory operating condition, and are saddled with provision of non-commercial
 services that governments generally fail to compensate. Resolvingthese issues, which is a
 precondition to launching a privatizationprocess, often require long and protracted
 decisions involving both the executive and legislative branches o f government. Further,
 findingthe right balance inthe design o f aconcession bidbetween government interests
 and incentives to private operators to venture into a difficult businessi s problematic.

 Stretching Objectives and Targets

 6.3           Setting unrealistically highproject objectives and target i s not useful. While
some `stretch' intargets can encourage better performance, too big a stretch leads to
failed outcomes. That is the lesson from the railway project, where targets were set too
highfrom thebeginningoftheproject, andthe sameapproach continuedwhen anew
objective was added. Original traffic, operational efficiency and financial targets were    ,
clearly too high, to the extent that one o f the early supervision missions decided to lower
some o f the targets. When the privatizationobjective was incorporated, the expectation
that concessioning o f the railway would be achieved beforeproject closing was risky due
to the complexity o f railway concessioning. Thus, launchingthe biddingrather than
awarding a concession contract would have been a morerealistic target. Setting too high
targets was bound to lead to failed outcome, as it happened. Incontrast, the objective to
concession the container terminal o fthe Dar es Salaam port was feasible: it was a simpler
concession, the labor issue could be easily resolved, and the port container business is .
known to'attract private operators because it is generally profitable. A conclusion is that
there was no reason to set the same concession expectation inthe port and inthe railways
projects.

      'I'hc primary lessons learnt from thesc projects are that:


Thc frcedorn to opcrate according to market principles potentially makes the
operational efficiency o f privately run concessions superior to that o f parastal
organizations for ports and railways;

The concentration of investment with high volumes of traffic, lower operational
costs and relative autonomy from government, generally makesport concessions
a lower risk for investors than railways.

When railways are likely to incur losses andor are inadequately compensated for
uneconomic services, investors will be hardto attract;

The design o fprojects preparingparastatalcompanies for privatizationshould
take into account the capacity and commitment o f government and management
to carry through the reform process. Targets and timetables should be realistic.
Special care shouldbe placed inthe selection o f qualified consultants preparing
bidding documentation
