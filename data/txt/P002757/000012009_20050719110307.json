The audit confirms the following lessons. The\n            freedom to operate according to market principles\n            potentially makes the operational efficiency of privately\n            run concessions, superior to that of parastatal\n            organizations for ports and railways. Thus, the\n            concentration of investment with high volumes of traffic,\n            lower operational costs, and relative autonomy from\n            government, generally makes port concessions a relatively\n            low risk for investors. Yet, if railways are likely to incur\n            losses, and/or are inadequately compensated for uneconomic\n            services, investors will be hard to come, and therefore\n            bidding conditions, and the terms of the concession\n            agreement will need to take this fact into account. The\n            design of projects preparing parastatal companies for\n            privatization should also consider the capacity, and\n            commitment of government, and management to carry through\n            the reform process. Targets and timetables should be\n            realistic, and, special care should be placed in the\n            selection of qualified consultants preparing bidding documentation."}, "docdt": "2005-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
