Railways Corporation (TRC) (the Agreements)as amended to date. We
also refer to the letter from your Ministry, dated December 4, 1995,
requesting changes to onlending rates and procurement procedures for
the Project and to the discussions held during the recent supervision
mission of the Association.
     This letter is to inform you of our agreement to your request and
