   (PCR) for the Zou Province Rural Development Project in\n            Benin. The principal objectives of the project were to\n            improve rural incomes while simultaneously increasing\n            production of cotton and food crops and export. The project\n            was aimed at reversing the decline of cotton production in\n            the Zou province through the supply of inputs (fertilizers\n            and insecticides mainly), strengthening agricultural\n            services and facilitating the processing and marketing of\n            cotton. Over a period of five years, the project aimed at\n            reaching 38,000 families (about half the population of the\n            Zou province) and to increase annual production of cotton by\n            5,700 metric tons. Parallel improvements in food crop\n            production were expected to occur not only through residual\n            effects arising from fertilizers applied to cotton, but also\n            through improved genetic material and better farming\n            methods, including greater use of animal traction. Annual\n            targets of food crop increase were 5,200 tons of maize,\n            4,000 tons of groundnut, 3,300 tons of cowpeas and 400 tons\n            of paddy. The project also aimed to produce an additional\n            200 tons of tobacco per annum."}, "docdt": "1993-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
