 Province Rural Development Project are to improve the level\n            of rural incomes and to increase production of export and\n            food crops through strengthening and support of\n            institutions, integrated with applied research, seed\n            production, extension, cooperative training, and social\n            services. The project will be implemented over a\n            five-and-one-half year period. It is expected to reach some\n            38,000 farm families (about 50% of the Province's\n            total), and to generate an incremental production of 5,700 t\n            of cotton, 5,200 t of maize, 4,000 t of groundnuts, 3,300 t\n            of cowpeas, 400 t of paddy, and 200 t of tobacco. The\n            project's principal quantifiable benefit would derive\n            from the incremental production of cotton, food crops and\n            livestock products. Unquantifiable benefits include better\n            financial management of Government institutions, enhancement\n            of their capability to plan and implement development\n            activities, and the establishment of a firm basis for\n            adaptive food crop and cotton research, and for seed production."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
