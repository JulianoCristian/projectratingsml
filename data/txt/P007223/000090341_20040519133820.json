satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was highly likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that rural\n            communities can effectively and transparently manage\n            resources transferred by the central level and can hire\n            teachers following established procedures regardless of the\n            participants' educational level. Scaling-up\n            implementation of programs is important, particularly as\n            demonstrated by the multi-grade methodologies model.\n            Satisfactory results reached by the Project are largely due\n            to a sustained continuity in project coordination. Project\n            execution benefited by the application of a decentralized\n            administration of project activities, with the Project\n            Coordination Unit's (PCU's) main function as a\n            coordinating unit rather than the main implementer of\n            project activities. It is necessary to (i) provide timely\n            and relevant training to personnel in the operational units\n            of the Ministry responsible for the administrative and\n            financial areas; and (ii) permanently assign these technical\n            teams so that they can take charge of the implementation of\n            project activities, rather than have staff assigned\n            temporarily to activities but with the risk of constantly\n            losing them to other assignments. It is beneficial for\n            project execution if the Operations Manual of the Project is\n            adhered to closely. The Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) must\n            intensify efforts to take advantage of the favorable\n            atmosphere that exists in the country to increase budgetary\n            allocations destined to the education sector. The opening of\n            a special account in the Bank of Guatemala and hiring United\n            Nations Development Program (UNDP) as procurement agent,\n            helped to ease the administrative procedures for disbursing\n            resources from the loan and contributed to greater\n            transparency in the procurement and hiring processes. In\n            order to optimize the use of the resources and to reach the\n            goals and objectives of the MINEDUC, the activities and\n            programs of the Ministry should be systematic and timely."}, "docdt": "2004-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
