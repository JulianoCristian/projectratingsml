three years of school; a focus on gender equity,\n            bilingual education and decentralization of education\n            administration to encourage greater community participation;\n            and geographic focus on those areas most affected by decades\n            of internal conflict before the December, 1996 Peace\n            Accords. The project seeks to raise coverage and equity, the\n            first component, through increased pre-primary and primary\n            school enrollment in the poorest rural areas, emphasizing\n            reaching indigenous groups and girls by (a) expanding the\n            National Community-managed Program for Educational\n            Development; (b) offering afternoon shifts in existing\n            schools; and (c) expanding the \"Programa de la\n            Nina.\" The second component seeks to improve efficiency\n            and quality of rural basic education, resulting in reduced\n            drop-out and repetition rates, and improved student academic\n            achievement, mainly by supporting bilingual and multigrade\n            teaching methodologies. The third component seeks to\n            strengthen the organization and management of the education\n            ministry's normative and policymaking functions at the\n            central level, and support functions at the intermediate and\n            local levels, with community involvement in day-to-day\n            school organization and management."}, "docdt": "1997-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
