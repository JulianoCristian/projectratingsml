The\n            project did not achieve many of its objectives,\n            institutional development was negligible, sustainability is\n            unlikely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was less than satisfactory. Lessons learned from the project\n            are: (a) a project design successful for certain groups of\n            farmers is not necessarily applicable to others. Before\n            launching follow-up projects that include a new target\n            population, socio-economic surveys testing farmers response\n            are a necessary part of preparatory work, and should be\n            applied in pilot activities before major financing decisions\n            are taken; (b) the set-up of an independent project unit to\n            compensate for the weaknesses of existing Government\n            services has not proved to be a feasible alternative, as it\n            caused management problems and tense relations with the\n            local administration, but most importantly as it was\n            ultimately not sustainable financially. This lesson was\n            learnt at the same time in similar projects elsewhere in\n            Zaire; and (c) supervision missions should give close\n            attention to financial accounts even when project audit\n            reports give unqualified clearance of such accounts."}, "docdt": "1993-08-25T00:00:00Z"}
