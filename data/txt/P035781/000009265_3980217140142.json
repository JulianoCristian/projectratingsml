The project\n            consists of four components.  The first component will\n            provide technical assistance and training to develop Savings\n            and Credit Associations (SCAs) in the rural areas of\n            Moldova.  The second component is the establishment of\n            regulatory body of the SCAs, which will provide technical\n            assistance and training to the Rural Finance Project\n            Implementation Unit to temporarily supervise and regulate\n            SCAs, develop the framework for a permanent regulatory body\n            of SCAs, and finance year-end audits of SCAs established\n            under the project.  The third component is the establishment\n            of the Rural Finance Corporation (RFC), which will operate\n            according to agreed prudential rules and an agreed policy\n            manual, specifying RFC's lending polices.  The fourth\n            component will provide a credit line to RFC, who in turn\n            will extend loans exclusively to SCAs operating in the rural areas."}, "docdt": "1997-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
