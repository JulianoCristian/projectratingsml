Despite success, some lessons should\n            be emphasized. Future financing of savings and credit\n            associations by financial institutions should be linked to\n            matching funds provided from the internal mobilization of\n            savings, and resources of the Savings and Credit Association\n            (SCA), so as to support the development of the SCA system.\n            To this end, more than one financial intermediary would be\n            preferable, where interested commercial banks that meet the\n            agreed eligibility, should be permitted to participate in\n            the project. However, capitalization should be established\n            as a priority, before lending expansion, particularly for\n            institutions like the Rural Finance Corporation (RFC) and\n            SCAs, in order to mitigate lending risks. Consequently,\n            lending norms should be based on the ability to minimize\n            such risks, where loan limits should not be increased until\n            such norms, and regulations are in place. It is also\n            reinforced that stronger implementation coordination among\n            the agencies involved - the Project Implementation Unit,\n            RFC, and nongovernmental organizations - could have further\n            increased project success, and contributed to lower costs.\n            Similarly, stronger coordination among the large number of\n            donor funds, could have ensured sustainability, reduced\n            reliance on donor funds, and endured lower operational\n            costs. Other lessons suggest training options, a fee-based\n            technical assistance, strengthened regulatory capacity of\n            the State Supervisory Body of SCAs, and precautionary\n            financial clauses to adhere by, and phase out subsidies."}, "docdt": "2001-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
