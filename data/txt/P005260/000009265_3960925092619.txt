FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2068-JO)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth
Education Project in Jordan, for which Loan 2068-JO in the amount of US$25.0m.
was approved on December 15, 1981. The loan war closed on December 31, 1989,
two years behind schedule. Actual disbursements amounted to USS 18.1m, about
USS 6.9m. leas than the approved amount.   Two cancellations in the amounts of
US$3,576,000 and US$3,302,998 were made on December 31, 1988 and June 30, 1990
respectively.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Division of the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Part I, Part III), and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started in May, 1990 and is based,
inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and Project Agreements,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and
internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
JORDAN
FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2068-JO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Proiect Obiectives
1.          The design of this project followed closely the objectives of
Jordan's 1981-85 National Development Plan with regard to education and
training. The Plan put heavy emphasis on the accelerated fo-rmation of skilled
workers and technicians, mainly through formal education. Accordingly, the
project aimed to (a) meet what was identified as a critical lack of skilled
workers and technicians required for industrial development of the south of
the country; (b) ensure an adequate supply of subject matter teachers for
general vocational and industrial secondary schools, and for vocational
streams of comprehensive schools and trade training centers; (c) provide
increased general and occupational education by converting existing teacher
training institutes into community colleges; (d) contribute to the ongoing
increase of general vocational secondary schools and trade training centers;
and (e) alleviate shortages of qualified paramedical, nursing and mid-wifery
personnel required for the basic health-care programs. These objectives were
pursued through investment in the components identified and appraised. (Part
I, paras. 3.01, 3.02).
Implementation Record
2.          Project implementation proceeded, on the whole, according to the
initial estimates. The only exception to this pattern was the Nursing/
Paramedical Institute at Irbid, whose implementation delays resulted in a 2-
year postponement of the loan Closing Date (Part I, para 4.02). The"e was a
significant shortfall in estimated final disbursements (from US $25.Om to US
$18.1m - see Part III, Table 4), due to lower costs resulting from, inter
alia, (a) rising foreign exchange rates and (b) strong competition among local
construction firms. Furthermore, the multiplicity of public entities involved
in the project's execution (Part I, para 5.03) resulted in lack of
coordination and delays (but it did not prevent the eventual successful
completion of all project components).
Proiect Results and Sustainabilitv
3.          Of the various project components, the VTC tr&ining center outside
Amman, the technical teacher training program of Marka Polytechnic, and the
two community colleges in Salt and Howwara function as planned, and are
producing the expected benefits. Furthermore, these benefits appear to be



- iv -
sustainable over the foreseeable future, on the basis of the quality of their
managemant, institutional arrangements, and demand for their services.
4.          In contrast, the expected benefits from the Tafilah Polytec.nic,
the Irbid Nursing/Paramedical Institute, and the four General Vocational
Secondary Schools have not yet realized their full potential, as anticipated
at project appraisal:
(a)   Enrollments for technician training at the Tafilah Polytechnic are
about 60% of the initial projections at appraiual, due to lack of
local demand for its graduates and lack of dormitory space. In
addition, due to the creation of the Ministry of Higher Bducation
in 1985, and transfer of the Polytechnic under its jurisdiction
(and also due to the establishment of a vocational secondary
school in Tafilah), the initially planned enrollments of 200
secondary level technical students did not materialize (Part I,
paras. 6.02, 7.03).
(b)   The nursing program at the Irbid Institute currently operates at
about half its capacity. The reason is that strict requirements
for practical training in local hospitals, combined with limited
hospital facilities, keep student numbers low, despite the strong
demand for qualified nurses (Part I, paras. 6.03, 7.04).
(c)   The Vocational Schools are also functioning at less than planned
capacity. The schools do not generally offer the initially
planned trade training courses (which are now almost exclusively
offered by VTC). In addition, continuing education programs are
also not operating at the levels initially anticipated (Part I,
paras. 6.04, 7.05, 7.06).
S.          With regard to project sustainability, it is expected that the
Tafilah Polytechnic, the Irbid Nursing/Parimedical Institute and the General
Vocational Secondary schools will achieve their full potential in the future
based on the demand for their services and specific changes in the way these
institutions are operated (paras 7.02-7.06 refer). On the other hand, the
vocational training center, the teacher training program at the Marka
Polytechnic and the two community colleges function as anticipated at
appraisal and are producing the estimated benefits.
6.          With regard to the sustainability of the GVSSe, it should be noted
that one of the objectives of the Human Resources Sector Investment project
(Loan 3106-JO) which is currently under implementation, is to examine the
future of the GVSSs in the context of a broader reassessment of vocational
secondary education. To ensure adequate upkeep of project institutions the
Government intends to pursue the recommendations for a maintenance program
proposed in a maintenance study financed under the Seventh Education project
(Loan 2890-JO). Ongoing technical assistance (financed under ongoing World



Bank loans for Jordan) is also facilitating the upgrading of teachers and the
improvement of instruction in schools to ensure the sustainability and quality
of programs.
Lessons Learned
7.          The project experience provides the following lessons:
(a)   Project risks, including those arising from exogenous factors,
need to be ident' ied more conservatively. In the present case,
the risks of a drastic slow-down in economic growth and of
substantial underutilization of project facilities were not
adequately highlighted (Part I, para 4.03, 6.02).
(b)   Project design should make special arrangements for supporting
counterpart agencies with no previous involvement with Bank
projects, especially in cases of complex projects such as this
(Part I, paras. 4.02, 5.03, 9.03).
(c)   Proper timing, staffing, and personnel continuity of supervision
missions are critical for effective and efficient project
implementation (Part I, para.8.02).

2. Proiect Background
2.01        In the late 1970s and early 1980s Jordan's economy was growing at
the rapid pace of 9% p.a. (the mining and manufacturing sentors were growing
at 18% p.a.). The main determinant of high economic growth was the ability of
the country to benefit from booming conditions in oil-exporting Gulf
countries, by utilizing its better skillead labor force (in comparison to other
countries in the region) in local production for exports to those countries
and in lucrative temporary employment abroad.
2.02        The importance of labor skills for rapid growth of an otherwise
resource-scarce country led the Government to invest heavily in training and
education. The 1981-85 Development Plan allocated the equivalent of US $650m.
to investment in education and US $30m. to investment in training (for a total
of about 5% of GNP).
2.03        The principal priorities of the 1981-8S Plan with regard to
education were to: (a) increase enrollments in secondary vocational education
(grades 10-12) to 30% of total secondary school enrollment; (b) expand the
provision of basic schooling (grades 1-9) from 91% to 94% of the corresponding
age group; (c) expand the access of children from rural families to prepara-
tory (grades 7-9) and secondary schools; (d) improve the ui3ality of education
by means of adequate laboratories, equipment, teaching aids and libraries; and
(e) expand technician education (grades 13-14).



-2-
2.04        The heavy emphasis on secondary vocational education was decided
upon by Jordanian planners because of (a) doubts that nonformal vocational
training would be acceptable by sufficient numbers of Jordanian families as
the final stage of pre-employment academic activities for their children; and
(b) awareness that the narrowness of Jordan's industrial base limited the
potentia' for the required on-the-job portion of vocational training.
2.05        The Bank fvlly supported the Government's strategy in the sector,
and wao prepared to continue its substantial participation in Jordan's educa-
tion investment, following three previous projects in 1972-1979.
3. Proiect Obiectives and DescriRtion
3.01        The project aimed to (a) meet what was believed to be a critical
lack of skilled workers and technicians required for industrial development of
the south of the country; (b) ensure an adequate supply of rocational subject
teachers for general vocational and industrial secondary schools, and for
vocational streams of comprehensive schools and trale training centers; (c)
provide increased post secondary general and occupational education by
converting existing teacher training institutes into community colleges; (d)
contribute to the ongoing increase of general vocational secondary schools and
trade training centers; and (e) alleviate shortages of qualified paramedical,
nursing and mid-wifery pernonnel required for the basic health-care programs.
3.02        In pursuit of these objectives the project included construction,
equipment and furniture for: (a) a new Polytechnic in the southern town of
Tafilah; (b) expansion and quality improvement of the technical teacher
training program at the Marka Polytechnic; (c) conversion of the teacher
training ochools of Salt and Howwara into community colleges; (d) four new
general vocational secondary schools (GVSSs) around Amman; (e) a new
vocational training center northwest of Amman; and (f) a new nursing/
paramedical institAte in Irbid (NPITI). The project also included specialist
services and fellowships (under UNDP funding) aimed at better utilization of
the physical components.
4. Prolect Desion and Oraanization
4.01        By following closely the objectives of the 1981-85 Development
Plan, which emphasized the accelerated formation of skilled workers and
technicians, mainly through formal education, the projec't was remarkably
coherent despite the disparity and large number of its components, and the
multiplicity of intervening agencies (Ministry of Educat..on (HOE), Vocational
Training Corporation 'VTC), Ministry of Health (MOH), National Planning
Council (N2C)]. Project identification took place in October 1979 followed by
a preparation mission in September 1980. An appraisal mission was fielded in
January 1981 and the loan became effective in June 1982.



-3-
4.02        In retrospect, the project design waa overly optimistic with
regard to MOH's ability to implement its component on time. MOH's lack of
experience with Bank supported projects, combined with site changes and
related problems, contributed to major delays in the beginning stages of the
construction and equipping of the NPITI. The establishment of a Project
Management Unit (PMU) for the implementation of a Primary Health Care Project
in 1985 speeded up the implementation process, but apparently it came too late
to prevent the delays.
4.03        At the design stage, the exrectation that rapid economic growth
would be a long-term phenomenon, particularly for the south of the country,
fostered the strategy that coverage of remote areas by education facilities
was desirable on grounds of decentralization and regional development, _ven if
there was some underutilization of investment. This thesis led to the
specific choice of location for the Tafilah Polytechnic, which resulted in the
underutilization of the facility (see para 6.02).
4.04        In terms of organization, the implementation strategy addressed
the issue of muVliplicity of executing agencies: the National Planning Council
(NPC) assumed the role of coordinating agency, and the key staff of the three
implementing agencies received specific training in management and procurement
under the project. Project experience indicated that these arrangements were
generally effective in fulfilling their tasks (see, however, para 5.03), even
though lack of experience with implementing Bank projects at MOH did result in
significant delays. Project coordination was facilitated by the ability of
the Government to maintain stable management teams, and by the decision to
place the UNDP-financed TA program under a single executing agency, the Bank.
5.  Project I'plementation
5.01        Apparently based on the lessons learned from the previous three
Bank-fina-ced projects, which took considerably longer than the %ppraisal
estimate co be completed, a more realistic implementation schedule was
establl 4ied for the project. The construction, furnishing and equipping of
all institutions were originally scheduled to be completed by January of 1987,
while the TA component was to be completed by June 1987, after five and a half
years of implementation. Actually, construction of all project components was
completed slightly ahead of schedule, except for the NPITI, the completion of
which was delayed by approximately three years.  Procurement of eq;ipm4ent and
furniture for the MOE components took somewhat longer than estimated. It
lagged behind by about 6-12 months, but was nevertheless completed before the
original Closing Date. Ninety-five percent (95%) of the TA component was
completed on schedule, but delayed nominations of two MOH short-term
fellowships made it necessary for the TA contract with Oklahoma State
University (OSU) to be extended to December 1988, about one year after the
original contract closing date.
5.02        Another significant variation between initial estimates and actual
outcome during implementation was project costs (estimated at US$ 50.9m, while



-4-
the amount actually spent was US$ 30.8m). Due to the sharp increase in
foreign exchange rates compared with domestic inflation and keen competition
within the Jordanian construction industry, actual project costs declined
significantly with no adverse effect on the achievement of project objectives.
Approximately US$6.9 million in loan funds were unutilized and cancelled.
5.03        During implementation, the project teams of the MOE, VTC and MOH
worked independently of each other, with the NPC (which later became the
Ministry of Planning) responsible for coordination between the agencies. This
detached nature of implementation contributed to the fact that the MOH did not
fully benefit from MOE experience in executing Bank projects. Nevertheless,
the project was generally well implemented and, except for the NPITI, its main
componants were completed at an opportune time to assist the Government i
meeting its major educational objectives. It should be noted, however, that,
with the exception of MOH's lack of experience with the implementation process
of Bank-financed projects, risks leading to implementation delays were not
generally identified at the design and preparation stages (see paras. 6.01-
6.04).
6. Proiect Results
6.01        Several of the project's components function as planned, and are
producing the expected benefits. Such is the case with the vocational
training center outside Amman, the technical teacher training program at Marka
Polytechnic, and the two community colleges resulting from the expansion of
former teacher training schools. On the other hand, problems exist with
regard to the expected demand for skilled workers and technicians in the south
of the country (Tafilah Polytechnic). There have also been delays in
alleviating shortages of qualifiad paramedical, nursing and mid-wifery
personnel (Irbid Nursing/Paramedical Institute).  In addition, there are some
discrepancies between anticipated and actual utilization of the project's four
GVSSs. (The general questions on the proper role of GVSSs, raised by the
observed discrepancies, are discussed in paras. 7.05-7.06).
6.02        Regarding demand for skilled labor in the south, it is clear that
the slackening of economic activity since the mid-80s has reduced such demand
in general. Furthermore, existing industries in the south have developed
their own training programs and/or hire graduates from other institutions. As
a result, local industry appears indifferent to the potential of the Tafilah
Polytechnic for upgrading its labor force. On the supply side, also, there
have been variances from expected results. The Polytechnic was designed to
offer technician training to 300 post-secondary students, and trade training
to 200 (grade 10-11) secondary students. It actually has 180 post-secondary
students for technician training, and 150 teacher trainees in Arabic language
streams. The transfer of authority over the Polytechnic from the MOE to the
Ministry of Higher Education (established in 1985) explains the absence of
skilled-worker level trade training courses (which would make it difficult to
attract adequate numbers of appropriate candidates in any case, in view of the
existence of a recently built GVSS in Tafilah and the generally reduced demand



-5-
for skilled labor).  Initiatives have been made to utilize the Polytechnic's
excellent facilities and equipment Zor offering 4-year post-secondary
technology courses. Also, the absence of qualified candidates in Tafilah
itself makes it necessary to provide dormitory space for out-of-town students.
Existing dormitories can easily accommodate 200 and, if necessary, up to 300
students.
6.03        The Irbid Institute has begun operating following a 3-year
implementation delay mentioned in para 5.01. However, its nursing program
operates at less than half the planned capacity (Part III, Table 10) because
strict requirements for practical training in local hospitals combined with
limited hospital facilities kept student numbers low, despite the strong
demand for qua.lified nurses.
6.04        Finally, the project'li four GVSSs function at considerably below
their planned capacity regarding formal vocational education. The main cause
of this appears to be that preparatory education was recently expanded to
include grade 10 (and secondary education correspondingly limited to grades
11-12). In addition, the project schools do not generally offer trade
training courses as planned (the few remaining programs are being transferred
over to the Vocational Training Corporation).  Furthermore, continuing
education programs operate at a fraction of their initially foreseen size.
The combined result is that the anticipated intensive use of facilities and
equipment has not materialized.
7. Proiect Sustainabilitv
7.01        As noted in para 6.01, the vocational training center, the teacher
training program at Marka Polytechnic, and the two community colleges function
as expected and are producing the estimated benefits. These benefits appear
to be sustainable over the foreseeable future, on the basis of the quality of
their management, institutional arrangements, and demand for their services.
7.02        On the other hand, at project completion, the expected benefits
from the Tafilah Polytechnic, the Irbid Nursing/Paramedical Institute, and the
four General Vocational Secondary Schools were not realized to the extent
anticipated at the design stage of the project. This does not mean that these
components should be considered as failures and/or that all the factors which
produced the current situation could or should have been foreseen at the
design stage. Rather, the sustainability of almost all of these components
can be assured, if some changes in the form of their operation are introduced
as noted below.
7.03        The Tafilah Polytechnic can be utilized at or close to capacity if
the Ministry of Higher Education makes a determined effort to promote it among
local industry and to attract the necessary number of students from around the
country. The latter may necessitate construction of some additional dormitory
space, but first the existing space will have to be used to the maximum.
Efforts to make the existing 2-year post-secondary technician program



-6-
successful could be combined with the introduction of a 4-year technology
program (in order to better utilize the school's excellent equipment and
facilities) and continuation of the teacher training program mainly directed
at Tafilah residents (in order to better utilize existing classrooms and to
lessen the need for additional dormitory space).
7.04        The Irbid Nursing/Paramedical Institute will be fully utilized in
a few years' time, even if current rigid requirements for practical training
are retained, when two hospitals currently under construction are completed in
the Irbid area. Full utilization can be achieved earlier if practical train-
ing requirements are amended, without adversely affecting the qualifications
of graduites. These amendments are already under discussion in the Ministry
of Health.
7.05        The future of the four project GVSSs needs to be examined in the
context of a broader reassessment of vocational secondary education. After
several years of incremental investment, the Vocational Training Corporation
has developed into a successful supplier of skilled workers. At the other end
of the spectrum, there were in 1988, fifty-six (56) community colleges (35
public and 21 private) offering ninety (90) specializations at the technician/
para-professional level. Within this setting, it should be carefully examined
what training needs GVSSs are meeting. This examination should take account
of the fact that the cost per student of GVSSs is about double that of
academic secondary schools as well as that unemployment among GVSS graduates
is increasing. It should also include a review of the services provided by
community colleges, and of their role as suppliers of skilled workers and
technicians (a similar recommendation was been made in the Audit Report for
the Third Education Project Loan 1781-JO).
7.06        If the decision is made to de-emphasize vocational secondary
education, the benefits of the project's investment can be sustained (and even
increased) by some re-arrangement of facilities. For example, some or all of
GVSSs' equipment and specialized instructors could be transferred to VTC
centers and/or community colleges; and the buildings could house secondary
academic schools, for which there is ample demand.
8. Bank Performance
8.01        The most noteworthy feature of the Bank's performance in the
initial stages of the project was the development, appraisal and acceptance of
a project involving three separate government entities, interconnected through
the NPC (which, as mentioned above, later became the Ministry of Planning).
Although the risks affecting implementation and utilization of facilities were
not totally identified at appraisal, Bank performance was satisfactory at this
stage. A comprehensive identification of all the risks was difficult,
especially during a period of rapid economic growth and acute skilled labor
shortages, which was the case in 1981 when the project was appraised.



-7.
8.02        Although 18 supervision missiono have been reported (Part III,
Annex II), about five of these missions were considered to be 'limited'
supervision reviews carried out by only one staff member and for less than one
week's duration. Given the complexity of project components, especially with
regard to the NPITI, it would have been more efficient to field missions of a
longer duration, composed of relevant education specialists particularly in
the later years of project implementation, so as to facilitate follow-up
actions and recommendations as well as identify issues for effective solution.
Nevertheless, the Bank performed effectively during project implementation.
On the whole, it acted efficiently as the executing agency in selecting and
monitoring the consultants (Oklahoma State University) for the UNDP financed
Technical Assistance component (see Sections 4 and 11). The management of the
fellowship program by the Bank was demanding in terms of daily monitoring,
administration and professional inputs. Nevertheless, the TA objectives were
met to the satisfaction of the Government and UNDP. The Bank also responded
promptly to the Government request to set up a Special Account and later on to
increase the disbursement percentage for civil works and to finance mainte-
nance mobile units for activities supplementary to the original project
objectives. Requests for Closing Date extensions and various activities
related to implementation, procurement and disbursement were also handled
promptly.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01        The Government performed efficiently in expediting actions
required for the planned project activities through loan Effectiveness.  The
Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which was established in the MOE for
implementing the first three education projects, was strengthened by
additional technical staff and eventually developed into the Directorate of
Project Implementation. The project teams for the implementation of the VTC
and MOH components were in place well in advance of loan effectiveness.
9.02        MOE and VTC performance regarding physical implementation was
exemplary: consultant architects/engineers for the construction of all project
civil works were appointed and equipment/furniture lists prepared on schedule.
Suitable MOE and VTC fellowship participants to the TA component were nomi-
nated in a timely manner. In contrast, physical implementation of the MOH
component experienced the delays described in Sections 4 to 6 and the fellow-
ship program was delayed by one year.
9.03        it should also be noted, however, that insufficient use was made
of the Special Account (see Section 8). The first (and only) deposit in the
Special Account took place in July 1986. At project closing 3 1/2 years
later, less than half of that deposit had been expended. Normally, full
replenishment of special accounts should occur every 4 to 6 months. Staff of
the Procurement Unit did not take full advantage of a number of available
procurement practices other than ICB. Local funds were adequately provided,
except during the last two years of implementation, when the progress of



project activities was hampered by acute shortages of local funding due to the
worsening economic situation.
10.   Compliance with Covenants
10.01       Loan covenants were generally complied with satisfactorily
although some difficulty was experienced with finalizing the refinement of the
tracer system and related studies. Progress reporting was ragular and of good
quality. Year-end financial statements were routinely received in fulfillment
of the audit reporting requirement.
11. Proiect Relationship
11.01       Working relations between Bank missions and the project teams were
excellent during project preparation and through the entire period of imple-
mentation. In particular, relations between the Bank project team and the MOE
Directorate of Project Implementation (which has subsequently grown into a
larger General Directorate of Projects and School Buildings) were marked by a
spirit of cooperation and mutual trust. That was also true of the VTC and the
NPC. As a result, implementation of the MOE and the VTC components went
smoothly and issues were quickly resolved as they occurred.
12. Consulting Services
12.01       Both of the main TA components--expatriate services in Jordan, and
an on-campus training program at OSU for Jordanian participants--were in
general executed on time and with satisfactory results regarding project
objectivee.
12.02       One exception appears to have been training at OSU for MOH
participants. Due to lack of the required training programs on campus, as
well as in the Medical School of the University of Oklahoma, where some of the
training courses were offered, trainees reportedly were placed in existing
university programs which were not entirely compatible with their intended
positions in Jordan upon their return. This shortcoming could be corrected in
future projects if the Government included in TA contracts the condition that
if a contractor does not possess the required training facilities and programs
on campus, it would be obligated to find a subcontractor that specializes in
such programs.
12.03      A different, and more general, problem also arose because of the
apparent failure of Jordanian officials and OSU representatives in Jordan to
brief prospective trainees in detail about training and living conditions in
the U.S. The problem was compounded by a certain neglect of OSU staff to
respond to the trainees' cultural sensitivities. As a result, many trainees
felt personal frustration and disappointment, and their performance was
probably less satisfactory than it could have been otherwise. Nevertheless,



-9-
on their return to Jordan, the trainees were placed in positions relevant to
their training.
13.   Proiect Documentation and Datg
13.01       The appraisal report was well documented and a valuable tool for
the HOE, KOH and VTC teams in implementing the project.  The project working
papers however were limited to only: (i) architectural and educational
worksheets and, (ii) the TA schedule. Their usefulness is therefore
restricted to civil works and TA. Data for the project completion report were
readily accessible at the MOE and MOH, but data for the VTC component were not
all available, as these records (eight years old) had been retired.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Comments on Part I
The preparation of this part is completely well carried out and
wholly covering the various components of the project. Consequently, it is
accepted and approved by the MOE as a borrower.
2.    Bank Performance:
Although the successive Bank Missions faced some difficulties in
the initial stages of the project, especially in the appraising stage, which
were due to the involvement of three separate government entities, and most of
thn risks that affected implementation and utilization of facilities were not
totally identified at appraisal, the MOE considers the Bank Performance as
very satisfactory.
3.    Borrower Performance:
The Project Implementation Unit that was established in the MOE
for implementing the first three education projects has implemented all the
components of the project accurately and in a timely manner. But, in
contrast, physical implementation of the MOH component experienced the delays
in both, the construction and the fellowships, by one year. The civil works
were appointed and executed, and equipment furniture were prepared and
imported on schedule. The Technical Assistance component was prepared and
fellowship participants and consultants were nominated in time.
4.    Lessons Learned:
The project experience provides the following lessons:
(a)   Project design is preferable to be made for each government entity
separately. In the present case, there were risks as a result of
the slow implementation of MOH as a counterpart.
(b)   Proper timing, staffing and supervision missions are essential for
project implementation to be effective and efficient.
(c)   MOE has acquired the experience in executing Bank-financed
projects as it is now fully aware of the Bank procedures.

the initial difficulties in identifying an appropriate site at Irbid for
construction of the Nursing/Paramedical Institute. Further delays resulted
subsequently from the need to revise the design of the foundation, after the
initial design was reviewed by Bank staff.
