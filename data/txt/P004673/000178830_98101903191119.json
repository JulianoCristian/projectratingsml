the acquisition and\n            installation of a 310 MW oil-fired thermal unit, Unit No. 4,\n            at the South Bangkok power station located about 10 km\n            southeast of Bangkok on the Chao Phya River, together with\n            related equipment and engineering and consultant services.\n            The South Bangkok power station was designed for\n            high-efficiency base-load service by EGAT's consultants\n            for thermal projects. Present plans are for the installation\n            of five units with a total capacity of 1,500 MW at this\n            station. Unit No. 1 (200 MW) was commissioned in December\n            1970 and Unit No. 2 (200 MW) and Unit No. 3 (310 MW) are\n            expected to come into operation in December 1971 and 1973,\n            respectively. The timing of the installation of Unit No. 5\n            is being kept under review in the light of the demand for energy."}, "docdt": "1971-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
