Project\n            is designed to support several of the policy changes needed\n            in Brazil's program of structural adjustment.  Its\n            primary objectives will be to support the process of making\n            the agricultural credit system more market-oriented and of\n            reducing rural credit subsidies, and to bring about a reform\n            in trade and pricing policy for key agricultural\n            commodities.  To meet these objectives, the project will\n            support important changes in Government policies affecting\n            interest rates on official rural credit; trade and price\n            controls; risk management and financing for holders of\n            agricultural stocks; and market information systems.  The\n            loan will be disbursed in two tranches. All of the first\n            tranche and US$100 million of the second tranche will be\n            used to finance general imports.  Of the balance of US$100\n            million, US$75 million will be used to fund a new\n            dollar-denominated line of credit devoted to providing\n            much-needed finance for commodities held for the domestic\n            market. The other US$25 million will be made available to\n            finance equipment and technical assistance for the\n            development of new marketing instruments and a continued\n            program of agricultural policy studies."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
