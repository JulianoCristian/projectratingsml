The\n            project consists of three parts: (i) development of six\n            pilot projects, of about 4,000 ha each, introducing\n            technical packages for annual and perennial crops and\n            livestock; (ii) improvement and expansion of agricultural\n            and livestock extension programs in the humid tropics, with\n            emphasis on the areas of influence of the pilot projects;\n            and (iii) support for the tropical agricultural and\n            livestock research programs. The technical, social, and\n            administrative packages developed as a result of the project\n            would be applicable to a wider area of about 660,000 ha\n            having similar ecological and socio-economic conditions. The\n            proposed pilot projects would directly benefit about 3,000\n            smallholders and cooperative farmers, the majority of which\n            have incomes below the relative poverty level in Mexico."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
