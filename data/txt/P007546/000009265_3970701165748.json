The main project objective was to intensify and\n            increase agricultural production in Mexico's tropical\n            lowlands. In the early 1970s, the Mexican Government began\n            to shift its agricultural development priorities to rain fed\n            areas which comprised 75 % percent of the cropped land and\n            85 percent of the farms. Part of this shift involved the\n            development of its tropical lowlands which were estimated to\n            contain about 3.5 million hectares of unused or\n            underutilized land of high agricultural potential. The\n            project resulted in increased (340 percent) crop area\n            harvested, increased yields and improved access to markets.\n            The overall incremental production is estimated at about 50\n            percent over pre-project levels. Although there is\n            considerable variation between pilot projects, the overall\n            economic rate of return has been estimated at 18 percent (17\n            percent at appraisal). Indirect benefits include improvement\n            in health, educational and nutritional status of beneficiaries."}, "docdt": "1985-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
