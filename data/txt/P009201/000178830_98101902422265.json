is to generate\n            economic growth with a focus on individual farmers in its\n            least developed communes. This is to be done through the\n            development of a more productive individual sector and\n            through strengthening the institutional capacity of Kosovska\n            Banka Pristina and the Federation of Cooperatives, Kosovo.\n            The project aims to increase individual sector on-farm\n            investments for livestock, crops, fruit and vegetable\n            production with short-term credit for about 36,000 tons of\n            fertilizer consumption. In addition, the project proposes to\n            strengthen and improve provincial services, such as\n            marketing opportunities; upgrade village access roads;\n            support the Province's land consolidation program;\n            improve rural communications; and finally to contribute to\n            institution building within KBP, the Federation of\n            Cooperatives and the Institute for Economic Development."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
