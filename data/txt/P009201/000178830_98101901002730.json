In addition, the project proposes to\n            strengthen and improve provincial services, such as\n            marketing opportunities; upgrade village access roads;\n            support the Province's land consolidation program;\n            improve rural communications; and finally to contribute to\n            institution building within KBP, the Federation of\n            Cooperatives and the Institute for Economic Development."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
