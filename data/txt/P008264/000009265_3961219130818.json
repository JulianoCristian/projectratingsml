Lessons\n            learned: 1) a \"learning by doing\" approach is an\n            effective method for developing a flexible, demand driven\n            project in a transition economy while providing for\n            immediate and visible results. The approach does not\n            compromise project quality; on the contrary, it results in\n            more meaningful project preparation and provides for\n            built-in project adaptability to a changing environment; (b)\n            the participation of future borrowers in the design of a\n            credit program can lead to greater ownership and reduced\n            risk. In Albania, village intermediation, using\n            village-level solidarity, can very effectively limit the\n            risk of small credit; and (c) the pilot project's\n            bottom-up approach for rural infrastructure rehabilitation\n            created some competition and bureaucratic rivalries with the\n            central government ministries that advocate and pursue a\n            top-down approach. Some ministries appeared to be resentful\n            of Albanian Development Fund (ADF's) large donor\n            budget, its low costs for rural works, and its flexibility\n            and quickness."}, "docdt": "1996-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
