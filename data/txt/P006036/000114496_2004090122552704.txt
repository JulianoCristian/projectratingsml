Re:
ARGENTINA - Loan 3520-AR Second Yacyreta 
Hydroelectric Project Amendment to the 
Loan Agreement
Dear Minister Cavallo:
We refer to the Loan Agreement for the above referenced Project, entered 
into between the Argentine Republic (the Borrower) and the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), dated November 16, 1992.
We also refer to the letter sent by Entidad Binacional Yacyretd to the 
Bank, dated July 22, 1993, requesting to increase to 100% the disbursement 
percentage for all expenditures made under Category 1 of the table set forth in 
paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement (for civil works).
Based on such request, the Bank is prepared to amend the text of the column 
"% of Expenditures to be Financed" of such table, related to Category 1, by 
increasing the amount therein set forth, from $130,000,000 equivalent to 
$184,000,000, and by changing the percentage to be disbursed after such amount is 
reached, from 57% to 44%.
The table set forth in paragraph I of Schedule I to the Loan Agreement 
should then read as follows:
Amount of
the Loan
   % of 
Allocated
Expenditures 
   (Expressed in US
   to be
   Dollar Equivalent)
  Financed
(1)
Civil works for Part A 
of the Project
252,500,000
100% until withdrawals 
under
this Category have reached 
an
amount equivalent to
$184,000,000 and 44%
thereafter
(2)
Engineering services for 
Part A of the
 36,900,000
100%
Project
(3) Consultants' services:
100%
   (a) for Part B of the Project
  1,000,000
   (b) for Part C of the Project
  9,000,000
   (c) for Part D of the  Project     600,000
TOTAL:
300,000,000
If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign the attached copy 
of this letter, as the duly authorized representative of the Borrower.  The 
amendment shall become effective upon receipt, by the Bank, of such copy duly 
countersigned by you.
Sincerely yours,
