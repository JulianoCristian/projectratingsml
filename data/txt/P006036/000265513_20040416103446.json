The\n            Requesters state that the environment and the standards of\n            living have been compromised due to the filling of the\n            reservoir for the hydroelectric project and that there was a\n            lack of proper supervision in the environmental and\n            resettlement activities. The Requesters allege that the\n            filling of the reservoir caused the water to become to\n            stagnant and polluted and contaminated the drinking water;\n            affected sanitation in the area; destroyed crops; flooded\n            farmlands; disrupted fish migration by damming the river.\n            Social impacts included a loss of jobs, livelihood, and\n            forced resettled to inadequate housing.  The Requesters also\n            state that the Bank has been lax in their overall\n            supervision of the project.  The Management Response replied\n            to the claims, stating that the problems listed by the\n            Requesters were not caused by the Bank's lack of\n            supervision and that all environmental and resettlement\n            activities had met certain criteria in order to be completed."}, "docdt": "1996-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
