NOTICE OF REGISTRATION 
Dear  Sir: 
 
Re: Request for Inspection
 
- Argentina/Paraguay:  Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project
 
 
 
The Inspection Panel (the “Panel”) received on September 30, 1996 a Request for Inspection (the 
“Request”) dated September 12, 1996 from an organization called SOBREVIVENCIA - Friends of Earth, 
Paraguay - representing persons who live in the project area (the “Requesters”) who claim that their 
rights/interests have been directly, materially and adversely affected by acts and omissions of the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the “Bank”).  The Request claims that people  
living in the project area have been, and may potentially be, directly and adversely affected in their 
standards of living, health and economic-well being as a result of the filling of the Yacyretá Reservoir and 
the Bank’s omissions and failures in the preparation and implementation of the above-referenced project.  
The Requesters claim to be harmed as a result of alleged violations of various provisions of Bank policies 
and procedures set forth, inter
 alia,
 in the following: 
 
• 
Environmental Policy for Dam and Reservoir Projects (OD 4.00 - Annex B)  
• 
Environmental Assessment (OD 4.01) 
• 
Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30) 
• 
Indigenous Peoples  (OD 4.20) 
• 
Wildlands (OPN 11.02) 
• 
Supervision (OD 13.05) 
• 
Project Monitoring and Evaluation (OD 10.70) 
• 
Suspension of Disbursements (OD 13.40) 
• 
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03) 
• 
Environmental Aspects of Bank Work (OMS 2.36) 
 
 
SOBREVIVENCIA has submitted original copies of Authorizations of Representation and they 
have requested that the names of the signatories of such authorizations be made available only to the 
Inspection Panel members but otherwise remain confidential. 
 
 
In accordance with paragraph 17 of the Panel’s Operating Procedures (the “Operating 
Procedures”), I am notifying you that I have on October 1, 1996, which is also the date of the dispatch of 
this notice, registered the Request in the Inspection Panel Register. 
 
All communications with the Requesters in connection with the Request will be sent to Mr.  Oscar 
Rivas at the address listed below.
