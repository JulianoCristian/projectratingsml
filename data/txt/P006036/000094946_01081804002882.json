Furthermore,\n            both the Bank, and Borrower performances are rated\n            unsatisfactory, given considerable difficulties during the\n            period 1995-1997, triggered by the economic crisis, which\n            prevented committed counterpart contributions - severely\n            delaying implementation, thus inducing social problems,\n            while unanticipated environmental impacts hampered results.\n            A number of valuable lessons are drawn from the project,\n            particularly relevant for large infrastructure projects\n            involving resettlement, and environmental impacts. It would\n            be advisable that Bank loans be allocated to finance high\n            cost, critical project components, and, that given a\n            shortage of Borrower's counterpart funds, these would\n            be allocated to finance those components which are easier to\n            procure, and less complex to implement. Such complexity,\n            also requires coordination from central, and local agencies;\n            unfortunately an overly optimistic view by the Bank on\n            resettlement, and environmental issues, disregarded its\n            political implications, which should have been dealt with at\n            the early stages. Other lessons address failures in applying\n            legal remedies; in appropriately addressing the\n            project's bi-national nature at project design, and\n            appraisal; in allowing early interventions of Bank senior\n            management, given the potential, critical situation of the\n            project; and, in envisaging the need for early enactment of\n            expropriation laws to impound the reservoir."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
