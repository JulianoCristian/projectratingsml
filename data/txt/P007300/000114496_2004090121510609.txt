Re:
HAITI: Fifth Power Project Credit No. 2053-HA Amendment of the 
Development Credit 
Agreement
This is in connection with the Development Credit Agreement for the above 
between Republic of Haiti (the Borrower) and the International Development Association 
(IDA) dated August 9, 1989 (the Credit Agreement), and the recent discussions held by 
Borrower and IDA representatives on the required modifications to the above Project 
ensuing the rejection of all bids received for two turbine generators.
We are pleased to inform you that we are in agreement with the course of action 
proposed by the Haitian authorities, including the following amendments to the Credit 
Agreement that are consistent with the objectives of the Project and thus hereby 
formally proposed.
1.
The description of the Project in Schedule 2 to the Credit Agreement is hereby 
modified by:
(a)
changing the description of Part A.1 of the Project to read as follows:   
“1. Installation of one gas turbine of a capacity of about 20 megawatts and of 
one-medium speed diesel generating unit of about 10 megawatts, both to increase EdH’s 
generating capacity in Port-au-Prince; and
(b)
deleting Part B.1 of the Project.
2.
The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Credit Agreement is replaced by 
the Annex to this letter reflecting increases equivalent to SDR15,000,000 and 900,000, 
respectively, in the allocation of the amounts of the Credit to Categories  (1) (a) 
and 1 (b) of said table, and changes in the disbursement percentages for the former
