Lessons reflect the\n            positive factors which facilitated these impressive results.\n            Primarily, client ownership, and sustained political, and\n            financial support reinforce their fundamental value in the\n            development of project implementation, and in preventing\n            delays, and/or overcoming problems, respectively. Contrary\n            to criticism of being an ambitious, and complex project, -\n            including the Biomedical sciences building (Biomedicum),\n            which brought together various medical specialties - it was\n            this investment, and related policy programs, that proved\n            common to academia, policymakers, and the community at\n            large, and, precisely this common focal point, helped\n            overcome the risk of complex design. However, the highly\n            politicized capacity building for the development of health\n            policy, was perceived as a potential threat to traditional\n            \"political\" policy development, thus, the absence\n            of policy was preferred over policy development.\n            Nonetheless, more attention could have been given to\n            consultation, and participation, with a project design more\n            focused on attracting stakeholders' interest on those\n            issues. The significant value the Bank has in providing\n            impartial technical know-how, was evidenced by the\n            construction of the Biomedicum, through technical expertise,\n            while financing, and guaranteeing sustainable,\n            cost-effective solutions."}, "docdt": "2000-08-05T00:00:00Z"}
