MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INRNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUJIVE DIECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBUC OF ESTONIA
FOR A HEALTH PROJECT
1.              I submit for your approval the followg mevorandumandre        on
a proposed loan to the Republic of Estonia for the equivalent of US$18 million to help finance the
Estonia Health Project. The loan would be at te Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a
maturity of fifteen years, includ   five yeasof grace, with a ommitment charge at the Bank's
standard rate on the outstanding balance. The Borrower would bear the foreign exchange risk. The
proceeds of the loan woWld be made available to the Ministry of Social Affairs (MSA) by the
Borrower.
2.              Countrv and Sector Backzround. Estonia began the economic transition process
earlier than the other Newly Independent States (NIS) and the pace of reform quickened durmg the
last two years. A strong mncroeconomic stabilizion program was adopted in md-1992 and the
combination of tight monetary and fiscal policies, including wage restraint and the elimaion of
price controls, has stabilized the economy. Estonia has made importan advances in health care,
partculrly in reducing infant mortality from 31 (1960) to 15 per 1,000 live-births (1990), maternal
mortality from 37 (1970) to 22 per 100,000 live-births (1990) and redcing, in the st thirty years,
death rates from respiratory dieas  by 45% and from infectious diseases to one tenth the initial
figure. However, less success was achieved in other areas.
3.             IKg  sues. The average life expectancy in Estonia is 4.9 years below the
European Region (WHO/Euro) average and 6.4 yeas lower than the average for OECD counries.
This gap is mainly due to higher mortality in the adult population, especially among males.
Moreover, the gap has been widening: between 1960 ad 1990 while ife expectancy at age 30
increased 3.4 years for women, it declined 0.5 years for den; in most Western couries, life
expectancy at age 30 for men inreaed durmg the same period while lie expectancy for women
increased more than in Estonia: e.g., 1.4 and 3.7 years for men and women respectively in Norway;
1.9 and 4.6 in The Netherlands; 3.0 and 5.3 in Sweden; 5.3 and 6.3 in Finland (all had life
expectacies higher dtan Estona in 1960). Age standardiwd death rates for males due to
cardiovascular diseases in Estonia were 72% higher than in Finland, 82% higher than in Germany
and 100% higher than in Sweden; corrsponding rates for accidents, inIjuries, and poisoning were
60%, 50%, and 100% higher than in Finland, Germany, and Swede, respectively. High tobacco
and alcohol consumption, poorly baanced nution, and taffic and occational injuries are
significant dewrmiants of these differentias. The public health services network in Estonia are
still strongly influenced by the former Soviet model that focsed on sanitary control and paid limited
attention to health promotion and disease prevation programs, which are the main instuments used
to reduce such health problems in OECD counties. Estonia needs to reonent its public health
services to health promotion and disease prevention programs, to improve efficiency and quality in
the service's delivery, to train and retrain health professionals to support the health reform and to
strengthen the management capacity of the system's organization and financing.



2 -
4.              Health Services: Efficiency and Ouality Problems. Before 1991, Estonia had
an average of 12.1 hospital beds per 1,000 population, compared to the European average of 9.4.
Through closures and downsizing, nearly 4,000 beds were eliminated and, as of 1994, beds have
been reduced to 9.5 per 1,000. Many health facilities and much of the equipment in Estonia are
in poor condition, reducing the overall quality of care. Some tertiary-and seconday-cae hospitals
are overcrowded, while some of the recently built secondary level hospitals are less than 60%
occupied.  Hospital faciliies have been poorly designed, reducing safety -and generating
inefficiencies in maintenance, heating, lighting and cleaning. Heating costs represent between 25%
and 30% of hospital running costs and are- associated with low efficiency, poor insulation and the
absence of'heat meters. Specialized health training facilities, such as those for clinical training at
the University of Tartu, are over 100 years old, scattered throughout the city, unsafe, and
inadequate for medical and public-health training.- Modem concepts and techniques--of facilities
planning, progranming, drawing, construction and equippi g are critically needed. Accreditation
procedures, quality assurance tools, technology assessment methodologies and medical equipment
support systems are needed te improve overall quality and efficiency in the delivery of health care.
5.                 Human Resources for Health. The past emphasis on curative medicine led
to early specialization within medical training. Public health and family medicine were not
significant concepts in the former Soviet Union. Moreover, the medical community has endured
a prolonged scientific isolation from Western advances, with the result that pre-clinical medical
training programs are outdated, take place in inadequate facilities, and lack esseial modern
equipment. This applies not only to doctors but also to other members of the health team including
nurses, health insurance managers, hospital administrators, planners and policy analysts, whose
training also needs reorientation and strengthening. Health managers do not have any special
training and nurses are considered mainly as doctor's assistants.
6.              Oranization and F'ancin. The health care system is in a transition from
centralized to decentralized administration and financing. This process is king place through: (a)
the transfer of financing responsibilities from the central governent to a health insurance program;
and (b) the delegation of most of the health administration tasks to local authorities (county health
officers) and municipalities. These reforms need to be accompanied by a transformation of the
central health structure, now divested of its role as administrator of health services, into a policy-
making, regulatorv and evaluating body. Moreover, the new health financing system, based on a
universal mandatory health insurance system, is in its developmental phase and needs to be fine-
tuned to introduce needed changes and corrections to improve geographic equity and ensure financial
sustainability, cost-effectiveness and accountability.
7.              Government Strateg. The Government is committed to a far-reaching health
care reform. Advances have been made on many fronts: "paraHlel" health systems have been
integrated into the public health care network; health insurance is already being implemented and
hospital beds have been reduced; in addition, a small public health unit was established in MSA
and a new Department of Public Health was created at the University of Tartu, following the
Govermnent's decision to discontinue training in Sanitary Epidemiology at Moscow and St.
Petersburg; candidates for medical schools were reduced from 200 per year to 90; the first group
of general practitioners (family doctors) was recently trained and a school of nursing for advanced



-3-
degrees was eceY created at Tartu Univrsty. A comprehensive phm    tical policy was
developed, leading to the privatization of imports, packaging and distribution, linmiting the state to
a regulatory role.
8.              A health policy paper setting priorities for health reform, prepared by the
Government has been adopted. Recen legislation on health reform includes: (a) the new law on
organition of health care, stressing the role of county officers as local coordinators of prevenive
and curative care, passed in Parliament in February, 1994; (b) legislation on road safety, aking
seat belt use conmpulsory and banning driving under the influence of alcohol; (c) an amendment to
the law on health insurance reform, approved by Parliament in April, that increases accountability,
geographic equity and fiancial: susaiabity; and (d) the- intrducton -of a bill in Parliament to
restrict tobacco advertising and smoking in public places.
9.              Lessons from Previous Bank Oneions. This is the first lending operation for
the health sector in Estonia. Valuable lessons have been drawn from similar Bank projects in other
countries - particularly Eastern European countries - as well as from the experience of other
donors. The most frequentdy encountered problems that are likely to be relevant to this operation
include coordination problems among institutions participadng inthe project, inexperience with Bank
procedures, initial weak implemenation capacity, and reluctance to use exteral technical assistance.
Project design takes into account these findings, through a strong government role in project
prepamion, detailed briefings on the Bank project cycle, careful planning and establishment of a
project coordination unit (PCU) before appraisal and detailed definition of technical assismce and
train  programs.
10.             Rationale for Bank bnvolvement. The Bank's first lending operation in Estonia,
a rehabilitation loan of US$30 million, was approved in October 1992. It had a health component
of US$3.5 milion fox ptical products and equipmt. The Bank also facitated co-
financing by the Japanese Export/import Bank (JEXJ  (US$20 million, of which US$3.5 million
were for medical eWpment). This project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy as
dicussed by the Board of Directors on October 18, 1994 during the presntatdon of the Financial
I-nstitutions Development Loan, Report No. 13539-EE daed September 21, 1994. The Bank's
overall country strategy for Estonia emphasizes stng   and stmlining the social safety net
and improving the accessibility and quality of basic health services. Support to health sector reform
and increased efficiency would be conistent with this overall strategy. The Estonia Health Project
will improve the health of Estonia's people, by emphasizing health promotion, enhancing efficiency
and quality, developing humun resources and by providing instruments for sustainaility, cost-
effectiveness and equity to the ongoing reforms. Moreover, the proposed operation would contribute
to strengtening public sector management, emphaizing maintance and energy conservation and
supporting cost recovery and sustainable fnancing of health services. Bank involvement has already
encouraged other donors to enter the sector.
11.            Qkj~~ectiM. The proposed project would support the health reform initiated by
the Govenment and would aim to improve health status of Estonia's people by: (a) emphasizing
health promotion and disease prevention programs to increase awareness of healhy life styles, and
enhancing efficiencY and quality of health services; (b) developing human resources by



-4 -
strengthening modern public health training, integrated pre-clinical medical triing, and continuing
education for public health doctors, family doctors, healt insurance and hospital adminhstrators and
other health personnel; and (c) supporting the ongoing health financing reform to ensure its
sustainability, cost-effectiveness and equity through establishing sound cost and performance aalysis
and health mamgement infonnation systems.
12.               iption. The proposed investnent program would comprise the following
components: (a) Healt System Reornentation. This compnerit would support MSA's new national
health state  that includes: (i) institutional development and realignment in MSA; and (ii) health
promotion -and disease prevention.  The sub-component on- Institutional Development- and
Realignment in MSA would strengthen the institutional capai ty of the Ministry in four areas. These
include: (1) formulating health policy, performing economic analysis, and creating a health
management information system; (2) enhancing liospitzl efficiency; (3) establishing quality
assurance, accreditation of health facilities and licensing of professionals; and (4) reorienting the
health system towards integrated primary health care and health protection services. The sub-
component on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention would finance national and local health
promotion campaigns to reduce tobacco and alcohol consumption, provide information and services
on women's reproductive health, update nutrition practices for cardiovascular and heart disease
prevention, introduce stricter road safety and environmental protection measures, and promote safety
in the work place; (b) Human Resources Developme  Comonent. This component, to be
implemented by the University of Tartu, would carry out progrms for training and re-training
health professionals and personnel, in the foilowimg manner: (i) strengthening of the recently
established Departments of Public Health and Polyclinics and Family Medicine at the Tartu Medical
Faculty to train doctors at pre-clinical, graduate and post-graduate levels, as well as nurses and
hospital and health insurance admnistrators on health management, financing, and economics; (ii)
creatng a Center for Contuing Education of health professionals in Tallinn (to be housed in an
existing research institute with excess space available); and (iii) construn  a Biomedical and
Health Sciences complex at the University of Tartu for pre-clime-'l medical and public health
training programs and to house MSA's National P acal Agency and Tartu City Public
Health Laboratories; (c) Efficient ManaSement of Financial Resourmces. This component aims to
improve the management capacity of the Central Health Insurance Agency (CHIA) and the local
health insurance fiuds and to help establish clear links between these funds and health care
providers. The component would improve the Agency's capacity to collect, retrieve and analyze
information needed for providers and the insurance administration, through developing computerized
accouing and management information systems through improved procedures to enhance health
insumance enrollment, collection, and rei    methods, and electronic interface with major
health care providers; and, (d) Project Coordination Unit (PCU). This unit was established in the
Ministry of Social Affairs during project preparation to oversee project implementation and
strengthen MSA's capacity to coordinate extemal assistance for health. In addition to its regular
fimctions as project coordinating unit, the MSA PCU will manage stuies, surveys, and technical
assistance and undertake overall project montoring and evahation, consolidate project progress
reports, undertake procurement and ensure timely auditing of project accounts.

13.                           Thiemntaion. Te project would be implemented in a four-year period and
would involve three agencies, namely. (a) MSA, (b) University of Tartu, and (c) the Central Health
Insurance Agency. The PCU's work would also becompld by two component coordina; rs -
one in Tartu and one in CHIA. This project coordination structure would be institutionalized at the
comipletion - the PCU would develop MSA's capacity for procurement, coordinate overall donor
assistance in health and undertake onra continuing basis, health and economic policy analysis; the
coordinators at Tarns and CHIA would help improve the managerial and financial capacity of those
institutions. The total project cost is estimated to be US$34.5 million, with a foreign exchange
component of US$21.8 million (63%). A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedle A. Amounts and methods of procurm     and disbursements, and the
disbursement- s-chedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations m Estonia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
map, IBRD 26104, is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, Report No. 13297 EE, is being
distributed sepuately. To assist the early start expected to be made on some works, it is
recommended that etoactive flMancing of up to US$ 270.000 equivalent would be provided for
etures incured from July 20, 1994, covering initial expenditures of the architectural designs
of the Tartu Biomedical building.    -
14.             A:ed Actions. The following conditions were obtained before negotiations:
(a) provision of formal evidence that MSA has officially established the Health Reform Coordinatig
Committee and appointed procurement and accounting specialists, as well as a financial component
coordinator at the Cental Health Insurance Agency, and a coordinator at the University of Tartu,
all with qualifications and experience sasctory to the Bank; (b) agreement on standard bidding
documents for the main constuction acceptable to the Bank; and (c) evidence of inclusion of EEK
4.5 million of incremental project expenditures in the 1995 Goverme.it budget. During
negotiations, the following assurances were obtained: (a) by February 15, 1996, MSA shall submit
to the Bank a report on status of development of the accreditation, licensure and quality assurance
systems with recommendations for nation-wide application; (b) by May 31, 1995, CHIA shall
appoint consultants to review the results of the EU-PHARE exercise in Pamu County, and no later
an July 31, 1995, it shall decide and adopt the financial management, and accounting systems
addressed to the local insurance funds and providers, satisfactory to the Bank; (c) by July 31, 1995,
CHIA shall recruit a revenue collection specialist and a public information expert, and by November
30, 1995, it shall submit to the Bank an action plan for implementing recommendations on financial
management and accounting systems for local insurance funds and providers, for the improvement
of revenue collection and on a public information program for employees and entrprise owners;
(d) by July 1, 1995, MSA shall furnish the Bank a program for health promotion and disease
prevention with operational rules, procedures, financing and selection criteria satisfactory to the
Bank; (e) not later than November 30 of each year, annual progress reports would be prepared for
each of the project components consolidated by the PCU into an annual report and an
implemne:itation plan for the following year, including, for Bank review, a list of the technical
assistance to be obtained, by donor; (f) not later than November 30, 1996 a mid-term review shall
be carried out, jointly, by the Borrower and the Bank, according to terms of reference acceptable
to the Bank.



-6-
IS. -           The following are conditions of loan effectiveness: the Government will (a)
appoint the Director of the Policy and Economic Analysis Unit; and (b) reach a formal
understanding with CHIA acceptable to the Bank on the annal transfer of an appropriate percentage
of health insurance tax proceeds to MSA for financing health promotion and disease prevention
programs; (c) appoint a national worldng group and a coordinator for the hospital and health
facilites master plan and a committee on medical technologies, under terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank; (d) provide evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, that provisions in the budget for 1995.
combined with other sources -of fancing, are adequate to fun the contribution of the Borrower for
the implementation of the project in that year.
16.             Environental Assessment. The project is-xpected-to have a positive impact
on the environment through the energy efficiency measures that are part of the overall program to
improve hospital efficiency. Medical waste disposal ss stems in hospitals and in the biomedical
building were already assessed during the functional reprogramming studies and modern standards
will be adopted for the construction of the biomedical building. The intended central unit for
technology assessment, equipment mamtenance and facility redesigning will play a major role in
future environmental control issues in the health sector. The project falls in environmental category
C.
17.             PartFimcorv ADvroa-c. The project was prepared with extensive support from
the Central Health Insurance Agency (CHIA) which is a health financing body totally separated from
the MSA. Several local health insurance funds were also extensively conslted. The University of
Tarns, an autonomous public institution, made significant contribution in the prepaton of the
functional programme for the Tartu Biomedical Building. For the preparation of the Health System
Reorientation component, several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were consulted: doctors'
associations, family planning and health promotion associations, local newspapers and mass media,
as well as, private clinics and private groups for quality assurance in health care and for
hyptesion management. Most of these institutions, NGOs and groups will participate in project
implementation. Moreover, the comnmunity-based health promotion programme is designed to elicit
participation from grass-root organizations interested in promoting healthy life-style and preventing
non-communicable diseases among adults.
18.             Benefits. The project's support of key institutional health reform., training of
health personnel in modern public health and medicine, and changes in financial management and
evaluation would, in the short term, increase efficiency in health service delivery and cost
containment. In the medium term, the emphasis on preventive measures and promotion of healthy
lifestyles, added to the improvements in quality of health personnel and clinical treatments, would
lower adult mortality and morbidity related to tobacco and alcohol consumption, unhealthy diets,
and women's reproductive health problems. Improved tax collections and implementation of
country-wide redistribution of health insurance funds inteided to improve equity would benefit the
low income population. The adoption of four health promotion programs in family planning, anti-
smoking, cardiovascular conditions and injury control could save 29,000 disability-adjusted life
years (DALYs) between program start and the year 2004, accounting for direct and indirect savings
of EEK32S million (US$25 million). Also, less costly health services would reduce the costs born
by industry - especially important in a growing economy with relatively scarce labor. In addition,



-7-
conponents in Estonia's health reform will serve as a reference for other countries under similar
circumstances.
19.             Risks. The nain risks are: (a) the difficultes involved in transforming a curative
health system into one more focused on disease prevention and health promotion, (b) the
complexities enutiled in restrcturing of institutions and in strengthening the management of the
health insurance funds; (c) a new government may not be as comnmtted as the current and previous
ones to implement agreed reforms; and (d) the Government's lack of exerence in implemen_t
Bank-financed projects. A positive factor that reduces the risks is the strong conmitment of the
Government to the entire project which is considered as a key instrument to support the ongoing
health reform. Moreover, the design includes feaur to attenuate risks, such as ensug continued
technical guidae and tining for strengening organizations and management practices.
20.             SusWjagfkij. The incremental recurrent costs that the project add to the
budget in the first year (1995) account for 7 percent of the MSA budget and only 0.3 percent of the
toal health care budget (MSA and health insurance). Significant savings are expected to be
generated from health promotion and disease prevention programs, restrucwning of the health
institutons, improved management and increases in efficiency. The structural changes tbat the
project would sipport are expecd to bring major financial (as well as qualitative) benefits to the
health systm, which would contimue we11 beyond the project period. The relatively low share of
Bank financing in total project costs (52%) indicates a high proportion of Goverment funding and
an ability to sutain the project in the future.
21.             Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and reconmmend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
