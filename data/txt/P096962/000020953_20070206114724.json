management and service\n            delivery. The key elements of the reform program are: (a)\n            public finance reforms to increase public spending and its\n            efficiency for key priority sectors, while ensuring fiscal\n            sustainability; (b) reforms that strengthen devolution and\n            service delivery; and (b) reforms that improve the fiduciary\n            and governance environment. As part of these reforms\n            GOPunjab, is focusing on irrigation and reforms that are\n            being carried out along the following four pillars: (i)\n            institutional and policy reforms; (ii) water resources\n            management reforms; (iii) irrigation service delivery\n            reforms, and (iv) reforms to improve water use efficiency\n            and on-farm productivity."}, "docdt": "2006-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
