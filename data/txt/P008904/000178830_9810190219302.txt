INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO TIE TURKISH STATE RAILWAYS
FOR A RAIL1WAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Turkish State Railways for the equivalent of US$47 million to
help finance a project for the rehabilitation and the technical and adminis-
trative modernization of the railways. The loan would have a term of 25
years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum,
and would be guaranteed by the Republic of Turkey.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Developments and Prospects of
Turkey" dated September 18, 1972 was distributed to the Executive Directors
on October 25, 1972 (R72-236).   A country 1ata sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Following a long period of stability, internal political tensions
have appeared in the last two years. Student disturbances and unrest among
workers occurred in 1970 and early 1971, and the armed forces called in March
1971 for the resignation of the Demirel cabinet and for the implementation
of the land, tax, educational, administrative and other reforms prescribed by
the 1961 Constitution. An "above-party and reformist" government was formed
under Prime Minister Erim, and martial law was introduced. In its eight
months in office, the Government largely re-established law and order, and
introduced some administrative changes. It also raised prices charged by
several State Economic Enterprises and presented several reform bills to
Parliament. However, it was not able to translate its long-range economic
policies into detailed measures and decrees. Growing opposition from Par-
liament to some of the administrative changes and reform proposals brought
about the resignation of a large group of ministers in December 1971, and
a new coalition government, headed again by Prime Minister Erim, was then
formed.
4.        The second Erim government had greater political party representation,
but its attempt to push through modified reform measures again met with oppo-
sition in Parliament. A mining reform bill and a moderate land reform bill
were introduced in Parliament, but little was done to further educational re-
form or to reorganize the State Economic Enterprises. Prime Minister Erim
resigned in mid-April after his request for "government by decree", intended
to speed up the process of reforms, was turned down by the political parties.
A new government drawn from three parties and non-parliamentarians and headed



- 2 -
bv Prime Minister xelen wns formed in 'fay 1972.   It declared its aim to pursue
the reform measures and prepare for national elections in the fall of 1973.
During 1972, despite the attempts of the Telen Government little progress
has been made in passing the reform bills in ParliameTit.   The underlying ten-
sions between some of the political narties and the armed forces came to the
fore in March 1973 in connection with the end of the term of the President
of the Republic and the election of a new President. After some delay, agree-
ment was reached and former Admiral Fahri Koruturk was elected President
April 6, 1973.
5.        While long-term economic policy issues have recently become one of
the main causes of political tensions, growth in Gross National Product in
the last decade has been high and continuous, averaging about 6.8 percent
per year in the period 1962-1971. In the same period, gross investment in-
creased substantially, with its share in GNP rising from 15 to 21 percent.
Although total consumption increased considerably, gross national savings
increased at a much faster rate, their share in GNP rising from 11 to 20
percent. However, in 197n and 1971, in spite of a big jump in workers' re-
mittances, the share of gross national savings has not risen substantially
due to relatively poor public savings, and the share of investmenit also in-
creased more slowly due to pressure on public resources (para. 8).
6.        The main growth sectors in the last decade have been industry, power
and construction. This reflected the development strategy during the first
and second five-year plan's (1962-67', 1968-72), which gave highest priority
to industrialization. Industrial output grew by about 10 percent per annum
with textiles, machinery and equipment, steel and chemicals providing the main
impetus.  But this rapid'growth, mainly to meet domestic demand and replace
imports, was. insulated from foreign competition. Other rapidly growing sectors
were transport, trade and financial services. The impact of large investments
in agriculture was slow, however, and agricultural nroduction' had a trend growth
rate of about 3 percent per annum only, with large fluctuations from year to
year depending on weather conditions. As a result of the relative growth rates,
the shares of industry and trade in GDP rose to 23 and 10) percent respectively,
and that of agriculture dropped to 27 percent, compared to 17,. 8 and 37 re-
spectively in 1962. Growth in the last two years has been above average. In
1971, GNP increased bv 9% in rea-l terms, with value added in agriculture in-
creasing by more than 9% thanks largely to an excel-lent harvest, a sharp rise'
in workers' remittances and continued industrial growth.    En 1972, GNP in-
creased by about 7.5%, with value added in agriculture remaining.at about
the record 1971 level but an estimated 12% growth in industry, fast growth
in transport, construction and trade and another sharp rise in workers'
remittances.
7.        The balance of payments situation was characterized in 1967-70 by
increasing trade deficits, and a strict system of import contrbls leading to
delays and shortages of essential imports and, consequently, tb underutiliza-
tion of production capacity. The overvalued official exchange rate was changed
in August 1970 from TL 9 to TL 15 per USS, revised to TL 14 in December 1971



3-
and has remained at TL 14 after the February 1973 dollar devaluation. This,
together with associated stabilization measures and a rapid rise in workers'
remittances helped to improve the situation dramatically. Workers' remittances
increased sharply, from about $140 million in 1969 to $470 million in 1971.
Commodity exports and tourism receipts also increased markedly. These im-
provements led to better availability of essential imports of investment
goods, raw materials and parts, and to rebuilding of stocks. The improvement
in the balance of payments continued in 1972. Commodity exports increased
by about 30 percent reaching $885 million due to agricultural exports (main-
ly tobacco, hazelnuts, raisins and fruits and vegetables) increasing by over
20 percent, and industrial exports increasing by about 65 percent, from $145
million in 1971 to about $240 mlllion. The large increases in industrial
exports were in food and beverages, textiles, cement, hides and leather pro-
ducts and petroleum products. Imports also rose by over 30 percent to reach
about $1560 million, leading to a substantially larger trade deficit than
1971. However, workers' remittances jumped by about 55 percent, reaching
about $730 million and the overall result has been a continuing increase in
gross official foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $1485 million at
the end of January 1973. Net foreign assets, which were negative in 1966-68,
had risen to almost $600 million in November 1972.
8.        The budgetary situation has been dominated in the last decade by
the need to control the rapid growth of public expenditures.. Although tax
revenues have grown faster than GNP, their share rising from 12.9 percent in
1962 to 17.6 percent of GNP in 1971, the increases in tax revenues have been
more than offset by the rise in current expenditures and transfers. The over-
all budget deficit has grown since 1968 and was particularly large in 1971
when the full impact on current expenditures of public salary increases under
the 1970 Personnel Reform Law was felt. The Treasury had to have growing re-
course to the Central Bank for short-term advances and to other short-term
borrowing. The difficulties facing public mobilization of resources led to
public investment expenditures falling short of targets, and to an actual
decline in public fixed investment in real terms in 1971. The pressure on
public resources has continued in 1972, and the growth of public development
expenditure probably suffered as a result.
9.        The financial results of the more than 100 State Economic Enter-
prises (SEE's) have been consistently poor. The SEE's now account for about
20 percent of the fixed investment in the economy and about 10 percent of
value-added; however, in each year since 1966 a third of the 28 major produc-
ing SEE's on average have lost money. Since 1969 the average rate of return
on investment for these largest producing SEE's has been less than 3 percent
despite subsidized interest rates averaging about 4 percent.. The low profits
of the SEE's have necessitated increasing budgetary transfers, which amounted
to TL 3.5 billion in 1971. The railways, by far the biggest loser, accounted
for about a third of that amount.
10.       In the period 1967-70, while available resources increased, a more
rapid growth of expenditures led to inflationary pressures in the economy,



resulting in an average increase in wholesale prices of about 6 percent per
annum.  Inflationary pressure became particularly strong in 1971 when whole-
sale prices rose 16 percent and cost of living by 20 percent. The pressures
came mainly from the demand side due to substantial increases in public
salaries and industrial wages, higher remittances from abroad and larger
agricultural incomes in a year of record output.   At the same time controlled
prices of public industrial enterprises and support prices of major agricul-
tural products were also raised, and prices of imported goods increased sharp-
ly as a result of both devaluation and the rise in world export prices. The
pressure on prices has continued in 1972, fueled by a continued rise in
receipts from remittances and exports, as well as by the resumed growth of
investment, both private and public. Wholesale prices rose by 15 percent
in 1972. In these circumstances, better mobilization of resources by the
public sector, a balance between the claims of the public and private sectors
on investment funds, further liberalization of imports and avoidance of short
term borrowing by the Treasury from the Central Bank are needed, among other
measures, to contain the inflationary pressure.
11.       For the longer term, the continued political uncertainties have
meant that the planned reforms, e.g. administrative, tax, educational and
land reforms, and reorganization of SEE's have on the whole not progressed
very far. In July 1972, a "preliminary measures law" for land reform was
passed which provided for preparatory measures, but the land-reform bill
itself has yet to be passed by Parliament. Administrative reform of the
SEE's and upgrading their executive and labor skills have still to be achieved.
This is particularly important to prepare Turkish industry for competition,
that will arise from association with the EEC. In agriculture, although sub-
stantial irrigation investments have been made in the past and the government
rightly gives high priority to completing on-going projects, several long-term
problems remain. The Anatolian plateau and the eastern part of Turkey are
considerably less developed than the coastal regions and land tenure problems
are serious in some regions. Surplus stocks of tobacco, tea and hazelnuts;
have accumulated and there is need to modify price support and other policies
to divert resources from those surplus crops for which Turkey has no compara-
tive advantage. Some progress has already been made in shifting land from
sugarbeet to sunflower, feedgrains and other crops and recent high export
demand has also helped to somewhat reduce the stocks of other products.
12.       The employrment situation is also a matter of growing concern.
Despite rapid industrialization and with the leveling off in agricultural
employment, Turkey has not been able to absorb the increasing labor supply in
the last decade. The labor force grew by about 420,000 a year between 1965
and 1970, of whom about 57,000 emigrated and 240,000 found employment on the
domestic market, mostly in services and industry, leaving about 124,000 more
unemployed each year. In the medium term, labor supply is expected to con-
tinue growing by about 2.8 percent per year while demand outside agriculture
is projected at about half the increase only.   Speedy implementation of land
reform would help to reduce the migration from rural to urban areas. In
addition, labor-intensive projects need special emphasis in-the choice of
industrial projects. However, even with these measures and continued emigra-
tion, urban unemployment is likely to grow.



_5 _
13.       The problem of domestic resource mobilization by the public sector
will remain a major constraint and will restrain the real growth of public
investment in the Third Plan period (1973-77), especially if the savings
strategy continues to be heavily dependent on public savings. If substan-
tial increases in public savings are to be realized, then planned changes
in the tax structure should be implemented at an early stage and the failure
of State Economic Enterprises to generate sufficient surpluses should be a
major concern of economic policy. In addition, it is essential to develop
a capital market in Turkey to supplement the existing sources of long-term
domestic borrowin,g. Proposals for a capital market bill are now being
considered. A number of changes in the interest rate structure were intro-
duced in early 1973, including reduction of the rate on short term lending
and deposit rates, and higher interest subsidies to be paid for priority
areas. A basic economic mission will visit Turkey this spring to review the
Third Plan and some of the key policy issues mentioned above.
14.       If the country maintains politically stable and if the government
effectively carries out structural reforms in the areas mentioned above and
promotes exports, Turkey may be able to maintain or even exceed a growth
rate of 7 percent per annum. The Third Plan targets are an 8% GDP growth
with a 9% and 6% growth per year of exports and imports respectively, and a
total investment of about $3.7 billion per year. These targets imply a
marginal propensity to save of 38% per ye&r (compared with 23% achieved dur-
ing the Second Plan). The Plan projections seem to underestimate both the
difficulty of raising the savings level and that of balancing the external
account at a reduced level of net capital inflow. The emphasis on capital
intensive industrial development will require more imports than targeted,
especially since the import regime is likely to be more liberal than in the
past. Gross official external capital requirements, which will be reviewed
by a basic economic mission scheduled for May 1973, are tentatively estimated
at about $400-500 million a year.
15.       Total debt outstanding and disbursed was $2.2 billion at the end
of 1971, of which all but 2 percent is public or publicly guaranteed. The
average terms have been hardening in recent years and this trend is expected
to continue. Of the total gross official external assistance of about $400
million in 1971, the Consortium members provided about $300 million. Of this,
about $90 million came from the United States, $52 million from the European
Fund, $26 million from the European Investment Bank and $37 million from the
World Bank Group. The USSR disbursed $40 million. As a result of successive
debt reschedulings and other arrangements for debt relief together with sub-
stantially increased workers' remittances, the debt service ratio fell consid-
erably after 1965, reaching 19.4 percent of exports of goods and non factor
services and 12.9 percent of total foreign exchange earnings (including
workers' remittances) in 1971. However, since the improvements in the balance
of payments have occurred relatively recently, Turkey should continue to
exercise great care in its external debt management, including restraint in its
resort to suppliers' credit financing.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
16.       During the lengthy period of chronic balance of payments difficulties
before the 1970 stabilization program and devaluation of the Turkish lira
Bank lending was only intermittent. Since then, the rapid improvement in the
balance of payments and in creditworthiness stimulated by these actions has
made possible a large increase and a new continuity in Bank/IDA lending, which
in FY 1971 and FY 1972 amounted to $114 million and $173.3 million respectively.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of December 31, 1972, and notes on the execution of on-going
projects. Project execution has generally been satisfactory although disburse-
ments on several recent projects have been slow due to administrative problems.
17.       Bank Group lending since 1970 has generally been aimed at assisting
Turkey in the following broad development tasks: (a) the continued build-up
of creditworthiness; (h) the external orientation and liberalization of the
economy to improve extern'al and domestic competitiveness; (c) improved orien-
tation of public investments with a view to ensuring the efficiency of invest-
ments and bringing about a better balance between growth and employment and
between the sectors and regions where development has reached a momentum of
its own and those where it is lagging; and (d) institution-building in the
public sector and especially among SEE's, where resource mobilization should
and can be greatly improved.
1i.       In the pursuit of these aims, a pattern of concentration in lending
is evolving along sector and to some extent along geographic lines. In two
sectors, agriculture and industry (including mining and development finance
companies), past and planned lending is on a large scale and fairly broad
in coverage of subsectors.   In transportation, power and urban development,
substantial lending focused on a few projects, particularly SEE's, will be
continued or started.   Geographical concentration has been designed to obtain
mutually reinforcing benefits in related sectors and institutions and to
support the objective of better rural-urban balance.   Thus far, concentration
has occurred mainly in the Istanbul region, with emphasis on urban develop-
ment and industrial finance, and in the Cukurova region around Adana on the
southern coast, with emphasis on power, irrigation and fruit and vegetables.
A start has recently also been made on a complementary effort to psrovide
rural inhabitants with an alternative to urban migration by lending for labor
intensive projects such as the Second Livestock Credit which focuses on breeding,
raising and fattening in Easterh and Central Turkey and by preparing, with the
assis'tance of the IBRD/FAO cooperative program, an integrated rural development
ptoject in rainfed areas of Central Turkey.
19.       Several other projects financed by the Bank Group in recent years
or presently under discussion may be mentioned to illustrate the effort to
support the objectives discussed above. For instance, emphasis was placed
on export-oriented sub-projects in the last two loans (713 and 873-TU) made
to the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and in the ioan and credit
(762/257-TU) for the Fruit and Vegetable Export Project. Other projects for
which lending is contemplated in coming years, especially for livestock,



-7-
forestry and irrigation, are expected to enhance Turkey's ability to earn
foreign exchange as well as spread development in rural areas. On the other
hand, attempts to assist the expansion of tourism have not borne fruit, indi-
cating some Government hesitation as to the importance to be given to tourism
in Turkey's development strategy; as a result, tourism projects suitable for
Bank consideration have not yet been put in shape, although an IFC investment
in the sector has recently been presented to the Executive Directors. The
objective of institution building has been pursued chiefly in agriculture (in-
cluding agricultural credit), urban development of the Istanbul area and
now in transportation. The Bank has furthermore been instrumental in bring-
ing about a comprehensive reorganization of the power sector culminating in
the establishment of the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) to which a loan
(763-TU) was made in 1971.
20.       In addition to the proposed Railway Loan, three other operations com-
prise the Bank Group lending for FY 1973: a $40 million ninth loan (there has
also been one IDA credit) to TSKB for lending to private industry was approved
by the Board on December 21, 1972; a $44 million loan and $30 million credit
for the multi-purpose Ceyhan Aslantas Project near Adana were approved by the
Board on February 13, 1973; and a loan of $14 million for power in support
of the Istanbul urban development which is being submitted to the Board
at the same time as the present operation. Operations contemplated for FY
1974 include: a combined forestry and paper mill project in the Antalya area,
which is being appraised simultaneously by the Bank and the European Investment
Bank, which is expected to share in its financing; the lignite-based Elbistan
power project for which the Government is also approaching several other
potential lenders to finance the large foreign exchange costs; an integrated
rural development project in a predominantly rainfed area of Central Anatolia;
and a second irrigation rehabilitation project.
21.       IFC has been active in Turkey, having participated in industrial
investments for nylon yarn, pulp and paper, glass and aluminum. Total com-
mitments so far amount to about $30 million. IFC is currently investigating
new investment opportunities in various sectors, including special steel and
tourism.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
22.       Since World W4ar II, Turkey's transport system has experienced a
substantial transformation. The road network has expanded rapidly while
railway construction has been essentially limited to the improvement of the
existing system, and the leadership in traffic - both passenger and freight
-- has been wrested from the railways by motor vehicles. By 1970, there were
48,000 km of all-weather roads compared with 24,000 in 1950, and 8,000 km of
railway lines. Between 1950 and 197n, traffic on the roads grew at 11 percent
per year, four times faster than on the railways. As a result, in 1970,
74 percent of the freight tonnage was moved by trucks, 25 percent by trains;



- 8 -
and 90 percent of inter-city passengers were carried by buses and cars;
only 7 percent by trains. The distribution of road traffic reflects the
regional disparities in Turkish deVelopment, with about 70 percent of the
trnffic concentrated in the five economic centers of Istanbul., Bursa, Ismir,
Ankara and Adana. As most of the railway network was built in the twenties,
it does not conform with the present pattern of economic flows, and distances
are generally greater bv rail than bv road. About a third of the lines have
a very lox traffic density.   However, the railways have an indispensable role
to play in Turkey's development as the most economic means of long-distance
transportation for bulk commodities along the main trunk routes, particular-
ly in the mining and agricultural sectors, and in. the movement of the raw
materials for industry.
23.       Turkey operates seven ports for international trade and also many
minor ports. Traffic in ports increased by about 5.9 percent per year during
the last decade, although the traffic handled by domestic vessels declined.
Port facilities do not comply with the requirements of traffic demand, espe-
cially as concerns mechanical installations, speed of operation, harbor depth,
length of wharves, and storage capacity. The airport infrastructure is by
and large adequate, and consists of two international airports used for
scheduled domestic traffic.   In 1970, the international airports handled about
70 percent of all aircraft movements and 75 percent of all passenger traffic,
and the domestic airports the rest..
24.       During the First and Second Five-year Development Plans (1963-67
and 196fS-72) investment in the transport sector was kept at a rather low
level (16 percent of total investment), and most of it went to the mainten-
ance and upgrading of the existing road network. The amount of investment
allocated to railways, about 20 percent of total investments in the transport
sector, was not large enough to prevent the deterioration of the track and of
the rolling stock. Transport coordination was keynoted in the text of Turkey's
Second Plan, but little action has been taken to make it a reality. The
Plan emphasized intermodal competition and commercial criteria for the
operation of the state transport enterprises. These policies have not been
implemented, however, essentially because of lack of administrative coordi-
nation and the dispersion of authority among various government agencies:
there are at present in the transport sector six state enterprises and twelve
ministries or specialized government agencies dealing with policy, planning,
pricing and operational management. During the period 1966-71, the state
transport and communications enterprises have shown on the average the poor-
est financial results of all public enterprises. The railways (TCDD) and
the Maritime Bank, which is in charge of shipping, have incurred the largest
deficits in the transport sector. The Ministry of Communications has broad
statutory authority over the sector, but due to its poor organizational
structure and shortage of qualified personnel, it has not exercised its power
effectively. Responsibility for railway investment is still divided, with
construction under the Ministry of Public Works and other railway investments
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communication. The Bank has acted
as executive agency for UNDP technical assistance studies on transport



coordination and on the railway investment program, which led to the project
discussed below. In 1970, the Government created a transport coordination
agency (called the Transport Coordination Project Center -- TCPC) within the
State Planning Organization. TCPC was given authority to formulate sector-wide
transport policy and to coordinate investment. However, within a few months
of its establishment, it was largely shelved by the Government that came to
power in March 1971.
25.       The present Government has recently expressed renewed interest
in ensuring an economic balance between railways and roads both in policies
that affect traffic and operations and in the allocation of transport invest-
ment funds. In August 1972 TCPC, now named TCA - Transport Coordination
Agency - was relocated in the Ministry of Communications, and preparations
were got underway for key studies on intermodal problems (see paragraph 43);
the establishment of TCA with suitable authority was agreed on as a principal
feature of the proposed loan. A six-year plan (1972-77) for the rehabilitation
of the railways has been approved, calling for sharp increases in railway
investments over Second Plan levels. The proposed loan is designed to help
finance the 1973-74 portion of that plan.
PART IV - TRr. PPOJECT
26.       A detniled description of the proposed project is given in the
report entitled, "Appraisal of a Railway Project Turkey", Report No. 12a-TU,
dated April 6, 1973, which is being distributed separately. A loan and
Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
27.       The proposed project was appraised in March/April 1972 and a mission
visited the country again in September 1972 to follow up the appraisal. Nego-
tiations were begun in Washington in November; they were adjourned for con-
sideration of a number of issues which remained unresolved, and were finally
completed in March, 1973. The Turkish delegation was headed by Mr. Muammer
Akinci, Chief Financial and Economic Counselor, Turkish Embassy, Washington,
D.C., and included Mr. Sarp, General Manager of T.C.D.D. and representatives
of the Government agencies which would be responsible for project implementation.
General
2R.       TCDD is a State Economic Enterprise, autonomous in day-to-day oper-
ations, but under the general supervision of the Ministry of Communications
and subject to specific Government authority in matters of major financial
importance including, particularly, plans for investment and proposals for
changes in tariffs of basic commodities. Apart from operating the railways,
TCDD also runs five ports and three workshops for the manufacture of locomotives
and rolling stock. Management is the responsibility of a Director General,
who also serves as Chairman of a six-man Board of Directors. The Chairman and
most of the members are appointed by the Cabinet.



- 10 -
29.       Institutional Aspects.   A number of problems in management and
staffing have diminished the effectiveness of TCDD. In broad terms, the
principal management difficulties have been over-centralization of authority,
insufficiently clear responsibility at middle levels, and poor internal co-
ordination. TCDD has made several responses to these problems. In 1971 it
created a reorganization committee which is in the process of completing re-
commendations for consideration by the Director General and the State Planning
Organization. In parallel, it has requested the assistance of an outside
management and reorganization study which the UNDP has agreed to finance in
1973. TCDD recently decided to strengthen the Research, Planning and Coor-
dination Department, both in staffing and in authority. Finally, TCDD intends
to establish a coordinating committee with the Director General as chairman
in order to ensure effective implementation of the project. The experience
gained by this committee should have a significant long-term effect on the
quality of TCDD's management and may be one of the greatest benefits of the
project.
30.       Overstaffing, low executive pay and slow promotion, and lack of
career training have been the key personnel problems. TCDD, in recognition
of the burden of the personnel overhang left from past technologies, services,
and wage structures, reduced total staffing by nearly 3,000 in 1970-71 and
will prepare a plan for a further reduction through attrition of about 2,000
in 1973-75. To offset the handicaps of seniority promotions and low civil
service pay scales, TCDD, within existing regulatidns, has begun to make merit
jump promotions and plans to make salaries more competitive. An extensive
training program exists and TCDD will review it to assure adequate opportunities
to train executives abroad and employees at home.
31.       Railway Lines, Equipment, and Cperations.   The central physical
characteristic of the Turkish railways is obsolescence, the result of neglect
and underinvestment for several decades which is apparent in both lines and
equipment.  The condition of track is generally poor, renewals are behind
schedutle, and breakage and derailment rates are high.  Signalling systems are
antiquated or non-existent except on the Ankara-Tstanbul ma4n line and in
suburban services. Steam still accounts for 70-percent of train haulage, and
old age keeps the availability rate of locomotives low. Nearly 20 percent of
both freight and passenger cars are ready for scrapping. In spite of these
impediments, TCDD's performance compares fairly well with that of other low-
density railways, except for the average speed for freioht trains and turn-around
times for wagons. One important problem requiring attention is that some
2,400 km of secondary lines, about 300 out of 1100 stations, plus miscellaneous
freight and passenger services elsewhere in the system are definitely or
probably uneconomic.
32.       Traffic.  Railway traffic in Turkey -- freight and passenger -- is
ratlher concentrated, both geographically and functionally, and this pattern,
wiich is likely to persist, bears heavily on the cost structure, profitability,
ancl future course of development of TCDD. While passenger-kms roughly match



tonnage-kms, freight is three times as important in revenue terms, and its
share will rise. Bulk items - notably iron ore, iron and other metals and
ores, coal, cereals, fertilizer and fuel oil -- constitute about 70 percent
of freight traffic, and their movement is heavily focused on the line connect-
ing Istanbul, Ankara, and the iron mines near Divrigi in east central Turkey
and on the branch line from Ankara north via the Karabuk Steel Mill to the
coal mines at Zonguldak on the Black Sea. Heavy emphasis in the Third Five
Year Development Plan on expansion of iron and steel production indicates
that iron ore alone will grow to about 50 percent of freight traffic in 1980,
and completion of the steel mill in Iskenderun on the Mediterranean Coast will
bring the Divrigi-Iskenderun line into heavy use. Such rising demand for bulk
transport (fertilizer is another important case), together with planned im-
provements in railway efficiency, is expected to result in a near doubling
of freight traffic by 1980 compared with about a one-third increase over the
past seven years.
33.       Forty percent of passenger traffic is suburban transit, which has
increased by 80 percent since 1964 under the impetuis of road congestion and
electrification. The rest is a stagnating main line traffic, largely con-
centrated on the Istanbul-Ankara-Divrigi trunk route, which has survived
rising competition from buses only because fares have been held constant
during a period of steadily rising prices, and service has thus been provided
at below marginal cost. Over the next five years a much slower expansion in
commuter traffic is anticipated as suburban road projects are completed, and
the uneconomic main line traffic is to be radically reduced by substantial
increases in fares. Overall, a decline in total passenger traffic of more
than one-third is foreseen by 1977.
34.       Commercial Policy.   TCDD's commercial policy, in practice determined
by the Government and guided by the need to reconcile conflicting claims of
special public Interests rather than by the criterion of market competitiveness,
is inadequate both as to service and as to pricing. Collection and delivery
arrangements are poor. The tariff system is complex, rigid, and not related
to costs or to competing trucking rates. In 1968, a consultant study made
recommendations for the introduction of (a) commercially-oriented, interrelated
costing and pricing systems, and (b) improvements in service, and marketing,
but they were not implemented. In connection with the proposed project, TCDD
has reconsidered those recommendations and now plans to carry them out with
further assistance from consultants with a view to establishing by May 31, 1974,
a traffic costing system and revised freight and passenger tariffs based thereon,
including provision for varying the tariff for any individual commodity category
at such times and to such degree as TCDD deems advisable in response to changes
in market conditions.
35.       Financial Situation.   After years of break-even and slightly pro-
fitable operations, TCDD has sustained ever-increasing losses since 1959.
TCDD's working loss for its railway activities (excluding its port opera-
tions) reached in 1971 TL 1.1 billion; its operating loss including depre-
ciation, expenditure on track maintenance costs and interest financed by



- 12 -
the Government, was nearly TI 1.4 billion in the same year. These losses
were the result partly of increasing operating costs - e.g. rising wzages
and deteriorating equipment - and declining revenues, and partly of under-
capitablization and unsatisfactory financing arrangements; between 1967 and
1971, in real terms, average per capita staff costs rose by 40 percent and
average receipts per ton-kilometer declined by 25 percent in the absence of
significant increases in rates and fares. Although a State Economic Enter-
prise, TCDD for years was not fully reimbursed by the Government for its
operating losses and had to resort to short-term borrowing. In 1971, a new
law was approved under which the Government took over TCDD's debts to the
State Investment Bank, increased its own capital investment in TCDD, converted
TCDD's debt to the Treasury to equity, and undertook to finance annual track
renewal costs. Despite the temporary relief provided by such measures, they
failed to correct the basic shortcomings in TCDD's structure and operations
and the recurrent causes for its financial deficits. TCDD's Investment Plan
and the Plan of Action for Railway Development agreed upon in connection with
the proposed loan are intended to initiate a far reaching program for the
financial and physical rehabilitation of the railways.
TCDD's Investment Plan and the Project
36.       1972-77 Investment Plan.   With the assistance of consultants, financed
under a UNDP project and in consultation with the Bank, which was the execut-
ing agency for the project, the Government and TCDD began in 1968 a planning
effort aimed at rehabilitation and reform which culminated this year in the
preparation and approval of the 1972-77 TCDD Investment Plan. This Plan is
intended to bring the railways up to the level of operating performance needed
to sustain agriculture, mining, and heavy industry with efficient long-haul
transport; to promote investment planning and operational policy-making'in
transportation on a coordinated sector-wide basis; and through'these efforts
to help bring to an end TCDD's enormous drain on the Government budget.    It
provides for an estLmated investment expenditure over the'six years of 85.41
million, of which abouit $157 million is in foreign exchange. Because of budget-
ary stringency, the Plan was limited to uraent needs to assuire reasonable
standards of safety and efficiency and is close to the minimum 'effort required
to achieve basic rehabilitation by 1978.   In view of this, TCDD has under-
taken to review the Plan yearly in consultation with the Bank and not to make
any increase or reduction of more than 10 percent in the funds allocated
to any part of the Plan without the concurrence at the Bank.
37.       The Project.  The proposed. project is envrisaged as the first of a
posslble series of three within the Plan and represents the investments in-
tended for the period 1972-74.   These are estimated at $223 million, including
$67 milllon in foreign exchange.   The principal items to be financed under the
proposed first project aret renewal of about 8nn kcilometers of track and provision
of related equipment; installation of signalling and telecommunications equip-
ment; manufactuire by TCDD of about 150 diesel locomotives and shunters, 2,800
freighit wagons, and other equipment;'conversion of wzorkshops and depots to
diese1-repair; improvement of administrative, water, storage and other
support facilities; training; ar.d consultant services.
3I.       Financin.   of the total project cost of $223 million, the Government
would contribute $158.5 million, including $13 million in foreign exchange for



- 13 -
items already contracted for. The European Investment Bank has signed a
loan for $23 million of which $16.1 million is to finance the import of
components for the manufacture of 140 diesel locomotives. A French bilateral
credit will finance about $1.? million in other complementary foreign exchange
costs of those loconotives. The proposed Bank loan of $47 million would pro-
vide $37 million to finance the foreign exchange cost of other imported re-
quirements and $10 mi]lion to cover local costs.   This much of a Bank con-
tribution toward financing local currency expenditures seems justified in
view of the small share which the Bank is taking of the overall project
cost (21 percent), and the fact that the Turkish Government itself is cover-
ing $13 million of other foreign exchange expenditures connected with the
project.
39.       Plan of Action for Railwqays Development.  Throughout the period of
preparation of the Investment Plan, the Government and TCDD recognized that
physical rehabilitation of the railways had to be matched by financial res-
toration, and that this required parallel actions to reduce costs through
greater efficiency and to increase revenues through higher tariffs. In
collaboration with the Bank and consultants, the Government and TCDD prepared
an initial plan two years ago, from which emerged the present Plan of Action.
40.       The central feature of the Plan is a series of annual targets for
TCDD's working ratio 1/ which stood at about 2:1 in 1971. The Plan aims at
reducing it to 1:1 in 1978, or, in other words, is designed to achieve break-
even performance at the end of the Plan period except for capital costs and
depreciation. To cover these latter items out of current revenues is too
great a task for six years and must remain as a subsequent objective. To
help achieve the annual targets for the working ratio, TCDD has incorporated
in the Plan of Action for Railways Development, Schedule 5 of the Loan Agree-
ment, a series of cost-saving actions. These include: (a) operating tar-
gets for increased efficiency in locomotive availability and train movements,
complete dieselization by 1974, and a plan for abandonment of uneconomic
lines, stations, and services; (b) limitation of new investments to those
that are economically justified; and (c) imnplementation of plans for reor-
ganization, staff reduction, and training.
41.       To increase revenues in support of the working ratio targets, the
Plan of Action for Railways Development provides that TCDD will establish
the costing system and the revised freight and passenger tariff system noted
in paragraph 34 above, including adjustments in real terms. In this regard,
TCDD has recently increased freight tariffs an average of 32.5%; will in-
crease suburban passenger tariffs an average of 33% and main line passenger
tariffs to which 1959 rates apply an average of 25% by April 30, 1973 and
will raise the remainder of the main line tariffs by 15% before December 3i,
1973.
1/ All current costs other than depreciation and interest as a percentage
of gross operating revenue exclusive of subsidies.



- 14 -
42.       The Plan of Action for Railways Development also provides for
consultant services on the following basis: (a) four studies to be financed
by UNDP for: management and reorganization; abandonment or rationalization
of uneconomic lines, stations, and services; construction of two new con-
necting lines; and signalling investments; and (b) consultants to be fi-
nanced by the Bank to assist in: commercial policy reform; track renewal
and signalling investment; and dieselization. To permit a timely start on
the latter group, the proposed loan provides for up to $100,000 in retroactive
financing beginning January 1, 1973.
43.       Plan of Action for Transport Coordination.   The Covernment recog-
nizes that rehabilitation of the railways will be successful and of lasting
effect only in the context of an effort to rationalize investment decisions
and operating policies throughout the transport sector. It has accordingly
agreed on a Plan.of Action for Transport Coordination, which gives the Trans-
port Coordination Agency (TCA) suitable structure and responsibilities and
provides for the carrying out by TCA, with the assistance of consultants to
be financed under a UNDP project, of priority studies on user charges, trans-
port management information, import restrictions on transport equipment, and
a consolidated transport policy statement.
44.       Economic and Financial Benefits.   The chief benefits of the pro-
posed project are (a) to increase speed, promptness and safety of trains,
(b) to augment the railways' capacity to carry traffic, and (c) to improve
TCDD's competitiveness, particularly in relation to trucks on long hauls.
Dieselization is expected to yield savings of up to 40 percent in operations
and maintenance.  Track renewal, signalling, and new rolling stock will also
produce important, though not individually quantifiable savings. On the
basis of the alternative investment and operating costs which would be in-
curred in road transport if the 1972-82 railway investment program were not
carried out and of the reduced railway working costs entailed by this pro-
gram, the economic return over the lifetime of the project is conservatively
estimated to be in the range of 16-26 percent, depending on variations in
rail and road investment and operating costs and in traffic growth.
45.       Under the proposed project and the 1972-77 TCDD Investment Plan,
a number of financial benefits are anticipated. W4ith regard to financial
structure, TCDD has agreed to revalue its assets and depreciation rates,
undergo an annual external audit by the Inspectors or Accounting Auditors
of the Ministry of Finance, and publish separate accounts for its ports
and railways. The targets for the working ratio accepted by TCDD and the
Government foresee complete elimination of the working deficit in 1978
and reduction of operating losses (which include capital costs) from an
estimated TL 1.47 billion in 1972 to TL 0.66 billion in 1978. The debt-
equity ratio would improve from 44/56 in 1971 to 25/75 in 1977.
46.       Procurement.  Goods financed by the proposed loan in the amount of
about $41.5 million would be procured under the Bank Group's normal procedures
for international competitive bidding, including the provision of a margin of
preference for local, manufacturers of 15 percent or the applicable duty,
whichever is lower. Certain local goods and services (ballast and labor
for track renewal) would be provided under force account.



- 15 -
47.       Disbursement.   The proposed loan would be disbursed on the following
basis: (a) for imported goods -- CIF landed costs; (b) for local goods from
local bidders under international competitive bidding -- 100 percent of ex-
factory cost; and (c) for ballast and labor for track renewal -- 65 percent
of costs.

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION i
Ln No. 568 Keban Transmission Lines Project:   US$  25 million,.oan of, October' 31,
1968, Closing Date: December 31, 1973. Progress on this project was, interrupted
for about a year in 1970/71 by a dispute between the Turkish,Electricity Authority
(TEK) and the principal contractor concerning payment of the increased cost of the,
project, following the devaluation of the Turkish lira. This matter has been,put
to arbitration and TEK is now carrying out construction using its, own,staff.
Subsequently, delays on delivery dates for project equipnent led to the. extension
of the original closing for the loan to December 31, 1973., Since the earliest date
for power operation (two units) of the Keban dam is likely to be postponed to
197h-75, the timing for the completion of the project is acceptable.
Ln and Cr. Nos, 587Ah3 Second Seyhan Irrigation Project:    US$ 12 million loan and
JS$ 12 million credit of February 28, 1969.   Closing-Date: 'June 30, 1975   The
project is macing satisfactory progress and should be completed'on'time.   Yields
of wheat and seed cotton, the principal crops, reached record levels in 1971/72.
A large part of this success can be attributed to the efficient working of the
project extension service which was set up for the first time in. Turkey to inte-
grate the various extension service activities in, the project area under a full
lJ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the progress
of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems which are being
encountered, and the action being taken to remedg~ them. They should be read in
this sense, and with the understanding that they, do not purport to present a
balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

time extension service manager with sole responsibility for the project.
Coordination of irrigation and drainage works, on-farm development and the
extension service has been achieved by a project coordinating committee
representing the concerned Government Agencies.
In Nos. 589, 713 and 873 TSKB (Industrial Develo4ent Bank of Turkey):
US$ 25 million loan of March 12, 1969 US$ 40 million loan of November 27, 1970
and US$ 40 million loan of December 26, 1972. Closing Dates: Marc    31, 1973
December 31, 1974 and December 31 1976 respectively. Since the first Bank
loan was made in 1950, a very satisfactory relationship has been developed
with TSKB. These loans when fully disbursed would bring total Bank Group
lending to TSKB to $168 million. The standard of TSKB appraisal work is
consistently high and sub-projects submitted for Bank approval are well
prepared. Loan 873 was made effective on March 21, 1973.
Ln No. 623 Third Cukurova Power Project: US$ 11.5 million loan of June 27
1969. Closing Date: September 15, 1973. Work on this project is ahead of
schedule, although costs have increased, chiefly due to currency realignments.
Initial operation is scheduled for July 1973, three months ahead of contract
date for completion.
Cr. No. 236 First Livestock Project: US$ 4.5 million credit of February 22, 1971.
Closing Date: June 30, 1975. Implementation of this project was delayed
initially by difficulties encountered by the Turkish authorities in fulfilling
some of the effectiveness conditions under the Credit Agreement and by admin-
istrative problems in hiring the necessary staff for the project unit. These
delays were largely due to the absence, following a reorganization of the
Turkish Government administration in March 1971, of an effective coordinating
link between the various ministries concerned with the project and between
the Government and the Bank Group. Steps have been taken to correct this
deficiency and progress on the project is now satisfactory.
Ln. No. 748 Education Project: US$ 13.5 million loan of June 9. 1971.
Closing Date:  September 30, 1976.   The execution of the project has
progressed slowly, due to the weakness of the Project Unit and lack of
communication between the Project Unit and the Government. As a result,
the project is over a year behind schedule for civil works and five months
for equipment procurement. A recent supervision mission provided assistance
in preparing architectural briefs and has submitted several suggestions to
strengthen the Project Unit, streamline its operations and ensure that
specialists' assistance is available as and when required to expedite its
work. Until now no disbursement applications have been made. A cost overrun
.of about 30% is expected for civil works for the Management Institute and the
six Adult Training Centers included in the project.
Ln and Cr. Nos. 762/257 Fruit and Vegetable Export Project: US$ 10 million
loan and US$ 15 million credit of June 22, 1971. Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
This project was also delayed by difficulties in meeting some of the effecti-
veness conditions by the due date for the reasons noted under Cr. 236 above.
Although it is expected that the project should catch up on the time lost, the
Agricultural Credit Survey, which is included for financing under the project,
will be delayed beyond the forecast date. The SLrvey team has now been
assembled, however, and is expected to produce a preliminary report in April
1973 and a full report in December 1973, which could permit Bank consideration
of a first Credit project for FY 1975.

Ln No. 763 TEK Power Transnission Project: US$ 24 million loan of June 22, 1971.
Closing Date: March-31, 1    ag Implementation of this pro ject has been delayed
by shortage of staff, First contracts were awarded early in 1972 and work is
now progreasing according to the revised schedule. Problems in meeting the
financial covenanta are under discussion.
Ln No. 775 Fourth Cukurova Power Project:  US$ 7 million loan of June 30, 1971.
Closing Date: March 31, 1975. In part an extension of Ln 623, this project is
still in the initial stage. Major contracts have been awarded and work is
proceeding on achedule. Estimated combined foreign exchange cost of the Third
and Fourth Cukurova projects has increased by about $1 million principally due
to currency exchange variations. Cukurova is producing new cost estimates for
Bank review.
Cr. No. 281 Irrigation Rehabilitation Project: US$ 18 million credit of
January 25, 1972. Closing rDate: June 30, 1977. Preparation of specification
and bidding documents and the respective work programs of the Government agencies
responsible for project implementation are in hand to enable work to commence on
schedule in 1973. Appointment of consultants for on-farm development is taking
longer than anticipated but should not hinder progress.
Ln -No. 817 Steel Mill Expansion PoJect: US$ 76 million loan of Agril 28, 1972.
Closing Date: December 31, 1976. Difficulties in coordinating the implementation
steps for the project between the Company, the lenders (IBRD, USAID and U.S.
Ex-Im Bank) and the project engineers have caused delay in the prequalification
of contractora and preparation of specification and bidding documents.
Ln No. 844 Istanbul Water Supply project:  US$ 37 million loan of June 30,
1972. CloBing Date:., June 30, L977. This loan was made effective on January 5,
1973 after some delays. Considerable progress has been made in the selection of
the consultants and some of the works are in progress.
Cr. No. 324 Istanbul Urban Development project: US$ 2.3 million credit of
June 30, 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1977. This credit was made effective
on January 5, 1973 following some delays due to the required actions for effect-
iveness under Ln 844, Istanbul Water Supply, to which effectiveness of this
project was linked. There has been considerable progress towards the selection
of consultants although implementation will be delayed slightly due to the
complexity of the necessary arrangements.
Ln No. 845 IGSAS (Istanbul Fertilizer Company) Project: US$ 24 million loan
of June 30. 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1976. This project was declared
effective on October 6, 1972.  Progress is on schedule,  although the Borrower
is studying changes in some of the major features of the project.
Cr. No. 330 Second Livestock Project:  US$ 16 million credit of September 28
1972. Closing Date: December 31, 1976.     The signing of the Credit Agreement was
delay4d until September 1972 pending the Third IDA replenishment. Conditions of
effectiveness were met by the due date of January 5, 1973.

improved accounting, budgeting and financial reporting system. The consul-
tants' report concerning organization structure is under examination by
the Bank.

rehabilitation of the railways designed to enable the rail-
ways to provide expanded, efficient, long-haul transportation
especially for the bulk traffic of agriculture, mining and
industry. The main components are track renewal, installation
of signalling and teleconmmunications systems, manufacture of
diesel engines and rolling stock, modernization and diesel-
ization of workshops, modernization of support facilities,
training, and consultants' services.
Estimated Cost:      The cost of the project is estimated at about $223 million
equivalent and is summarized as follows:

would finance complementary foreign exchange requirements for the
manufacture of those locomotives. The proposed Bank loan would finance
the remaining foreign exchange costs (apart from a few items already
contracted for) and certain local cost items.
Procurement
Arrangements:       All imported items wfould be under international
competitive bidding according to normal Bank policy.
Local costs would be largely force account and
possibly some contracting with local firms.
Consultants:          The project provides for (a) studies for the Borrower
financed by the United Nations Development Program on
management and organization; abandonment or rational-
ization of uneconomic lines, stations, and services;
the feasibility of construction of two connecting
lines; and optimum signalling investments; (b) con-
sultants to the Borrower to be financed by the proposed
loan to assist in implementation of commercial policy
reforms; and monitoring the track renewal, signalling,
and dieselization programs; and (c) consultants to the
Guarantor financed by the United Nations Development
Program for assistance to the Transport Coordination
Agency in organizing its work and developing a transport
mnnagement information system.
