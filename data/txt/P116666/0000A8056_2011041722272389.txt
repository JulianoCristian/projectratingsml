                          As the last operation in the series, Tanzania PRSC-8 has been implemented successfully. Based on the latest available data, the achievements toward PDO are in the right

                         directions based on the latest available data. The lack of recent poverty data does not allow precise assessment of performance under the rural poverty headcount. The weakened
                         performance under the GBS PAF 2010 makes the preparation for the next operation (next DPO series) challenging, although it is not a part of this ISR.
