Eighth Poverty\n            Reduction Credit Program (PRSC-8) for Tanzania in an amount\n            of US$115 million. The Pilot Crisis Response Window (CRW)\n            will cover US$15 million out of the total credit amount.\n            This is the fifth and the last credit in a series of five\n            annual programmatic PRSC operations (PRSC-4/8) supporting\n            the implementation of Tanzania's National Strategy for\n            Growth and Reduction of Poverty 2005- 2010. As the last\n            operation in the series, this PRSC-8 is a bridge between the\n            current and the next series of PRSCs, which would start with\n            the planned PRSC-9. Against the country context of the\n            weaker-than-expected poverty reduction over the past seven\n            years, as well as the negative impact of the global\n            financial crisis, the specific objectives of this operation\n            are to: (i) complete and consolidate reform achievements\n            under the current PRSC series to move toward the stated\n            medium-term objectives of the series; and (ii) strategically\n            lay the ground for the next series based on medium-term\n            goals. The trends in poverty reduction are described in\n            section two of this report, and the implications in terms of\n            program design for PRSC- 8, notably an increased focus on\n            income generation and rural areas, are discussed in section\n            five. The impact of the global financial crisis on Tanzania\n            is discussed in 'recent economic developments' in\n            section two, and the Bank's responses are discussed in\n            \"operation description\" in section five. The\n            progress on the government program supported by PRSC and on\n            the broader policy spectrum are described in section five\n            under 'summary assessment of overall progress' and\n            'description of policy areas.'"}, "docdt": "2010-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
