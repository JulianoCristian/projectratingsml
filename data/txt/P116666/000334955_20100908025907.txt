                      Pilot Crisis Response Window resources); standard IDA terms: 40-year
                      maturity with a 10-year grace period; single tranche

Main Policy Areas     This Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series focuses on two
                      overarching objectives: (1) sustaining high and shared economic growth
                      and (2) expanding the effective delivery of basic public services through
                      the government budget. In line with Tanzania's Growth and Poverty
                      Reduction Strategy (MKUKUTA), these objectives map into three broad
                      policy clusters: (i) growth and poverty reduction; (ii) quality of life and
                      social well-being; and (iii) governance and accountability.
                      Specific program outcomes under the growth and poverty reduction
                      cluster are the following: (i) improved business environment by
                      maintaining a conducive macro framework and reducing administrative
                      barriers; (ii) increased access of private sector to key inputs, in particular
                      credit and backbone services; and (iii) improved livelihoods in rural areas,
                      where the majority of the poor work, through improved agricultural
                      policies and expansion of rural infrastructure. For the quality of life and
                      social well-being cluster, specific development outcomes are the
                      following: (i) improved health status of the population, (ii) expanded
                      enrollment and enhanced quality in all levels of education, and (iii)
                      improved well-being through better access to clean water. Finally, for the
                      governance and accountability cluster, development outcomes are as
                      follows: (i) enhanced accountability of the state, (ii) improved
                      effectiveness of public administration through better incentives for public
                      servant and decentralization, and (iii) improved public financial
                      management.
Key Outcome           The broad indicators for these three clusters are, respectively, (i) rural
Indicators            poverty head count, (ii) under-five mortality and literacy rates, and (iii)
                      Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) on accountability, corruption,
                      and government effectiveness.
                       Rural poverty head count: Baseline 39% (2001), Latest 37% (2007),
                      Target 34% (2010)

Program Development   This PRSC series supports the implementation of the Country Assistance
Objective(s) and      Strategy and contributes to the achievement of Tanzania's Growth and
Contribution to CAS   Poverty Reduction Strategy (MKUKUTA) objectives in several ways: by
                      funding MKUKUTA implementation; by fostering policy reform and
                      institutional changes in the outcome areas; and by supporting the
                      development of government systems for the implementation and
                      monitoring of MKUKUTA. The PRSC focuses on the following
                      development objectives: (i) reduce income poverty, (ii) improve key
                      human development objectives, and (iii) improve the capacity of the
                      Government to design and implement development policies in a
                      transparent and efficient manner.
Risks and Risk        There are two closely interrelated and overlapping sets of risks for this
Mitigation            operation. The first set includes general risks that may interfere with the
                      successful implementation of the MKUKUTA, including the vulnerability
                      of Tanzania's economy to external shocks, aid dependence,
                      decentralization, and capacity constraints. The second set of risks could
                      undermine the overall credibility of the General Budget Support process--
                      and this PRSC--as effective means to channel resources toward the
                      achievement of the MKUKUTA objectives. This set includes: corruption
                      and weak domestic accountability, the reliance on the domestic budget
                      process, the transition to sector review processes, and fiduciary risks.

            IDA PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
PROPOSED EIGHTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT TO
                     TANZANIA

                                 I. INTRODUCTION
1.      This program document proposes an Eighth Poverty Reduction Credit (PRSC-8) for
Tanzania in an amount of US$115 million. The Pilot Crisis Response Window (CRW) will
cover US$15 million out of the total proposed credit amount. This is the fifth and the last
credit in a series of five annual programmatic PRSC operations (PRSC-4/8) supporting the
implementation of Tanzania's National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty 2005­
2010 (known as MKUKUTA).

2.      The Bank's PRSC support to Tanzania is provided within a harmonized framework for
general budget support (GBS) with 13 other development partners (DPs), comprising a
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), a Partnership Framework Memorandum (PFM)
for GBS for the implementation of MKUKUTA, and a joint review process which culminates
in a joint Annual Review (AR) in October/November. The framework is designed to support
domestic accountability, reduce transaction costs in the process, and encourage the further
development and use of Tanzania's own systems. The program structure follows the three
pillars of MKUKUTA, namely Growth and Reduction of Income Poverty, Social Well-Being,
and Governance.

3.     Within the overall GBS framework, the PRSC series focuses on two sets of objectives:
       (1) high and shared economic growth; and
       (2) effective delivery of basic public services through the government budget.
These two main strategic areas map out into seven operational policy areas for the PRSC
series: (1.1) agriculture and natural resources, (1.2) infrastructure, (1.3) environment for
private sector development, (2.1) monitoring of service delivery in social sectors, (2.2) public
expenditure and financial management, (2.3) effectiveness of public administration, and (2.4)
anti-corruption and accountability of the state.

4.      As the last operation in the series, this PRSC-8 is a bridge between the current and the
next series of PRSCs, which would start with the planned PRSC-9. Against the country
context of the weaker-than-expected poverty reduction over the past seven years, as well as
the negative impact of the global financial crisis, the specific objectives of this operation are
to (i) complete and consolidate reform achievements under the current PRSC series to move
toward the stated medium-term objectives of the series and (ii) strategically lay the ground for
the next series based on medium-term goals.

5.      Under the current PRSC-4/8 series, relatively good progress has been made in a few
areas, including transport, energy, health, audit, procurement, and anti-corruption institutions.
These are the areas where this operation seeks to consolidate the achievements in policy
reforms so far. On the other hand, only slow progress has been achieved on several fronts:
agriculture development, business environment, quality of budgeting, financial management


                                               1
systems, governance of public enterprises, and education. Those are the areas where this
operation seeks to support the Government's policy reforms not only to push for progress on
pending issues but also to help the Government formulate its medium-term development
objectives.

6.      The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) envisaged a sharp increase in the share and
level of budget support during the CAS period in light of the Government's preference for
GBS as a lending modality. Although some important progress has been recorded, the
Government's overall reform effort, however, has weakened over the past three years. The
overall focus of economic policy has been driven more by the aim of redirecting existing
resources through more intrusive intervention of the state rather than by the objective of
deepening market-supporting institutions and a reliable investment climate for both local and
international investors. This has translated into a reduced drive for structural reforms and a
perceived lack of predictability in the business environment, which might hamper the
achievement of higher and more broad-based growth. This has also resulted in a lackluster
performance with respect to PAF, as only slightly more than half of the PAF actions and
outcome targets have been met, and also led to a deteriorating quality and performance with
respect to the PRSC prior actions and program content. PRSC-8 performance has been
modest, both in terms of the prior actions met and in terms of the ambition of the forward-
looking program. All this has led to a stagnant and then declining level of policy lending. The
formal assessment of the current series in the form of Implementation Completion and Results
Report (ICR) will be undertaken in the first half of the World Bank's Fiscal Year (FY) 2011.

7.      The current poverty reduction strategy (PRS) of Tanzania (MKUKUTA) covers from
2005 to mid 2010. A new PRS (MKUKUTA II) was prepared over the last 12 months and is
being finalized for cabinet approval in the third quarter of 2010.1 The new PRS keeps the
three main cluster of the MKUKUTA I and puts more emphasis on economic growth, in
particular in the agriculture and infrastructure sectors. It is likely to remain a rather generic
document that indicates broad objectives but falls short of suggesting specific policies or
attempting to address key trade-offs among priorities, especially in terms of resource
allocation. Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for October 2010, and a
new administration will be in charge for the next GBS cycle, starting January 2011. The
design of the next series, starting with PRCS-9, will depend very much on the quality of the
new PRS, and on the reform agenda of the new administration.

8.     The trends in poverty reduction are described in section II of this report, and the
implications in terms of program design for PRSC- 8, notably an increased focus on income
generation and rural areas, are discussed in section V. The impact of the global financial crisis
on Tanzania is discussed in "Recent Economic Developments" in section II, and the Bank's
responses are discussed in "Operation Description" in section V. The progress on the
government program supported by PRSC and on the broader policy spectrum are described in
section V under "Summary Assessment of Overall Progress" and "Description of Policy
Areas."

(MKUZA II) is being prepared for the adoption by RGZ around the same time as MKUKUTA II adoption.

                                      II. COUNTRY CONTEXT
                        A. POVERTY REDUCTION TRENDS AND OUTLOOK

9.      Tanzania experienced sustained economic growth with growth rates of between 5 and
7 percent per annum during the period from 2000 to 2008, until the global financial crisis hit
the economy in 2009. Despite the solid growth record, findings from the recent analysis
based on the 2007 Household Budget Survey (HBS) pose a mixed picture of the country's
progress in poverty reduction over the past eight years. Lower relative prices from imported
goods and increased government spending led to tangible improvements in some areas,
including ownership of consumer durables, housing quality, and some social indicators such
as under-five mortality and enrollment in primary education. On the other hand, progress was
rather limited in terms of basic-needs income poverty, ownership of productive assets in rural
areas, as well as some other social indicators, such as maternal mortality or access to safe
water.

10.      Between 2001 and 2007, income-poverty incidence fell slightly in mainland
Tanzania, as did the depth and intensity of poverty. However, the size of those drops is small.
Per capita consumption measured through the HBS increased by only 5 percent in the period
between 2000­1 and 2007. With such a small change in consumption, the poverty head-count
ratio dropped only slightly, from 35.6 in 2001 to 33.6 in 2007 (Table 1). As the head count
fell by little while the population continued to grow rapidly, the absolute number of poor
people increased by 1.3 million in the period. In rural areas, the change in poverty was not
statistically significant. Even though relative inequality remained more or less unchanged,
consumption declined for a small fraction of households at the very bottom of the income
distribution. In absolute terms, however, the data show an increase in inequality.

11.      This slow progress in income-poverty reduction is disproportionate in light of the high
rates of gross domestic product (GDP) growth that have been recorded in the past few years.
It is in contrast with comparable countries in Africa such as Uganda that, like Tanzania were
stable, underwent economic reform, and recorded high levels of economic growth and that,
unlike Tanzania, managed to reduce poverty significantly (Table 2). There are three key
reasons for the lack of a strong nexus between poverty reduction and GDP growth in
Tanzania. First, the pattern of GDP growth was driven by sectors that were predominantly
urban (while poverty is mainly rural), some of which had weak linkages with the rest of the


                                                             3
economy; the 2007 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) also showed that up to three-
quarters of the higher growth in the nineties was driven by higher foreign aid inflows feeding
into the government budget, resulting in a much stronger public consumption component of
GDP compared to the private consumption component, which is the base for the measurement
of income poverty. Second, some of the increase in private consumption has occurred in
consumer durables, which are not included in the consumption basket of the HBS. Third, the
weak quality of agricultural GDP statistics probably led to an overestimation of GDP growth
in some drought years. Several studies are currently being conducted to provide a better
understanding of the relative importance of these different factors and options for accelerating
income poverty reduction, underpinning the dialogue for the next PRSC series (see Annex 7).

12.     With the current level of poverty in the country, the MKUKUTA objective to reduce
poverty in terms of the poverty head count to 19 percent by 2010 has been missed. The
country is also off-track to reaching the target of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
to reduce the poverty head count ratio to 19 percent by 2015. The country was already off-
track in achieving the MDG target in 2001, but the deviation from the required level of
poverty reduction widened during the period between 2001 and 2007. An analysis of the
distribution of consumption suggests that achieving the MDG remains feasible, because a
relatively large mass of households have consumption levels not far below the poverty line. If
through a process of growth it were possible to move these households across the poverty
line, the MDG objective would be achieved. To accomplish this, an annual real consumption
growth of 3.2 percent per capita would be required (or a 29 percent increase between 2007
and 2015). The analysis of the first phase of the Poverty Assessment (Rapid Poverty
Assessment) suggests that to achieve this target more attention should be given to the
development of agriculture and to boosting the private sector contribution to GDP growth.

                                B. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

13.      Pre-crisis trends: From 2000 to 2008, sustained economic reforms and
macroeconomic stability, coupled with a favorable external environment, contributed to the
robust growth of between 5 and 7 percent per year (see Table 3). While the Government had
carried out an expansionary fiscal policy since 2000 with a fast rise in government
expenditures, the fiscal environment was overall on a prudent track, sustained by strong
growth in tax revenues, large debt relief, and significant growth in foreign aid. Inflation was
initially kept in check but accelerated starting in 2005, reaching double digits in 2008, driven
by adverse regional food supply shocks and challenges in managing large liquidity coming
from public and private capital flows. The real effective exchange rate has converged to a


                                                 4
more competitive level from the overvalued level at the beginning of the decade, but has
started to appreciate again in real terms, mainly on account of higher domestic inflation. The
current account balance has deteriorated since 2006, driven by high imports (high imported
oil prices and capital import growth). The current account deficit is no longer fully covered
by foreign aid and is more dependent on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows.

14.     The global financial and economic crisis has led to a growth slowdown in Tanzania.
Real GDP growth in 2009 is estimated to have dropped to around 6 percent from 7.4 percent
in 2008. The crisis has affected Tanzania through the export channel--mainly tourism, cash
crops, and regional manufacturing exports--and by lower capital flows: foreign assistance
and private investment flows. Manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, transport,
communication services, and construction being the most affected sectors (Table 4). The
decline of international commodity prices and reduction of food shortages in the sub-region
have yet to result in lower inflationary pressures. This was mainly driven by food prices,
reflecting the impact of the drought affecting parts of northern Tanzania and neighboring
countries. The authorities are targeting an annual inflation rate around 8.2 percent for the
Government's FY2009/10, down from 11.9 percent in the previous fiscal year FY2008/09.2

15.      The balance of payments continues to post a sizable deficit due to the turbulence in the
global economy, with a slight improvement since last 2009. In the external sector, following
the sharp deterioration of the current account balance in 2008--which increased by about one-
third to reach 12.3 percent of GDP--the current account deficit was improved slightly in 2009
to 11.1 percent of GDP, as the trade deficit shrank by over 40 percent by the end of 2009
compared to the end of 2008. This was due to the reduction in the import bill, partly driven
by muted demand but also by falls in the prices of Tanzania's imports, notably oil, which fell
by around 40 percent. The current account deficit is financed through a combination of
concessional lending and debt relief, including relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) and the Enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC).
International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a US$330 million Exogenous Shock Facility
(ESF) at the end of May 2009 to support Tanzania's balance of payments. As a result, net
international reserves have been maintained at comfortable levels of around four months of
goods and non-factor services (GNFS) imports.

16.    Supported by low levels of public debt, Tanzania has managed to take counter-cyclical
measures in response to the global crisis in a timely manner. Prudent economic policies in
recent years--broadening of the domestic revenue base, a decline in public debt levels--
together with access to external financing have given Tanzania some room to maneuver
through fiscal stimulus and monetary easing in the short term. During FY2008/09, the
Government reacted to mitigate the impact of the financial crisis by preserving expenditures
as budgeted, de facto providing a moderate fiscal stimulus. The total fiscal stimulus is


                                                                  6
projected to reach about 4 percent of GDP over the last two fiscal years with the magnitude
striking an appropriate balance between expanding public sector demand without creating
excessive crowding-out effects. This was achieved mainly through an easing of the limit on
net domestic financing (NDF), which increased from zero to about 1 percent of GDP.

17.     In FY2009/10, the Government pursued additional on-budget fiscal stimulus, seeking
to maintain essential public expenditures and provide specific support to help mitigate the
economic and social impact of the crisis, including an expanded fertilizer subsidy scheme, a
cut in the value-added tax (VAT) rate from 20 percent to 18 percent, and targeted time-bound
interventions (limited debt write-offs, government guarantees) to support agriculture and
ensure continued flow of credit to the economy. The FY2009/10 budget provided a fiscal
stimulus to the economy, with total expenditures estimated to have increased to 27.7 percent
of GDP (1 percentage point less than budgeted), together with weakening revenue collection
by around 1 percentage point compared to projections, leading to a budget deficit of 6.1
percent of GDP. The deficit was financed by relaxing further the limit on NDF to 1.6 percent
of GDP, supplemented by extra concessional foreign financing, which included a
supplemental PRSC-7 financing of US$170 million approved in December 2009. On the
monetary side, the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) targeted a tighter monetary policy at the
beginning of FY2008/09, but successively eased its stance to cope with the slowdown in
economic growth. Interest rates have fallen sharply since March 2009 as treasury-bill auction
volumes were reduced and commercial banks scaled back private sector lending due to
uncertain prospects for the real economy.

18.     The implementation of the FY2009/10 budget faced several challenges. The
Government has cleared a stock of arrears that accumulated on infrastructure and salary
payments to teachers during the first quarter of FY2009/10. To improve the commitment
control system, the paymaster general issued a circular letter on 14 September 2009 to all
permanent secretaries, independent agencies, regions, and local governments instructing them
not to sign any contract without adequate funding in FY2009/10. The Government also
intends to prepare a project manual that will guide all Ministries, Departments, and Agencies
(MDAs) in project design and management that should, in effect, ensure that there are no
over-commitments or under-funding of approved projects. Strengthening the reliability and
functionality of the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), which
this operation supports, would improve overall quality of fiscal policy management.

19.     Tanzania's external debt sustainability has strengthened significantly following the
completion of HIPC and MDRI and additional debt relief received in early 2007 from
bilateral donors. Currently, Tanzania's external debt level is low. According to the recent
Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) in February 2010, Tanzania's total external debt more
than halved from US$7.7 billion, or 57.3 percent of GDP at end-June 2006, to US$4.5 billion,
or 25.6 percent of GDP at end-June 2009. In present value (PV) terms, the public sector
component of this debt stood at about 12 percent of GDP at end-June 2009, or 53.5 percent of
exports. Public external debt service is around 0.9 percent of exports of goods and services.
All these indicators are significantly below the indicative debt-burden thresholds that apply to
Tanzania. The Government anticipates having to borrow from both domestic and external
source, potentially including on non-concessional terms, in the coming years to finance a
stepping up of infrastructure spending. The additional borrowing will increase the present


                                               7
value of debt-to-GDP in the medium term but should not jeopardize long-term debt
sustainability given the current low level.

20.     The recently approved FY2010/11 budget continues a trend of fiscal expansion by
increasing budgeted expenditures by 2.5 percentage point of GDP compared to the last year's
budget, reaching 31 percent of GDP. Three-quarters of the increase in expenditures goes
toward development spending. Domestic revenue is projected to increase by 1 percent
compared to last year's projections, and 2 percent of GDP compared to last year's actual
revenue outturns. Foreign aid is budgeted 1 percent of GDP below last year's estimate. Non-
concessional financing includes 1.6 percent of GDP in domestic borrowing, and foreign
commercial bank borrowing of 2.1 percent of GDP, which has not been fully secured. The
overall non-concessional borrowing appears to be above the benchmark set in the DSA of 1
percent of GDP for domestic borrowing and 2 percent of GDP for non-concessional foreign
borrowing, to make up for reduced program loans and grants. A sound debt management
strategy, a conservative approach to non-concessional borrowing, and rigorous evaluation of
the quality and feasibility of investment projects are important factors for maintaining debt
and fiscal sustainability.

                             C. DEVELOPMENTS IN REAL SECTORS

21.     The country is largely dependent on agriculture, which is the source of employment
for over two-thirds of the total labor force. Although agricultural GDP is reported to have
been growing at around 4­5 percent per year until 2008, the data on rural income growth and
productive assets from the 2007 HBS suggest that income generation in rural areas has
stagnated. Yields of staple crops, a mainstay of the livelihood for the predominantly poor
subsistence farmers, appear to have been flat or declining, with agricultural growth primarily
driven by extension of cultivated areas, along with shifts in the composition of crop
production. In the cash crop sub-sectors, the very gradual pace of reform of the Crop Boards
appears to have been accompanied by a surge of new modalities for licensing and market
regulations, which have sometimes resulted in sustaining anticompetitive practices, hindering
profitability for the smaller farmers and businesses.3 At the same time, some of the sub-
sectors, particularly cotton and coffee, were seriously hit by the global financial crisis,
through the significant drop in international prices.

22.      Recognizing the fundamental role the agricultural sector could play for income
generation and poverty reduction, the Government has strengthened its focus on agriculture. It
recently adopted the Tanzania National Business Council (TNBC)'s "Agriculture First"
policy, or Kilimo Kwanza. The policy takes a holistic approach constituted in total ten pillars.
The policy also emphasizes the role of the private sector in driving agriculture development.
This new emphasis is reflected in the increased budget allocation in the sector. The largest
part of this increase is to sustain higher farm productivity through (i) a voucher fertilizer
subsidy scheme, which replaced the past inefficient transport subsidy, and (ii) strengthened
private-sector-driven seed and fertilizer markets. More resources are also allocated to
irrigation, research and development, provision of veterinary supplies and services, and

 The new bill to amend functions of six Crop Boards (coffee, sisal, cotton, tobacco, pyrethrum, and sugar) was
submitted to the Parliament on July 10, 2009.


                                                       8
strengthening procurement and fiduciary units in the lead ministries of the agriculture sector.
While this emphasis on agriculture is welcomed, and Kilimo Kwanza contains a number of
potentially effective policy directions, the overall framework shows some inconsistencies and
also includes some potentially distortive policies, such as subsidized mechanization schemes,
or publicly subsidized credit for agriculture, which have a poor track record of success in
developing countries.

23.     The natural resource sector, including tourism, mining, forestry, and fisheries, is a
significant supplement to the subsistence for a majority of Tanzanians, particularly those in
poverty. The sector fosters the environment on which much of the population's health
depends. Natural resources in Tanzania constitute a wealth asset and their growth potential,
which is largely untapped so far, is estimated to contribute a potential additional US$100 per
person. They provide the basis for much of the economic non-farm growth in both the formal
and informal economy. However, recent evidence indicates that shortfalls in governance and
law enforcement have led to unsustainable use of these resources, undermining shared
economic growth in this sector. The Government has started taking measures to address
sustainable resource management in the country. It has also prepared a set of action plans to
improve accountability and transparency in allocating natural resource licenses in mining,
fisheries, forestry and wildlife. Concerns over the mining sector, including the level of
revenue generated by the sector and captured by the Government (through royalties, taxes,
and so on), prompted the Government to issue a new Mining Act. On February 16, 2009,
Tanzania joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) as a Candidate
Country. Tanzania has until February 15, 2011, to undertake validation, in which its
compliance with EITI principles and standards will be assessed. Successful validation will
lead to Tanzania becoming an EITI Compliant Country. Tanzania is currently finalizing the
selection of a firm that will produce its first EITI report on company payments and
government revenues. Both the Government and the oil, gas, and mining companies have
submitted reports on payments and revenues, respectively.

24.      Overall, infrastructure bottlenecks are still a serious constraint to private investment in
Tanzania, and while some sectors, such as road and energy, are gradually improving their
performance and institutional setup, others, such as the port, railways, and water sectors, are
still dysfunctional. The weak capacity of the Government to handle Public Private Partnership
(PPP) transactions in an efficient and transparent way has limited the contribution of the
private sector to the finance and management of infrastructure in Tanzania. Continued
improvement in the governance of the infrastructure sector and the rollout of national PPP
framework are critical to unlock the situation.

25.     Over the past few years, the Government has been implementing several targeted
programs to improve the business environment, including the Business Environment
Strengthening Program (BEST), a Tax Modernization Program (TMP), and the Second
Generation Financial Sector Reform. While tax and financial sector reforms have proceeded
positively, business environment reforms have lagged in implementation and consistency, and
their impact to date has been marginal, while other legal and regulatory changes have actually
added to the complexity and restrictiveness of the business environment. Consequently,
Tanzania continues to underperform in terms of its business environment, being ranked 126 in

the ease-of-doing-business rankings in the 2009 Doing Business Report and dropping to 131st
place in the latest 2010 report.

       D. OUTLOOK AND MEDIUM-TERM PRO-POOR GROWTH CHALLENGES

26.      The Government's economic recovery program, on both the fiscal and monetary sides,
in response to the global financial crisis has helped cushion the impact of the crisis. The
recovery is underway in Tanzania, although low levels private credit growth point to some
fragility. The impact of the crisis continues to pose a significant challenge to the economy,
and to the Government, in the near term, with increased fiscal pressures given slugging
recovery on the revenue side. The revenue performance in FY2009/10 achieved only 91
percent of budget targets. A series of regional and domestic shocks such as the drought in the
north, electricity outages, and floods in Central Tanzania, which destroyed a portion of the
east-west railway, have slowed the pace of recovery and created additional fiscal costs.

27.      The outlook for medium-term growth for Tanzania will be more challenging in the
years to come (see Table 5). First, the international environment that sustained Tanzania's
growth through high public and private capital flows as well as high trade volumes might not
be as favorable, due to the anticipated slow recovery of the world economy and to the
absorption of some of the large fiscal and monetary unbalances created before and during the
crisis in developed economies. Second, as the economy gradually recovers from the external
shock, the country continues to face substantial domestic policy challenges, particularly
sustaining a positive business climate and acting decisively on some of the key infrastructure
constraints. The continued uncertainty in the global economic climate and potential of an
exogenous shock from another global downturn raises an additional risk for Tanzania as the
country gets increasingly integrated in the global economy through trade and investment.
This could compound the challenges of sustaining high economic growth rates.

28.      As a consequence, Tanzania's economic performance might not return quickly to pre-
crisis levels. Achieving a sustained acceleration of growth would depend on resumption of


                                                                 10
FDI inflows, reopening of global capital markets, and a rebound in exports, all of which may
have some lag. A number of structural weaknesses will need to be addressed forcefully if
Tanzania is to achieve significant poverty reduction through growth. The shorter-term impacts
are likely to depend on improving regimes and the policy environment for agriculture and the
private sector, by removing distortions in the current incentive systems. The longer-term
impact will require that Tanzania fills the gaps it has in terms of its long-term assets for
sustainable pro-poor growth: infrastructure, human capital, and natural resources. Together
with the drought, the uncertainty in the pace of recovery poses continued risks to the outlook
for growth and inflation.

29.      In all these areas, the country's policy reform agenda for medium-term pro-poor
growth will have to be approached by balancing the following two necessities: (i) policy
reforms to raise regional and global competitiveness of the economy and (ii) policy reforms
that raise the poor's income opportunities.

   a. In building a competitive domestic economy, the country needs rigorous efforts to
      correct incentive frameworks, improve efficiency in infrastructure services, and
      address low appropriability due to government failures by rationalizing state
      interventions. Regional integration should be leveraged on as well.

   b. For achieving pro-poor sustainable growth, improved accessibility and efficiency of
      basic infrastructure, particularly in the rural areas, as well as availability of market
      institutions and sound incentive frameworks will reduce transaction costs for small-
      scale, often informal, productive activities and facilitate their integration to the formal
      economy. Sustainable use of natural resources and strengthening human capital,
      which are the key assets for pro-poor growth, need to be addressed.

   c. For both pillars to be successful, continued efforts are critical to improve the quality of
      public finance and transparency and accountability of public policies, through reforms
      in public financial management, legal, public services, and local government agencies,
      and anti-corruption. The quality of budgeting is equally important.

                                E. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

30.    Tanzania ranks 151 out of 182 countries in the 2009 United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) Human Development Index, and has been steadily improving since
1995. Social services in the country have been expanded by the two successive PRSs.
Education, health, HIV/AIDS, and water all have sector strategies endorsed by the
Government and the Development Partners.

31.    Significant progress in access to social service was recorded in areas that benefited
from substantial increases in government spending (Table 6). Enrollment in primary
education increased substantially, benefiting poor households in particular. A successful bed-
net campaign contributed to a drop in child mortality by more than 40 percent relative to
1999. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS--a main contributor to adult mortality--dropped from
7.0 percent in 2003 to 5.7 percent in 2007, and the provision of selected micro-nutrients
(vitamin A; salt iodization) was successfully introduced, although food fortification is lagging

behind. The increase in funding is starting to have an impact on the access to improved water
sources as well. Preliminary data from household surveys conducted in FY2007/08 show that
access to improved water sources has been increasing since FY2004/05, albeit that access in
FY2007/08 is still below the levels of 2000, especially in urban areas where rapid
urbanization is putting a lot of pressure on utilities to improve access as can be seen.

32.     Nonetheless the stock of human capital remains low, as average levels of education
are low and malnutrition rates high. Inadequate progress has been made in improving the
quality of education and health services, particularly in view of the focus of Tanzania's first
PRSP on service delivery and the high levels of aid that Tanzania has received (and still
receives). For example, primary school completion rates have been declining since 2005, and
access to education at the secondary level remains inequitable, notwithstanding government's
efforts at building new public schools, with a large share of children from the poorest
households left behind during the transition from the primary level. The results from the
recent HBS survey show that very few children from poor households are found in tertiary
learning institutions. Although the number of qualified teachers is increasing overall, the
pupil-to-teacher ratio has worsened to 54 to 1, which remains high by international standards.
At the secondary level, while overall enrollment has increased (about 25 percent for lower
secondary and 1.4 percent for upper secondary), the completion rate for the upper secondary
level declined from 93 to 73 percent in 2007/08. There are also major quality concerns, at
both primary and the secondary education levels, in terms of learning achievements.

33.     The persistently high population growth, around 3 percent annually, is among the
highest in the world, reflecting lack of broad social consensus and clear policy directions in
this area. Roughly half of Tanzania's population is 15 years old or younger, which raises the
dependency burden and creates additional unmet demand for youth employment. Rapid
population growth also undermines the impact of economic growth on poverty reduction. This
is especially true for the urban areas, where population growth happens at a much faster rate
than in the rest of the country. The rapid influx of people increases the stress on institutions
already struggling to cope with delivery of basic services, such as sewerage, clean water,
schools, and health care.

                                         F. GOVERNANCE AND ANTI-CORRUPTION

34.     Tanzania's National Framework on Good Governance provides the overall framework
for reforms in this area. The implementations of five core reforms are the Government's main
instruments toward improving the governance environment. These reforms are the Public
Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP), the Public Service Reform Program
(PSRP), the Local Government Reform Program (LGRP), the National Anti-corruption
Strategy (NACSAP), and the Legal Sector Reform Program (LSRP). There has been progress
in the implementation of these core reforms, but it has been slow. During the previous annual
review of GBS in 2009, two out of five (PFMRP and LGRP) rated unsatisfactory.

35.     The overall Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score for Tanzania,
which has been relatively good compared to other International Development Association
(IDA) countries, dropped in 2008 from its previous level, largely driven by worsening scores
in public sector management and institutions, in particular in the area of quality of budget and
financial management as well as transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public
sector (Figure 1). It remained constant in 2009. The insufficient performance in governance
is also corroborated by the corruption perceptions index by Transparency International, which
shows further downgrading in 2009 from 2008 level.

36. In the anti-corruption area, progress has been seen in terms of law enforcement and
recovery of funds. Some notable grand corruption suspects related to some of the major cases
that ravaged Tanzania from 2005 to 2007 have been indicted, but no convictions for grand
corruption have been made. These have followed investigations by the Prevention and
Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), the Parliament, and other state agencies on the
Bank of Tanzania External Payment Arrears (EPA) case, the Richmond energy case, and the
Alex Stewart case. Following the leakage of over US$110 million from the BoT's EPA
account, the Government set up an investigative task force on the case and has implemented
an action plan to refocus the BoT on its core activities. It also reached an agreement between
the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs (MoFEA) and BoT on the management of any
remaining EPA claims. Following the work of the EPA task force, several high-ranking
officials and businessmen involved have been prosecuted and almost half the amount
embezzled has been recovered, although a number of companies implicated have yet to be


                                                                                                          13
prosecuted, or may not be prosecuted on the ground that they have returned the stolen funds.
There is also a court case against one of the suspects involved in the Richmond energy
scandal. However, the delays in which the state has dealt with the recommendations of the
Parliamentary Select Committee that investigated this scandal casts doubts on whether all
those involved in this scandal will be held fully accountable. The Government has sent a
signal of its commitment to pursue corruption cases, but for this message to be fully credible
and dispel perceptions of the impunity of public leaders, it is important that the key
prosecution agencies, PCCB, and the Department of Public Prosecution are seen as applying
the rule of law uniformly.

37. Although Tanzania's public financial management (PFM) system is more solid than
most in Africa, progress has been slow in the past few years, and in some areas a tendency
toward deterioration of the key PFM system has been recorded. Over the last year, there have
been few areas of progress. A new economic classification of the budget has been introduced,
the annual accounts are now compliant with International Public Sector Accounting Standards
(IPSAS), Internal Audit has been strengthened and made independent, a new Public Finance
Act has been drafted, and there have been major improvements in the functioning of the
procurement regulator and the National Audit Office (NAO).

38. These improvements have, however, been too slow to prevent a gradual deterioration of
the overall quality of PFM systems, as reflected by declining PEFA scores over the past five
years. The recent 2008 report of the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) has pointed to
some problems including weaknesses with the Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS) both at the central and local government level, poor bank reconciliation, lack
of reliable information on government revenues, weak internal controls, a 52 percent increase
in loss of public money and stores, and an increase of more than 100 percent in carried
forward commitments between FY2006/07 and FY2007/08.

                      III. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
39.    The Government of Tanzania completed its second poverty reduction strategy (PRS)
called MKUKUTA in June 2005. The strategy covered the period from 2005 to 2010. It
emphasizes accelerating private-sector-led growth by building a competitive economy
supported by an efficient government. It also recognizes that policies will be required to
ensure that growth is shared and benefits the poor. Building on experience with previous
PRSs, the MKUKUTA adopted an outcome-based approach stressing inter-sectoral linkages
and synergies. It defined three clusters of broad outcomes: growth and reduction of income-
poverty; improvement of quality of life and social well-being; and governance and
accountability.

40.     The president and the parliamentary majority were elected in mid-2005 on the basis of
an electoral platform known as the CCM manifesto, from the winning party's name.4 The
CCM manifesto has become the explicit programmatic platform of the Government under the
new president and is often cited before the MKUKUTA as one of the key drivers of
government policy. The 2005 CCM manifesto and the MKUKUTA support similar overall
priorities, but the two agendas sometimes appear to imply different implementation strategies.
The original CCM manifesto's focus on physical outputs has been seen, at times, as
distracting from agreed and more articulate sectoral strategies. How the Government is able to
balance any tensions between the two will be critical to the quality of its development policy.

41.     The Government's reform program in implementing the MKUKUTA is articulated in
five core reforms in the public sector and governance areas, and in a number of sector
strategies. These thematic and sector strategies are the foundations for practical policy
implementation, although they are unevenly synchronized with MKUKUTA, and the level of
ownership throughout the Government is not fully clear.

42.     While there is a broad consensus between the Government and the Development
Partners (DPs) on the goal of more pro-poor growth, as well as the importance of agriculture,
private sector development, better natural resource management, and investment in human
capital, there is much less consensus around the ways through which the benefits of growth
will be more widely shared. The Bank and many DPs favor an investment in market-
supporting institutions that might help establish the incentive structure for integrating the poor
most effectively into markets, whereas the Government has shifted toward interventionist
approaches, trying to correct market mechanisms with widespread state led-interventions. The
Bank will continue to support active dialogue with the Government on this issue, through a
set of knowledge activities and technical assistance.

43.    MKUKUTA I will end after mid-2010. A new PRS (MKUKUTA II) is currently
under the final phase of approval by the Government. The new PRS will have a heavier focus
on economic growth, particularly on agriculture and infrastructure sectors.

44.   General and presidential elections are scheduled for October 2010. This will affect
government and parliamentary activities during the current year, while it may also add to

spending pressures in some areas. The timing of the elections also coincides with the
launching of the new PRS, which may add complexity to how the new strategy will be shaped
in terms of both content and speed of finalization.

    IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY
                                       A. LINK TO CAS

45.     The proposed PRSC-8 is congruent with the Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania
(JAST) (covering the World Bank's FY07­FY10 with one year extension to FY11), presented
to the Board of Executive Directors in March 2007 as the country assistance strategy (CAS)
being developed jointly with 22 development partners (DPs), including the Bank. The JAST
clearly identifies general budget support (GBS) as the preferred aid modality. GBS is believed
to foster ownership, donor harmonization and alignment, and domestic accountability. DPs
have endorsed government programs and strategies, increasingly using harmonized aid
modalities and relying on government processes and systems. Slow progress on public
financial management, procurement, budget planning and implementation, and development
outcomes limits an increase of direct budget support toward the high scenario under the JAST.

46.    The mid-term review of JAST in the form of a CAS progress report was presented to
the Board in March 2010. While the overall objectives set out in the original CAS/JAST
remain valid and relevant, the progress report introduces two adjustments: (i) CAS period
coverage has been extended by one year to include FY11 so as to align the next CAS/JAST to
the launch of the new PRS (MKUKUTA II), which has been delayed, and (ii) the CAS
Results Matrix has been revised, updated, and streamlined to improve its quality and realism.

47.     The progress report notes that a mix of exogenous and endogenous shocks combined
with a slower than anticipated speed of reforms. These shocks include global food and
financial crises, modest progress in key reforms and governance-related issues (inducing a
shift away from GBS), a decrease in the 2008 CPIA rating and resulting lower IDA 15
allocation to Tanzania, and rapidly growing regional initiatives--has called for adjustments to
the lending program. Investment operations have been scaled up, and their sequencing and
size have been adjusted to reflect project readiness and absorptive capacity. On the other
hand, the proportion of budget support operations in total lending has been reduced to 32
percent for FY07­FY10 from the 50 percent initially envisaged in the CAS.

    B. COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS AND THE
                                IMF

48.     The IMF Executive Board approved a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for
Tanzania in February 2007, supporting the goal of achieving sustainable broad-based high
growth, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The core objectives of the program are
enhancing public resource mobilization and efficiency of spending; increasing the financial
sector's contribution to growth and the effectiveness of monetary policy; and improving the
business and investment environment. The periodic IMF assessments of Tanzania's
macroeconomic performance serve as a key input for dialogue and assessments on policies
related to macroeconomic stability. IDA and IMF staffs collaborate closely, notably on public
expenditure management, financial sector, debt sustainability, and PRS assessments. In the
context of the ongoing dialogue under the PSI, on May 27, 2009, the IMF Executive Board
approved a one-year Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) for SDR 218.79 million (about
US$336 million) to cushion the country from the effects of the global economic crisis. The


                                              17
program envisages fiscal and monetary easing to support growth, which is being adversely
impacted by falling prices for agricultural exports (cotton, cashews, and coffee); a decline in
tourism; and a slowdown in investment. The IMF financing will bolster Tanzania's foreign
reserves and support its balance of payments, which have been undermined by a 26 percent
fall in the price for cotton, a major export, and by a severe downturn in tourism and foreign
direct investment. The ESF is designed to provide policy support and financial assistance to
low-income countries facing exogenous but temporary shocks. The IMF Executive Board
completed the seventh review under the PSI and second review under ESF in June 2010. A
new three-year PSI was approved by the Board at the same time.

49.      The PRSCs have been implemented through the harmonized framework for GBS with
13 other DPs, namely, African Development Bank, Canada, Denmark, European
Commission, Finland, Ireland, Japan, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland,
and United Kingdom. Among those DPs, Japan provides parallel financing with the Bank for
this operation. GBS is an aid delivery modality that provides financial assistance to the
overall national budget, making up 12 percent of the government budget and 36 percent of the
total foreign aid to Tanzania in FY2008/09. Under the GBS, the participating DPs, including
the Bank, coordinate their policy dialogues with the Government through a structured system
of Cluster Working Groups, guided by annual Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)
agreed between the Government and the DPs. The PAF is a matrix that contains commitments
that have been jointly agreed between the Government and DPs, consisting of the three
categories that are monitored throughout the year: (i) Underlying Process; (ii) Temporary
Process Actions; and (iii) Outcome Indicators.

                    C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

50.      The PRSC has a two-way interface with sector investment operations:

      a. The objectives of the PRSC in many areas are supported by the implementation of
         Bank/DP sector investment programs, ensuring that PRSC objectives in these areas are
         realistic and receive appropriate technical support.

      b. On the other hand, the PRSC dialogue supports specific sector policy or cross-sector
         constraints that are difficult to handle at the project/sector level. PRSC also depends
         on the Bank's and on other DPs' analytical agenda to update its areas of focus and its
         policy content.

                                     D. LESSONS LEARNED

51.     The Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) of the first series of PRSC-
1/3 was completed in June 2007 and reviewed by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of
the World Bank. This evaluation stressed the need to establish a clearer results framework for
the operation and correspondingly strengthening the monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
system in country. It also stressed the importance of supporting the Government in achieving
better efficiency and impact in public expenditures and focusing on policies to rebalance the
growth pattern toward the rural areas. The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) of the World
Bank has performed a Quality at Entry assessment for PRSC-5, which found the operation to



                                               18
be Highly Satisfactory overall, and commended it as a best practice example of how the new
(post­Paris Declaration) aid architecture can function. It also highlighted areas for
improvement, including building greater in-country demand for good governance as well as
encouraging more cost-effective mechanisms for tracking performance in key public services
and a greater focus on the drivers of growth in line with the ICR findings. On the broader
budget support framework in the country, the current set up of the PAF and of GBS dialogue
is the result of a profound restructuring of harmonized budget support in Tanzania that started
at the time of the MKUKUTA in 2005/06 and took stock of the experience of budget support
under the first PRS, aiming at simplifying and rebalancing the structure of the budget support
and strengthening the quality of the dialogue.

52.      Lessons learned from earlier operations under the current series indicate a need to
realistically assess the readiness of the Government to engage in a strong reform program,
taking into account both the overall policy direction of the leadership and the implementation
capacity of the administration. This assessment should feed back more flexibly into the level
and content of the program.

                            E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

53.     The World Bank has a focused analytical work program addressing the core issues
supported by the PRSC series. In agriculture, the Bank is finalizing a detailed sector strategy
piece, and has already competed three notes on crop marketing, as part of the poverty
assessment. In natural resources, the Bank has given technical assistance to the ministry to
prepare its action plan. The Bank finalized last year an Investment Climate Assessment and a
review of labor market regulations. An Economic and Sector Work (ESW) on the micro-
constraints to growth from a private sector perspective has started, and should provide
specific inputs into the private sector development agenda. Work is also ongoing on trade and
logistics. The poverty assessment is carrying out a household level analysis of the dynamics
of poverty in a number of districts. The annual Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Reviews (PEFAR) report is to be completed by the end of the fiscal year,
analyzing both budget resources allocation and PFM issues, while the Bank and other donors
are also providing capacity building on budget management and the medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF). A Water Public Expenditure Review (PER) has just been completed.

  V. THE PROPOSED EIGHTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT
                         CREDIT
                             A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

Overall Strategic Focus

54.     The proposed eighth poverty reduction support credit (PRSC-8) would be the fifth and
the last in a series of five annual operations (PRSC-4/8), supporting the implementation of
Tanzania's second National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction, or MKUKUTA.
The Bank's PRSC support is provided within a harmonized framework for General Budget
Support (GBS).

55.     The strategic focus of the PRSC-4/8 series is on supporting the Government with
respect to two broad sets of objectives: (i) sustaining high and shared economic growth and
(ii) expanding the effective delivery of basic services through the government budget.

56.     The two PRSC strategic objectives map out into a graduated set of operational policy
areas. The shared growth objective is articulated in the following three policy areas:

       In infrastructure, the PRSC series objective is to address critical elements of the
       institutional set-up for transport and energy. Across infrastructure sectors, the PRSC
       series is supporting the emergence of a solid public private partnerships (PPP)
       institutional framework.
       In the area of business climate, the PRSC series is trying to support a number of
       discrete policy actions that are part of the Government's overall plan under the BEST
       program, with a focus on business and licensing, registration, and land management,
       identified in the cost of doing business (CoDB) as critical for Tanzania.
       This PRSC series is re-engaging the policy dialogue on the overall agricultural policy
       framework, which has had a poor track record in terms of reforms, with widespread
       distortions at various levels, and has suffered from low public investment.
The objective of supporting service delivery of public goods through the budget is pursued
through the following four interventions:
       Support the implementation of sector strategies and the strengthening of the
       monitoring and evaluation systems in selected service delivery sectors.
       Support improvement to the quality of budget preparation and execution.
       Strengthen the integrity and soundness of the PFM system, focusing on audit and
       procurement, and improve the effectiveness of the public administration, focusing
       notably on civil service reform and wage bill management.
       Improve the institutional framework for anti-corruption in and accountability of the
       state, notably by supporting the enforcement of more comprehensive anti-corruption
       institutions, and strengthening the oversight function of the audit and regulatory
       authorities.


                                             20
  57.     A detailed description of the policy objectives and achievements under these headings
  is provided in the "Description of Policy Areas" subheading in this section.

  58.     Funding under PRSC is also been used to mitigate the continued impact of the global
  crisis. The World Bank provided the supplemental financing under PRSC-7 to support the
  Government's stimulus program, which largely covered the initial financing gap in the
  FY2009/10 budget. However, as noted above, the economy is expected to continue to
  experience balance-of-payments pressures and a financing gap due to weaker revenue
  performance. To mitigate the continued impact, the Government intends to continue to protect
  expenditures in FY2010/11 as it did in FY2009/10. This operation will provide $15 million in
  additional resources under the crisis response window (CRW) to support those budget
  objectives. This is expected to result in allowing the Government to protect core development
  expenditures under MKUKUTA and pursue its pro-poor growth goal while the economy
  gradually recovers from the downturn caused by the global crisis.

  PRSC-8 Description

  59.     For the third year in a row, the joint assessment of the GBS Annual Review (AR) 2009
  (held from November 23 to 25, 2009, in Dar es Salaam) found that overall progress was
  moderately satisfactory. The AR concluded that the Government and Budget Support Partners
  recognize the importance of accelerating the implementation of the agenda for inclusive
  growth, poverty reduction, and equity and addressing corruption and impediments to doing
  business, all of which are required for Tanzania to achieve its objective of joining the ranks of
  middle-income countries by 2025 as envisaged in the country's Development Vision.

  60.    The assessment of performance under the 2009 PAF showed that 15 out of 20
  Underlying Processes were assessed as satisfactory during the year, 13 out of 25 Temporary
  Process Actions were achieved, and 18 out of 34 Outcome Indicators are on track.

  61.    The PRSC-8 operation is based on 11 triggers that were established during negotiation
  of PRSC-7 and are drawn from the 2009 PAF. Seven out of 11 triggers were fully or
  substantially completed, one has been partially completed, and three have not been met (Table
  7).

policy objectives (MKUKUTA, sector policies).



  62.     Key progress achieved by the Government under the program include taking effective
  measures to reduce the congestion at the container terminal at the Dar es Salaam port,
  improving budget execution of the recurrent budget, and finalizing and initial implementation
  of an action plan to improve the transparency of resource allocation and revenue collection in
  the natural resource sectors. Three important actions that have been met only with
  considerable delay compared to the original schedule relate to the electricity tariff submission
  to meet full cost recovery, the amendment to the procurement legislation to strengthen the
  autonomy and powers of the procurement regulatory authority, and submission of a PPP law
  to Parliament.

  63.     The three triggers that have not been fully met are related to the reduction in the
  agricultural cess tax rate, to the issuance of pay targets for the civil service, and to the quality
  and alignment of the FY2009/10 budget. The trigger that was only partially met is related the
  land registry. The unachieved goal to reduce the agriculture produce cess rate imposed by the
  local government authorities (LGAs) during FY2010/11 reflects the negative impacts the
  economy received from the global financial crisis which made it difficult for the Government
  to take an immediate step to reduce cess across all LGAs. But it also reflects the complexity


                                                               22
      in the local government financing reform. The failure to fully meet the budget alignment
      trigger reflects a broader worsening of overall budget preparation in a pre-election year. It was
      improved through dialogue, notably for the roads budget, and is being addressed through the
      PER dialogue. The failure to make progress on specific civil service targets is linked to the
      delay in finalizing and approving a new medium-term pay policy (MTPP).

Indicative PRSC-9 Triggers

65.     The PAF for the GBS 2010 cycle adopted at the November 2009 Annual Review (see
Annex 2) includes a government commitment to implement key measures to improve the
private sector business climate, the marketing environment for the private sector in
agriculture, phased abolition of the distortive crop cess in agriculture, and measures to
improve the distribution of human resources in public services, although many of these
measures lack specificity to date. There remain questions on the effectiveness of the
Government's policy choices in several sectors, such as agriculture, tourism, and information
and communication technologies (ICT), where it appears to rely excessively on direct and
extensive public intervention in the economy and/or heavy regulation of the private sector.
Dialogue is expected to continue and intensify following elections.

66.     Several of these key agreed PAF actions are being proposed as the preliminary set of
triggers toward PRSC-9 (see Table 9), which is envisaged to be the first in the next series of
PRSCs. Given the fact that PRSC-9 prior actions would still cover the last year under the
current PRS and an election year, the intent is to significantly strengthen the substantive
policy actions under the areas defined by the triggers, based on the new MKUKUTA and
dialogue with the current and new administrations, including possibly a short-term program
which will be implemented after the election in October 2010. To ensure that the next PRSC
series can achieve its objectives, this may entail some delay in the processing of PRSC-9 with
respect to the FY2011/12 budget cycle. Proposed preliminary PRSC-9 triggers are presented
side-by-side with PRSC-8 triggers in Table 9 and are designed to ensure continuity in
dialogue and smooth bridging to the anticipated next PRSC operation. These will be fully
fleshed out in the PRSC-9 program document.

                     B. SUMMARY ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL PROGRESS

67.    The country's leadership is committed to pursuing a broad structural reform agenda
needed to modernize the economy. The policy stance over the past few years, however, has
been characterized by slow implementation of structural reforms, and weakened commitment


                                                              25
and consistency toward a stable and reliable investment climate for the private sector. This
lack of a strong reform drive can be explained in part by political events and administrative
restructuring that have hampered the cohesiveness of government action. On the other hand,
slow gains in poverty reduction for the majority of the population have also led the
Government to embrace more pervasive, and often unpredictable, government interventions in
the economy in order to attempt to address the perceived failure of previous reforms to deliver
for the common citizen.

68.     In recent years, a number of overall policy performance indicators for Tanzania have
worsened. Tanzania's ranking on the Cost of Doing Business declined by seven places in
2009; the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment and UK
Department for International Development (DFID) Public Financial Management (PFM) risk
assessment have downgraded Tanzania; its ranking by Transparency International has fallen
again in 2009; and the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating, though still
relatively high at 3.8, was revised downward by 0.1 points in 2008 and kept constant in 2009.
Progress on the Government's main private sector development program has continued to be
slow, and the PFM reform program has been rated unsatisfactory by development partners
(DPs).

69.     GBS partners and the Bank share an assessment of the overall performance of the
program as mixed. There have been important areas of progress, but also a rather slow pace of
reform in some critical areas, as well as questions as to the effectiveness of a number of recent
policy directions. Together with the weaker alignment of the budget to the MKUKUTA than
in previous years, and the lack of specificity of many of the government commitments for the
next operation, this has created a sense that the current policy stance cannot sustain the large,
comprehensive, policy-based budget support program that was envisaged under the CAS, but
only a more limited support under this aid modality.

70.      Against the backdrop of a lackluster implementation of policy reforms, the 2009
Annual Review of General Budget Support for Tanzania has witnessed the continuation of a
constructive dialogue, initiated at the 2008 AR, on the need to re-energize the private sector
development and agriculture sector agendas. Over the first half of 2010, the Government has
shown renewed dynamism to revitalize some critical parts of its policy reform agenda. In
particular, the president appointed a taskforce, coordinated by the Prime Minister's Office, to
address administrative constraints to private sector development, which will produce a
roadmap for improving the investment climate in Tanzania. The Government has also shown
commitment on moving forward the PPP legislation through Parliament. A new major
initiative to prioritize agriculture modernization, Kilimo Kwanza, has been launched and
provides the basis for enhanced dialogue on improving incomes of the rural population as
well as higher allocation of public expenditures to the sector. Overall, it is hoped that, after
the elections, the new administration will be able to continue revitalizing the policy reform
agenda and strengthening the budget system, so as to allow a return to higher levels of budget
support.

71.    Based on the overall assessment of the program, the amount of proposed PRSC-8 is
US$115million (including US$15 million from CRW), down from US$190 million provided
through PRSC-7.

                                          C. RESULTS

72.     The results framework (RF) covering the whole PRSC-4/8 series in support of
MKUKUTA is fully congruent with the PAF. Given the high level of harmonization, it is not
possible to distinguish the results supported by PRSC separately from the overall Poverty
Reduction Budget Support, although indications are given as to the PRSC specific policy
measures. The RF identifies a limited number of Project Development Objectives that will
allow for the measurement of the success of the PRSC series over its full cycle. The RF is
organized around the three MKUKUTA broad clusters of objectives, each of which has three
main outcome areas, resulting in a 3x3 overall structure with nine outcome areas which maps
closely the seven main policy areas of the PRSC series (Table 10).

73.    The PRSC's RF integrates information provided in earlier PRSC documentation for
Tanzania, consistent with the current ICR format, so as to enhance the quality and relevance
of M&E for the operation. The RF is based on the full five-year period in terms of overall
development objectives but focuses policy actions around the current PRSC operation.

74.     The results since the second PRSC series was initiated in 2005 show steady
improvements in several outcome areas, but also a few setbacks. In particular, road
construction has increased substantially, and road quality has also improved and is on track
for reaching its target, owing to higher funding for maintenance. Congestion at the port of Dar
es Salaam worsened after an initial improvement in the early 2000s. However, the record
shows an improvement in recent months. Weak progress is also observed in the Doing
Business ranking and agriculture sector growth. Enrollment in education has expanded
significantly at all levels, but completion rates, especially in primary grades, do not mirror an
equally promising trend. Tanzania has expanded energy supply capacity at a much slower
rate than anticipated, but it has improved immunization coverage rates. The RF also shows
improvements in current budget execution and in the timeliness of the Auditor General report.
The progress in the civil service reform remains mediocre due to the slowed progress in the
pay policy reform to provide better incentives to civil servants serving underserved areas and
thus improve quality of social services in such areas.

75.     Given the weak progress in reforms and the subsequent adjustments in the Bank's
policy dialogue with the Government, which directly affects the outcomes, the corresponding
intermediate outcome indicators in RF for doing business and pay policy have new program
targets to reflect such adjustments, which are set separately from MKUKUTA targets.

                           D. DESCRIPTION OF POLICY AREAS

76.    The modest results in reducing income-poverty present a challenge for the
achievement of the broad development objectives of this second PRSC series for Tanzania.
The PRSC-6 Program Document anticipated that, in case of an income-poverty reduction
scenario much below the MKUKUTA target, the PRSC's policy focus should increase in
those areas that have been identified as key for the poverty reduction impact, namely income
generation in rural areas and the overall business environment, while continuing to encourage
progress in solving key infrastructure constraints.

77.     In this context, the PRSC series' strategic focus on higher shared-growth and
expanded service delivery through the government budget is still relevant, both in terms of
assessment of PRSC-8 and in terms of future policy dialogue under the forthcoming PRSC
series, which will be initiated with the PRSC-9 operation. A greater focus on engaging with
the Government and supporting reforms in agriculture and private sector development, which
are expected to raise the poor's income opportunities, is being implanted in this PRSC-8. At
the same time, PRSC-8 also supports key policies in infrastructure and overall governance to
raise regional and global competitiveness of the economy.

78.    Areas of enhanced focus: In agriculture, the PRSC supports the phased replacement
of the crop cess tax and improvements in the agricultural marketing regime. PRSC also
supports the Government's renewed efforts to implement a comprehensive roadmap to
improve the business climate in Tanzania.

79.     Areas of continued focus: In infrastructure, PRSC is supporting the establishment of
an overall legal and institutional framework for PPP. Successful progress in natural resource
management is a continued focus. The PRSC will still monitor the completion of satisfactory
sector reviews in the three key social sectors--education, health, and water--and will monitor
the alignment and execution of the budget. On PFM, the trigger targets the implementation
measure to improve the reliability and functionality of the IFMIS.

80.    The rest of the section provides an assessment of recent developments in the policy
areas supported by the PRSC, focusing particularly on the discussion of prior actions for
PRSC-8 and triggers for PRSC-9, which are critical to the achievement of Tanzania's
MKUKUTA objectives.

MKUKUTA Implementation: Cluster 1 - Growth and Reduction of Poverty

81.     Cross-cutting issues: Sustaining and further increasing economic growth, while
making sure it is sufficiently pro-poor to have a tangible impact on the large majority of
Tanzanians, are critical to Tanzania's development. Slow improvement in the environment
for the private sector, especially pervasive regulatory impediments and taxes that are
detrimental to farmers and private businesses, and stagnant productivity in agriculture are
primary constrains to sustainable economic growth. Fostering income generation in rural
areas, promoting an enabling business environment, and addressing infrastructure constraints
will be critical to poverty reduction. While physical bottlenecks still exist in infrastructure,


                                              33
from transport to energy, the priority for this operation is to support the Government's
initiatives to strengthen market institutions and remove distortionary regulatory measures and
interventions in developing a pro-poor sustainable growth path, based on its comparative
advantages (agriculture and natural resources) and being driven by the private sector and the
market.

82.     Agriculture: Recognizing the fundamental role the agricultural sector could play in
income generation and poverty reduction, the Government has strengthened its focus on
agriculture by adopting the "Agriculture First" policy, or Kilimo Kwanza. It recognizes the
central role of the agriculture sector in the country in bringing about social and economic
development and poverty reduction. The Government sees the role of Kilimo Kwanza as a
catalyst for implementing its Agricultural Sector Development Programme (ASDP), which
was launched in FY2006/07, by putting agriculture at the center of the pro-poor growth in the
country under MKUKUTA.

83.     The Government's renewed focus on agriculture is reflected in the increased budget
allocation for the sector. Despite this significant increase, public spending in agriculture
overall remains low, at less than 2 percent of GDP. Considerable fiscal space will be needed
to ensure agricultural transformation as envisioned in Kilimo Kwanza. The acceleration of
agricultural growth consistent with the Government's economic development and poverty
reduction objectives will require a scaling-up of fiscal resources, particularly for core public
goods and for sustainable program aimed at improving the productivity of small-holding
farmers. And scaling up of the agriculture budget needs to be complemented by reorientation
of Ministries, Department, and Agencies (MDAs) activities and private sector investments.

84.      Motivating farmers to expand output is an overarching aim of agricultural policy, and
the demand side reforms hold the key. It is crucial that policy reforms are put in place to
provide right incentives to farmers. Basic incentives are best provided by market prices. Low
producer prices give rise to thin profit margins, especially for small-holder farmers, providing
little incentive for productivity increases and making agriculture production in Tanzania very
vulnerable to changes in input prices and labor costs. A substantial improvement in the price
incentives for agricultural products is an indispensable intermediate objective of a successful
implementation of Kilimo Kwanza.

85.     With transport cost as the principal cost driver in agricultural marketing in Tanzania,
expansion and maintenance of rural roads continue to be an important area for both traditional
and non-traditional sub-sectors. Although the number is declining over the past years, more
than 40 percent of rural roads are still in poor condition and not passable during rainy seasons.
A rural road program has been finalized, and but implementation is hampered by low budget
execution. The Government's fertilizer scheme, based on subsidized transportation of private
input suppliers, was found to be expensive and ineffective in reducing the costs of inputs or
significantly increasing production. It has been phased out and replaced by the new
Agricultural Input Voucher Scheme.

86.    Studies on rural taxes have identified significant problems on the administration of the
produce cess and related local taxes. As the enforcement of the produce cess involved the
transportation sector in one way or another, it imposes restrictions on the free movement of


                                               34
agricultural produce and additional tax-like costs. The study on regulations and taxes
affecting agriculture at the local and national levels was launched together with Foreign
Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Cooperatives
(MAFC) and was completed in November 2009 (PRSC-8 prior action). Based on
observations from the study, it is suggested in the short term to reduce the overall taxes on
agriculture to below 10 percent. The Government has already announced in the FY2009/10
budget speech its plan to reduce the cess tax to 3 percent in FY2010/11. The Government
subsequently decided to withhold the immediate implementation of the decision and provided
a range of between 3 percent and 5 percent. The Government, however, continues to be
committed to reduce cess tax gradually.          For 2010 PAF, the Government and GBS
development partners (DPs) had agreed to adopt a Temporary Process Action (TPA) on
phased elimination of all local crop cess taxes from 5 percent to 3 percent and to 0 percent
within two fiscal years to be included in the Finance Bills FY2010/11 and FY2011/12 and
offset by a transfer while the overhaul of local taxation is carried out. The government has
now postponed the first phase of the reduction while it prepares an overhaul of local taxation
aimed at guaranteeing sound own revenues for local governments, while improving market
incentives in the agricultural sector (PRSC-9 preliminary trigger).

87.     More broadly, creating a more liberalized and competitive marketing environment for
agricultural products is conducive to the private-sector-driven agricultural development
envisaged in Kilimo Kwanza. Studies show that in many cash and staple crop markets, a
maze of regulations and taxes and interventions by the local government authorities (LGAs),
Crop Boards, and cooperatives create an unfavorable investment climate and low profitability.
Actions are urgently required by the Government to address factors that drive a wedge
between the consumer and market prices and diminish farmers' profit margins and promote
agriculture development based on market incentives, such as domestic market development of
seeds, fertilizers, insecticides, and other inputs, scaled up and innovative investments in rural
road maintenance and development, and reforms of the marketing and regulatory systems
with a view to introducing more competition and reducing monopolistic and rent-seeking
activities by traders, cooperatives, LGAs, and officials. Crop board amendments were
submitted to the Parliament in July 2009. The Government and GBS DPs have agreed to
include a TPA on an agricultural marketing strategy by July 2010 and implementation of key
measures to improve the marketing environment for private sector by December 2010 (PRSC-
9 preliminary trigger).

PRSC-8 Trigger (not met): Update FIAS study paying particular attention to regulations and local
taxes affecting agriculture and undertake consultations and agree to an action plan based on the
findings and recommendations of the study.
PRSC-9 Preliminary Trigger: Overhaul of local taxation with a view to improving market
incentives in the agricultural sector.
PRSC-9 Preliminary Trigger: Finalize an Agricultural Marketing Strategy and implement key
measures to improve the marketing environment for private sector by December 2010.
Objective: Under PRSC-8, the Government is expected to address a broader set of issues in
agriculture related to agricultural marketing regulation and taxation. It is also expected to see the Crop
Board amendments passed by Parliament to become effective.

88.      Natural resources: Natural resources contribute to economic outputs through
traditional activities such as forestry, fishing, mining, and tourism and are an important basis
of livelihood for Tanzanian households, particularly those in the rural areas. Better
management of such resources would have significant pro-poor growth impacts in the long
run. Presently, the sector is constrained by shortfalls in governance and law enforcement as
well as weak regulatory capacity. Legislation for commercial natural resources management
(NRM) is in place. However, weak governance and law enforcement threatens the
sustainability of most sectors. Outside the protected areas, zoning for regulating the use of soil
and water is absent. There are several programs that are supported by DPs encouraging
sustainable livelihoods. In general, the protected areas system in terrestrial areas is effective,
though adjacent communities are not actively engaged in decisions affecting their livelihood.
In protected marine areas, the current system is ineffective, with unsustainable fisheries
activities taking place in and around some of the protected areas. Particular issues remain
regarding transparency of pricing systems, allocation of concessions, adequacy of rent
capture, and regulatory measures to control fishing and forestry activities.

89.      The objective of the operation in the natural resources sector is to improve the overall
institutional environment, especially in terms of transparency, to allow for a more sustainable
and profitable exploitation of the resources for the local communities. The sector has
registered positive policy developments at the institutional level. Tanzania has applied
formally to EITI, paving the way for a more transparent framework in the sector. Improving
the system of allocation of natural resources, in terms of transparency, valuation, and
openness, is a prerequisite for a more sustainable management of these resources and for
greater economic opportunities for local communities, particularly for poor, subsistence-level
rural households. There is a growing recognition by the Government and DPs of the need to
improve the incentive structure, transparency and accountability by focusing the dialogue on
the development of a decentralized NRM program. The Ministry of Natural Resources and
Tourism (MNRT) has achieved good progress in carrying out a review of the different
licensing and concession modalities related to forestry and wildlife.

90.     The Government approved action plans to improve accountability and transparency in
allocating natural resource licenses and concessions in October 2009. The plans cover mining,
fisheries, and forestry and wildlife, and their implementation has been initiated (PRSC-8 Prior
Action). A key feature of these action plans is the set up of new revenue collection system
mechanisms (using commercial banks), which will include LGAs and ensure timely transfer
of funds through the system. In addition, it is expected that the predictability of revenue
streams will improve as a result of the development of a cash flow forecast and retention
scheme to meet full Other Charges (OC) expenditures in cooperation with Ministry of Finance
and Economic Affairs (MoFEA). As part of the implementation of the Natural Resources
Action Plan, the Government is making an effort to strengthen NRM monitoring and
evaluation by adopting a new coding system that differentiates between illegally collected
natural resource products and legally collected resource products in the area of forestry and
wildlife.

91.     In terms of revenue collection, a performance assessment was conducted by MNRT
task force and the consultants to review the MNRT revenues collection structure and elaborate
a revised strategy for improving the same. The ministry is currently developing short-,


                                               36
medium-, and long-term strategies to effect their recommendations. In an effort to increase
revenue collection and avoid tax evasion, MNRT has strengthened its monitoring and control
functions by setting up units for anti-poaching activities and forest surveillance. This has
been accompanied by increasing field presence through a network of (fixed) checkpoints in
strategic parts of the country. Considering existing opportunities to improve the efficiency in
non-tax revenues collection from natural resources, which is currently reaching only 10
percent in most districts, it is expected that the targets set in the PAF can be achieved through
maintained or even decreased harvesting and production levels.                  Furthermore, the
establishment of Forest Surveillance Units and the Deep Sea Fishing Authority has increased
the capacity for management planning and control in two of the key natural resources sectors.

92.     Under PAF 2010, the Government is committed to implement key actions of the
action plans following the timetable specified in the monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
framework (PRSC-9 preliminary trigger). In doing so, the Government and DPs have agreed
to carry out a Natural Resources Sector Review, which will include quarterly meetings as well
as the implementation of relevant analytical work to support the implementation of the action
plans.

 PRSC-8 Prior Action: Action plan to improve accountability and transparency in allocating natural
 resource licenses and concessions approved and implementation initiated.
 PRSC-9 Preliminary Trigger: Government to implement key actions of Natural Resources
 (forestry, wildlife and fisheries) accountability and transparency action plans following the timetable
 specified in the M&E framework.
 Objective: In the natural resources sector, it is expected that the Government will adopt a solid plan
 to improve the transparency and sustainability of natural resources licensing and concessioning, and
 take action to implement quick wins under this plan.

93.     Infrastructure Tangible progress has been achieved over the past year in
infrastructure, with remaining issues in several areas. In transport, marked improvements have
been made in the conditions of the road network in Tanzania, while railways continue to
suffer from a lack of effective management and declining business. Since 2005, roads in good
and fair condition have increased from 50 percent to 58.5 percent for rural roads, and from 82
percent to 95 percent for trunk and regional roads, but the Government will need to adjust
maintenance funding to keep pace with inflation and road construction. In contrast, the joint
venture for the Tanzania Railway Limited (TRL) with as private concessionaire has
unraveled, as stakeholders have not been able to agree on a workable business plan to help
revive the company. An agreement is being finalized to return the company under public
ownership, and the government will be looking at options to run the railways efficiently,
including a management contract or a further concession agreement. Recently, thanks to
some pertinent measures taken--but also due to the international financial crisis, which
reduced transit traffic--the dwell time at the Port of Dar es Salaam was reduced to 12 days.
The poor performance of port over the last few years has been a key impediment to trade and
consequently to the improved performance of the Tanzanian economy. The dwell time (for
imported containers) had been consistently above 20 days over the past five years. One of the
key requirements for improved port performance is that the Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA)
assumes its role as a landlord, as is required by law, and focuses on port performance rather
than on operations. Progress was achieved over the past year: TPA has prepared a


                                                  37
preliminary version of a time-bound action plan for moving to the landlord status; based on
TPA application, the Surface and Maritime Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA) approved an
increase in port storage tariffs and a reduction in free time; and the Government established
own area for impounded containers (PRSC-8 prior action).

PRSC-8 Prior Action: Government improved port congestion situation by three key measures:
(i)Tanzania Ports Authority prepared a preliminary version of a time-bound action plan for moving to
Landlord Status; (ii) Based on TPA application, SUMATRA approved increase in port storage tariffs
and reduction in free time,; and (iii) Government established own area for impounded containers.


94.      Access to electricity has increased (8.2 to 14 percent of population over the 2005­9
period), but the electrification rate is still very low and users face severe and prolonged power
outages.5 These are the result of procurement scandals related to existing generation projects
(e.g., IPTL, Richmond), regional droughts that reduced the hydropower generation outputs, as
well as the technical dilapidation and saturation of the existing transmission and distribution
network resulting from decades of underinvestment in the sector. To enhance its planning
capacities, the Government had prepared a long-term least-cost Power System Master Plan
(PSMP) in 2008, which was further updated in August 2009. In order to cope with the
continuing strong demand growth in the short term and to reduce its dependency on hydro-
based generation resources, Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) has installed an
additional 147 mega watt of gas-fired generation capacity since January 2008. Furthermore
the Bank is supporting TANESCO and the GoT in developing its medium- to long-term
power generation options under various existing projects. TANESCO, a single vertically
integrated national utility, has made improvements in its financial situation and for the first
time meets its operational costs. 6 However, continued efforts to expand the generation
capacity and boost operational efficiency (by reducing losses and improving tariff collections)
are required to meet the growing demand for power and to reverse operating losses. In the
energy sector the Government continues with the implementation of the strategy described in
PRSC-7. Recent progress made includes: (i) a new Electricity Bill was approved in 2008, and
(ii) a cost-of-service study was conducted in 2009 and recently finalized, which supported
TANESCO's next tariff application (PRSC-8 Prior Action). In the past year, the Government
has made further progress on the implementation of its Power Sector Reform Strategy,
approved in 2007. The regulator (Energy and Water Utility Regulatory Authority: EWURA)
recently prepared Standardized Small Power Purchase Agreements to attract investors in the
(renewable) power sub-sector (under 10 mega watt). EWURA has also approved and
disseminated the Standardized Power Purchase Agreement and tariff methodology as well as
the actual tariff for 2009 for both grid-connected projects and isolated grids.

  Tanzania is endowed with diverse energy sources including biomass, natural gas, hydropower, coal, geothermal,
solar power, and wind power, much of which is untapped. Despite this potential, Tanzania has one of the lowest
electrification rates in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA):14 percent compared to the SSA average of 29 percent and the
SSA low income average of 26 percent.
6
  In its third year since the approval of TANESCO's Financial Recovery Plan (FRP), the utility's financial health
has further improved. Following a substantial tariff increase by an average 21.7 percent in 2008, the revenue of
the company increased by 27 percent in the same year. In 2008, TANESCO was also able, for the first time in
many years, to meet its operating expenditures with an operating profit of T Sh 2.7 billion.


                                                      38
95.    A cost-of-service study commissioned by TANESCO was submitted to EWURA in
May 2010. Consistent with the study, TANESCO submitted a multiyear tariff application to
EWURA (PRSC-8 Prior Action). The normal application review process grants EWURA
eight months to reach a decision. The tariff application requests three stages of tariff increases
between now and 2013, with a view to achieve in 2011 full operational cost recovery, and by
2013 full cost recovery.

96.      To limit the impact of this increase on the poor, the requested increase for the lifeline
tariff is lower than the average tariff increase request and aligned with the increase in inflation
since the last tariff increase. TANESCO is actively engaged with commercial banks to
facilitate the amortization of new connection fees for low income consumers.

PRSC-8 Trigger: Strengthening TANESCO's revenue collection to meet full operational cost
recovery in 2010.
PRSC-8 Prior Action: An Energy Tariff application was successfully submitted by TANESCO to
the regulator to meet full operational cost recovery in 2011, and full cost recovery by 2013.


97.    Private sector development: Reforms under the BEST program have stalled over the
past two years due to a lack of direction linked to administrative reorganization of the
department responsible for private sector policies, as well as wavering commitment to broad-
based improvement of the overall business environment. PRSC support to BEST has been
focusing on discrete policy measures, in the area of the business registration and licensing
regime, which were supposed to complement the effort to improve infrastructure access but
have not experienced similar progress as in the case of Business Activities Registration Act
(BARA). On the other hand, modernization of Business Registrations and Licensing Agency
(BRELA) to improve efficiency of the agency's operations is on track. Discussion for a
regulatory licensing reform has been taking place between the Authorities and DPs with a
prospect of submitting a regulatory licensing policy to the Cabinet in 2010.

98.      A key component of the BEST program is the land administration reform. This is a
long-term reform aimed at establishing an effective, efficient, and equitable land
administration, guaranteeing security of tenure and facilitating an efficient land market.
Important achievements include the adoption over the past five years of key land legislation
(Land Act and Village Land Act, 2001); preparation of regulations and bills to regulate the
Real Estate Agency and Valuation Professions; procurement of surveying and mapping
equipment, with the mapping of 15 pilot districts due to commence; preparation of an
environmental assessment framework and resettlement policy framework; and reduction of
the backlog of land related disputes. However, progress in the implementation of these efforts
has been much slower than expected.7 The main reasons for this include (i) continuing debate
and persistent lack of policy consensus on some of the key provisions of the legal and
institutional framework, particularly by the implementing agencies; (ii) the lack of tested and

 For 2009/10, the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development reported that 11,795
certificates of title had been issued by December 2009. The ministry plans to issue a total 16,000 certificates by
June 2010. In terms of customary titles of occupancy in rural areas, a total of 14,500 Certificates of Customary
Rights of Occupancy (CCROs) were issued as of February 2010. A total of 32,366 farms were adjudicated as of
February 2010 and are in the process of receiving CCROs.


                                                       39
scalable mechanisms to formalize tenure rights in a systematic and self-sustaining way that is
adapted to the needs of different settings (e.g. rural and urban) settings; (iii) remaining gaps in
the legal and regulatory environment that would reduce the potential value of tenure rights
and thus the incentives to move ahead with implementation; and (iv) a rather centralized
mode of implementation whereby responsibilities and incentives of local governments are not
always in line with their human and financial resources or well coordinated with actions by
the Ministry of Land, Housing and Human Settlements Development. The ministry is in the
process of implementing strategies and streamlining procedures to arrive at a comprehensive,
fast, and user-friendly land registry. It is also launching an information system needs
assessment of the registry to identify the best options to manage the registry more efficiently
through the use of information technology. The completion of a land information assessment
study and subsequent agreement on an action plan to implement the study's recommendations
in order to improve land records management and to speed up land registration, however, are
still forthcoming (PRSC-8 prior action). The Needs Assessment Study has been completed
and the work on an action plan has been started, although the latter is still not finalized.

99.     In the context of 2010 PAF, the Government is committed to presenting a time-bound
roadmap to improve the business environment in Tanzania and implement selected critical
short-term priority actions detailed in this plan (PRSC-9 preliminary trigger). The roadmap
was finalized and the associated Cabinet paper was approved by the Cabinet in July 2010.
Major Components of the Government Roadmap on the Improvement of the Investment
Climate in Tanzania aim at simplifying regulatory compliance requirement for doing business
in four areas including starting, operating and reporting procedures as well as closing
business. Some of the key measures included in the roadmap include (i) amendment of the
payment schedule of the Companies Act to address cumbersome administration of multiple
fees for company registration /incorporation; (ii) consolidation of inspection procedures in
one process; and (iii) amendment of relevant land acts to simplify procedures and allow
commercial courts to determine mortgage matters. Some measures have already been taken,
such as removing the need for a separate valuation of property by Tanzania Revenue
Authority (TRA). Overall the roadmap represents a significant effort by the Government to
improve Tanzania's declining rating for business environment. The challenge will be to go
beyond narrow improvements of administrative procedures and address the policy and
regulatory dimension of the business environment, which is affected both by legislation and
by the practice toward the private sector in implementing rules and regulations.


PRSC-8 Prior Action: Progress in completion of land registry.
PRSC-9 Preliminary Trigger: GoT will present a time bound roadmap to improve the business
environment in Tanzania and implement selected critical short term priority actions detailed in this
plan.
Objective: Under PRCS-8, the Government is committed to strengthening the reforms to improve
the business environment while addressing efficiency in infrastructure services.

100. Tanzania's public-private partnership (PPP) efforts for utilities or infrastructure
entities have a poor track record. While much effort has been made by the Government in
investing in physical infrastructure such as roads, there remain substantial challenges in
improving efficiency of infrastructure services, where the governance structure of public


                                                40
enterprises providing infrastructure services is one of the key issues to be addressed. Most
major infrastructure/utility concessions have either been terminated (water, power), been
reverted to national ownership (airline, telecommunication), or faced a danger of negotiation
collapse (railways). The container terminal operator in Dar es Salaam Port has remained in
private hands but the circumstances regarding contract extension are being questioned. A
notable exception is Songas, a limited liability company for gas processing, transportation,
and power generation, which is majority owned and operated by a private investor. Supported
by the Bank, it has successfully established privately managed gas production and gas-fueled
power generation operations and contributed to expanding access to more affordable
electricity. The establishment of a modern framework for PPP will be critical to enable the
private sector to participate in the infrastructure projects and to allow Tanzania to meet its
formidable infrastructure financing needs. The draft policy paper was prepared and presented
to development partners in March 2009. Subsequently, a PPP policy was approved by the
Cabinet in October 2009. A new PPP bill was submitted to Parliament and approved in July
2010 (PRSC-8 prior action).

101. The new PPP law provides an adequate legal framework within which to promote the
country's PPP agenda. It is comparable to the PPP laws in other countries that are at a similar
stage of PPP development. There are some remaining areas of uncertainty in the bill: (i) the
lack of definition of PPP entails that it is not fully clear to which projects this bill is meant to
apply; (ii) lack of clarity on approvals, as the unit under the ministry responsible for
investment seems to comment only, and the unit in the Ministry for Finance and Economic
Affairs approves, but only for projects involving public finance (which term is not defined),
although there is also an implication that it must approve all projects; the Attorney General
must provide a legal opinion, but also "vets" each project (which is not defined). Such issues
could potentially lead to challenges in implementation once the law becomes effective.
Therefore, the supporting regulations will be critical (PRSC-9 preliminary trigger), but further
amendments might also be required as the Act is tested. The quality and capacity of the
coordinators and staff of the proposed Coordination and Finance Units will also be important.
In particular, the integration of the Coordination Unit with the other work of the Tanzania
Investment Centre will be critical. The institutional arrangements will also be key to the
success of the Tanzanian PPP initiative: how the two units will operate and cooperate with
each other.

102. For Tanzania to achieve private sector driven growth and poverty reduction as
envisioned in MKUKUTA and, more recently, as stipulated in Kilimo Kwanza in the context
of agriculture, it is critically important that the country come back on track for its progress in
improving business environment. Frequent market interferences by the state and lack of
market-supporting public policies raise transaction costs and reduce the opportunities for
businesses. Partly, inadequate soft institutional infrastructure for private sector development
can be traced to the still largely unfinished agenda of reducing the cost of doing business.

PRSC-8 Prior Action: PPP bill approved by Parliament.
PRSC-9 Preliminary Trigger: Regulatory framework for PPP prepared and implemented,
including progress in setting up central PPP units.

MKUKUTA Implementation: Cluster 2 - Quality of Life and Social Well-Being

103. Under this cluster, the PRSC focus is strictly on the monitoring and evaluation of
effective service delivery, or on critical cross-cutting issues, such as civil service
management, which link with other PRSC components. The operation does not deal directly
with social-sector-specific policy issues.

104. Monitoring of the three sectors covered, namely education, health and water, is done
through harmonized annual sector review processes, which assess (i) whether budgets are
aligned with strategies and implemented as agreed, (ii) whether the implemented strategies are
having the anticipated results, and (iii) when not, whether the strategies and implementation
plans are being revised accordingly through appropriate policy actions. The rating of the
review is a composite indicator that summarizes these assessments, together with the question
of whether the Government is enabling itself to be held accountable to a broad range of
stakeholders through an open review process. The 2009 reviews were satisfactory for all three
sectors.8

105. Cross-cutting challenges: Achievement of MKUKUTA objectives under this cluster
is reliant on service delivery capacity at the front line, particularly in local government
authorities (LGAs). Despite significant improvements in the conditions for LGA service
delivery, accountability in delivering social services remains insufficient, in particular due to
(i) inadequate information on procedures to access different social services; (ii) continuing
shortages, especially in health and education, of qualified staff, particularly in underserved
areas; and (iii) still problematic flows of funds to service delivery units at the local levels,
both in terms of timing and transparency.

106. The quality, frequency, and completeness of performance information are key to
evaluating and, if necessary, adjusting sector policies. The clear performance assessment
frameworks, including expected results, measurable indicators, and targets, which were
introduced in 2008 for health and education, have shown tangible success in facilitating the
stakeholders to build consensus on achievements and areas that require further attention.
Timely and accurate information for management decision making continues to be a major
challenge in the water sector, where the PAF envisages a comprehensive review of the
monitoring framework. By the end of the PRSC series, it is expected that monitoring and
reporting on results will be based on a higher-frequency and solid information system, and
more tightly integrated into the budget process.

107. Education: The introduction of the Primary Education Development Program (PEDP)
in July 2001 and the abolition of primary education school fees have led to a rapid increase in
primary enrollment ratio. The Government has continued its efforts to expand access and
improve the quality of secondary education through the implementation of the Secondary
Education Development Program (SEDP). The Government has decentralized the
management of secondary schools to local governments starting in July 2009. Several draft
strategies and policies were developed over FY2008/09 including the Higher Education
8
  The three sector reviews were held from October 5 to7, 2009, with a high-level meeting on November 12
(education); October 7 to 9, 2009, with technical review from September 15 to 17 (health); and from October 1
to 2, 2009 (water).


                                                      42
Development Program (HEDP) and the strategies on gender, environmental education,
inclusive education, and HIV/AIDS. The private sector share of primary school units and
enrollment is low. In 2007, 2.1 percent of primary schools and 1.0 percent of primary school
enrolment were provided through the private sector. At the secondary level, as recently as
1997 the private sector provided about 50 percent of secondary schools. The private sector
supply of secondary education has waned relative to public sector supply from a 50:50 split in
1997 to 19 percent of secondary schools privately provided in 2007.

108. While there has been a phenomenal increase in enrollment at the primary and more
recently post-primary levels and equitable access to education has been largely achieved at the
primary school level, access to education at the secondary level does not seem to be
homogenous among various segments of the population, with a large share of children from
the poorest households left behind during the transition from the primary level. 9 Gender
differences are not marked in forms 1-4 (lower secondary), but do emerge in forms 5-6.10 The
rapid expansion in primary school enrollments has spilled over to unprecedented demand for
secondary education, and to some extent higher education. Net secondary school enrollments
rose from 10.3 percent in 2005 to 27.8 percent in 2009, largely driven by community schools
that doubled in number between 2006 and 2009. It is evident that this has posed tremendous
pressure on school infrastructure, teaching supplies, and staffing. The qualified teacher/pupil
ratio has deteriorated to 1:57, and most secondary schools are in need of teaching materials
and essential facilities such as laboratories, latrines, and a reliable source of water. Recent
evidence testifies to the impact of these challenges on quality through declining completion
rates and learning achievements.

109. At the higher education level, enrollment is low (gross enrollment rate in 2008 was 3.7
percent); subjects taught are not entirely relevant to the developing priority economic sectors;
and teaching facilities, resources, and pedagogy are outdated. The Bank-supported Science
and Technology Higher Education Program is helping to address these issues at the higher
education level. Driven by a rapidly growing student loan scheme, the share of higher
education in the government budget has crept up by 10 percentage points over the past five
years. As such, the secondary education sub-sector is under-financed--with its share
declining from 16 percent in FY2007/08 to 12 percent in FY2009/10--to meet the needs of a
rapidly expanding system. The Government has been unable to provide capitation grants to
schools (T Sh 25,000 per student) as budgeted.

110. The education sector has been conducting successful annual reviews with the aim of
assessing the overall performance of the sector in the context of MKUKUTA and Education
for All (EFA) targets. The process of reviewing the sector consists of four components (mid-
term review of the milestones to take place in February/March of each year, joint field
monitoring visits to councils, a three day technical working session, and a high-level

9
  As many as 27 percent of 14 year olds from the poorest income quintile do not attend secondary school, while
14 percent of 14 year olds in the wealthiest income quintile fail to go to secondary school. Overall, wealthier
households (top 40 percent) increased their real spending on education from 2001 to 2007, while the bottom
three quintiles reduced their real spending on education over the same period.
10
   In Form 6, there are two boys for each girl enrolled. Secondary education is also inequitable across geographic
regions: 77 percent of secondary school age children in rural areas do not attend secondary school compared
with 17 percent for urban areas (excluding Dar es Salaam, which has a 95 percent school enrolment rate).


                                                       43
meeting). The 2009 Joint Education Sector Review, which was held between October 5 and 7,
2009, assessed the sector performance as "satisfactory" based on agreed milestones reached
during the past year, which included the production of the public expenditure tracking survey
(PETS) report. The achievements noted in the review included increased enrolment at all
levels and in particular for secondary education; improved participation of female students;
increased number of teachers; and improved management capacity at all levels in the sector.
However, an increase in access at all levels of education needs to be sustained with
improvements in the quality of education. This has been constrained by a shortage of teachers
and lecturers as well as a poor supply of adequate teaching and learning materials and
assistive devices for students with disabilities. Other challenges include the marginal
decrease in net enrollment rate at primary level (from 97.2 percent to 95.9 percent); a
downward trend of completion in primary and secondary education; critical shortage of
teachers/academician at all levels, particularly in rural areas, including the problems of
teacher absenteeism and the presence of under-qualified teachers; a decrease in attendance for
children with disabilities; a decline in the passing rate for primary education students; and
inadequate infrastructure. The budget continues to be an issue, with intra-sectoral allocations
not being aligned with the sector priorities; amounts allocated to secondary and tertiary sub-
sectors appear to be insufficient given policy priorities to expand those sub-sectors. Also, the
capitation grant component of the recurrent education budget, which is critical for quality
purposes, is not adequately financed at the primary and the secondary levels.

111. Consultations were also held to agree on the next set of milestones, not only for
FY2009/10, but for FY2010/11, in order to align with the budget cycle. The focus was to
agree on a few, focused, measurable, and manageable milestones. For FY2010/11, the
milestones include implementing the priority activities noted in the Teacher Development and
Management Strategy; strengthening the effectiveness of Kiswahili and English teaching;
simplifying education funding to LGAs; conducting a higher education PETS; and
implementing guidelines on re-entry policy for pregnant girls. Further, for the FY2010/11
period, the weighting of the various milestones will be recalibrated to give more weight to
overall sector performance per agreed PAF indicators. It was agreed that the proposed
milestones be further refined to ensure they are implementable and used to inform the
planning and budgeting processes.

112. Health: Tanzania is on track for MDGs in reducing infant and under-five mortality
and has made some progress against child malnutrition. Challenges remain, however, in
further improving service delivery, general nutrition status, and health systems management
and expanding protection for catastrophic care for the poor, unemployed, and informal sector
workers (including subsistence farmers). Maternal mortality has been persistently high at
unacceptable levels, despite the modest increase in the number of births taking place in health
facilities (41 to 52 percent from 2005 to 2009).

113. The Health Sectorwide Approach (SWAp) continues to move well with a great deal of
development partner involvement. A total of 11 partners now disburse through the health
basket.11 Total contributions to the basket have increased to US$79.5 million in FY2008/09,

11
 The 11 partners are Canada, Denmark, Germany, IDA, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, UNFPA,
UNICEF, and UN.


                                                  44
up from $68.2 million in FY2007/08. The FY2009/10 amount is approximately $76 million,
although there are several basket partners that still have to confirm their contribution. The
Basket Fund meeting in June 2009 resulted in an unprecedented level of financing being made
available to the districts and to essential central services. A decision has been made to
increase the district allocation to $1.25 per capita, from just $0.50 in FY2006/07. An
evaluation is currently being initiated to assess the impact of the past increases in funding at
the district level on improved access and service delivery. There are documented
improvements in a number of indicators, including infant mortality rate, bed-net utilization,
tuberculosis (TB) cure rates, and intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) access. The
demographic and health survey (DHS) that is to be completed later this year should provide a
more comprehensive overview of the development impact of this approach.

114. The overall level of financing for the health sector has continued to grow, although
there are concerns about whether this pace can be maintained. One concern is the declining
share of total government expenditure devoted to health care. While actual government
funding for health is increasing and is expected to reach US$14 per capita in 2010/11, the
proportion of the government budget being devoted to health has declined over recent years,
raising concerns about the overall priority of the health sector.

115. The Government's strategy for development of the health sector seeks to improve the
accessibility, delivery, and quality of health care services available in the country, with
resulting improvements in health status and financial security. It is supported by far-reaching
reforms at all levels. The implementation of the Primary Health Services Development
Program, commonly known by its Kiswahili acronym of MMAM, is ongoing with increased
student enrollment in health training in institutions, posting of trained staff to councils, and
building of more dispensaries and health centers to increase access to services. The most
significant policy change over the past year was the finalization of the Third Health Sector
Strategic Plan (HSSP III), which was launched on June 30, 2009, by the president of
Tanzania. This strategic plan covers the period from 2009 through 2015, which is until the
target date for the MDGs.

116. The 10th Joint Annual Health Sector Review (JAHSR) was conducted on October 7­9,
2009, and included the presentation of an updated health sector performance report. The
JASHR mechanism is well established and has been improving continually since its inception
in 1999. These reviews involve a critical look at the sector, including the monitoring of sector
performance and implementation of the Health Sector Strategic Plan, discussion of key sector
policy issues, a critical examination of the milestones established during the previous review,
and the development of new milestones for the coming year.

117. The sector review noted a general improvement in health plans, but attention was
drawn to specific areas where increased capacity is required. The need for close supervision,
coaching, and mentoring from the regional level was underscored. The Performance Profile
Report showed a mixed picture of improvements and status quo. Ten out of 14 milestones for
2008/9 were partly or fully achieved. The quality of some of the selected milestones was
questioned, especially with respect to their specificity and realistic application in a resource-
constrained environment. Human resources for health--in number, skills, and geographical
distribution--can be the most important supply-side constraint. Other remaining challenges


                                               45
include supply chain for drugs and medical supplies and the overall flow of funds, especially
to the lower levels of care. The overall evaluation of health sector performance as part of the
JAHSR was satisfactory (barely).

118. The key issues (milestones) agreed as central for the policy dialogue under the next
sector review cycle are (i) review and revise the Comprehensive Council Health Plan
guideline, including the assessment tools and National Essential Health Package in line with
the Health Sector Strategic Plan III (HSSP-III), MKUKUTA, and other agreed sector
strategies; (ii) all regional hospitals are supported to develop annual plans and the plans are
put to use by July 2010; (iii) final draft Health Financing Strategy and action plan completed
by next years' Technical Review; (iv) staff recruitment, posting and retention processes
strengthened by July 2010; (v) PPP policy guidelines for implementation of PPP strategy
finalized by August, 2010; (vi) ensure that there are established and funded posts for M&E
staff at District and Regional levels by September 2010; (vii) increase resources for maternal,
neonatal, and child health used as entry point to strengthen service delivery; (viii) Regional
Health Management Team role and capacities for supportive supervision as well as
monitoring of the councils strengthened; (ix) user participation is increased by strengthening
further Council Health Service Board and Health Family Governing Committees; and (x)
finalization of National Social Welfare policy and strategy. In addition, a Temporary Process
Action (TPA) was agreed as follows: "an analytical framework is established (related to
MTEF and PER) to monitor the allocation and disbursement of funds to key HSSP-III areas.
A draft framework has already been developed with assistance from the World Bank, and
final testing and training is expected to be done shortly. This framework should allow
ongoing monitoring of the degree of coherence between HSSP-III priorities and budget and
expenditure allocations.

119. Tanzania has recorded major progress in its fight against HIV/AIDS. HIV prevalence
in the 15­49 age group has declined from 7.0 percent in 2005 to 5.7 percent in 2009. The
number of people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and some behavioral indicators (e.g.,
increased condom use, reduced numbers of sexual partners) indicate that prevention and
treatment efforts may be having an impact. Yet significant unmet ART needs still exist,
stigma against HIV/AIDS persists, and some traditional social or religious values hinder
behavioral changes that are needed in curtailing HIV transmission. Continued provision of
ART services is largely dependent on two main financiers--the U.S. government and the
Global Fund--suggesting potential exposure if either or both of them change their funding
priorities or experience problems with raising funds for continued involvement. In the area of
HIV/AIDS, the focus of recent activity has been on the development of the national
prevention strategy and the costing of the National Multi-Sectoral Strategic Framework on
HIV/AIDS. Substantial work has been done in these areas, and the process is expected to be
finalized by the end of FY2010/11.

120. Water: After a slight deterioration between 2001 and 2007, access to clean water
appears to show signs of improvements in urban and rural areas. Efforts to improve basic
sanitation facilities are facing more difficulties, as coverage fell from 93 percent in 2007 to 82
percent in 2009. Lack of systematic planning, monitoring, and reporting hinders effective
management and implementation at both central and local levels. The establishment and roll-
out of a management information system is critical and urgent. Dar es Salaam Water and


                                               46
Sewerage Cooperation (DAWASCO) has achieved significant gains in service coverage,
water quality, and financial sustainability. Revenue collection from water and sewage services
has steadily improved and covers more than 80 percent of all operations and maintenance
costs. The joint recovery plan prepared by Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority
(DAWASA) and DAWASCO needs to be implemented and bear fruit to ensure longer-term
financial sustainability.

121. The Government has pursued the implementation of its Water Sector Development
Programme aimed at enhancing water-resources management for socioeconomic development
and sustainable environment, and ensuring that all social groups in rural and urban areas have
access to adequate, safe, and clean water and sanitation services. After a slow start due in part
to delayed release of funds, procurement bottlenecks, and start-up capacity constraints, the
program is now active in all nine Basin Offices, almost all 132 Districts, and over 70 regional
and district utilities. In the first two-year implementation period, 2,983 subprojects were
completed, adding about 6,141 water points and increasing coverage to some 1.5 million
people in rural area. Sanitation activities are beginning to pick up, but results are not
impressive, partly due to remaining uncertainties regarding the roles and mandates for
sanitation. The new Water Resources Management Act and the Water Supply and Sanitation
Act became effective in August 2009. Progress on the management of transboundary
waters--Lakes Victoria, Tanganyika, Nyasa, and Jipe and on the Mara, Kagera, Songwe, and
Ruvuma Rivers--is encouraging.

122. The fourth Joint Water Sector Review, which was held October 1­2, 2009, concluded
that reforms in the sector were progressing satisfactorily. The Ministry of Water and Irrigation
(MoWI) has conducted a full review of the monitoring framework and systems to ensure
consistency of definitions and accuracy of data (including data on sanitation, water resources
management and water supply services). As a part of PAF 2010, the Government is
committed to put in place capacity-building plans based on the water sector capacity
development framework by March 2010 and on budget by June 2010 for all MoWI
departments, minimum 75 percent of all LGAs; and minimum 90 percent of all other
implementing agencies (such as Urban Water Authorities, Water Basins).

  PRSC-8 Prior Action: Satisfactory education, health, and water sector reviews carried out (based
  on an assessment of progress on agreed outcome targets, adequacy of resource allocation,
  achievement of sector milestones, and adequacy of stakeholder consultations).
  PRSC-9 Preliminary Trigger: Satisfactory education, health, and water sector reviews carried out
  (based on an assessment of progress on agreed outcome targets, adequacy of resource allocation,
  achievement of sector milestones, and adequacy of stakeholder consultations).
   Objective: Strengthened capacity to develop, implement, monitor, and assess impact of a range of
  policies in social sectors.


MKUKUTA Implementation: Cluster 3 ­ Governance and Accountability

123. Tanzania's National Framework on Good Governance provides the overall framework
for reforms in this area. The implementation of five core reforms, the financial management
reform program (PFMRP), the Public Service Reform Program (PSRP), the Local



                                                47
Government Reform Program (LGRP), the National Anti-corruption Strategy (NACSAP), and
the Legal Sector Reform Program (LSRP) are the Government's main instruments for
improving the governance environment. All reviews that were scheduled in the past year for
the cluster were undertaken as planned. The implementation of these core reforms has been
slow, with three out of five (PFM, LSRP, and LGRP) rated unsatisfactory this year. The DPs
and the Bank have sent an unequivocal signal that progress on anti-corruption is key to
continued high international support to Tanzania, and both the governance DP group and the
anti-corruption DP group, chaired respectively by the United Kingdom and Sweden, monitor
the situation closely.

124. Cross-cutting issues: The policy issues to be addressed in this sector concern both the
strengthening of the general environment for governance and the improvement in service
delivery. Stronger institutions of domestic accountability--particularly Parliament, the
oversight offices, and the media--are critical to improving governance throughout the
Government and are also critical to making sure that reforms in this field become less
technocratic and formalistic in nature and have relevance with respect to the actual decision
mechanisms in the country. Although there has been some good progress under this cluster in
some areas, such as grand corruption prosecution, other areas of concern remain: pay and
allowances policy, intergovernmental transfers of funds, the cross linkages between reforms
and the lack of progress to resolve the issues where one reform program may hinder
development in another reform program, and the alignment of Constituency Development
Fund with existing government policy.

125. Public service reform program: The second phase of the PSRP--one of the core
reform programs aiming at improving performance of the public sector and services
delivery--was launched in January 2008. Under this new phase (2008­12), the program will
have a greater focus on implementation of reforms by Ministries, Departments, and Agencies
(MDAs) and will also seek to enhance the coordination of core reforms at the center of the
Government (Office of the Chief Secretary/Head of the Public Service).

126. The planned approval of the Medium-Term Pay Policy (MTPP) (PRSC-7 trigger) and
related pay targets (PRSC-8 trigger) were delayed. The MTPP draft addresses issues related to
(i) the excessive use of allowances to augment pay by public servants, which distorts
incentives to service delivery; (ii) pay and incentives for staff working in underserved and
remote areas; as well as (iii) decompression of the salary structure that has in recent years
faced the pressure of increased employment of public servants, particularly in the social
sector. Two drafts of the MTPP have been discussed with stakeholders over the past year.
The Government approved the policy in July. However, the adopted policy does not include
pay targets (PRSC-8 Trigger). Low pay and incentives continue to be raised throughout the
Government as the main challenge to attract, retain, and motivate key categories of employees
in all sectors, particularly in underserved areas. Since the trigger on MTPP was not met, this
operation will take a different approach to the issue of reforming the public personnel
management policy by focusing on the need to establish a clear regime of allowances. The
current system of allowances is highly distortive of incentives for productive work in the civil
service, and is liable to easy manipulation for patronage and favors. It also creates fiscal
pressure during the time of limited fiscal space due to the crisis. Next PRSCs will follow up
on the implementation of a new medium-term policy called Public Service Pay and Incentive


                                              48
Policy (PSPIP) or any alternative model to the issue of weak human resources in social
service deliveries in underserved areas, such as a voucher system which allows parents to
send children to either public or private schools In the meantime, the Government has
committed to taking immediate action in the fiscal year 2010/11 budget to reduce the amount
of discretionary allowances (PRSC-9 preliminary trigger), as well as promote the positive use
of allowances in underserved areas.12

 PRSC-8 Trigger (not met): GoT approves Targets related to the adopted Medium-Term Pay
 Policy, incorporating strategies to address (inter-district) inequity in human resource distribution.
 PRSC-9 Preliminary Trigger: The Government reduces overall expenditure on duty facilitating
 allowances and honoraria in Ministries, Departments and Agencies and promote positive use of
 allowances in underserved areas in line with the principles of PSPIP by June 2010.
 Objective: Hiring and remuneration in the civil service are consistent with fiscal responsibility,
 incentives for performance, equity in service provision, and enhanced capacity.

127. Legal sector reform program: The vision of the LSRP Medium-Term Strategy is
"timely justice for all." The reform program is being implemented with the support of a joint
donor basket. The legal sector reform program has moved from unsatisfactory to satisfactory
in 2009. The legal sector monitoring and evaluation system has been revised through updating
the Performance Measurement Framework, which will allow for a more robust assessment of
progress in the sector.

128. Local government reform program: Some limited progress has been registered in
the areas of fiscal decentralization. The share of the budget transferred directly to LGAs has
increased, following the decentralization of the secondary education budget. A system of
intergovernmental transfers, which provides performance-based discretionary grants (Council
Development Grants: CDGs; and Capacity Building Grants: CBGs) to LGAs is now fully
functional. Several areas of weak performance remain, on which limited progress has been
registered, leading to an unsatisfactory rating of the local government reform program by
DPs. These weaknesses include limited progress in providing autonomy in human resources
management at the LGA level; transparency and accountability of use of funds is undermined
by the existence of multi-channels of funding at the local level; and continuing large inequity
in the allocation of funds among districts.

129. The Government has committed itself to tackling some of these issues in the coming
year. The agreed PAF 2010 (see Annex 2) includes actions to (i) review and develop
proposals for the amendment of the local Government Finance Act, a 1982 attendant
memorandum, regulations, and manuals to provide for enhanced autonomy in budgeting and
planning as well as ensuring more efficient, accountable, and transparent financial
management shared with key stakeholders by June 2010; (ii) issue to LGAs a circular that will
inform them about the Government's decision to fold the recurrent grants into one for personal
emoluments (PE) and one for other charges (OC) for each LGA effective from FY2011/12;


12
  The FY10/11 budget reduces the amount of four major types of allowances, namely per diem (local),
honoraria, extra duty, and sitting allowances, in the six key MKUKUTA MDAs (namely education, health, water,
agriculture, energy, and infrastructure) to around T Sh 33 billion, down from T Sh 43 billion in the FY 09/10
budget. This is equivalent to a 23 percent reduction in nominal terms.


                                                    49
and (iii) put in place measures, including incentives, to ensure adequate staffing in persistently
understaffed areas by June 2010 to be implemented in FY2010/11.

130. Anti-corruption: A National Anti-corruption Strategy and Action Plan (NACSAP II)
was launched in December 2006. It encompasses a holistic anti-corruption agenda covering
civil society, the private sector, the legislature, and the judiciary. The legal framework for
fighting corruption has been significantly strengthened with the enactment of the new anti-
corruption bill (PRSC 6 prior action). Some of the next steps in the anti-corruption agenda are
to (i) revisit the Public Leadership Ethics Code Act to accord with the president's
announcements regarding conflict-of-interest and corruption in leadership ranks; (ii) review
the Political Parties Act and the Elections Act in order to control the financing of politics and
political campaigns; and (iii) proceed with the preparation of the Freedom of Information Bill
and the Whistleblower Bill. Access to public information remains a big challenge in Tanzania.
The several laws that restrict access to information, freedom of expression, and activities of
the media need to be reviewed, amended or repealed. The Government's current proposals on
the Freedom of Information Bill 2007 would further curtail access to information and has
been challenged by the stakeholders proposals, which call for minimizing bureaucracy and
secrecy by making information held by public and private organs accessible to the people.
The lack of freedom of information (FOI) legislation in Tanzania could affect the Government
in effectively pursuing its anti-corruption efforts.

131. As mentioned earlier, the Government has, over the past year, been able to bring to
court a number of grand corruption cases, demonstrating that the overall institutional
framework is being enforced and starting to dent the culture of impunity. Bringing the judicial
actions to closure in a fair and uniform way with respect to the major grand corruption cases,
such as EPA or Richmond, will be a test of the effectiveness of Tanzania's anti-corruption
system. The PCCB has also been active in investigating corruption allegations at the regional
level. The Ethics Secretariat is finalizing plans to set up an Ethics Tribunal, which will deal
with specific cases of breaking ethical rules and provide sanctions. The Government has
pledged in the PAF to continue to fight grand corruption, but it has also indicated that it wants
to attack the problem at all levels, and to this effect it has committed itself in the PAF to carry
out a National Governance and Corruption Survey, as a monitoring tool to guide its fight
against petty corruption. The Government's plans to improve the regulatory environment for
the private sector will also contribute to reduced opportunities for petty corruption. The
proposed new policy framework for PPP transactions and the strengthening of the autonomy
and power of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) will also strengthen the
anti-corruption agenda. While the PRSC is focusing of these last two specific issues, other
partners are taking the lead in closely monitoring the other critical aspects of the anti-
corruption agenda.

132. Public finance management: Since the GBS 2008 Annual Review, leadership of the
PFM program has improved under a deputy permanent secretary dealing with PFM issues,
and the technical and managerial capacity of the secretariat to manage such a large and
complex reform program has been enhanced.

133. PFM outcomes remain largely unchanged from 2008, although there have been some
notable improvements. Government accounts are now produced in the International Public


                                                50
Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) format, economic classification has been introduced,
internal audit is being strengthened, along with external audit and procurement, and there
seems to be increasing evidence of high-level political commitment to this important core
reform. These improvements provide a good basis for future action.

134. However, there remain outstanding issues of fiduciary risk that have yet to be fully
addressed. Main areas that require progress are improving the reliability and strategic
consistency of medium-term budget plans; introducing effective screening and prioritization
of investment projects; improving cash flow planning and fund of flow timeliness; improving
core fiduciary system around IFMIS, including bank reconciliation and commitment controls;
and improving procurement capacity. All of these areas were discussed fully at the 2008 GBS
review. The PEFA assessment for 2008 remains largely unchanged from the 2006 assessment
and therefore confirms the above assessment. The CAG reports continue to highlight major
systemic issues at all levels of Government that need to be addressed. The Government has
expressed his intention to tackle some of the important issues concerning the IFMIS in the
wake of a NAO diagnostic report (PRSC-9 preliminary trigger).

135. During the FY2008/09, procurement audits were conducted in 100 public enterprises
(PEs) and an average level of compliance of 50 percent was established, which is below the
2009 target of 55 percent. These weaknesses point to the need to strengthen procurement
capacity in a systematic way, especially as the procurement capacity has a large adverse effect
on the budget execution of public investment. The medium-term objective is to have
Procurement Management Units (PMU) established in all PEs and the full operationalization
of scheme of service for procurement cadre by 2010. The adoption of regulations under the
Procurement and Supplies Professional Board Act (PRSC-7 trigger) is the first step in this
direction. The regulations to implement the Procurement and Supplies Professional Board Act
have now been issued. Another important measure is to improve the quality of procurement
and cash flow plans, which exist only nominally. A review of cash flow and procurement
plans of five key line ministries was carried out this year and should lead to stronger cash
flow planning in the next budget.

136. Procurement of large infrastructure transactions has been problematic and has had a
record of being tainted by manipulation, lack of transparency, and corruption, in violation of
the existing Procurement Act. The Parliament has recommended, and the Government
accepted to amend legislation so as to give PPRA more autonomy from the MoFEA, and to
have more power to enforce the procurement regulations ex-ante (PRSC-8 prior action). The
Cabinet has approved these amendments as a part of a new public procurement bill, which
was presented to the Parliament in July 2010. This bill, once adopted by the Parliament, will
replace the current Public Procurement Act 2004. The proposed changes as incorporated in
the new bill include (i) a strengthened legal recognition of PPRA legal status as an
autonomous authority by removing it from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs
(MoFEA); (ii) the power for PPRA to cancel a tender process if it establishes gross
irregularities; (iii) a time limit of seven days for procurement entities to answer to PPRA's
observations; and (iv) a substantial increase in the fines for breach of procurement
regulations. The Parliament will conduct a second reading of the bill in a later session in the
fiscal year and would become effective from the next fiscal year if adopted.



                                              51
 PRSC-8 Prior Action: Presentation to Parliament of new Public Procurement Act that increases
 autonomy of PPRA and its power to enforce procurement rules.
 PRSC-9 Preliminary Trigger: Implementation of the agreed time-bound action plan derived from
 the NAO audit of IFMS.
 Objective: Strengthen the integrity of procurement and financial management systems

137. Another area where improved systems need to be established is in the governance and
financial management of parastatals. A fiduciary conference organized by the NAO and the
parliamentary Oversight Committees has revealed a weak overall control environment, and a
fragmented legal and regulatory framework. A due diligence study has recommended to
quickly implement the provisions for the independence of the Treasury Registrar, the unit
responsible for overseeing parastatals and government guarantees. The Government plans to
approve this recommendation and start implanting it in the coming year (PRSC-9 preliminary
trigger). The Government will also commission a comprehensive study on revision of the
Public Corporations Act to harmonize the legislation relating to public corporations, and
ensure strengthened corporate governance and accountability consistently across parastatals.

PRSC-9 Preliminary Trigger: Adoption of the Due Diligence study, including recommendation to
transform the Office of the Treasury Registrar into an Autonomous Body, and relevant steps taken to
start implementing said recommendation.
Objective: Improve the management of parastatals and contingent liabilities.

Budget consistency and resource allocation

138. Budget execution: MDAs recurrent budget deviation index 13 declined to 13.1 in
2008/09, after adjusting for salary arrears. Following the announcement by the president
about raising the salaries of the public servants starting from January 2008, salary arrears of
about T Sh 112 billion had accumulated between January and June 2008. All these arrears
were budgeted for in the FY2008/09 budget under the contingency item in the Treasury. This
constituted the big source of reallocation from the Treasury (vote 21) to other votes, including
the regions and LGAs. Adjusting for salary arrears of the regions and LGAs in order to come
out with MDAs recurrent budget deviations index puts the index at 13.1 percent, a significant
decline compared to FY2007/08. The expenditure outturn and recurrent budget deviation for
2008/09 were reviewed as satisfactorily during the 2009 GBS annual review (PRSC-8 prior
action).

139. The overall execution of MDAs development budget remained poor in FY2008/09.
Although there are some improvements in other aspects in FY2008/09, MDAs' development
budget execution remains poor. The overall MDAs' development execution rate was 52
percent in FY2008/09, slightly higher compared to FY2007/08. While the about 60 percent of
funds were released by end of the year, both in FY2007/08 and FY2008/09, 52 percent were
spent in FY2008/09, about 7 percent higher than in FY2007/8. This tends to suggest that
slight improvement in execution in FY2008/09 was driven by increased absorption capacity


13
  The recurrent budget deviation index is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between the approved
recurrent budget and actual recurrent expenditure at vote level expressed as a percentage of the total approved
recurrent budget.


                                                       52
of the MDAs. The release gap in overall MDAs development funds contributed to about 87
percent of poor execution, while the spending a gap contributed to about 13 percent.

140. Weak capacity to execute large capital investment projects may be attributed to
inadequate capacity in key sectors to design, plan, and implement quality projects, from
feasibility and economic evaluation studies to the physical implementation and monitoring.
This includes the credibility of the associated procurement and cash flow plans. Weakness in
planning and physical implementation reduces capacity to absorb funds and therefore slows
down execution of development programs. The problem worsens when releases are untimely
and resource levels are unpredictable--a phenomenon noted often in the case of donors
funded interventions.

 PRSC-8 Prior Action: Expenditure outturn for FY08/09 consistent with approved budget and
 recurrent budget deviation reduced.
 PRSC-9 Preliminary Trigger: Expenditure outturn for FY09/10 consistent with approved budget
 and recurrent budget deviation reduced.

141. Resource allocation: The FY2009/10 budget was developed in the relatively difficult
circumstances of a major international crisis that led to a growth slowdown in Tanzania. As a
result, GDP growth was revised from the previous target of 7.5 percent down to 5 percent for
2009. The Government has responded adequately to the crisis by identifying a narrowly
targeted and time-bound rescue package, while acting to counteract the macroeconomic effect
of the slowdown by modestly expanding budgeted public expenditures from 27.9 percent in
FY2008/09 to 28.5 percent of GDP in FY2009/10, and the planned deficit from 3.8 percent to
4.9 percent of GDP.

142. While the FY2009/10 budget accommodates a targeted response to the international
crisis, it maintains expenditures supporting its development program. The Government
pursues additional fiscal stimulus, seeking to maintain essential public expenditures,
increasing focus on agricultural sector (deemed critical to achieve greater poverty reduction),
staying the course on medium-term infrastructure investment plans, and providing specific
support to help mitigate the economic and social impact of the crisis. The adequate response
to the crisis notwithstanding, and largely independently from the impact of the crisis, the
FY2009/10 budget shows some weakening of the alignment between the budget and the
MKUKUTA and sector policies and priorities relative to previous years.

143. On the revenue side, the credibility of revenue projection--and hence that of the entire
budget--remains a major concern. Although the impact of the crisis was relatively well
anticipated in the macro-framework, and the GDP projection broadly accurate, the revenue
projections, both domestic and foreign, have proved to be overly optimistic, with a T Sh 90
billion yearly shortfall projected at the end of the first quarter for domestic revenues, and an
overestimation of foreign financing by some T Sh 135 billion. It is not clear if the
deterioration in the quality of revenue projections is the result of inadequate technical capacity
or political expediency; but it certainly weakens significantly the credibility of the budget,
since any shortfall will then need to be met by in-year cuts of approved expenditures.
Development partners are also responsible to a small extent for the unreliable projections of




                                               53
foreign financing, as a number of adjustments to GBS commitments were announced far too
late into budget preparation process and beyond agreed timeline.

144. On the expenditure side, trends in the composition of aggregate spending--current
versus capital--also raise serious concern as presented in Public Expenditure Financial
Accountability Review (PEFAR) 2009. Within the large 24 percent nominal increase in
expenditures (equivalent to a 10­12 percent real increase), the FY2009/10 budget shows a
drastic decrease in the share of public investment in GDP, from 25 percent to 15 percent of
total expenditures, which corresponds to a cut in real public investment. Instead, spending on
goods and services in the current expenditures increased considerably, from 18 percent to 28
percent of total expenditures. Around a quarter of this 10-point increase can be explained by
the rescue package and by the agricultural supplies.14 The sharp reduction in the share of
public investment in favor of potentially sticky recurrent commitments will further constrain
the fiscal space over the medium term and hinder the capacity of the budget to play a
significant role in propelling economic growth.

145. Within MKUKUTA, the budgets of several priority sectors have seen their alignment
with sector strategies significantly weakened. In the road sector, funds allocated for ongoing
and newly signed upgrading contracts fall short of requirements of new contracts for
upgrading and paving trunk and regional roads that were signed in the summer of 2009,
leading to an overall underfunding of the road budget of around US$130 million. The shortfall
could imply cuts to other parts of the approved budget, but also raises concern on the
effectiveness of the commitment to control procedures. In education, while overall sector
financing has remained adequate in comparison to other comparable countries, intra-sectoral
allocations are not aligned with the stated sector priorities. The share of secondary education
has tapered off to 11 percent of education spending for FY2009/10, and now stands at less
than half the share of the higher education sub-sector budget for FY2009/10, which is about
24 percent of education sector spending. The capitation grant component of the recurrent
education budget, which is critical for quality purposes, is not adequately financed at the
primary and, even more markedly, at secondary levels.

146. In agriculture, the FY2009/10 budget has both strong and weak elements. The
financing for the agriculture sector increased by 62 percent in nominal terms and 50 percent in
real terms compared to the past year, reflecting the Government's intention to prioritize
agriculture. Expenditures for the Ministry of Agriculture are biased toward the support for
"crop development," mainly the provision of agricultural inputs. This function accounts for 44
percent of MDA sector expenditure. The spending on agricultural mechanization is projected
to increase to 12 percent of national sector expenditure. The experiences with mechanization
in Tanzania and elsewhere have shown that government-operated tractor procurement and
hire schemes have a poor track record in profitability and sustainability. Similarly, the T Sh

14
   Of the major increase in goods and services in the budget, one half is in MDAs and the other half is in LGAs
and public enterprises. The increased allocation for goods and services, particularly in MDAs, is partly on
account of increased spending on agriculture inputs, such as fertilizes and seeds. The observed increase in
allocation for interest payment is the result of the inclusion of roll-over costs of the Treasury bills and bonds in
the recurrent expenditures this year. The shares of other items in current spending, like maintenance and current
transfers, remained broadly stable. The share of wages and salaries and their components, such as PE and
allowances, declines in FY2009/10 compared to FY2008/09.


                                                         54
20 billion allocation for the "agricultural window" in the Tanzanian Investment Bank (TIB)
raises some concern given the fact that TIB had 81 percent non-performing loans in the
agricultural sector and did not have a functioning board. All these allocations show that much
of expenditures, both recurrent and development, are geared to provide subsidized inputs and
other private goods.

147. The health budget has been sliding both as a share of GDP and share of total
expenditures for the second year in a row, to the extent that per-capita health budget
expenditures in real term have declined with this budget. This downward trend is inconsistent
with the identification of health as a priority sector of MKUKUTA, and with the requirements
of the recently approved HSSP III strategic plan. Also, no strong trend toward greater
resources being allocated to address the severe challenge of shortages of human resources for
the health sector is observed in this budget. There is also a continuing inadequate allocation of
maintenance budget to the sector facilities.

148. PRSC will continue to monitor budget alignment with MKUKUTA objectives. In that
respect, the introduction of stronger sector performance frameworks for social sector reviews
will be an important tool for improving effective alignment of spending and MKUKUTA
objectives. In this year's budget preparation, it will also be important to monitor how the
Government will be able to accommodate the (relative) revenue shortfall and the additional
expenditures stemming from the impact of the crisis, in particular the ability to maintain a
pro-poor and pro-growth orientation of expenditures.

 PRSC-8 Trigger (not met): Approved FY09/10 budget broadly in line with policy objectives
 (MKUKUTA, sector policies).
 PRSC-9 Preliminary Trigger: Approved FY10/11 budget broadly in line with policy objectives
 (MKUKUTA, sector policies).
 Objective: Ensure consistency between growth and poverty reduction strategy and annual budgets

                     VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
                             A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

149. Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) has allowed the Government to analyze the
distributional impact of policy reforms on the well-being of different stakeholder groups, with
particular focus on the poor and vulnerable. A poverty and social assessment on Crop Board
reform was carried out by the Bank in 2005 under PRSC-3 and is still relevant for these reforms,
which are however no longer covered by this PRSC operation.

150. Institutional reforms in agriculture marketing and improvements in the regulatory
environment, as supported by this operation, are expected to have significant direct pro-poor
implications. These measures would remove market constraints and reduce transaction costs,
which then improve the price incentive for farmers, the majority of whom are in poor
households. They also help them diversify their economic activities and provide improved
income generating opportunities in the rural agriculture-based households. The operation also
supports policies in MKUKUTA Cluster II (social well-being) by facilitating improvements in
service delivery in the areas of education, health, and water, which have direct impacts on
improved welfare of poor segments of population.

151. Reforms in the energy sector, including potential increases in tariffs, are expected to have
an overall positive impact on the poor. At present, the poor have extremely limited access to
energy, which implies that the current subsidies benefit primarily to the better-off and potentially
drain resources from pro-poor spending. While the poor receive a negligible share of the implicit
energy subsidy, the Bank has advised that the lifeline tariff should be exempted from the
proposed increase, through an appropriate combination of budget financing and cross-
subsidization from higher brackets. Furthermore, as illustrated in the investment climate
assessment, lack of access and interruptions to the power supply are major constrains to
economic growth. Power sector reform supported under the PRSC series, including tariff
increases, should contribute to improved reliability and access to power supply, ultimately
contributing to Tanzania's economic and social development.

152. A broad PSIA program is under way, with a focus on water, agriculture, land policy, and
the in-country institutionalization of PSIA. In addition, most core diagnostic or sector work
addresses these issues even though the final product is not presented as a PSIA.

               B. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION

153. Monitoring arrangements: The Government has issued two key reports to follow up on
MKUKUTA implementation. These are the Poverty and Human Development Report 2009
(PHDR) and the fourth MKUKUTA Annual Implementation Report 2008/09 (MAIR). The
PHDR, which is published bi-annually, consolidates poverty measures from various sources and
provides analysis of poverty trends and underlying factors. Sector reviews are also key
monitoring mechanisms for developments at the sector level, and the PSI reviews, as well as the
monthly Bank of Tanzania economic reports, are the key sources for the assessment of the
macroeconomic situation. Progress in public-expenditure management, covering improvements


                                                56
in systems, enhanced allocative and operational efficiency in the use of inputs, and the
consistency of the budget and budget execution with the MKUKUTA, are tracked by the annual
PEFARs.

154. While the system Tanzania has put in place for M&E of MKUKUTA is elaborate, it has
remained mainly donor oriented, producing M&E outputs of uneven relevance. The underlying
M&E system is under revision to strengthen information quality, policy relevance, and
integration with the budget process, notably by (i) implementing a new national statistical master
plan; (ii) carrying out the implementation of an annual Living Standards Measurement Study
(LSMS) panel survey, started in 2009; (iii) supporting the strengthening of the internal reporting
requirements of the Government, in particular, the output and performance reports newly
introduced in the latest budget guidelines; and (iv) better integrating MKUKUTA's M&E and
the public service reform program, which in its new phase puts much emphasis on results and
accountability, hence better performance from the public service.

155. Results monitoring of budget support suffers from the unavailability or low frequency of
some of the critical outcome indicators, such as poverty estimates, health outcomes, or learning
achievements. The poverty survey data in the third quarter of 2008, and subsequently the results
of the annual panel survey as well as the demographic and health survey planned for 2009, allow
a much tighter follow up on the impact of the government policies and spending. An additional
dimension of the monitoring framework covers the Government-donor relationship in monitoring
progress on PRSC objectives, such as enhanced local ownership of the development process,
participation by all stakeholders, and efficiency of aid delivery mechanisms. In particular, the
PRSC team is working with the Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) partners to enhance
the capacity of, and information flows with, Parliament, civil society, and the private sector. In
February 2010, a PER parliamentary forum was organized by the Finance and Economic
Committee of the Parliament, and the Bank was asked to contribute extensively by presenting the
results of the PER analytical work.

                              Text Box 1. Good Practice Principles in Policy-based Lending
 Principle 1 -- Reinforce ownership
 The Government's home-grown PRS, the MKUKUTA, was developed through extensive national consultations, and is a
 broadly shared platform for government action. Tanzania is at the forefront of aid coordination through strong alignment of
 both the broader program and the budget support instrument to the MKUKUTA, though the Joint Assistance Strategy for
 Tanzania (JAST), which was completed in 2007. The Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) process multiple fora, at the
 sector cluster and macro levels, are headed by the Government.
 Principle 2 -- Agree in advance with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
 framework
 Donor harmonization and alignment with government priorities is well advanced in Tanzania. The Government and DPs have
 subscribed to a Partnership Framework Memorandum (PFM), which sets the rules for the joint process underlying PRSC.
 Under the PFM, the Government and DPs organize budget support around a joint annual implementation plan for the
 MKUKUTA, summarized in a common Performance Assessment Framework (PAF).
 Principle 3 -- Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
 Policies supported by the PRSC represent actions included in the PAF that the Government believes will lead to the desired
 MKUKUTA outcomes, and thus reflect country preferences. They are selected in consultation with donors, including the
 Bank, from the larger PEAP policy matrix. The PRSC is structured so that financing is committed in time for the preparation
 of the budget guidelines for the following fiscal year.
 Principle 4 -- Choose only actions critical to achieve results as conditions for disbursement
 The PRSC triggers represent actions and outputs that are considered critical by the Government to the success of its reforms.
 Several of the PRSC prior actions are based on satisfactory completion of undertakings agreed to in existing sectoral review
 processes (e.g., in water), thus avoiding creation of new and overlapping review structures and indicators. However, the Bank



                                                             57
 continues to provide important input to the sector review process to improve prioritization and outcome orientation.
 Principle 5 -- Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
 support
 The annual review of PRBS is a public event chaired by the Government. There is an established preparation process, and the
 PFM envisages that within six weeks of the annual review's conclusion DPs will make indicative financial commitment
 under PRBS, based on their evaluation of the outcomes of the annual review


156. Supervision: Supervision and preparation of the credits in this series take place in close
collaboration with other donors and are consistent with the MKUKUTA review mechanism. For
most of the program areas, supervision and dialogue will be carried out on a continuous basis in
the context of sector or thematic programs. A joint GBS review will be conducted annually for
an overall assessment of progress made in each of the program areas. In addition, the
achievement of PRSC targets will be assessed annually in the context of the MKUKUTA review
that will document the progress made in the MKUKUTA implementation and analyze the
outcomes of reforms. The reform program sets out clear quantitative and qualitative benchmarks
for the implementation period of the MKUKUTA. The PRSC targets are fully consistent with the
MKUKUTA.

                                              C. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

157. A Special Audit of the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) EPA account for FY2005/06 identified
serious occurrences of fraud, which affected the integrity of the BoT's control and audit systems
and resulted in illicit payments. Following the strong government response, as detailed in the
PRSC-6 Program Document, the authorities have continued to strengthen the fiduciary
environment at the BoT by (i) continuing to implement the recommendations of the special audit,
as summarized in the Government's action plan shared with the DPs; (ii) including many of the
recommendations of the Voluntary Safeguard Assessment in the upcoming corporate plan of the
BoT, with ongoing monitoring from the IMF; (iii) starting prosecution against individuals
involved in the fraud; and (iv) refocusing the BoT on its core activities and preparing a new
memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs. The
2009 PAF included a specific action on the implementation of the Government's EPA Action
Plan, and the DPs assessed the action plan implementation as satisfactory at the 2009 Annual
Review.

158. An IMF Safeguards Assessment (SA) of BoT was conducted in 2008. It updated the
earlier assessment of 2003. This assessment showed that BoT's financial statements for 2006/07
comply with International Financial Reporting Standards and that recent steps have been taken to
strengthen BoT's oversight framework, the internal audit function, and the control system.
However the assessment found that risks remain and that BoT needs to take steps for further
strengthening the mandate and independence of the Audit Committee, revamp the internal audit
function, implement an internationally recognized control framework, and take measures to
improve transparency in accounting, audit, and control functions. BoT is taking proactive action
to implement the recommendations of the SA.

159. The audited financial statements of BoT for the year ended June 30th 2009 have been
made publicly available. As for the past few years, the CAG subcontracted the audit to Ernst and
Young. As stated in the formal cover letter from the CAG, the audit gives an unqualified opinion
on the financial statements (no matters of emphasis were identified) and the review of


                                                              58
compliance with procurement legislation identified no material divergences. The previous audit
issued was clean with an emphasis on Matter on the EPA fraud. The Bank has also been
regularly receiving the annual external audit report for PRSC and quarterly internal audit reports
from BoT. To strengthen DPs' confidence in the fiduciary management of budget support funds,
an external review of the mode of operation of the PRBS accounts at the BoT--where all funds
of GBS partners are disbursed--was carried out last year The review confirmed the integrity of
PRBS funds and made recommendations on a number of improvements to the mode of
operations, which have resulted in new technical improvements to the related financial
operations. A comprehensive audit of budget resources is therefore carried out by the National
Audit Office. In light of the above, the fiduciary risk to Bank funds being disbursed to BoT for
onward credit to the exchequer account is rated as "Low."

                             D. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

160. Borrower and credit amount: The borrower is the United Republic of Tanzania. A
single tranche credit of SDR 75.8 million (US$115 million equivalent) would be made available
upon credit effectiveness, anticipated for November 2010. The closing date of the operation
would be August 31, 2012. It is envisaged that there will be no further annual PRSC to support
the implementation of the MKUKUTA I under the current PRSC series.

161. Disbursement, reporting, and auditing arrangements: The proposed credit will follow
the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy credits. Credit proceeds will be
disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the development policy program and not tied to
any specific purchases or be subject to procurement requirements. Once the credit is approved by
the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the credit will be deposited at the request of the
Borrower by IDA in an account designated by the Borrower at the Bank of Tanzania and will
form part of the country's official foreign exchange reserves. The Borrower shall ensure that
upon the deposit of the Credit into said account, an equivalent amount is credited in local
currency to an account that is available to finance budgeted expenditures. The Borrower will
provide a written confirmation to the Bank when the amount has been credited to an account that
is available to finance budgeted expenditures. If the proceeds of the credit are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement of this Credit, IDA will require the Borrower to,
promptly upon notice from IDA, refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA.
Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration of this
credit will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs.

162.   The following arrangements also support the requirements related to fiduciary assurance:

163. Foreign reserve account: The Government will acknowledge to IDA receipt of the
money into the foreign reserve account and the crediting of this amount in local currency to the
Tanzanian Government's Consolidated Fund Account. While no external audit will be required,
it is expected that the confirmation of receipt will be countersigned by the Accountant General
and the Controller and Auditor General.

164. Public (government) accounts: The Controller and Auditor General is required by law to
produce his annual report to Parliament on the public accounts within nine months of the
financial year-end. IDA will have access to those reports.


                                                59
165. Bank of Tanzania: The annual entity financial statements of the Bank of Tanzania,
audited in accordance with international auditing standards as promulgated by the International
Accounting Standard Board, are publicly available.

                               E. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

166. The PRSC contributes to the financing of the implementation of Tanzania's MKUKUTA
across all three MKUKUTA clusters, but the policy dialogue focuses primarily on institutional
reforms in selected areas. This section thus discusses (i) the likely environmental effects of the
actions monitored under the PRSC performance assessment framework, and (ii) the overall
capacity of the Government to monitor and mitigate environmental effects of budgetary
expenditure.

167. With respect to policy reforms contained in the Performance Assessment Framework and
supported by the operation, and given the potential negative environmental implications of
policy reforms and their implementation, several measures are taken to ensure that any negative
environmental effects of the various activities will be properly addressed by the Government of
Tanzania in collaboration with its development partners. The Government of Tanzania has
enacted an environmental framework law and associated regulations that ensure due diligence in
managing environmental and social impacts emanating from government operations and
investments. In line with the requirement of the Environmental Management Act (EMA 2004),
precautionary approaches need to be undertaken by each sector to capture broader effects within
and in other sectors. EMA requires each sector to establish a sector environmental section that
will undertake analysis of environmental impacts of sectoral legislation, regulations, policies,
plans, strategies, and programs through strategic environmental assessments. Some of the key
sectors under the program (PRSC), such as agriculture and water, are already in the process of
conducting Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), as a precautionary approach. The main
objective of SEA is to give particular attention to supporting the incorporation of environmental
and social concerns into policies and long-term development and investment planning as well as
safeguarding against potential adverse environmental impacts. SEA is expected to be an
important input in sector policy formulation, strategy or planning for the water sector--to
strengthen environmental planning and management capacity for the implementation of the
National Water Policy (NAWAPO; and irrigation under the Agriculture Sector Development
Program (ASDP) as part of preparation for the National Irrigation Policy and Strategy, the draft
of which has been submitted to the parliament for review and approval.

168. The impact of higher electricity tariffs on fuel wood is expected to be very limited, taking
into account that (i) only a relatively small number of Tanzanians are connected to the grid (with
particular low connection rates in rural areas), and (ii) electricity is not commonly used for
cooking (mainly for affordability reasons). That said, it needs to be pointed out that there is a
problem with the unsustainable production of fuel wood and charcoal as the main energy sources
for poor households. The Bank is addressing this together with GoT through a Charcoal Policy
Note and subsequent piloting of a National Fuel wood/Charcoal Action Plan under the Tanzania
Forest Management and Conservation Project.

169. This operation supports several policies that have positive environmental impacts.
Enhanced transparency in the public allocation mechanisms for the commercial exploitation of


                                               60
natural resources should, in the medium-term, allow a more sustainable economic management
of these resources, as studies have shown that the lack of transparency leads to both
overexploitation of resources and exclusion of local populations from the economic benefits.
Through this operation, the Bank will assist the Government in making sure that the action plan
for a more transparent allocation mechanism is consistent with the national environmental
policies. The operation also supports the Government's effort to improve the land registry
system, which would have positive impacts on environmental management in a long run. In
analyzing potential effects of supported country policies on the environment and the
Government's environmental management capacity in the roads and rural sector, the Bank relies
on a variety of analytic work undertaken over the past years. These include a Strategic
Environmental Assessment under previous PRSCs and analytic work underpinning
environmental aspects of investment projects, including Bank projects in the roads, water, and
energy sectors. In addition, the Bank supported studies on the interaction between poverty and
environment as well as growth and environment. As project support for some sectors is being
shifted from specific sector operations to the PRSC, the PRSC draws on the environmental
management systems that the Government has established with the support of these projects.

170. In addition to the assessment of potential effects of policy actions directly supported by
the PRSC, the PRSC also supports the Government in its efforts to monitor and mitigate
environmental and social effects of public expenditures, financed from domestic resources and
general budget support provided under the GBS framework. Projects financed through PRSC
ought to be subjected to national rules and regulations pertaining to environmental and social
assessment in a transparent and participatory process. The implementation of the National
Environmental Management Act will strengthen in-country capacity for screening, monitoring
investments for positive and negative environmental effects, and the ability at the national and
district levels to identify mitigation measures for reducing effects. The act is very comprehensive
and has specific provisions for environment assessment (EA) and SEA as well as conflict
resolution and administrative processes for pollution charges according to the "polluter pays"
principle. The Vice President's Office and the National Environmental Management Council
have been supporting the development and implementation of various sector-specific guidelines
for EA (initially in roads and agriculture), and have more recently pursued procedures for
strategic and sector environmental assessment to permit mitigation of any adverse environmental
effects while taking advantage of potential synergies between poverty reduction and
environmental protection efforts. Country environmental systems have proved effective in
ensuring that sensitive issues are adequately studied and addressed (for example the proposed
project in Lake Natron), and their resilience will continue to be tested with respect to several new
projects that are currently being considered within the timeframe of this operation.

                                 F. PARTICIPATORY ASPECTS

171. The reform agenda supported by the PRSC derives from Tanzania's MKUKUTA, which
has been developed through a consultative process in which the Government sought inputs and
feedback from a wide array of stakeholders representing all levels of society and all regions of
Tanzania. Similarly, Tanzania's MKUKUTA monitoring system also is open to inputs from
inside and outside the Government.




                                                61
172. Aside from the MKUKUTA, the Government of Tanzania carries out wide-ranging
consultations on most policy reforms, and many of the policy areas covered by the PRSC are
underpinned by sector or thematic processes that are open to stakeholders from civil society,
NGOs, academic and research institutes, the private sector, and the donor community. This
includes the PER process as a regular forum for dialogue on public expenditure, financial and
macroeconomic management, the Investor Round Table, the Tanzania National Business Council
for government­private sector dialogue, and the environment working group. The annual review
of GBS as well as sector-specific review processes are conducted in a similarly participatory
format with the private sector and civil society organization (CSOs) participating the discussion
together with the Government and DPs. In addition, Tanzania has also put in place a process for
an independent monitoring of the government-donor relationship, which also covers the PRSC.
The design of the GBS framework seeks to encourage the further development of participatory
review processes in all areas, which would then provide the main inputs to the overall GBS
assessment.

                              G. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

173. There are two closely interrelated and overlapping sets of risks for this operation. The
first set includes general risks that may interfere with the successful implementation of the
MKUKUTA, foremost the vulnerability of Tanzania's economy to the international economic
crisis, the general direction of economic and social reforms and a continued ownership of the
core principles behind MKUKUTA, political risks related to the situation in Zanzibar, aid
dependence, decentralization, and capacity constraints. The second set of risks could undermine
the overall credibility of the GBS process--and PRSC--as an effective mean to channel
resources towards the achievement of the MKUKUTA objectives. This set includes corruption
and weak domestic accountability, the reliance on the domestic budget process, the transition to
sector review processes, and fiduciary risks.

   Vulnerability of Tanzania's growth in relation to uncertainty surrounding global
   recovery: Tanzania's growth performance remains vulnerable to external shocks that can be
   exacerbated by domestic structural weaknesses. Areas of vulnerability to external shocks,
   which are particularly relevant given the current international economic situation, include
   tourism, which has become a leading source of foreign exchange, and terms of trade,
   especially with regard to the prices of the leading export commodities including gold, coffee,
   tea, and fish, and import commodities, especially oil. The impact of the crisis has been
   described in section II of this document. It is important to recognize that considerable
   uncertainty remains with respect to the pace of recovery from the crises both in the
   international economy and in Tanzania, so that downside risk continues to exist and will
   require constant monitoring as well as rapid and flexible reaction. There are continued risks
   of exogenous shocks from another global economic downturn. The ability of Tanzania to
   quickly access the 25 percent of its quota through the IMF ESF facility, due to its good
   standing PSI program, as well as access to the rest of the quota represents an important
   defense against such uncertainty. Additional World Bank financing under the proposed
   Vulnerability Fund would also allow the World Bank group extra flexibility.
   Vulnerability of Tanzania's growth to domestic shocks: Regional and domestic risks,
   including drought, are additional risks to a recovery. Recurrent droughts have significant


                                               62
   impacts on agriculture and the power sector, which is heavily dependent on hydro generation.
   A combination of a severe drought with the international economic crisis could create very
   difficult social conditions, and might require a shift toward emergency programs. The Bank
   is discussing with the Authorities measures to strengthen agriculture production, and targeted
   social protection schemes. The planned expansion of Tanzania's power generation capacity,
   which also includes diversification into thermal (gas, coal, and fuel) power sources, will be
   important to avoid recurrent energy crises, but has been proceeding slowly.
   Political risk: There are two predominate political risks. First is the election. Success in
   reform implementation is often affected by political dynamics. As the general elections in
   October 2010 approach, some reform efforts could potentially be slowed down. Better
   understanding of political economy and the agenda of the multitude of stakeholders would
   help identify alternatives and prepare mitigation measures. There is also a risk of
   overspending during the election year and tight monitoring of budget expenditure is
   important. Second is the situation in Zanzibar. Since independence in 1961, Tanzania has
   developed one of the strongest track records of political stability in Africa, despite
   contentious elections in Zanzibar. Zanzibar's semiautonomous status and the presence of a
   strong opposition party have led to three contentious elections since 1995, which the ruling
   party won despite international observers' claims of voting irregularities. In October 2001,
   the ruling and the main opposition parties reached a bilateral accord, which was hailed as a
   landmark achievement by an African country to solve its thorny political issues through
   internal dialogue. The main opposition party has as a result been represented in the Zanzibar
   Electoral Commission as part of the agreement. In 2006, government and the main
   opposition party reaffirmed their commitment to revive the process for mutual political
   understanding in Zanzibar, popularly known as Muafaka. In 2010, a political compromise
   has led to a power-sharing agreement between the main parties, which was confirmed
   through a popular referendum. Recent political developments in Zanzibar, therefore, point
   toward a sharp reduction of tensions and associated risks, although some uncertainty still
   remains for the level of post-election implementation of the agreement.
   Losing traction in policy reforms due to lack of consensus: There is a broad consensus in
   the country, among the Government, civil society, the private sector, and development
   partners, on the goal of more pro-poor growth as well as the importance of agriculture,
   private sector development, better natural resource management, and investment in human
   capital. However, there is less clear consensus around the ways through which the benefits of
   growth will be more widely shared--for example, whether government policies should
   encourage more market-based economic development and poverty reduction or the policies
   should strengthen the control by the state over the market to achieve the same goals. Without
   rebuilding such consensus, there is a risk of further derailment in the process of policy
   reforms, with the Government diverting its attention from the energetic implementation of
   structural reforms.
   Aid dependence: Tanzania's dependence on external aid, which is about 18.1 percent of
   gross national income (GNI) and which finances around 33 percent of the Government's
   budget (GBS alone finances about 12 percent of the budget), makes the country extremely
   vulnerable to changes in donor sentiment. With respect to GBS, disbursements are subject to
   potentially more abrupt changes of donor's sentiment. The PFM underlying the PRSC
   recognizes these risks and contains a general commitment by all participating donors that, in


                                              63
   case budget support is to be reduced, this should be done in a gradual manner. JAST also
   recognizes the need to design aid modalities with a view toward minimizing the scope for
   abrupt changes. However, there is also a clear recognition that the authorities need to
   maintain an appropriate environment for sustaining relatively high levels of aid. The rapid
   increase in the level of domestic revenues, which covers recurrent expenditures, is a critical
   achievement to mitigate aid dependence.
   Decentralization: Another risk for the achievement of MKUKUTA objectives arises from
   the ongoing decentralization process, which shifts responsibility for key poverty-reducing
   programs in education, health, the water sector, and agriculture to the districts. The local
   government reform program focuses on strengthening the capacity of local authorities. As a
   result, there have been significant improvements in accountability processes at the local level,
   and about 50 percent of local authorities now meet basic accountability standards, compared
   to an estimated 10 percent only a few years ago. The PRSC also supports actions to
   strengthen the watchdog role of beneficiaries at the community level through disclosure of
   the flow of resources at the grassroots level and expenditure tracking of financial flows from
   the central government through the annual PERs.
   Capacity constraints: Limited human resource capacity to implement and manage the
   PRSC reform agenda represents another risk. A large number of capacity-building efforts are
   in place. Most reform programs have capacity-building components embedded, including the
   PFMRP, the LGRP, and the PSRP. Similarly, sector programs and projects typically also
   contain capacity-building components. The challenge for Tanzania is to enhance the
   effectiveness of capacity-building efforts by shifting from supply-driven to demand-driven
   efforts and address capacity building in a holistic way, in which the incentive structure,
   education system, and specific capacity-building efforts are organized in a mutually
   reinforcing manner. Analytic work to address these issues is planned.
   Corruption and weak domestic accountability: One of the intentions of the redesigned
   GBS framework is to use domestic processes for the assessment of progress and dialogue.
   This is intended to foster domestic accountability. However, as some of the analytic work has
   shown, these processes are still weak, partly because of weak incentives and capacity of civil
   society organizations, NGOs, and the private sector to participate in these processes. Recent
   events, though, have shown a renewed vigor in the oversight role of Parliament and of the
   media, and the initial prosecutions of a number of grand corruption cases, if carried
   uniformly, will help dent the culture of impunity.
   Reliance on domestic budget processes: The utilization of PRSC resources is determined
   by the domestic budget process, with the possibility that resource allocation is influenced by
   other factors than the pursuit of the MKUKUTA objectives. The principal mitigating
   measure derives from strengthening the role of domestic stakeholders in budget formulation
   and budget review. Government's continued commitment to an open and participatory PER
   and budget process is an important and well-established tool to support and monitor
   consistency of budget formulation and execution with the MKUKUTA. It is worth noting
   that due to fungibility of resources, the allocative risk also exists for other aid modalities, and
   the PRSC is explicitly designed to address this risk.
   Fiduciary risks: The 2006 and 2008 PEFA assessments suggest that Tanzania's financial
   management system is still among the best in Africa. Nonetheless, significant fiduciary risks


                                                 64
in the areas of financial management and procurement remain. In recent years, the
Government has implemented measures to reduce fiduciary risks, including the approval and
application of new public finance and procurement acts, the operationalization of the
electronic Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), strengthening of
the National Audit Office, and reform of the public procurement system. The PFMRP and
actions monitored by the PRSC and PAF are designed to address weaknesses in the
Government's financial management and procurement systems, with particular emphasis on
the integrity of IFMIS. Tight follow up of the Government's action plan on the EPA account
audit, and of other government measures to assess eventual past fraudulent transactions at the
Central Bank, will also be part of PRSC supervision.

Press Release No. 10/227
June 4, 2010

IMF Executive Board Completes Seventh Review under Tanzania's PSI; Approves a Three-
Year PSI, Completes Second Review Under the ESF and Approves US$29.1 Million
Disbursement

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the seventh review
of Tanzania's economic performance under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) and approved a new
three-year Instrument1. The previous PSI was approved by the Executive Board in 2007 (see Press
Release No. 07/26) and has been extended until June 4, 2010.

The Board also completed the second review of Tanzania's performance under an arrangement under
the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF). The completion of the review will enable the third and final
disbursement of SDR 19.89 million (US$29.1 million). The 12-month, SDR 218.79 million
(US$320.6 million) high access ESF arrangement was approved on May 29, 2009 (see Press Release
No. 09/190). On May 24, 2010, the Board extended the period of the one-year arrangement to June 18,
2010, to permit completion of the second review.

The new PSI for Tanzania aims at maintaining macroeconomic stability and supporting accelerated
growth, creating additional fiscal space, including to finance infrastructure investment, while
enhancing the return on public spending. It will also support the new poverty reduction and growth
strategy (MKUKUTA II) covering 2010-15 that is expected to be approved in June.
The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need, or want, IMF
financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice, monitoring, and endorsement of their policies (see
Public Information Notice No. 05/145).

Following the Executive Board's discussion on Tanzania, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:

"The Tanzanian economy is emerging from a slowdown associated with the global crisis and natural
disasters. The authorities' macroeconomic policy response, including temporary and targeted fiscal
stimulus measures and supportive monetary policy, helped mitigate the downturn. Inflation remained
high throughout 2009, but has since abated to single digits. A stronger-than-envisaged current account
and frontloaded donor assistance enabled maintenance of a comfortable reserve position. Progress
under Tanzania's poverty reduction and growth strategy is to be commended, with roughly half the
Millennium Development Goals expected to be achieved by 2015. Continued prudent macroeconomic
policies, progress on structural reforms, and improvements in the business climate will be important
to sustain these achievements.

"The near-term policy challenge is to support the economic recovery, while gradually withdrawing
the fiscal stimulus as growth strengthens. The central bank will need to monitor carefully the liquidity
conditions to guard against the emergence of inflation or exchange rate pressures.

"The new three-year Policy Support Instrument will support implementation of the authorities' new
poverty reduction and growth strategy (MKUKUTA II), to be finalized shortly. The strategy reorients

measures to contain vulnerabilities and strengthen the crisis management framework have been
undertaken," Mr. Portugal added.

 ANNEX 7: COUNTRY AT A GLANCE WORLD BANK STUDIES ON GROWTH-POVERTY LINKS
                                IN TANZANIA

The Rapid Poverty Assessment (RPA) was conducted in November 2008 based on the 2007
Household Budget Survey (HBS). The preliminary findings from RPA shows that the lack of
progress in poverty reduction is particularly driven by the weak progress in rural areas and
that positive growth contribution to poverty reduction in rural areas was offset by increased
inequality (Table A) The growth incidence analysis for rural areas shows that for most people
living in rural areas there has been no or only a negligible increase in consumption between
2001 and 2007. At the national level, inequality in essentially unchanged. One possible
explanation for the co-existence of high growth, no change in inequality and a marginal
increase in household consumption, is that increased GDP was spent in areas other than
household consumption. Looking at national accounts data, the production side of GDP shows
that mining and carrying, construction and communications are the sectors that grew most
rapidly, all of which with the exception of telecommunication are intensive in investment, and
low in basic consumption. With this a worrying pattern emerges of Government consumption
and investments in capital intensive sectors crowding out household consumption.

The World Bank is currently conducting the follow-up in-depth analytical work under the
second phase of the Poverty Assessment, which looks deeper into how poverty reduction can be
accelerated, by focusing on the question of what constrains household income growth. The
focus is be on the incentives of households to make productive investments and thus enhance
their ability to earn an income as the HBS has demonstrated that the majority of poor
Tanzanians are self-employed, either in agriculture, where 74% of the poor are occupied, or in a
small (in)formal enterprises. The ability of these entrepreneur households to increase their
income and hence to reduce poverty depends largely on the ability of the institutional
framework to create incentives aligned with making profitable investments. This poverty
assessment will focus on these incentives at three levels of aggregation: micro (households),
meso (markets and market organizations) and macro (Government and the institutional
environment). Special attention is being paid to constraints in the agriculture sector and how
they are related to the lack of poverty reduction in rural areas.



                                                      94
To complement agriculture-focused in-depth work conducted for the poverty assessment, the
World Bank is also preparing a set of policy notes on the Micro-foundations of Growth with
respect to key operations and production factors affecting firms' activity. This will synthesize
findings of existing studies in the area of private sector and markets, including the labor
market, fill knowledge gaps on issues such as regulatory regimes, competition, land, taxation,
access to finance, and technological innovation, and present a consolidated view on key
micro-level constraints which inhibit pro-poor growth in Tanzania

In addition, the Government of Tanzania (National Bureau of Statistics) has initiated a
National Panel Survey. The results of from the first wave (initiated in 2008 with data
collected through October 2009) are expected to be available by mid-2010 and can further
inform the analysis of poverty dynamics and its determinants.

Both the second phase of the Poverty Assessment and Micro-Foundations of Economic
Growth Study are expected to be completed during FY11.
