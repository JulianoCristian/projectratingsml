This\n            report focuses on air pollution management, biodiversity\n            conservation, fishing reserves conservation, and protected\n            areas management: Formulate a regulatory and legislative\n            framework for natural resource management, including\n            regulating barracuda fishing, incorporating traditional\n            practices and employing participatory practices.
