Towards this objective, the project\n            comprises three inter-related components plus one component\n            for project management. There are four project components.\n            Component 1 will both strengthen the institutional framework\n            and management capacity for biodiversity and protected\n            areas. Component 2 promotes sustainable use of biological\n            resources at the local level and includes two main groups of\n            activities: (1) It provides a grant funding mechanism (Fund\n            for Local Environmental Initiatives - FIAL) to promote\n            sustainable use activities inside and outside of the\n            targeted protected areas, and (2) Builds the capacity to\n            strengthen the management, monitoring, control and\n            surveillance of reserved fishing zones and fisheries.\n            Component 3 establish and implement an environmental and\n            social safeguards framework.
