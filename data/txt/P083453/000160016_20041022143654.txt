A. Project Development Objective

1. Projectdevelopment objective: (see Annex 1)
The development objective o f the Coastal andBiodiversity Management Project is to buildthe capacity o f
Government agencies andnaturalresource users inGuinea-Bissau to collaboratively manage coastal
environments andbiodiversity for both conservation and sustainabledevelopment ends.

This objective will bepursuedby creating a new institution, the Institute for Biodiversity andProtected
Areas (IBAP), whose function is to manage the network o fprotected areas inthe country. The creation o f
IBAP is a natural extension o fpast parkmanagementefforts ledby the World Conservation Union
(IUCN), inwhich models for participatorypark managementhave shown to be successful. Inaddition, the
project will implement community development activities inandaround protected areas fundedby a
micro-finance mechanism, the Fundfor LocalEnvironmentalInitiatives (FIAL). Further, it will strengthen
the community-based management ofreservedfishing zones andthe Government's capacity to support the
management o f these zones andfishing areas. Finally, the project will create a unit for environmental and
social safeguards screening o f development projects inthe country, which is a function currently absent
withinany existinggovernment agencies.

2. Global objective: (see Annex 1)
The global objective o f the project i s articulated as: Strengthen the conservationof globally signifcant
ecosystems and species. This objective is inlinewith the Global Environment Facility's Operational
Program 2.
Guinea-Bissau's coastal zone is ofregional importance andi s characterized by an extensive
interpenetration o fterrestrial andaquatic environments. It includes vast estuaries, a large archipelago rising
from a continental platform o f about 70,000 kmz,and seasonalcoastal plains. The coastal biotopes are
knownto be among the richest on the coast o fWest Africa interms o f diversity, productivity andfood
potential. Incontrast, the coastal biodiversity o fneighboring countries has already beenseriously degraded,
becauseo findustrial andurbandevelopment, which has ledto increased levels o fpollutionandthe
degradation o fmarine andcoastal ecosystems.

3. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)

The project development objective will be evaluated usingfour key indicators:
        At least 3,500 squarekmo flandandwater under improvedmanagement, as definedinthe Project
        ImplementationPlan, by end o f project.
        As ofJanuary 1,2007, the number o finfringementso fthe applicable regulatory framework related
        to the Reserved FishingZones by fishingvessels decreasesby 10%per year inrelation to the
        baseline established incalendar year 2006.
        As o fJanuary 1,2007, the Government provides sufficient financial resourcesto cover the
        operational andmaintenance costs o f all fisheries surveillance activities (including surveillance
        stations, vessels andpatrols).
        Allpublic andprivate development projects eligible for review are submittedfor environmental
        impact assessmentreview prior to being implemented.

B. Strategic Context
1.Sector-related CountryAssistanceStrategy (CAS) goalsupported bythe project: (see Annex 1)
Documentnumber: 16568-GUB Dateof latest CAS discussion: May 12, 1997
The proposed project is fully inline with, andinsupport of, the overarching poverty alleviation andsocial
sector development objectives definedinthe Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) prepared in 1997.
The country has experienced a period o f considerable politicalinstabilitysince the CAS was prepared,
including a militarycoup in 1998 followedby 11months o f civil war, a failed militarycoup inNovember
2000 anda bloodless militarycoup inSeptember2003. Following the coup, the country was govemed
under a transition Government untilMarch28,2004, when elections, which were characterized as open and
transparent by the internationalcommunity, resulted ina democratic Government. Such politicalinstability
has further weakened the country's capacity to act andhas created a less favorable environment for private
sector investment. Nonetheless, the basic premisesuponwhich the CAS was founded remain inplace, and
the three broadpillarso f the CAS are still recognized as key to the future o f Guinea-Bissau: i)  achieving
macro economic stability and broad-based, sustainablegrowth; ii)encouraging the development o f a
vibrant private sector; andiii)puttinginplacepolicies andprograms to reduce poverty andto improvethe
indicators o f social development.

The aims o f the project are principally to support the first andthirdofthese three strategic pillars, to be
achieved through improvedmanagement of the naturalresource baseuponwhich the country's current and
future economic well-being depends. Specifically, the project aims to strengthen institutional andhuman
resource capacity, introduce environmental safeguardmechanisms, andsupport direct management o f
biodiversity andfisheries capital. Similarly, the promotion o f community-based natural resource
management andother local income generating initiatives (with an emphasis on reaching the poorer and
more vulnerable members o fthe community) is expectedto contribute to poverty reductionefforts and
hence to improve quality of life at the local level. The project will also indirectly support the second
strategic pillar, as the introduction o fthe environmental safeguard mechanisms (inparticular, establishing a
policy andregulatory framework for environmental assessment andthe related humancapacity) will help
ensurethe development o f a private sector that is environmentally andsocially responsible.

Inadditionto the strategic pillars,the project will alsotackle several ofthe cross-cutting issuesidentified
withinthe CAS, including strengthening institutional andhumanresource capacity; identifyingmechanisms
for promotion o f financial sustainability, andpromoting donor coordination.

The project also forms a key piece o fthe proposed InterimSupport Strategy for Guinea-Bissau (expected
to be discussedat the Boardinearly 2005), which emphasizesthe contribution o fnatural resourcesto the
economy. Inparticular, the project will strengthen the management o fkey habitats that support both
agriculture andfisheries production.

Finally, the project design explicitly attempts to minimize exposure to the current politicalinstabilitywhile

Guinea-Bissau ratifiedthe Conventionon BiologicalDiversity on October 27, 1995. The proposedproject
fits well with the GEF Biodiversity Operational Strategy and supports the objectives set out inthe
Operational Program on Coastal andMarineEcosystems. The project is inline with guidance from the
first, second andthirdConference o f the Parties to the Convention on BiologicalDiversity (CBD), which
stresses in situ conservation o f coastal andmarine ecosystems. It specifically responds to the Jakarta

Mandate endorsed at Conference o fParties (COP2), by supporting conservation andsustainable use o f
vulnerable marine habitats andspecies. The conservation andsustainableuse o f coastal andmarine
ecosystemshave been identified as priorities withinthe draR National Biodiversity Strategy andAction
Planandthe NationalEnvironmentalAction Planrecently adoptedbythe Government.
The proposedproject recognizes the importance o f conserving ecosystemstructures and functions inorder
to maintain, increase anddiversify ecological services o f global, national andlocal benefit. This integrated
approach to the management o f coastal ecosystems representsa strategy that promotes conservation and
sustainable use o fnaturalresourcesinan equitable way.

The project responds to Conference o f Parties o f the CBD guidance invarious ways including:
         takinganecosystemapproach to conservation, particularlyv i s - h i s fisheries andmarine
         biodiversity conservation;
         involving local communities andresourceusers, including buildingon local knowledge,
         strengthening community management for sustainableuse andpromoting economic incentives such
         as alternative livelihood opportunities;
         strengthening local andnational institutional capacity to address environmental issues, especially
         through developing a sustainableinstitutional andlegal framework for promoting biodiversity
         conservation andmanagement, testing participatorymodels that devolve biodiversity
         decision-making andmanagement to stakeholdersat the local level, andputtinginplace safeguards
         to ensure environmental andsocial aspectsare incorporated into broader economic development
         decisions;
         strengthening inter-institutional, andmultiple stakeholder forums such as the national-level
         Steering Committee andthe local level Park Management Councils andConsultative Councils for
         fisheries so as to promote the integration o fbiodiversity parametersinto sectoral policies and
         decisions;
         strengthening regional networks for conservation andsustainableuse o fmarine biodiversity, such
         as the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission, the regional coastal zone planningnetwork andthe
         West African Turtle network, through data gathering, improvedunderstanding andincreased
         national capacity for management; and
         harmonizing key sectoral legislationwith national andinternational biodiversity commitments.

The project is consistent with the Biodiversity Strategic Priority o fMainstreamingBiodiversity in
Production Landscapes. Itwill invest insystemic andinstitutional capacities o f Government, stakeholders
inthe productive sectors, communities andenforcement institutionsas well as inprotected areamanagers
inorder for thesestakeholderstoeffectively participatein,anddeliveron, improvedconservation and
sustainable use o fbiodiversity across the coastal land- andseascapes. The project will also support
sustainable management o f marine resources, inparticular fisheries. It aims to mainstream conservation
priorities andsustainableuse into area-basedmanagement o f fisheries by local fishing communities to
protect the ecological integrity o f coastal andmarine ecosystems. The project will further improve relevant
knowledge andpartnership buildingbetween agencies to mainstream biodiversity concerns into regulatory
andnormative frameworks.

The proposedproject seeks to use Protected Areas as possible development areas, by implementing
approaches that fully integrate biodiversity conservation andsustainableuse concems with poverty
alleviation andsocial-economic development. Models developedandpiloted would be replicatedelsewhere
inGuinea-Bissau, bothaspartoftheprojectitselfandaspartofcomplementary donor-financed protected
area andbiodiversity management programs.

Guinea-Bissau's coastal complex hosts exceptional biodiversity, due to its remarkable landscapefeatures.
Itis characterized by anextensive interpenetration ofterrestrial andaquatic environments, including vast
estuaries, a large archipelago rising from a continental shelfo f about 70,000 km2,andseasonally flooded
coastal plains. The mainbiotopes found inthe coastal zone includemangroves, sandbanksandmudflats,
shallow estuarine waters andsub-humidGuinean forests. These habitats, particularly the marine and
estuarine waters, are knownto be among the richest onthe West African coast interms o f diversity,
productivity andfoodpotential. They are essentialfor the survivalof several species that are globally
endangeredor threatened, and for species that are economically important.

Guinea-Bissau has established a network o fprotected areas inits coastal zone, all o f which are designated
for GEF support under this project. These areas are identified as priority sites o f global importance in"A
Global Representative System o f Marine ProtectedAreas" (Great Barrier ReefMarine Park Authority,
World Bank andIUCN, 1995) as well as by the review of "Ecologically Sensitive Sites inAfrica" (World
Conservation MonitoringCenter, 1993). Two o fthe protected areas, Orango NationalPark andJog0
Vieira e PoilSoNational Park, are within the Bolama-Bijagos archipelago, which hasbeen designated as a
Biosphere ReservebyUNESCO.

The coastalzone is very richinorganic materials andplankton, supporting highly diverse fauna, andis a
regionally important breeding andnursery zone for fish andcrustaceans. Mangroves cover almost a third
o f its area, including the white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa), a rare species inWest Africa, and
extensive mudflats lie adjacent to andbetween the islands.

The archipelago i s reportedto be the secondmost important wintering ground for Palearctic shorebirds in
West Africa (after the Banc d'Arguin inMauritania), andsupports 10,000-15,000 pairs o fbreeding water
birds. Itsplanktonrichwaters support diverse marine fauna including fish, crustaceanandmollusk
species; regionally important stocks o f five turtle species: green (Chelonias mydas), loggerhead (Caretta
caretta),olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), hawksbill (Eretmochelysimbriquata)andleatherback
(Dermochelys coriacea); marine mammals such as the bottlenose andthe Atlantic humpback dolphin;
sharks; and crocodiles. The archipelago also sustains the largest population o f manatee (Trichechus
senegalensis)inWest Africa anda populationof sea going hippopotami. One o f the archipelago's islands,
Ilhaudo Poilgo, is the largestbreeding ground for the green turtle inWest andCentral Africa.

The remainingthree areas targeted underthe project are along the mainlandcoast: i)the Cantanhezforest
(a proposed protected area) that supports one o fthe few remaining stands ofprimarysub-humidGuinea
forest andi s home to the endangeredchimpanzee; ii)     the Lagoa de Cufada NaturalPark, designated under
the Ramsar convention as a wetland o f intemational importance andnoteworthy for its wealth o fbirdlife;
andiii)the Rio Cacheu MangroveNaturalPark, a complex o festuarine mangroves, swamp andmarshland
of great importance to Palearctic waders, other waterfowl, andbirds o fprey.

Other significant conservation areas inGuinea-Bissau include: i)     the Rio Grande de Buba Basin where
rocks, mudflats andmangroves support resident andPalearctic waders as well as breedingpopulations o f
MarabouStork andPink-backedPelican; ii)the Rio Mansoa Basinwhere the inter-tidal mudflats and the
mangroves constitute an important breeding area for African Darter andGreat White Egret as well as being
important to western European populations o fBlack-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa) andothers; andiii)       the
Rio Tombali, an extremely biologicallyrichcomplex o finter-tidal mudflats andofmangroves supporting
breedingpopulations o f African Darter, Wood Stork, Great White Egret, Sacred Ibis, African Spoonbill
andPink-backed Pelicanas well as beingimportant for resident andPalearctic waders.

2. Mainsector issues and Government strategy:
Guinea-Bissau is one o fthe world's poorest countries. Its development index is amongst the lowest, with
over 50 percent o f the population livingbelow the poverty line, a life expectancy at birtho f43 years, and a
highlevel o finequality o fincome distribution. The country's estimated populationin2001was
approximately 1.3 million, with a growth rate o f 2.23 percent.

Guinea-Bissau's current and future economy i s highly dependent onits natural resources. The sale o f
cashew nuts andfisheries licenses are currently the country's two best income earners (representing
approximately 87 percent o fthe country's export earnings), but exploitation o fnon-renewable resources,
particularly bauxite, phosphate andpetroleum, i s touted by Government as a key potential element for
future economic growth.

Root causes of biodiversity loss
With approximately 80 percent o fthe populationcurrentlyresiding inthe coastal zonewhere most
economic activity is concentrated, one o fthe root causes ofbiodiversity loss is increasing population
pressure on coastal andmarine resources. A related cause o fbiodiversity loss i s poverty, andthe ensuing
lack o f economic alternatives. Naturalresources currently form the foundation o fthe livelihoodstrategies
for the majority o fthe population, for whom few alternatives exist. Furthermore, highpoverty andlow
awarenesso fthe necessity o f ecosystemhealth for the provision o f environmental goods andservices
implies little incentive for sustainablemanagemento f the coastal biodiversity capital.

Subsistence livelihoods have ledto deforestation andsoil degradation, which have historically been seen as
the basic environmental problems confronting Guinea-Bissau. Withinthe coastal zone more specifically,
the major threats to ecosystem function and habitat quality have resulted from subsistence activities such as
itinerant agriculture, rice production, artisanal fishingandthe extraction o f fuelwood from forests and
mangroves for the productiono f charcoal andthe smoking o f fish. The lack o f appropriate management o f
coastal andmarine naturalresources as well as the depletion o f key species within fragile ecosystems could
cause severe biodiversity loss (see Annex 13:IndicativeThreats andRoot Causes Analysis and
Identification o f Project ResponseMeasures).

Potential threats to biodiversity
The coastal zone also houses resourcesidentifiedas potential motors o f future economic growth, namely
fisheries andoffshore petroleum. Guinea-Bissau's capacity to manage these resources sustainably i s very
weak.

Fisheries are at present mainly exploited by foreign vesselsthrough negotiated fishing licenses or by
migrants from SenegalandGuinea. The fishinglicenses do not set quotas, but rather rely onthe payment
of fees proportionate to captures, eventhough fishstocks are insufficiently known. Guinea-Bissau does not
have the capacity to monitorthe impact o f fishing on stocks, to control fishing licenses, or to collect fishing
fees. Ultimately, intense industrialfishing of key species such as shrimps could change the ecological
balance o f coastal ecosystemsandthreaten their integrity. Artisanal fisheries present another set o f issues.
Much o f the fish caught by artisanal fishermen is landedinGuinea or inSenegal. Furthermore, global
markets for high-priced foods, such as shark fins, have ledto intense overexploitation anda rapidcollapse
o f source stocks.

The potential for petroleum production inGuinea-Bissau and Southern Senegalhas also beenrecognized.
Petroguin, a Guinea-Bissau parastatal oil company, retainedin2000 the services o f First Exchange



                                                       - 7 -

Corporation (FE) o f Houston, Texas, to promote andoversee oil development. Earlyestimates suggest a
potential o f 500 million to 3 billionbarrels, split between Guinea-Bissau's sharedeconomic zone with
Senegalandits exclusive economic zone. The area currently openedto exploration comprises Guinea
Bissau's entire coast, including the Bolama-Bijagos Archipelago. Productioncould go aheadif
commercially viable oil fields are found. Such offshore oil production could have huge environmental and
social impacts, unless necessarysafeguardsare developed andimplemented.

The threats o f overfishing andoil exploration are compoundedbythe inclusion o fthe Department o f
Environment inthe same Ministrythat hosts the nationalpetroleum development parastatal (Petroguin),
thus creating a conflict ofinterest that couldhinderthe sustainablemanagementofcoastalbiodiversity. In
order to addressthese threats and constraints, the project will buildthe capacity for independent
environmental impact assessmentso f all major projects, with specific sector assessments for petroleum and
fisheries.

Threats to marine resources
Another significant threat to the coastal andmarine biodiversity o f Guinea-Bissau i s illegal, unreported and
unregulatedfishingby industrial fishingvessels, particularly inareas or zones reserved for artisanal fishing
or inmarine protected areas.

Foreign vessels routinely encroachupon the country's marineprotected areas andthe artisanal fishingzone
(delineated as the areawithin 12nautical miles o fthe shoreline), creating conflicts with artisanal fishers
and damaging the fragile ecosystemsprotected by the Marine ProtectedAreas (WAS)through activities
such as bottom-trawling. Furthermore, bothunlicensed andlicensed vessels often fishinreserved fishing
zones andmarine protected areas usingtrawls with a single meshsize, e.g. 60 - 65 mmfor shrimp, for all
fisheries.

For this reason, inorder to manage the reserved fishing zones inGuinea-Bissau, andindeedto help ensure
the sustainable use andprotectionof all o fthe country's coastal andmarine biodiversity, strengthened
capabilities inthe public sector for the Monitoring, Controland Surveillance (MCS) o f industrial fishing
vessels i s urgently needed.

Three challenges prevent effective management o freserved fishingzones. The first is the encroachment o f
vessels into shallow waters close to the islands, but also well-organized foreign artisanal fishermen landing
their catch directly on industrial vessels. The second is the inappropriate or absence o f a strategic
management scheme for fisheries. The thirdis the general weak capacity andlack o f infrastructure and
equipment o f institutions that are supposedto manage fisheries.

Inorder to addresstheseobstacles,the projectwill support the establishment ofamonitoring and
surveillance system for fisheries. Itwill also promote a fisheries control system andinvest inequipment,
infrastructure and operating costs o fthe institutions incharge o f managingfisheries.

However, none o fthis will be sustainable if the politicalwill for managing fisheries does not exist. For this
reason, a process leadingto a consensus on sustainable fisheries management actions andreforms will be
initiated as part o f this project. The process will buildon the findings o fthe World Bank-supported
Fisheries Sector Strategy Note andinclude all major stakeholders associatedwith fisheries in
Guinea-Bissau, including Government representatives, civil society representatives,the fishing industry,
donors, as well as regional fisheries organizations. The process will be co-designed with major donors, who
will be assisting with investments to addressobstaclespreventingresponsible fishingindustries.

National policy and institutionalframework to address issues and constraints
Despite the severe constraints it faces, the Government recognizes the importance o fmaintaining the quality
of the environment ando f the naturalresourcebase. The four prongs o fthe National Development
Program for 2001-2010are: i)economic growth andpoverty alleviation, ii)provision o fbasic social and
economic infrastructure, iii)demobilization andreinsertion o f soldiers (consolidation o fpeaceandnational
reconciliation) andiv) good governance. It clearly acknowledges the critical role naturalresourceshave to
play inoverall economic development as well as inpoverty alleviation. Priorityis given to stimulation of
sustainableeconomic growth basedon diversified rural development andthe rational exploitation of
agricultural, forestry andfishery resourcesto alleviate poverty.

Withrespectto natural resourcesandthe environment, the National DevelopmentProgramoutlines four
principal objectives: i)improving access to potable water; ii)improvingthe understanding o fthe potential
representedby the country's non-renewable resources; iii)capacity buildingvis-bvis technologies that
increasethe value o f localresources; andiv) ensuring sustainableexploitation o fthe resourcebase
combinedwithjudicious protectiono fthe environment. The strategy for achievingthe last objective
includes the elaboration o f a nationalpolicy andplanfor environmental management, the management of
parksandother protected areas andthe elaboration andimplementationofabiodiversity management
program inthe coastal areas.

The above objectives and strategies are reinforced by several initiatives:
                                 -
         The assessment o f environmental issues"Towards a strategic agendafor environmental
         management" prepared with the support o fthe World Bankin 1993, which identified the
         management o f protected areas as a priority to counter loss of offshore fisheries andbiodiversity.
         The National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), prepared by the Department of Environment
         with the support ofUNDPKJNSO, was adoptedby Govemment inFebruary2004 with the
         objective o fprovidingGuinea-Bissau with planningandmanagement instruments for its natural
         resources. Areas o f concem include salinizationo frice paddies, deforestation, bushfires and
         wildlife depletion, overfishing, destruction o fmangroves andloss o fbiodiversity along the coast.
         The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP), prepared by the Department o f
         Environment with the support of UNDP/GEF, was adopted by Government inFebruary2004. The
         NBSAP was a participatory initiative to help Guinea Bissauassess biologicalbiodiversity, identify
         threats, andsuggest options andmeasuresto ensure the conservation, ecologically sustainable
         utilization andequitable sharing o fbiodiversity.
         A Clearing House Mechanism is being establishedbythe General Directoratefor Environment in
         cooperation withthe Convention on BiologicalDiversity for Guinea-Bissau, withthe support o f
         UNDP/GEF. The GEF Council has approved fundinginApril 2001to set upbiodiversity
         information systems andfor support for hardware, software andtraining.
         A National Capacity Self-Assessment(NCSA)for Global Environment Management. The aimof
         the NCSA is to conduct an assessment and a thorough analysis o f the capacity needs and
         constraints that the country is facing regarding its efforts to solve the problems o f global
         environmental management as set forth inthe Rio Conventions andother related intemational
         instruments. Currently the NCSA i s inpreparation andexpected to be fundedby the GEF in2004.
         Thesepreparatory activities include preliminary consultations to conceive a process o f
         self-assessmentfor the enhancement o f capacities, as well as to prepare a fundingproposal request
         for that assessment.

Starting in 1988, the Government has beenimplementing activities inthe coastal zone. IUCNhas.beena
key partner since the beginning, withthe financial support o fthe Government of Switzerland. The


                                                      - 9 -

European Union, France, Portugal, Canada andthe Netherlands have each provided additional support.
The activities they funded have mainlyfocused onthe coastal area, although insome cases their scope was
national. Most remarkably, coastalplanningactivities have stimulatedthe growth of local NGOs, which
have inturn strongly supported these activities. The efforts ofthe last 15 years have significantly
contributedto the sustainablemanagemento fbiodiversity, by establishing a network of protected areas and
by involvingcommunities inthe managementofnatural resources. The mainachievementsinclude:

         Establishment o fthe Bolama-Bijagos Biosphere Reserve (1996).
         Enactment o f aFramework Law on Protected Areas in 1997,which providesfor the devolution o f
         management responsibilities for protected areas to the community level, to create ownership andto
         initiate "sustainable development poles".
         Establishment o f aprotected area network, including the Job Vieira andPoi150National Park, the
         Orango National Park, the Cacheu Mangrove NaturalPark, andthe Cufada LagoonNaturalPark.
         Studies are being completed for the conversion o fthe Cantanhez game reserve into a protected
         area.
         Establishment o f aProtected Area Nucleus (NAP), which managesthe Orango, Jog0 Vieira and
         Cacheuparks, as well as the Bolama-Bijagos Biosphere Reserve.
         Creation o f a Coastal Planning Unit, which has catalyzed numerous geographic as well as
         biodiversity inventory andmonitoring studies.
         Support to sustainabledevelopment andpoverty alleviation, through the funding o f micro-projects
         focusing on fisheries, food security andforestry, inpartnership with national NGOs.
         Environmental education andawareness raising, targetingnational decision-makers, technicians, as
         well as school children andlocal communities.
More recently, duringthe Bubaque+l 0 meetinginMarch2001, the Government publicly announced its
intentionto establish an official organ to manageprotected areas and wildlife, thus filling a critical
institutional gap. This i s a further confirmationthat this proposed project responds to the priorities o fthe
Government.


3. Sector issuesto be addressedbythe project andstrategic choices:
The project aims to buildthe capacity o f Government agencies andnatural resource users inGuinea-Bissau
to collaboratively manage coastal environments andbiodiversity for both conservation and sustainable
development ends.

More specifically the project will leverage additional funding based on the following strategic choices:

    0    Increasing long-term sustainability. The vulnerability o f Guinea-Bissau's biodiversity
         management efforts i s compoundedby the limitedcapacity o f Government to support biodiversity
         management. The strategic approach is to create an institutional framework and a funding
         mechanism that shields the protected areanetwork from the constraints anduncertainties o f donors
         andnational government, andthat enablesthe implementationofa strategic planningprocessfor
         the national coastal biodiversity capital. The objective o f the project i s to entrust the management
         o fprotectedareas andbiodiversity to a self-govemed institution, the Institute for Protected Areas
         andBiodiversity (IBAP),andto establish anindependent Conservation TrustFundsupporting
         biodiversity conservation activities inGuinea-Bissau. Contributions to the Fundwould be sought
         from the conservation community, andfrom foreign stakeholders inindustrial fisheries and
         offshore petroleum. Such an Institute would allow long-term, hence strategic, planningand
         coordinated, complementary activitiedfkture project approaches. The Government i s supportive o f



                                                      - 10-

       this solution as it addresses the underlyingproblem o fbudget and capacity, andit stabilizes current
       efforts. Similar models have been implepented inneighboringBurkina Faso andCGte d'Ivoire.

       Consolidating the achievements ofpast and on-going eflorts. IBAPwouldresult from the
       consolidationo f existing activities, most particularly the Protected Area Nucleus (NAP),the
       Coastal PlanningUnit (GPC) andthe Lagoa de Cufada Project. This consolidation would create
       synergies andlinkages between currently autonomous activities, support knowledge exchange and
       learning, enhancecooperation andcoherence, andavoid duplication.

       Strengthening the existing network of protected areas. Guinea-Bissau has succeededin
       establishing a network o fprotected areas, to which it plansto add the proposed Cantanhez
       protected area. However, there i s little effective management o fthese areas andmanagementplans
       muststill befinalized andimplemented. The proposedprojectwill help establish a greaterphysical
       presenceinprotected areas, identify andimplement managementmeasures.

       Empowering communities. The project will leverage the features o fthe existing protected area
       framework that provide for the devolution o fmanagement responsibilities for protected areas to
       community level, as a way to create ownership andto initiate sustainableresourceuse. Itwill
       support micro-activities contributing to biodiversity conservation through either sustainableuse or
       generation o f alternative incomepossibilities.

       Promoting SustainableFishing Practices. Selective fishing andhuntingof top predators o fthe
       coastal ecosystem as well as lossesthrough by-catch are seriously threatening coastal ecosystem
       functions. The project will help communities establish managed fishing reservesanddevelop
       conservation andmanagementplans for their fisheries resources. The establishment o f fishing
       reserveswould buildon successful experiences inthe country (e.g. by the Rio Grande de Buba
       Project, where local populations were given exclusive rightsto barracuda breeding grounds, on
       condition that they managethe area sustainably). Strengthenedmonitoring, control andsurveillance
       o f fisheries will also be an integralpart o f enabling sustainablemanagement o f fisheries inreserved
       fishingzones andenforcing sustainablefishingregulations andrules.

       Focusing on global threats. Inaddition to addressingtraditional biodiversity management
       concems such as protected areamanagement, testing participatory management models, capacity
       buildingandthe monitoring ofbiodiversity, the projectmustalso deal with growing global threats
       to the integrity o f coastal ecosystems andtheir associatedbiodiversity, most urgently from
       industrialfisheries andfrom the development ofoffshore petroleum. Limitingthese threats is a
       prerequisite to ensure that coastal andbiodiversity management efforts are sustainable inthe
       mediumandlongterm. Thesethreatshave underlinedthe country's extremely limitedcapacity to
       integrate environmental andsocial issueswithin broader national development decision-making,
       given weak dialogue amongst stakeholders, poor coordination, the absence o f environmentaland
       social safeguard mechanisms, andexisting conflicts o f interest between conservation andthe
       petroleum exploration. The project's response to global threats i s to help Guinea-Bissau set up an
       independent unitto ensure that the environmentalimpactso f development activities are adequately
       addressed.

C. Project DescriptionSummary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description andAnnex 3 for a detailedcost breakdown):



                                                      -11 -

The project aims to buildthe capacity o f Government agenciesandnaturalresource users inGuinea-Bissau
to collaboratively manage coastal environments andbiodiversity for bothconservation andsustainable
development ends. Towards this objective, the project comprisesthree inter-related components plus one
component for project management.

ComponentI ProtectedAreas andEndangeredSpeciesManagement
                -
Throughthis component, the project will both strengthenthe institutional framework andmanagement
capacity for biodiversity andprotected areas. Itwill establish a financially andadministratively
autonomous institution   - The Institute for Biodiversity andProtected Areas (IBAP)- chargedwith
managingthe country's network o fprotected areas andendangeredspecies. By engaging with local
communities inside andoutside o fthe protected areas, IBAP will ensure that these areas are effectively
protected. The project will finance (GEF funding) technical assistance, workshops andconsultations,
training, parkmanagement equipment, the physical facilities andoperating costs for IBAP, inorder to
strengthen the management o f four existing ProtectedAreas. The project will also support the creation o f a
new protected area inCatanhezandthe development andimplementationo f species action plans for
threatened species of marineMles, manateesandprimates.

Component11-NaturalResourceManagement
This component promotes sustainable use o fbiological resources at the local level andincludes two main
groups o f activities: (i)
                         provision o f a grant funding mechanism (Fundfor Local Environmental Initiatives     -
FIAL) to promote sustainableuse activities inside andoutside o fthe targeted protected areas, and(ii)
capacity buildingto strengthen the management, monitoring, control andsurveillance o f reserved fishing
zones and fisheries.

Provision of a grantfunding mechanism (FIAL) to support sustainable use activities inside and outside
of the targetedprotected areas. Through the FIAL a processfor identifylng andenabling community
development initiatives will be established.The FIAL,which will provide matchinggrants to local
communities andnatural resourcesusers inandaround the five protected areas, will assist communities in
identifylng and implementing biodiversity-friendly approachesto naturalresource management andlocal
development. FIALmay also provide full grants to individuals whose access to resourcesis negatively
affected by ProtectedArea regulations.

Once the FIAL processesare operating successfully, the project will facilitate the creation o f a private
foundation, the Foundationfor Biodiversity inGuinea-Bissau (FBGB)for which it i s anticipated that one
funding window will be a formalized FIAL, financing mechanism, andthe other one a funding mechanism
for supporting the cost o f operating the protected areas system o f IBAP. To enable these activities, the
project will finance the establishment and operating costs o f FIALadministrativestructures, the technical

for communities' microproject initiatives. Itwill also cover costs associatedwith technical assistance, legal
consultancies,workshops andmeetings, andenable the establishment o fthe FBGB.

Capacity building to strengthen the management and the monitoring, control and surveillance of
Reserved Fishing Zones and$sheries. These activities are aimed at implementing participatory
management andsustainable use o f three RFZs that are critical fishbreeding andnursery areas withinthe
coastal ecosystems, andthe monitoring, control andsurveillance o fthese RFZsand fishing areas. More
specifically, these activities will focus on the monitoring, control andsurveillance o f artisanal and industrial
fisheries having animpact on the reserved fishingzones. The project will finance facilitation and
consultations, participatory planning, collaborative surveillance andawarenessraisingfor co-management
of reserved fishing zones. Inorder to support the management o fthe RFZs, the project will also finance the

  equipment, training, andtechnical assistance necessaryto buildthe capacity o fthe Government for the
 monitoring, control andsurveillance o f industrial and artisanal fisheries. The majority o fproject financing
  for surveillance will be capitalinvestments for equipment, andit will only briefly subsidize the operating
 costs while a more durable solution i s found through the process o f a national discussion o f fisheries, also
 to be supportedunder the project.

  Component III Environmental and Social SafeguardsFramework
                   -
  This component will establish andimplement anenvironmental andsocial safeguardsframework. The
 project will support the development of policies andprocedures andcapacity buildingactivities neededto
 ensure that environmental andsocial concems are taken into account inthe development decision-making
 process.

  Itwillbuildnational capacity to evaluate andmonitor the environmental andsocial implications of
  development proposals, with a particular emphasis onunderstanding the potential environmental and social
  impacts associatedwith the future development o fpriority sectors such as petroleum exploitation, fisheries
  andtourism. The component will finance the preparation anddissemination ofnationalenvironmental and
  social safeguardlegislation, the establishment andoperation o fthe Environmental Impact Assessment
  (EM) unit, including staff, equipment andcontractedreviewers, andtechnical assistance, workshops,
  training andpublic awarenessraising.

  Inaddition, this component will finance the review andharmonizationofexisting environmental legislation,
  including adapting national legislationto reflect the commitments made by ratificationo f
  biodiversity-related internationalconventions (Biodiversity, Ramsar, CITES, Bonn).

  Component JY -Project Management and M&E
  A Project Management Unitwill secure the dailymanagement andtracking o fimplementation, be
  responsible for project financial management andprocurement, the monitoring andevaluation o fboth
  progress andimpact, andfacilitating working relationships betweenthe implementing agencies. The latter
  will include convening a ProjectManagement Group comprised ofall key implementingagenciesinorder
  to ensurecoordination o fproject activities. An inter-disciplinary Steering Committee will further promote
  coordinationandsynergies between participatinggovernment agencies andkey stakeholders.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:

Untilnow, the implementation ofGuinea-Bissau's environmental andbiodiversity agendahasbeenlargely
project-based andreliant upon non-governmental partnerships, especially with IUCNand UNDP. There is
anurgent needfor the Government to mainstreamits environmental responsibilities. Thus, one o fthe
central thrusts o f the project i s to support the criticallegal andinstitutional reforms considered necessary
for biodiversity conservation andmanagementto be intemalized ina coherent andsustainablemanner. To
this end, the project will support the following reforms:

         Creation o f an administratively andfinancially autonomous National Institute o f Biodiversity and
         ProtectedAreas (IBAP), responsible for the management o fbiodiversity andprotected areas in
         Guinea-Bissau. Although administratively andoperationally autonomous, this Institute will be
         overseenby the Ministryof Agriculture andRuralDevelopment, inorder to be well placedto
         respondto Government policies andstrategies.
         Establishment o f a conservation finance mechanism insupport o f management o fbiodiversity and
         protected areas andsustainableuse activities over the long-term. As part o fthis effort, the project
         will also identify and catalyze establishment of alternative financial arrangements(a foundation) to
         support management o fbiodiversity andprotected areas andto support the scaling up o f the FIAL
         micro-project mechanism.
         A re-launch o fthe nationaldialogue onthe fisheries sector andreform ofthe management of
         reserved fishingzones and other areas. Towards this, the Govemment will guarantee a recurrent
         budget for the monitoring activities o f the Fisheries ResearchInstitute (CIPA) andthe surveillance
         activities o f FiscaMar.
         Preparation andadoption o f critical environmental safeguardpolicies, regulations andprocedures,
         specifically those ensuring a transparent andeffective EL4review o f development projects. The
         EIAunitwill report directly to the Prime Minister.
         Review andrevision o f existing national laws to ensure intemal harmony as well as consistency
         with the relevant international conventions ratifiedbythe Government.

3. Benefits and target population:

The benefits o fthis project will accrue at global, regional, national andlocal levels.

Global and regional benefits

The project will contribute to:

    0    increased area of globally significant habitats undereffective protection;
    0    improved conservation o f globally significant fauna andflora species and assemblageswithin and
         outside formally protected areas;
    0    strengthenedprotection for globally andregionally significant species, including marine turtles,
         African manatees, chimpanzees, sharks, sea-going hippopotami, migratory birds andcolobus
         monkeys, complementing similar regional initiatives (e.g. the GEF-financed Medium Sized Project
         inThe Gambia, the West AfricanTurtle network, etc.);
         improved sustainability o f regionally important fisheries through the better management of critical
         breeding grounds and nurseries;
         decreasedloss anddegradation o f critical coastal habitats andecosystems, with associatedbenefits

National and local benefits
The conservation and sustainableuse o fcoastal andmarine ecosystemsandthe biodiversity they support,
andthe equitable sharingofbenefits from their use, are fundamental to socioeconomic development and
poverty alleviation both locally andnationally. The project will help:

    0    improve the institutional andlegal framework for environment andnatural resourcemanagementin
        general, andcoastal andmarine biodiversity inparticular;
    0   create a sustainable institutional andfinancial structure for management o f biodiversity and
        protected areas;
    0   reduce the loss anddegradation o f Guinea-Bissau's coastal andmarine ecosystems andhabitats,
         andthus contribute to maintaining the productivity uponwhich national andlocal economies
         depend;
    0    test practicalmodels for devolving biodiversity andnaturalresourceplanningandmanagement
        responsibilities to the local level, thus providing valuable lessons for Guinea-Bissau's incipient
         decentralization process;
    0    increase stakeholder capacity (government, NGOs, communities andprivate sector) for
        participatory biodiversity and natural resource planning andmanagement that cuts across sectoral
        boundaries;
    0    empower coastal communities, givingthem a voice inlocal development decision-making;
    0    identify andtest potential alternative livelihood strategies that promote bothimproved biodiversity
         conservatiodsustainable use, andimprove the quality of life at the local level;
    0    increaseawarenesso f the importance o fbiodiversity andnaturalresource management for local
         andnationaleconomic development andpoverty alleviation;
    0    putinplace a legalframework andinstitutional capacity to ensurejudicious environmental and
         social protection;
    0    contribute to increased sustainability o f locally andnationally importantfisheries through the
         improvedmanagement o f critical breeding grounds andnurseries.

Targetpopulation
Particular emphasisinthe project i s beingplacedonthe involvement of, andbenefit-sharing with, affected
local communities. Inaddition to these local communities, the target population includes other resource
users, Government employees and decision-makers at all levels, localNGOs, andthe small-scale private
sector inthe vicinity ofprotected areas or key habitats for targeted species.

As part ofthe environmentalandsocial impact analysis, a stakeholder analysis hasbeen conducted. As part
of this analysis, an environmentalandsocial management framework was preparedthat will ensure
stakeholder awarenessof the project. The stakeholder analysis has beenpublicly disclosed in
Guinea-Bissau andis available through both the World Bank andIUCN, as well as beingpresented inthe
nationalnewspapersand inlocal radio stations to ensurethat all stakeholders that could be affected by the
project have been reached.

Understanding the social underpinning o f incentives for people'sbehavior inrelation to a rational
management o f natural resourcesinthe coastal zone is imperative. While stakeholder analyses and social

safeguards have been completed for the project, additional work is requiredas part o f the continued
capacity buildingo f communities andinstitutions with whom this project will operate. Suchwork hasbeen
builtintomany activitiesto ensurethat the project remains focused ontargeting the rightpeople throughout
all interventions.

4. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements:
ProjectInstitutionalCoordinationandImplementationArrangements:

Overall responsibility for the project lies with the Ministryo f Economy and Finance. Nevertheless,
execution will be undertaken inpartnership with the Ministryo f Agriculture andRuralDevelopment, the
Ministry ofFisheries andthe Office o fthe Prime Minister. A ministerialdecreewill set out the working
relationships, roles and responsibilities o f the project's executing agencies.

OverallProject Coordinationand Oversight. A Project Management Unit(PMU), hostedbythe
Ministry ofEconomy andFinance, will overseeandensureoverall coordinationandmanagementofproject
implementation, including project monitoring andevaluation. The unitwill be headedby the National
Project Coordinator, supported by an intemational ChiefTechnical Advisor, anAdministrator and
Secretary. The project's financial management andprocurement activities will be outsourced to the Private
Sector Rehabilitation andDevelopmentProject (PSRDP), also hosted by the Ministryo f Economy and
Finance andfinancedby the World Bank. The PMU's administrator will ensure smooth coordinationon
questions related to finances andprocurement.

The National Coordinator would ensure the ongoing coordination o fproject activities through a Project
ManagementGroup (PMG) comprised ofthe designatedrepresentatives(focal points) from eacho fthe
executingpartners, representing a specific component. The PMGwill meet on a monthlybasis. Itwill
review implementationprogress andbudgetsfor each component on a quarterly basis, andresolve any
problems andbottlenecks that are identified. Itwill also be responsible for consolidating
component-specific annualwork plansandbudget proposals intoa coordinated annualwork planand
budget for the project as a whole. Coordinationwithin andbetween the various technical teams working on
the project components will also be strengthenedthrough regular assistanceprovided by a team o f
internationally andregionally contracted advisors (including the Chief Technial Advisor, conservation,
sociallparticipation, fisheries andEL4 experts).

A SteeringCommitteecomposed ofhigher levelrepresentativesfrom eacho fthe implementingagencies
andother key stakeholders, suchas NGOs, representativesofGEFimplementingagencies (inparticular
UNDP), andproject-affected communities, will ensurepolicy leveloversight o fthe project andpromote
incorporationo fthe project's objectives into sector-specific andnational development programming. The
Steering Committee will review progress andapprove annualwork plans andbudgets, andaddress any
problems or conflicts. It will meet bi-annually andon an ad hoc basis as needed.

Finally, a Donor Committeewill be establishedto coordinate support among donors to the project and
help present results andlessons learned to donors from co-financed activities, encouragebroader adoption
of successful approaches, andprepare for any follow-on activities. The project will carry outjoint planning
of activities with other donors inthe project area, inparticular FIBA, PRCM, IUCN, andUNDP.

Component-SpecificImplementationArrangements. Responsibility for biodiversity conservation
activities under Component 1will lie with IBAP, under the oversight o fthe Ministry o fAgriculture and
Rural Development. This same ministrycurrently overseesboththe Protected Areas Unit (NAP) and



                                                       -16-

Coastal PlanningUnit(GPC) with support from IUCN, thus the only major institutional change requiredis
the transfer o f the Lagoa de Cufada initiative from the Ministry o f Energy andNaturalResources, to the
MinistryofAgriculture andRuralDevelopment. Implementationofthe component activities will be ledby
the President o fIBAP(focal point), who will be supported by a Chief Operating Officer, an accountant and
anintemational technical advisor inBissau, andby the Park Conservators andguards at the locallevel.
Implementationo fproject activities will be done inclose collaboration withrepresentativesfrom other
implicated departments and institutions, including, inter alia the participatory Park Management Councils,
community leaders/associations, NGOs, andlocallevel agriculture, forestry and fishery extension officers.
IBAPwill alsowork closely with the CoastalPlanningUnit(GPC), to which itsbiodiversity data
management will be outsourced. Duringyear one the project, inpartnership with IUCN, will support the
gradual transfer o fNAPandLagoa de Cufada management responsibilities to IBAPas it becomes fully
operational. A Memoradum o fUnderstanding between the Government andWCN, together with an
intemal ministerial decree, will spell out the commitments o f the various partners to this transfer.

Naturalresource management activities under Component2 willbe ledbytwo differentministries: the
Ministry ofEconomy andFinance for those relatedto the FIAL's community sustainableuse and
development initiatives, andthe Ministryo f Fisheries for the management o fReservedFishingZones.
Responsibility for FIALwill lie with a specialized team attachedto the PMU comprised ofthe FIAL
Executive secretary (focal point), a gradually increasing number o f technical officers, a secretary basedin
Bissau anda team o f community facilitators to be based at the local level. The team will be guided by a
part time intemational technical advisor. The community mobilization andfacilitation activities will be
implementedcollaboratively with other key localplayers including inter alia agriculture, forestry and
fishery extension officers, andlocalNGOs. These activities will be further supported by a contracted
NGOwith expertise inparticipatoryappraisal methodologies. FIALfundswill be allocated to eligible
activities proposed directly by communities, or through NGOs that will serve as facilitators. Financial
management andprocurement for the microprojects will be managed by the FIALteam with support from
the CBMP financial andprocurement Officers.

Project activities inthe reserved fishing zones will be ledby a Fisheries Coordinator (focal point) located
within the administratively andfinancially autonomous Fisheries ResearchInstitute (CIPA) o fthe Ministry
o f Fisheries. The Coordinator will be supported by a full time administrator andan intemational technical
advisor (for the first 18 months), as well as two reserved fishing zone facilitators. Additional technical
assistancewill be provided on a short term basis. Inaddition, while CIPA will coordinate the fisheries
activities, some o fthe activities will be implementedby other departmentso f the Ministryo f Fisheries, such
as surveillance activities by FiscaMar andcommunity mobilization by the artisanal fishingdirectorate. An
intemal ministerial decreewill clearly establish the roles andresponsibilities o f eachplayer in
implementation.

The activities of the EIAunit under Component3 will be managed out o f the Prime Minister's office by a
small team comprised o f the EL4Coordinator (focal point), technical officer andbook keeper, withperiodic
short term support from an internationaladvisor. Specialist reviewersfor EIAs andfor compliance
activities will be hired on a short term contractual basis as needed. The reasonwhy this unitwill not be
locatedunder the Ministryo fEnergy andNaturalResources' environmental directorate is becauseit would
provoke a conflict o f interest. The Ministrycannot bothbe exploiting resourcesandpolicingthe
environmentalandsocial impact o f the exploitation. Again, a Prime Ministerial decreewill detail the
working relationship between the EIA unit andits host, the Prime Minister's Office.

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E)(see Annex 12). The projectmanagement unit will have overall
responsibility for project monitoring and evaluation. The P M Uwill contract independent consultants who,
working incollaboration with the implementing agenciesresponsible for each component, will develop a
detailed monitoring andevaluationplanfor measuring project implementationprogress andimpact. This
planwill clearly specify the key indicatorddataneedsandsources, who will collect the data for each
component as well as for the project as a whole. Participatory monitoring will be used whenever possible,
to create a sense o f ownership andto promote community understanding o fproject objectives. Impact
indicators will be updated andadapted inaccordancewith guidelines for GEF-financedprojects andwill
include biologicaVecologica1 andsocioeconomic parameters.

The PMUwill be directly responsible for monitoring andreporting on implementationprogress, andwill
produce consolidated semi-annual implementationprogress reports, baseduponinputsfrom each o fthe
leadimplementing agency focal points. These reports will serve as the basis o f semi-annual review
meetings. (These are expected to correspond withBank supervision missions).

Withrespectto evaluating project impact, it is recognized that biologicaYecologicalimpacts generally are
measurableover a longer time frame than currently proposed for project implementation. Iti s therefore
intended that the independent consultants contracted by the P M Uwill review IBAP andCIPA's monitoring
anddata collectionplansto ensurethey bothmeet project evaluation needsandlay a strong foundation for
monitoringbiodiversity trends over the long term. Inaddition, the consultants will be responsible for
conducting beginning, mid-andend-term beneficiary assessments, andfor evaluatingandconsolidating
project impactmonitorhg data into beginning, mid-andend-term evaluation reports. These reports will
serve as the basis for mid-term andcompletion reviews.

FinancialManagement and Procurement (see Annex 6). The ProjectManagement Unit (PMU) will take

ImplementationUnit(PSRDP-PIU) by outsourcing there its financial management andprocurement. The
financial andprocurement responsibilities o fthe PSKDP-PIU will therefore include collection andcontrol
o f invoices, management o fthe project's bank accounts, makingpayments, keepingthe books o f accounts,
managingprocurement processes, andpreparation o f the financial andprocurement reports. The PSRDP
has experience andtrained staff in place, which avoids having to duplicate efforts andencounter the
resulting significant delay inproject start-up. Two additional staff, a financial management and
procurement officer will be recruitedby the CBMP and secondedto the PSRDP PIUto absorb the
increasedworkload.

Fundswillbe disbursedfrom two SpecialAccounts (one for IDA Credit andone for the GEF Grant) to the
PMU, as the responsible agency for the project, andwill be administered by the ChiefFinancial Officer
(CFO) o fthe PSRDP team at the central level. Most procurement andcontracting will be conducted by the
PMLT, supported by the PSRDP financial andprocurement staff. Nevertheless, for smaller expenses, each
of the implementing units OBAP, PMU/FIAL,Fisheries, andEM) will have 90-day advance accounts, the
deposits into which willbe basedupon agreedquarterly work plans andbudgets andtimely andaccurate
accounting for expenditures.

The CFO o fthe PSRDP team will be entrustedwith the project's overall financial management and
procurement reporting andwill serve as the principal contact for Bank disbursement. Implementing entities
(at the national andregional levels) will be incharge o f reporting with respect to their activities. To this
end, eachimplementing agency will includeanaccountantladministrator intheir team. Fundmanagement
will follow the same procedures as those adopted for the PSRDP project to avoid having to retrain staff and
minimizethe potentialfor errors.



D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives consideredand reasons for rejection:
Degree of Private Sector involvement: One o fthe central ideas o fthe project as initially conceived in
 1997 was to find new, innovative ways o f givingeconomic value to biodiversity, thus creating lasting
incentives for local communities to conserve the habitats and ecosystems uponwhich this biodiversity
depended. This idea, inspired by growing experience inNepal, the Caribbean, andCuba amongst others,
includedprospecting for biological products (such as medicinalproperties inmangrove tree bark) andtheir
commercializationininternationalmarkets though private sector-community contracts. This type o f
experimental approach that focused upon overcoming the barriers to private sector investment, although not
completely excluded shouldan appropriate highvalue productbe identified, i s considered to involve an
inappropriately highlevelo friskgiven the changednational circumstances. Followinga militarycoup in
 1998, Guinea-Bissau's political stabilityhas diminished, particularly incomparisonwith sub-regional
neighbors. Furthermore, Guinea-Bissau's small size combinedwith growing knowledge o f its biological
resource base increasingly suggeststhat it is unlikely that a commercially valuable species o f interest to
private sector investors would be identifiedlocally that would not also be found ina neighboring country.
For this reason, the project preparation team opted for a more conservative, lower risk strategy, promoting
the introduction andadoption o f less destructive andmore efficient alternatives to current resource use
 exploitation techniques as well as the small-scale experimentation withnew products such as bubacalhau
 (locally processedbarracuda). The chosenapproach will emphasize participatory local initiatives that
 empower localcommunities intheir fight againstpoverty.

InstitutionalArrangements for Protected Area Management: Several options were consideredwith



                                                     -19-

respect to the institutional arrangements for the management o f protected areas. The first, andpossibly the
most conservative, wouldbe to allow IUCN andthe NAP to continue to manage Guinea-Bissau's protected
areas inthe short to medium term, withthe expectation that gradually the state would develop the human
andfinancial capacity to take onboardthese responsibilities inthe future. This option, althoughjustifiable
given the extremely weak capacity o f the Stateto assume these responsibilities as well as the current
institutional instability,runs the risk o f greatly prolonging the existing problem. Inaddition, the current
situationalso undermines national ownership andleavesthe project extremely vulnerable to externally
driven agendas. This is clearly illustratedby the current situation, where, as donor-supported coastal and
biodiversity programs draw to a close, NGO partners are forced to respondto funding priorities other than
environment, consequently puttingGuinea-Bissau's coastal andbiodiversity management efforts at serious
risk.

A secondalternative wouldbeto create a Coordination Council for ProtectedAreas (as foreseeninthe
Protected Areas Framework Law) or a Department o f ProtectedAreas. Such a Council or Department
would be integrated into a specific ministry andwould be directly subject to its hierarchy, operational rules,
regulations, andbudget. This option was also considered to be too vulnerable to current institutional
instabilityas well as raisingserious questionswith respectto financial sustainability (see discussion
below).

A thirdoption identifiedwas the creation ofanadministrativelyandfinancially autonomous institutionsuch
as IBAP, which although linkedto a parent ministry,would have a statute that guaranteedit sufficient
independenceto fulfill its responsibilities ina coherent andconsistent manner. This last option was
consideredto be the most viable. Thejustification for creation o fthe Institute for Biodiversity and
Protected areas (IBAP) was re-examined duringpre-appraisal, andstill found to be the best option for
management the protected areas o f Guinea-Bissau. This conclusionfollowed a UNDP-hded legal study
that examined the underpinnings o fthe creation o f IBAP.It is recognized that the roles andresponsibilities
o fthis institution mustbe clearly articulatedwith regardsto authority to manage protected areas. The
model chosen for IBAP is basedon the successfulNational Institute for Studies andPlanning (INEP),
which has undergone very little changesduring a difficult political environment from 1998 to 2004. The
same aspects o f continuity are expected from the proposed IBAP.

Financial sustainability: As indicatedabove, the issue of financial sustainability for the proposed Institute
(IBAP) was considered to be critical to ensuring sustainablemanagement ofbiodiversity andprotected
areas. One option would be that IBAP be supportedthrough national budget allocations supplemented by
retaining a part o fthe income generatedthrough environmental taxes andfines. This hypothesis was not
considered viable first andforemost since the budget andsources o f income to the State are extremely
limitedandinsufficient to meet all needs. These limitedfunds are therefore generally directed to immediate
priorities, andgovernment budget allocations for other sectors frequently go unrealized, even ifa
commitment hasbeenmade. At this point intime, it is believedthat the best option for ensuring the
sustainability o f IBAP's operations i s to create an independent funding mechanism inthe form o f a
Conservation Trust Fundto finance IBAPactivities for biodiversity conservation andmanagement and
support financing o f administrative expenses.

 Scopeof intervention: The IUCN-runprogram inGuinea-Bissau has attempted to intervene throughout
the coastal zone andacross thematic areas, includingenvironmentaleducation andawarenessraising,
physical planning, andinstitutional support. While this programhas had considerable success, the limited
humanandfinancialresourcesavailable suggestthat alessdispersedandmore focused approachmightbe
better. Following an assessment o f project objectives, available humanandfinancial resources, andgiven
the weak institutional framework, it was proposed that this project focus its activities on priority

biodiversity areas and species, inparticular protectedareas andtheir buffer zones andFishing Reserves;
and on concrete resourcemanagement activities such as local sustainable use initiatives, participatory
resourcemanagementapproaches andbiodiversity monitoring. This said, it i s vital to recognizethat
biodiversity managementdoes not occur inavacuum. The success of these management approacheswill
dependto a largeextentuponthe broadersocialandeconomicdevelopmentpaththe country choosesto
follow. For example, the potential development of offshorepetroleum, andthe managementof industrial
fisheries bothhave serious implications for the effectiveness and sustainability of coastal andmarine
biodiversity conservationefforts. Consequently, the project's scope of intervention hasbeen expandedto
tackle the establishment of environmentaland social safeguardsthat will favor the integration of
environmental(including biodiversity) andsocialconcems withinthe national developmentdecision-making
process.

3. Lessonslearned and reflected in the project design:
The proposed project is designedbasedonthe lessonslearned during the past 13 years. The key lessonis
that existing achievements are the result o f sustainedefforts over an extendedperiodthat have slowly
developed in-country capacity andhave stimulated support from communities. Rather than focus
exclusively on conserving biodiversity inprotected areas, IUCNandother development partners prioritized
a slow but fruitful dialogue with the communities neighboring the protected areas. Through tangible
activities inthe field, such as the Environment House inBubaque, they succeededincreating a widely
acceptednetwork o fprotected areas ina part o f the country knownto be highlyrefractory to central
authority. They have also nurturednumerous nationalNGOs that have now become major stakeholdersin
biodiversity management efforts.

Another lesson learned is the needto address institutional issues, to ensure long-term sustainability anda
more strategic approach. Existinginitiatives have lackedcoordination, leaving gaps and sometimes
creating duplications. BecauseGovernment was often only peripherally involved, biodiversity management
does not feature as much as it should innational development planning,including on-going poverty
reduction efforts. Inthe absence o f a focal point such as IBAF' to promote anddefendbiodiversity
management andprotected areas, commercialinterests such as industrial fisheries andoffshore petroleum
couldcome to dictate the hture o f Guinea-Bissau's coastal zone andeventually cancel current gains.

More generally, the project is also designed from the broad-based experience gained by the Bankand others
working inGuinea-Bissau; on the coastal andbiodiversity-specific experience gained inimplementationo f
the Bank, GEF andIUCNportfolios; andon sustainable conservation financing (specifically trust fund)
experience gained through the international work o f Conservation Finance, the GEF and others. Amongst
the lessons learned, several aspects have been identified as being particularly relevant to Guinea-Bissau:

    0    Governmentcommitment and ownership is extremely important ifcoastal andbiodiversity policy
         decisions are to be taken andsustainedover time. These concems are otherwise likely to bear little
         or no weight innationalor regional decision-making, leaving coastal andbiodiversity management
         efforts extremely vulnerable to interruption or reversal. Ensuringgovernment commitment and
         ownership is therefore a focus o f the project, which aims to shift Government from its current,
         relatively passive role, into an active leadership position. Recent legislativeandinstitutional
         achievements suchas the Framework Law for Protected Areas andthe Declarationo fIntent to
         Create a ProtectedAreas Authority confirmthat a strong commitment i s already inplace. The
         creation o f institutional andregulatory structures andthe establishment o f a sustainable financing
         mechanism will constitute tools that will help the Government keep Guinea Bissauon an
         environmentally andsocially sound development path. Inaddition, the project will support targeted
         awarenessraisingandcapacity buildingactivities.

         The available human and institutional capacity i s another critical determinant o fhow far and
         how fast national biodiversity andenvironmentalprograms can progress. Recognizing
         Guinea-Bissau's extremely weak institutionalcapacity, andthe limitedpool o fhumanresources
         available, the project design was based on a carell evaluationo f capacity constraints. Care has
         beentaken not to be excessively optimistic. Priorities have been established, activities focused,
         institutional arrangementsdesigned andtargets realistically set so as to avoid overwhelming
         existing capacity. Inaddition, the project design has taken a proactive approach to meeting
         capacity buildingneedsthrough provision o f on-the-job as well as targeted capacity building
         activities. It is nonethelessrecognized that capacity buildingis a long-term process andthat inthe
         short- to medium-term, national capacity will needto be supplementedby extemal assistance.


                                                      - 23 -

        Bearing inmindthe trade-off between long-term andshort-term technical assistance, particularly
        with regardto sustainability, the project design will attempt to keep long-term technical assistance
        commitments to critical areas only.

    0   EnsuringfiPraaciuZsustuiaubiZity,especially stable recurrent cost financing for protected areas and
        endangeredthreatened species managementandmonitoring initiatives, is another important
        parameter ifconservation efforts are to have a lasting impact. Inlight o f Guinea-Bissau's extreme
        budgetary constraints andthe potential sources o f economic growth, further reinforcedby a review
        o f GEF andothers' sustainablefinancing experience, it i s believed that establishment o f a
        conservation trust fundpresentsthe best option for securing this financial sustainability. Thus,
        particular emphasisduringimplementationwill be oncatalyzing private sector anddonor
        participationinthe establishment o f a biodiversity andprotected areas conservation trust fund that
        is able to sustain conservation efforts over the longterm: Design o f this fund will take the lessons
        learned from GEF andnon-GEF funds into account indeveloping the internal andexternal
        structures necessaryto establish a viable institution.

4. Indications of borrower and recipient commitment andownership:
Govemment commitment to the objectives andkey strategic features o f the project has been spelled out ina
Policy Letter, approved on March 18,2004.

National commitment to addressing coastal zone issues, including those o fbiodiversity, is strong and
long-term. As mentionedearlier, a national program for conservation andsustainable use o f coastal zone
resourceswas launched in 1988, informal partnership with IUCNandwith the support o f the donor
community. Coastal planningactivities have been complemented by a broader rollingprogram o f
environmental andnaturalresource initiatives, which together encompassthe establishment o f institutions,
policy development, legislativereform, scientific studies, physical planning, the creation o f protected areas,
local-level resourcemanagement, capacity buildingandenvironmental education.

More formally, Guinea-Bissau has signed andratifiedseveralregional andinternationalconventions,
further highlightingtheir commitment to biodiversity andenvironmental management concerns. These
include: the Convention on Biodiversity (27 October 1995), the RamsarConvention (14 May 1990),
CITES (16 May 1990), andthe BonnConvention on(1 September 1995).

The Government approached the World Bank in 1997 andrequestedassistanceinaccessingGEF resources
to contribute to conservation andmanagement o fimportant coastal andmarine biodiversity. The initial
project concept was developed basedon a highlyparticipatorynational level workshop andextensive
community level consultations, andwas designed to complement ongoing activities. A PDF B requestwas
submitted to GEF andapproved in 1998. However, preparation launchwas delayed untilearly 2000 due to
a militarycoup and subsequentpoliticalunrest. Nonetheless, national stakeholders attempted to keep local
level activities under implementation duringthe transitionperiod following the coup, despite the virtual
absence o f any donor support. Projectpreparation was launched inMarch2000 andwas timed to coincide
with aworkshop to review the progress made duringthe previous 12years o fcoastal planning.

There is highownership o fthe proposed project by concerned stakeholders. The Government put inplace a
Steering Committeeto oversee the preparation o fthe project, anda Consultative Council to ensure
broad-basedstakeholder discussion andfeedback. The Steering Committee includes representatives from
interestedministries and from the NGO community. Boththe Steering Committee andthe Consultative
Council have met regularly since December 2000, anddespite patches o f further civil unrest anddelays in


                                                      - 24 -

securing technical assistance, project preparation has advanced steadily. A national workshop was heldin
November 2001 to finalize the project's design on the basis o f studies conducted by national consultants
andfunded through the PDF B grant.

The Government, aided by IUCN, has actively sought interimfinancing to maintainthe momentum o f its
ongoing activities, while inparallel holding a series o fparticipatory workshops to re-evaluate andadapt the
original project concept andcommissioning studies on key themes. There have beenregular consultations
between the Steering Committee andthe teamsresponsible for the recently finalized National
Environmental Action PlanandNational Biodiversity Strategy andAction Plan,both o fwhich were
adopted inFebruary 2004. Guinea-Bissau's commitment to conservation and sustainableuse o f coastal
resourceswas reaffirmed during the Bubaque+lO meeting inMarch 2001, to review progress made over
the past 10years. The meeting included a Gift to the Earthceremony for the Jo50 Vieira e P o i l b National
Park that reaffirmedthe country's commitment to the conservation o fbiodiversity o f global importance.

5. Value added of Bank and Global support inthis project:
The project fits solidly within the GEF Operational Programon Coastal and MarineEcosystems, a priority
areafor the first, secondandthirdConference o f the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity.
The Bank, as a GEF implementing agency, can therefore bringincremental grant resourcesto assist
Guinea-Bissau intackling coastal andmarine biodiversity issues o f global environmental concern. This
will include ecosystemprotectionas well as increasing capacity for sustainingthis protectionover time.
Without these incremental resourcesmany o fthe proposedproject activities would likely go unfundedin
the face o fthe numerous competingdemands on the country's extremely limitedbudgetary resources and
the current financially constrained donor environment.

The Bank can also add value throughproviding technical assistancefor designing andimplementing coastal
and biodiversity projects that draw on its worldwide experience. The Bank has considerable experience to
offer ininstitution andcapacity building, be it for coastal management or environmental and social
protectionmechanisms, andits environmental safeguardsare recognized as setting intemational standards.
Inaddition, the Bankhasrecognizedthe value oftrusts as aninstrument forprovidinglong-term support to
biodiversity conservation andhasbeen a leader insupporting their establishment inAfrica andelsewhere.
Through this, the Bankhas gained experience that will enable it to provide valuable technical support for
preparingandimplementing a trust, as well as supervision capacity. The Bank`s increasing experience in
facilitating programmaticmulti-donor approaches leaves itwell placedto leverage additional funds from
other donors andthe private sector.

2. Financial(see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR= % (see Annex 4)
National budgetary implications: Recognizing the current extreme limitations on nationalbudget andthe
numerous competing demands, as well as the fact that this situation is likely to continue for the foreseeable
future, project design has focused on keeping the budgetaryimpact on Government to a minimumbothfor
the duration o fproject implementation andbeyond. With the exception o fthe runningcosts associated
with fisheries surveillance activities, which are expectedto be able to pay for themselves soon after their
start-up, anda limitedcost of core IBAPparastatal staff, Government contributions duringthe 5-year
implementationphasewill take the form o f in-kindcontributions such as provision o f office space and
participation o f staff inimplementing activities. Over the longer term, the project will catalyze the
establishment o f a mechanism, inthe form o f a conservation trust fund, to ensure an independent and
sustainable source o f financing for its biodiversity conservation and protected areamanagement activities
andrecurrent costs.

Community micro-projects: The exact nature o f activities to be funded under FIALwill be determined
through participatory processesduring implementation, andmay take many forms (e.g. conservation
activities, improved artisanal fishing, sustainable extraction o fnon-timber forest products, community
environmental centers). Evaluation o f income-generating micro-project proposals will include a
case-by-case financial analysis that demonstratesthe financial viability and sustainability o fthe activity,
andestimatesthe changes infamilyhousehold incomes that maybe expected.

Other financial issues: To ensure sound financial management aspects o f the project, it has been agreed
that the project implementationunit o f the on-going Private Sector Rehabilitation andDevelopment Project
will undertake the financial management of the CBM Project. A successful assessment was conducted to
determine whether the implementing unit for the fiduciary aspects o f the Private Sector Rehabilitation and
Development Project (PSRDP) had acceptable financial management arrangements as required by the
Bank's policies, including entities' systemofaccounting, reporting, auditing andintemal controls. To assist
the PSRDP with the implementation o f the additional workload associated with the CBMP, a financial
officer and a procurement officer will be recruited. Further, the computerized accounting system will be
updated and a project-specific administrative, financial and accounting manual prepared prior to
effectiveness.

Fiscal Impact:

N.A.

3. Technical:
The innovative approachesbeing proposed by the project are ambitious, but seemto be appropriate under
the country's circumstances, particularly inthe context o f extremely weak government capacity, the limited
pool o f experienced and skilled people andthe lack o f sound information.

Wherever possible, the project has sought to buildupon previous successes (e.g., IBAP builds on and
expandsthe functions o fthe existing NAP andGPC, the endowment fund design will incorporate
experience gained from similar funds inother sectors, biodiversity andprotected areamanagement
activities will further strengthen the on-going decentralized participatoryplanning andmanagement
processes, FIAL and its local-level dynamizationprocessesare basedon I U C " s micro-project experience,
andthe fisheries interventions buildonIUCNandCIPA experiences).

Nevertheless, implementationo fthe project will involve a fairly highlevel o f expert technical assistance.


                                                      - 26 -

Specializedtechnical advisors will be contracted to provide regular guidance andtechnical quality
assurance to the implementing agencies andteams, particularly inthe areas o f project implementation
(administration, financial management), creation andmanagement o f a conservation trust fund,
environmental impact assessmentprocesses, social assessmentandparticipation, andbiodiversity
conservation, management andmonitoring.

Capacity buildingi s emphasizedthroughout project design, with on-the-job training by technical advisors
and specific consultancies, targetedtraining, andexchange o flessonslearned through study tours and
meetings. Fulltime technical assistance will be keptto a minimum, with punctualvisits by an advisor over
the longterm favored wherever possible.

4. Institutional:
The detailed institutional, financial andmonitoring and evaluation arrangementshave beenexamined
duringappraisal (See Section C.4 for presentation ofimplementationarrangements.)
4.1 Executing agencies:
The experience andcapacity among the Government implementing agencies at all levels is weak, as is that
of many o f its NGO partners. Inaddition to these implementing agencies, the project seeks to put inplace
new institutionalstructures, specifically IBAP (linked to the Ministryo f Agriculture andRural
Development), a conservation trust fund(with independent Board andadministration) andan EL4Unit
(reporting to the Prime Minister).

The project will include a significant internationaltechnical assistancecapacity to support the
implementationo fthe refinedmandatesandorganizational structures o f implementing agencies.The
project will meet necessary infi-astructure, equipment, andoperating costs so as to provide these agencies
with the meansto implement the project.

Strengthening humanresource capacity i s a long-term process. As indicated above, the project will provide
targeted trainingopportunities as well as on-the-job training. Itwill also support legal andother
consultancies to help inthe design andestablishment o f the new institutional structures, as well as technical
advisors (fullandpart time) to provide guidance and assistanceto implementing agencies.

Skill transfer will be a key element o fthe technical advisors' terms ofreference, thus commencing the
process o fbuildingcapacity for implementationo fthe project beyondthis 5-year project. Periodic inputs
from these advisors will be favored over long-term residential support.
4.2 Project management:
The Ministryo fEconomy andFinance, with administrative support providedby IUCN, hasbeenmanaging
the GEF PDF B preparation grant andthe IDAproject preparation advance andtherefore has gained
experience with Bank financial management requirements andprocurement andconsultant contract
guidelines. It has also beenchairing the multi-institutional Steering Committee, facilitating broader
stakeholder consultations, andmanaging preparation consultancies. The Ministryo f Economics and
Finance is expected to continue to play these administrative andcoordinationroles duringproject
implementation. A strong PMUwill be established, with the NationalCoordinator supported by a full-time
ChiefTechnical Advisor. Each component will have an internationaltechnical advisor inthe start-up phase
(1?4to 2 years, andthen periodic support). This will ensurethat the foundation for the project i s
establishedfrom the outset.
4.3 Procurement issues:

Procurement will be outsourced to the World Bankfinanced Private Sector RehabilitationandDevelopment
Project (PSRDP) andtherehy take advantage of existing capacity, andsystemsandprocedures. An        -
additional procurement specialist will be recruitedunder the CBMP to reinforce the PSRDP's capacity for
managing the extra workload. Procurement of goods works and services will be done inaccordancewith
World Bank procedures.


4.4 Financial management issues:
Financial management will also be outsourced to the World Bank financed Private Sector Rehabilitation
andDevelopmentProject (PSRDP) and, similar to procurement, anadditional financial officer will be
recruitedunder the CBMP to absorbthe extra workload. The existing PSDRP financial management
system will be adaptedto meet project needsandan adaptedfinancial procedures manualwill be prepared
prior to effectiveness.

consultation anddisclosure) and the significant issuesandtheir treatment emerging from this analysis.
The overarching objective o f the project i s to strengthen Guinea-Bissau's management o f coastal
biodiversity for bothconservation andsustainabledevelopment ends, with an emphasis on local
communities. As such, the project seeks to maintainor improve environmental quality, particularly with
regardto ecosystemhealthanditsrelatedbiodiversity of global significance. A detailed Environmentaland
Social Impact Assessment @SA) has beenprepared. An Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) hasbeen prepared and its conclusions integrated into the design o f activities.

of consultation that were used andwhich groups were consulted?
For the environmentalandsocial screening andthe elaboration o fthe EA, a team comprised o f a social
specialist andenvironmentalspecialist supported by an intemtionalexpert touredthe project zone and
conductedmeetings withthe target populations. The team also met with all key institutions related to the
implementationofthe project. The final EA andESMF were discussedpublicly by a cadre o f experts, and
amendedthereafter. Finally, the target population inthe project zone hasbeeninformedvia community and
regional radio stations about the project andpossible environmental andsocial impacts. The professionals
inthe capitalcity were further reachedthroughatwo-page public disclosure inthe nationalnewspaper.

5.5 What mechanisms have been establishedto monitor and evaluatethe impact o f the project on the
environment? D o the indicators reflect the objectives andresults ofthe EMP?
Project impact onthe environment willbe monitored duringimplementation usingindicators that reflect the
objectives andresults o fthe project.


6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, andspecify the project's social
development outcomes.

Two social issues are o f importance duringimplementationo f this project. The first is participation o f
people indecisions related to restricted accessto natural resources, following the implementationo f
management plansinthe protected areas. Inorder to facilitate participatorynatural resource management,
a Process Frameworkhas been developed duringthe course o fproject preparation as a guide for how
people will be involved indecision-making relatedto changesto regimes ofnaturalresourcesuse. The
secondissuei s to understand the social underpinnings of incentives for people's behavior intheir practices
o fnatural resourceuse. The project will address this issue indetail by including community-specific
stakeholder identificationandanalysis as part of the FIALmicroproject identificationprocess, andby
conducting thorough social assessmentso f the reserved fishing zones, inorder to guide the project staff
who will be working with the target populations.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating inthe project?
All aspects o fthe project design have beendiscussedandapprovedby amulti-institutional Steering
Committee. At the local level, Park Management Committees have inthe past beenpart o f the development
o f current managementplans, andwill continue to be the central forum for the continuationofprotected
areamanagement activities being implementedby the project under the auspices of IBAP.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaborationwithNGOsor other civil society
organizations?
The community development, protected areamanagement, andreservedfishingzone activities o fthe project
cannot be designed or implemented without constant dialogue withconcerned stakeholders. NGOs, local
community/resource user associations, andtraditional leaderswill all be directly involvedinproject
implementation.
6.4 What institutional arrangementshave beenprovided to ensurethe project achieves its social
development outcomes?

Beneficiary assessmentswill be conducted at beginning, mid- and end-term o f the project. A longterm Chief
TechnicalAdvisor with expertise insocial development andparticipationwillbe includedfor the duration o f the
project, as well as a social participationexpert full-time for the first 18 months andpart-time thereafter.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance interms of social development outcomes?

Social development outcomes are embedded inthe indicators for improvedmanagement o fprotected areas
andreserved fishingzones. Details o fthis methodology are given inthe document "ReportingProgress at
Protected Area Sites:A simple site-level tracking tool developedfor the World Bank and W F ,I' which is
used as the backbone o f a system for tracking performance inthe management o fnatural resources.

7. Safeguard Policies:




7.2 Describe provisions made by the project to ensurecompliance with applicable safeguardpolicies.

A Social andEnvironment Management Framework (ESMF) hasbeenprepared andwill be implemented
by the client as anintegralparto fthe project.

A ProcessFramework (PF) hasbeenprepared anddisclosed, andwill beusedto determine howpeople
affected by a restriction o f access to naturalresourceswill be consulted. A portion o f the micro-finance
mechanism (FIAL)will be dedicatedto compensatethose people who have been affected.

A Resettlement Policy Framework hasbeenpreparedanddisclosed. The Bankhas receiveda letter from
the Government confinningthat no involuntary resettlement is expected under this Project. Should that
take place, however, the Project includes the appropriate instruments to mitigate and monitor instanceso f
involuntary resettlement, throughthe Resettlement Policy Framework.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Sustainability is a central theme of the project which, buildinguponthe achievements o f the past 13 years,
aims to turn a corner in Guinea-Bissau's approach to management o f the coastal zone. To this point,
Guinea-Bissau's environmentalandcoastal zone program hasbeen heavily reliant uponproject-linked,
external technical and financial support. As ongoing donor programs draw to a close andfuture sources o f
external financing become increasingly rare and unpredictable, the introduction o fmechanisms to secure
institutional andfinancial sustainability represents a crucial andtimely step towards ensuring the long term
sustainability ofthe country's coastal andbiodiversity management efforts.

Thus the project, through creationo fIBAP andthe aim ofcatalyzingthe establishment ofa private
Foundation, seeks to provide a sustainable institutional andfinancial framework for coastal andmarine
biodiversity management, while keepingthe burdenon Government to a minimum. Sustainability o f IBAP
activities will dependupon securing: i)sufficient capital for the Foundationto meet IBAP's minimum
operational andwork program needs; ii)an appropriate governance structure with satisfactory management
guidelines; iii)a sound framework governing IBAP'srelationshipwith its parent ministry; andiv)
commitment o fbeneficiaries andother stakeholders to participateinthe conservation activities under the
project.

Inorder to promotesustainabilityofthe RFZsandother fisheries management andMCS activities, the


                                                     - 30 -

project will assist the Government with planningfor recurrent costs for all project-financed activities. The
increased public revenue streams that will accrue as a result o f strengthenedmanagement andMCS will
directly contribute to the sustainability o fthese activities. Furthermore, the project will buildthe capacity
at the local level for the co-managemento f RFZs, so that local stakeholderswill be empowered to
implement managementmeasures.

Furthermore, recognizingthat coastal andmarine biodiversity concems cannot be addressedinisolation,
andwillbe affected bybroader environmental andnaturalresourcemanagementdecisions inandoutside
the coastal zone, the project also seeks to establish a broader legal andinstitutional framework. This
framework will be establishedprimarilyinthe form o f environmental assessmentregulations and
harmonizationo f legislation, to ensure thejudicious management o f environmental andsocial factors and
thus promote adoption o fa sustainableeconomic development path.

Project design also emphasizes humanresource capacity building, another key aspect to the sustainability
o fproject objectives. As humanresource capacity buildingis a long termprocess, the project will
contribute to attainingthis goal by: i)supporting specific, targeted training activities; ii)promoting
on-the-job training and skill building; andiii)empowering local communities; particularly vulnerable
groups such as women, andiv) increasing stakeholder capacity tojointly plan, manage andmonitor
biodiversity conservation andsustainableuse o fthe coastal zone, andenvironmental impact assessment
processesmore broadly.

At the locallevel, the project seeksto test and develop altemative livelihoodstrategiesthat will promote
sustainable use o fthe localresource base. Through FIAL, the project will provide matching grants to
communities to support social goods andaltemative livelihoods to extractive practices, to ensurethe
sustainability o fproject activities inprotected areas.

la. Replicability:
Replicability andcross-fertilization are central themes underpinningproject design. The project itselfaims
to replicate andreinforce earlier efforts to promote protected areaco-management andcommunity-based
naturalresource management andsustainableuse efforts, seeking to expand the geographic scope andbuild
uponthese approaches. Further, the establishment o f IBAP to oversee andcoordinate the management o f
Guinea-Bissau's network o fprotected areas will directly promote exchange andadoption o f successful
approaches developed withinthe context o fthis project or that o fthe related projects being financed by
FIBA, PRCM, ASDI andothers.

More specifically, with respect to:

(i)  Protected areas replicability. The project will consolidate severalpilot efforts on co-management o f
protected areas, to scale upby year three to include a fifthprotected area. These co-management
approaches are intendedto be further replicatedthroughout the region. Preliminary discussions have
already been heldwith IUCN concerning establishing a conservation corridor andpossibly a transfrontier
park onthe GuineaandGuinea-Bissau border that protects critical habitats. Financialresourcesthrough
IBAP will facilitate this scaling up.

(ii) andMCSreplicability. TheRFZapproachbeingappliedundertheprojectisareplicationand
     RFZ
adaptation o f a pilot inBuba. Replicationo f MCS activities andand expansion o fthe MCS station system
i s expected as the public revenue stream from fisheries increases. Further, the re-launch o fthe dialogue on
a national fisheries strategy andthe participation inregional fisheries activities will provide the opportunity
for scaling up successful RFZ management. Budgetary provisions havebeen made within the CBMP to


                                                       - 31 -

coordinate donor investments infisheries management.

(iii)FIALreplicability. TheparticipatoryapproachestobedevelopedandappliedthroughtheFIALbuild
upon the experience gained by KJCNandits partners over the past decade or so o f working with
communities on natural resourcemanagementconcerns. Through FIALthese experienceswill be
synthesized anda framework andstructure for continued community development through micro-projects
developed. These approacheswill be sharedwith other development partners, andbe disseminated though
fora such as the project's Donor Committee andthe PRCM, thus encouraging take up andreplication o f the
successfulmodels.

Finally, opportunities for wider dissemination o f lessons learned andreplication o f successful approaches
throughout the region also exist through Guinea-Bissau's participation inregional fora such as the
Regional Programfor Coastal Management (PRCM) andthe Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission.

                 GUINEA-BISSAU:Coastal and Biodiversity Management Project

By Component:

ProjectComponent 1 ProtectedAreas and ThreatenedSpecies Management US$3.73 million   -
This component will create a financially and administratively autonomous Institute for Biodiversity and
Protected Areas (IBAP) whichwill managefive protected areas ina participatorymanner andwill
implement actionplans for at leastthree threatenedspecies. IBAP will be mandated by the Government to
implement nationalpolicies andstrategiesfor biodiversity conservation andprotected areas management.
Its long-term financial sustainability will be assuredwith the creation o f a Conservation Foundationunder
Component 11.


The creation o fIBAP requires both legaland capacity buildingactivities. Projectpreparation finds have
supported the definition o f IBAP's mandate andits legal establishment. These activities included an audit
of institutional responsibilities v i s - h i s biodiversity conservation, the definition o f absolute attributes for
IBAP andthe other implicated institutions, the design o fIBAP's institutional andgovernance structures
andthe preparation ofits legal statutes. Itis expectedthat IBAP will be formally createdprior to project
effectiveness.

The project itselfwill provide IBAP with the necessaryoperating framework throughthe amendment o fthe
ProtectedAreas Framework Law andother existing legislationto reflect IBAP's roles andresponsibilities.
Itwill also establish IBAP'sBoard, develop internaladministrative andfinancial operating procedures,
secure a buildingto house IBAP headquarters, equip both IBAPheadquarters andprotected areas, recruit
its staff, andcover trainingand operating costs.

Project financing will further support implementationo f IBAP's mandate, enabling the gradual integration
o f existing protected area management projects into a coordinated program o f activities to be overseenby
IBAP. Reinforcingthe decentralizedparticipatory approach to protected areas management specified inthe
Protected Areas Framework Law, project activities will be overseenby IBAP andimplemented in
partnership withlocal government officials, the communities, the private sector andinternational, national
andlocalNGOs.Priorto the full implementationofIBAP, protected areamanagement activities will
continue to be overseen andimplementedby partnerswith on-going projects. These partnersinclude
IUCN's ProtectedAreas Nucleus (NAP) for the management o fprotected areas, andthe Coastal Planning
Unit(GPC) formapping, biodiversity studiesandmonitoring. Duringthe transitionphase, IUCNwill
provide advice to the future Director o f IBAP (to be hiredat project start-up to oversee establishment o f
IBAP),thus familiarizing the Director with existingprotected areamanagement activities. National
capacity for protectedareas and species management will concentrate on institutional strengthening andon
the management o f four existing protected areas, the Biosphere Reserve andthe proposed Cantanhez
protected area. Inaddition, investments will be made for conservation o f threatened fauna, for example the
five species ofmarine turtles, chimpanzees, Colobus monkeys, manatees, and sea-going hippopotamus, as
well as for the monitoring o f key habitats such as mangroves andprimary forests. Fundsunder the project
will also cover the costs o fa Technical Advisor (fulltime for the first two years andparttime for the rest
o f the project), biodiversity awareness activities andcapacity buildingfor implementation o f international
conventions (Biodiversity, Bonn, Ramsar, CITES), andregional coordination activities.

Component 2 promotes sustainableuse o fbiological resourcesat the local level andincludes two groups o f
activities: (i)the establishment o f a fundingmechanism (FIAL) for sustainableuse activities inside and
outside o fthe protected areas, and (ii) buildingto strengthenthe management andthe monitoring,
                                         capacity
control and surveillance o freservedfishingzones andfisheries.


Fundo deIniciativesAmbientaisLocais
The implementationo f this component will be staged. Duringstage Ithe project will establish a fund
managed by the project managementunit Fundfor Local EnvironmentalInitiatives VIAL)-to support
                                            -
community-driven conservation and development micro-projects andthe affiliatedparticipatoryprocesses
for micro-project identification andimplementation(including sustainable co-managemento fthree reserved
fishingzones). Duringstage I1the project will play a catalytic role inestablishing a private Conservation
Foundationwith a view to securing the longterm, sustainablefinancing o f (i)       the community-driven
conservation anddevelopment micro-project, and(ii)        IBAP andprotected area andbiodiversity
management.

The Fundfor LocalEnvironmental Initiatives(FIAL),buildingon 10years o fcommunity development
experiences o fIUCN, will initially provide matching grants o f upto US$10,000 per community insupport
o f specific, community-based micro-projects that canbe linkedto project objectives. Totalgrant value i s
likely to be modifiedover time as experiencewithFIAL is gained. Grants will be complemented by local
levelcontributions o f at least 15 percent, incash or kind. FIAL activities will be concentrated on
communities located inor aroundprotected areas andreserved fishing zones. Prioritywillbe given to
activities which also help reduce poverty andempower poorer communities. Based on prior national
experience as well as conservation andpoverty reduction criteria, key themes for intervention are expected
to include food security, artisanal fishing, palmexploitation, andrenewable energy. Proposals for FIAL
financing will be expected to meet a set o f eligibility criteria, including: compatibility with management
objectives o f the protected area, technical feasibility, cost effectiveness, ecological, economic andsocial
andenvironmental safeguardsandsustainability, anddemonstratedcommunity commitment and
management capacity. While the eligibility criteria anddetailed operational guidelines willbe finalized in
the Operational Manualduringthe project start upphase, it is intendedthat specific interventions will be
identified andprioritized throughparticipatory processesinvolving the communities andresource users
themselves, andform part o fthe community's Environmental Action Plan (CEAP). The CEAP preparation
process will be facilitatedby a trained local non-govemmental organization inconjunction withlocal level
FIALfacilitators, park staff, andother localgovernment representatives. Once CEAP priorities are
identified, a detailed micro-project proposal will be prepared by the community or designatedcommunity
group with assistancefrom local facilitators. The proposalwill be submittedinitially to the Park Finance
Committee, a sub-committee of the Park Management Committee, for a preliminary environmental and
social screening, with particular emphasis on overall eligibility andthe fit withthe park management
objectives andpriorities. Eligibleproposals will then be passedto FIAL's Permanent Technical Secretariat
inBissaufor a detailed feasibility assessment(both desk andfield) priorto beingsubmitted to the FIAL
Board for final approval. Capacity buildingandimplementation support will be provided to beneficiary
communities andcommunity groups by localfacilitators and, where appropriate, by contracted technical
experts.

Inaddition to matchinggrants, the FIALfinancingmechanismwill delivercompensationto individuals and
groups whose resource access is deemedto be reducedunder the World Bank's Involuntary Settlement
Safeguard Policy (OP/BP 4.12). Compensation will be a granted at 100percent. A Process Framework

governing identification o f affected parties, determination o f compensation levels, andgrievanceprocedures
has beenprepared andwas confirmed as satisfactory during appraisal.

To achieve the above, the component will finance boththe establishment andoperating costs o fFIAL,
administrative structures andthose o f the local-level facilitation processesrelated to the micro-project
cycle. Specifically, it will support preparation o fFIAL's legal statutesandpolicy documents, finalization
o f internal administrative andfinancial operating proceduresmanual,recruitment o f FIALheadquarters
andfield staff, equipment for headquartersandthe field, provisiono fnecessarytraining andoperating
costs, including operation o fmulti-stakeholder financial andtechnical committees for the evaluation and
approvalo f community micro-project proposals, andmonitoring andevaluation o f FIALitself. The
component will also cover the costs o f outreach activities by facilitators (FIAL staff, localgovernment
representatives,NGOs andpark staff, andcommunity association leaders), including awarenessraising and
extension services (pamphlets, radio broadcasts, meetings, pilot activity demonstrations, dissemination of
lessonslearned, study tours, etc.). Itwill provide technical support to interested communities andresource
user associations, including participatory diagnosis and CEAP preparation, andassistancein
preparatiodimplementationofmicro-projects. Investments willbe made incapacity buildingfor
facilitators, park staff, local government andNGOrepresentatives, andthe communities themselves in
areas such as participatory diagnosis, project preparation andimplementation, organization management,
micro-enterprise development, andmonitoring & evaluation.

To secure sustainablefinancing o fboth community development activities andthe biodiversity and
protected areamanagement activities (under Component I) the long term, it i s anticipated that over
                                                                 over
time FIAL will evolve into a private foundation: the Foundationfor Biodiversity of Guinea-Bissau         -
FBGB. Once establishedthe Foundationwill work incollaboration withimplementationpartners rather
thanbuildingimplementationcapacity withinitself. This Foundationis expectedto have at least two
financing windows, one for the community-based activities under FIAL, the other for management o f
protected areas andbiodiversity by IBAP andits partners. Once the FIAL financing mechanism is deemed
to be operating effectively the project will finance the migration of FIAL into the Foundation, provided a
privatepartycan be identified to establish the foundation. Triggers for this migration will include mastery
o fmicro-project cycle management, andfinancial management andprocurement practices which meet Bank
quality standards.Activities to be financedinclude the Foundation's structural design, preparation o f legal
statutes andpolicy documents, information dissemination, public meetings andpreparation o fthe
administrative andfinancial procedures manual. Project funds will also cover start up andoperating costs
such as recruitment o f additional Boardmembers (ifnecessary), Foundationstaff, training, equipment and
recurrent operating costs. The Foundationwill operate as a sinking fund duringthe lifetime o fthe project.
However, to secure long-term funding beyondproject duration, it i s envisagedthat the Foundationwill be
transformed into an endowment fund. This transformation will be triggered by a set o fbenchmarks
(following guidelines for GEF supported trust funds andexperience from other countries, inparticular
Brazil),once sufficient donor capitalhasbeensecuredas aresult ofafundraising strategy. To facilitate
this transformation, technical assistance andcapacity buildingspecifically inthe areas o f fundraising and
negotiations will be provided. It is currently anticipated that benchmarks shouldbe met at the end o fthe
f i s t project phase (five years), and that materializationo f the endowment fund would take place with the
commencement o f the secondphaseproject.

Capacity Buildingfor Management, Monitoring, Control and Surveillance of Reserved Fishing Zones
and Fisheries


Management of Reserved FishingZones (RFZs). Many coastal areas are sensitive breeding andnursery

grounds that underpinthe fisheries ecosystemas a whole. The project will develop andtest a new practice
for managingfisheries inReservedFishingZones (RFZs), which are fishing zones located inthe central
part o fmarine protected areas that are governed by special regulations approvedby local communities.
The project will support strengthenedmanagementandcapacity buildingwithin two RFZsinthe coastal
waters o f Guinea-Bissau, Orango andJoao Vieira, which are areas o fboth local economic importance and
global biodiversity significance. Inthese areas, enforcement o fmanagementregulations and surveillance
will be designedandimplemented with local stakeholders, inpartnership withthe extension serviceofthe
government's agency for fisheries. Specific activities will include: (i) options plans for Reserved
                                                                         creating
FishingZones inOrango andJoao Vieira, by supporting social assessmentsandparticipatoryresource
assessmentso fthe stakeholders, habitats, resourceuses andmanagement options for the RFZs; (ii)      building
capacity for RFZmanagement, by recruitingfacilitators to work with the localcommunities and
stakeholders inOrango andJoao Vieira to empower them as partners for the management o fthe RFZs; (iii)
strengthening/promoting RFZs inOrango andJoao Vieira, by supporting the RFZ facilitators to continue
workshops andconsultations withthe stakeholdersfor eachRFZ (inorder to assist them to examine the
resource uses, provide options for management, establish multi-stakeholder RFZ management committees
anddraft RFZmanagementplansthat canbe legallyrecognized), andby supporting the wide socialization
andawareness-raisingfor the management ofthe RFZs(including the production anddistribution ofupto
5,000 leaflets ina locally appropriate format inorder to explain the rules ofthe RFZmanagementplans, as
well as radio broadcasts); (iv) implementing andsocializing RFZs inOrango andJoao Vieira, by
supporting the facilitators to widely socialize the plansand rules o fthe RFZswith stakeholders, andalso
engaging interested fishers to be RFZWatchers, utilizing radios, binoculars, etc. provided by the project in
order to report to authorities any illegal fishingactivities; and(v) demarcating RFZs, by supporting the
demarcation o fthe RFZswith marker buoys andprovidingmaps to Guinea-Bissau fishers, including
industrial fishinglicense holders andartisanal fishers.

Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) of Reserved FishingZones and Fisheries. As mentioned
previously, the project will strengthen the monitoring, control andsurveillance (MCS) capabilities o fthe
Government of Guinea-Bissau, inorder to support the management o fthe RFZs andthe fisheries that
impact uponthese areas. Individualactivities andbudget lines can be categorized undereither
`Monitoring' activities, `Control' activities and `Surveillance' activities.

Monitoringactivities will focus on establishing a Fisheries MonitoringCenter at CIPA, as the command
center for a satellite-based vessel monitoringsystem (VMS). Inbrief, a V M S is based onanautomatic
vessel locator or transceiver (`blue box') being installedonboard every licensed industrialfishing vessel (as
well as fishingsupport vessels, etc.), which uses the global positioning system (GPS) to automatically
report its position to a Fisheries MonitoringCenter (FMC). Positions reportedto the FMC from each
vessel's `blue box' have a unique identity. The positions are receivedby the FMC andstored ina database
(any mainstream relational database), andcan then be visualized against an electronic maritimechart
backdrop on computers inthe FMC, usingcustomized V M S software. The FMC inCIPA would be linked
to the surveillance stations andpatrols of FiscaMar. More specifically, the project will support the
following fisheries monitoringactivities that will support the management o fthe RFZs: (i)   establishing a
Fisheries Monitoring Center at CIPA for a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), by supporting the
Government to contract a private firm to work with CIPA for 6 months to establish a Fisheries Monitoring
Center (FMC) at CIPA, includinghaving the firmpurchase andinstall the hardware (satellite receiver,
computers, radio, etc.) needed, as well as customize andprovide the software andtraining to CIPA staff;
and(ii)  coordinatingRFZs, fisheries monitoring, control andsurveillance activities andoperation o fthe
FMC, by supporting an international fisheries expert to help advise andcoordinate the fisheries activities
for the first one and a half years of the project, as well as a Fisheries Coordinator andtechnical specialists
andsupport staff inCIPA.

  The Control Activities will require a significant commitment from the government. Inorder to implement
  the various monitoring, control and survaillance activities (including the vessel monitoring system), the
  project will support a consensus-building processto create a new industrial fisheries management plan
  which sets limits on the resourcesthat can be harvested, andguidelines for the allocationo f these resources
  through licensing. This industrial fisheries managementplanwill restructure the current industrial fishing
  licensing system, andserve as the basis for the vessel monitoring system. The specific control activities the
  project will support include: (i) re-launching the national dialogue onthe fisheries sector, basedon the 2003
  World Bank-Supported Fisheries Sector Strategy Note, by supporting national workshops with
  stakeholders anddonors at the beginning o f implementationinorder to discuss the Fisheries Sector Strategy
  Note andmake recommendations for actions to address the sector inparallel with this project; (ii)       providing
  technical assistancefor fisheries control, by supporting a rough stock assessment o f the coastal demersal
  andother highvalue species ofthe industrialfisheries, andalso supporting a consultant to work withthe
  Ministry o fFisheries to help conduct severalcritical fisheries control activities, including drafting anew
  IndustrialFisheries Management Plan, creating andimplementing a policy for a satellite V M S for the
  industrial fisheries andproviding the technical assistanceandthe office equipment for the Government to
  create a new National FishingVessel Registry; and(iii)      participating inregional fisheries activities, by
  supporting the Government andproject staff to participate insub-regional fishingactivitieswhere
  cooperation may enhancemanagemento ftransboundary resourcesandusers inthe RFZs (such as with the
  Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission), including learning exchanges, andparticularly meetings to discuss
  integrating VMS and sharing surveillance activities.

  Surveillance activities: Inorder to act upon the information provided by the satellite-basedVMS, the
  Government will needpatrol capabilities for the RFZs and other fishing areas. The aim o f surveillance
  activities supported by the project will be to establish the most cost-effective patrol capabilities possible for
  the surveillance agency ofthe MinistryofFisheries (FiscaMar), through a constantpresenceat sea
  launched from two surveillance stations onthe islands inclose proximity to the RFZs, which would be in
  communication with the FMC. Towards this aim, project will support capital investments to establish two
  surveillance stations, at Caravela andOrangozinho, as well as establish cost-effective patrol capabilities
  andtrained staff. The specific surveillance activitiesthe project will support include: (i) capacity
                                                                                                building
  inFiscaMarfor surveillance ofRFZs,bysupportingthetrainingofFiscaMar staffinpatroland
  surveillance protocols andmethods for RFZs, including the managementplansthat will be developed for
  the RFZs,joint patrolsandresponseto community observations; (ii)          establishing small, cost-effective
I
  surveillance stations on the two islands o f Caravela andOrangozinho, by supporting the investment costs
  for the two stations, the equipment andthe patrol boats (the technical specifications for the procurement o f
  the boats andtheir characteristics will be determined prior to effectiveness but will be basedon the
  principal o f least costs), for carrying out patrols o fthe RFZsandfishing areas, coordinated with VMS; and
  (iii)operating andmaintaining the surveillance stations at Caravela andOrangozinho, by providingthe
  recurrent costs for their first six months o f operation o f the two stations andpatrols, after which the
  Government o f Guinea-Bissau will commit to providingthe funds for the recurrent costs for these stations
  andthe patrols.

  This component will create aninstitutionalandregulatory framework for safeguarding Guinea-Bissau's
  environmental andsocial values, manage the evaluation o f social andenvironmental impacts o f
  development projects andfacilitate mainstreaming o f environmental laws andregulations.

  Inorder to strengthenenvironmental managementinGuinea-Bissau, theprojectwill support the
  establishment o f an Environmental Impact Assessment (EM)unitattachedto the Prime Minister's Office.

This unitwill set andoverseeimplementation ofthe standardsfor environmental andsocial safeguards
requiredfor development activities inthe country. Keeping recurrent costs to a minimum,the EL4unitwill
be staffedby a small permanent team, andwill draw uponanexternal network o f experts for review of
specific development proposals. Although initially the unit will be supportedbyproject funds, it is
expected that this unitwill become financially independent through introduction o f an appropriately
designed fee-for-service structure.

Specifically, the component will support the establishment andoperation o f the EMunit, including staff,
equipment, andcontracted reviewers. The component will also support the development, adoption,
dissemination andimplementation o f environmental impact assessment(EM)legislation, regulations and
procedures, including the preparation o f sector-specific guidelines (e.g., for energy, fishing, mining,
tourism). Component costs will also cover capacity buildingfor EMreview andmonitoring o f compliance.
The project will support an in-depth evaluation of environmental and social impacts o f destructive fishing
practices andproposed offshore petroleumdevelopment, including organization o fpublic hearings and
other consultative mechanisms. Internationalenvironmental and social safeguard standardswill be applied
to proposed development activities prior to national legislationtaking effect.

ProjectComponent4 US$1.29 million
                      -
This component will finance the establishment andoperation ofa small Project Management Unit(PMU)
andits auxiliary oversight andcoordinationstructures, a multi-disciplinary Steering Committee andProject

independant evaluations) ofthe project. More specifically, costs to be covered are establishment and
operation o f the PMU, including P M U staff, equipment, a full time ChiefTechnical Advisor, andrecurrent
operating costs. The operating costs o fthe Steering Committee and Project Management Group meetings
will also be covered as will capacity buildingactivitiesfor PMUstaff, including teambuildingwith the
Steering Committee andProject Management Group.

Withrespectto monitoring andevaluation, distinctions are made betweenproject progress (outputs) and
impact (outcomes). Component IVwould cover the costs associatedwith monitoring project
implementationprogress while the costs of gathering baseline andmonitoring datarelevant to the
subsequentindependent evaluation o fbiological, ecological andsocial trends during the lifetime o fthe
project andbeyondwill be supported under the respective components with the exception o fthe costs o f an
overarching beginning, mid-andend-term beneficiary assessmentwhich will be financed under Component
IV. Thepreparationof the detailedmonitoringplanfor the projectas awhole as well asthe establishment
andmanagementofaproject Management Information Systemto track implementationprogresswouldbe
supported under this component.

                                  Annex 4: Incremental Cost Analysis
               GUINEA-BISSAU: Coastal and BiodiversityManagement Project
I.ContextandGeneralDevelopmentGoals
1.        Context. Guinea-Bissau's coastal complex is characterizedby an extensive interpenetration of
terrestrial andaquatic environments, including vast estuaries, a large archipelago risingfrom a continental
platformof about 70,000 km2, andseasonalcoastal plains. The coastal biotopes are knownto be among
the richest on the West African coast interms o f diversity, productivity andfood potential. Incontrast, the
coastal biodiversity o fneighboringcountries has already been seriously degraded, becauseo f industrialand
urbandevelopment, which has ledto increasedlevels ofpollutionandthe degradation ofmarine andcoastal
ecosystems. The Government has long recognized the importance o fits coastal andmarinenatural
resources to boththe local andnational economy, andi s increasingly aware o fthe importance o fthese
resourcesto the sub-region's economy. The Government has requestedthat the Bank assist its efforts to
sustainably manage its unique coastal ecosystems andrelated biodiversity, to promote appropriate and
responsible naturalresourcemanagement schemes, andto help it address the threats resulting from ongoing
andplannedactivities, mostparticularly industrial fisheries andoffshore petroleum.

2.        General Development Goals. Guinea-Bissau i s one o f the world's poorest countries. Its
development index i s among the lowest, with over 50 percent o fthe population livingbelow the poverty
line, a life expectancy at birtho f43 years, anda highlevel o f inequality o f income distribution. Subsistence
livelihoods have ledto deforestation and soil degradation, which have historically been seen as the basic
environmental problems confronting Guinea-Bissau. Withinthe coastal zone more specifically, the major
threats to ecosystemfunction andhabitat quality have resulted from subsistence activities such as itinerant
agriculture, rice production, artisanal fishing andthe extraction o f fuelwood from forests andmangroves
for the production o f charcoal andthe smoking o f fish. The lack o f appropriate management o f coastal and
marine natural resourcesas well as the depletion o f key species within fragile ecosystemscould cause
severe biodiversity loss. The development objective o f the proposedproject aims to buildthe capacity o f
Government agencies andnatural resource users inGuinea-Bissau to collaboratively manage coastal
environments andbiodiversity for both conservation and sustainable development ends. This is inline with
national development priorities, which focus on the reduction ofpoverty andthe development ofthe social
sector.

3.        The Role o f Biodiversity Maintenance inGuinea-Bissau's DeveloDment. Despite the severe
constraints it faces, the Government recognizes the importance o fmaintainingthe quality o fthe
environment and o fthe naturalresource base. The national development program for 2001-2010clearly
acknowledges the critical role naturalresourceshave to play inoverall economic development as well as in
poverty alleviation. Priority is given to stimulation o f sustainableeconomic growthbasedondiversified
rural development andthe rational exploitation o f agricultural, forestry andfishery resourcesto alleviate
poverty. With respectto natural resourcesandthe environment, the development program outlines four
principal objectives: (i) improvingaccess to potable water; (ii)  improvingthe understanding o fthe potential
representedby the country's non-renewable resources; (iii)     capacity buildingvis-&vis technologies that
increase the value o f localresources; and(iv) ensuring sustainableexploitation o f the resource base
combined withjudicious protectiono fthe environment. The strategy for achieving the last objective
includes the elaboration o f a nationalpolicy andplanfor environmental management, the management of
parks andother protected areas andthe elaboration andimplementationo f a biodiversity management
program inthe coastal areas.

II. Scenario
    Baseline
4.        General Scope. Inthe absence o f GEF assistance, it is expectedthat the Governmentwould

nonethelesspursue some program o f coastalandbiodiversity managementto meet domestic development
objectives. Some portion o f this programwould be accomplished by proceeding with other donor support,
andsomewouldbe undertakenthroughthe Government'sownlimitedfinancialresources.

5.      Costs.Over a five year period, the total expenditures associatedwith the BaselineScenario are
estimated to be US$3.61 million. These are summarized inthe Table at the endo fthis section, and can be
described as follows:

    0   Biodiversity Conservation andProtected Area Management Support. (US$O.91 million) The
        GOGB would provide minimalon-going public sector support to some o fthe institutions involved
        inmanagementofitsprotectedareas.Thislevelofsupportisconsistentwithpastcommitmentsto
        all such initiatives andwould be adequate to provide minimalprotectionto some o f its coastal
        resourcesandecosystems. Continued degradation o f intemationally andregionally important
        habitats would likely persist with this level o f support.
    0   SustainableCommunitv Develoument. (US$0.34 million) Throughsome donor support the
        GOGB would strengthencommunity development to reduce poverty.
    0   Fisheries Conservation andManagement. (US$1.02 million) Some extemal donor support is
        already committedto attempt to managenear- and off-shore fisheries andgive basic support to
        institutional strengthening withinthis sector, particularly with respect to the development o f an
        industrialfishing sector strategy andthe monitoring, control andsurveillance o fthe industrial

    0   Environmental and Social Safewards. (US$0.46 million) Environmental andsocial safeguards are
        considered a critical interventioninsupport o f all environment anddevelopment initiatives inthe
        country, as it involves strengthening the broadlegal framework for environmental managementto
        include provisions for an environmental impact assessment process, so as to ensurethat such
        safeguardsare integrated into development activities. The project would thus support the
        development, adoption, dissemination and implementation o f environmental impact assessment
        (EIA) legislation, regulations andprocedures, andcapacity buildingfor EIAreview andmonitoring
        o f compliance.
    0   ProiectManagement. Monitoring andEvaluation. (US$0.88 million) To enable implementationo f
        the above project components, this component would support the coordinationandmanagement
        structures underpinningproject implementation. The project would thus finance: the establishment
        andoperation ofa smallProjectManagement Unit(PMU) withinthe MinistryofFinance; the
        operation of the implementing agency coordination structures; andthe development andmonitoring
        andevaluationofproject activities.


6.      Benefits. The benefits underthe Baseline Scenario focus onminimal institutional strengthening
that meets immediate development objectives inthe protected areas andfisheries sectors. To the extent that
such institutional strengthening translates to directed improvements inresource quality, some near and
long-term benefits may also be associatedwith greater ecosystemproductivity.

III.GlobalEnvironmentalObjective
7.      The global environmental objective o f the GEF Altemative is to strengthenthe conservation o f
globally significant ecosystemsandhabitats andspecies under nationaljurisdiction. The project will build
on results from earlier environmental initiatives and on an existing network o fprotected areas along the
coastline o f Guinea-Bissau, andwill contribute to poverty reduction inrural coastal areas by providing
livelihoodstrategiesthrough participatory sustainablemanagement schemes for naturalresourceuse. The
global anddevelopment objectives are sought via the following operational outputs: 1)A financially viable,
administratively autonomous Institute for Biodiversity andProtectedAreas (IBAP)to manage a network of
protected areas ina participatorymanner, andimplement endangeredspecies actionplans; 2) Local
conununities inandaroundprotected areas practice diverse community-driven, sustainableuse of coastal
natural resources; 3) Environmentalandsocial impacts o fmajor public andprivate sector development
projects evaluated; and4) Project Management Unitis operational andadaptively managingthe project.

IV. GEF Alternative
8.       Scope. With GEF assistance for addressingthe global biodiversity objectives outlined above, the
Government would be able to undertake a more effectiveproject andbe able to generatebenefits over and
above those inthe purely nationalinterest. The major thrust o f the incremental activities would be to
address a number o f targeted initiatives that improve biodiversity management andthat provide
opportunities for biodiversity-fiiendly community development activities.

9.       Costs.The total expenditures associatedwith the GEF Altemative are estimated to be US$ 11.11
million; these are summarized inthe Table inthe end o f this annex. Under the GEF Alternative, the project
would involve expandedor new activities as follows:

   0     Biodiversitv Conservation andPA Management (US$3.73 million) The new Institutional
         Framework Support activity is absentfrom the Baseline andwill focus on the establishment o f an
         institutional framework that ensures the coordinated, priority-driven management o fprotected
         areas andbiodiversity over the long term. The proposed framework includes establishment and
         operationalization of an administratively andfinancially autonomous Institute for Biodiversity and
         Protected Area Management (IBAP), which would be mandatedby Government to implement
         national policies andstrategiesfor the management o fbiodiversity andprotected areas. Protected
         Area and Threatened SpeciesManagement activities will be expanded andwill focus on
         strengthening the capacity for andimprovingthe conservation o fbiodiversity, bothnationally and
         regionally. Interventions will concentrate on institutional strengthening andonthe management of
         the four existing protected areas and the proposed Mata de Cantanhez Park, as well as on the
         conservation o f key globally andregionally threatened fauna. Buildingon andcomplementing
         ongoing activities, the activity will support the gradual integration o f existing stand-alone projects
         into a coordinated program o f activities to be overseenby IBAP.The types o f costs to be financed
         include those associatedwith: (i)  identification, classification andmanagement of the proposed
         Mata de Cantanhez protected area; (ii)   elaboration, finalization, approval andimplementation o f
         managementplansfor existing protected areas; (iii)     strengthening andoperation o f the
         multi-stakeholder ProtectedArea Management Committees; (iv) elaboration andimplementationof
         endangeredandthreatened species actionplans; (v) implementationo f a biodiversity-focused
         public awarenessprogram; (vi) design andimplementationo f a long-term biodiversity monitoring
         system (including completion o fbaseline andother periodic studies); (vii) participation inand
         information sharingwith national, regional andglobal biodiversity andthreatened species
         networks; and(viii) capacity buildingrequiredto implement the above.

0 SustainableCommunitv Development. (US$ 5.06 million) This enhanced activity aims to promote
  conservation andsustainableuse o fbiologicalresources at the local level. While priority will still
  be givento activities that at the sametime helpreducepoverty andempower poorer communities,
  the activities will be concentratedon communities located inor around protected areas or within
  the Biosphere Reserve; these areaswill thus serve as development poles. The component will
  complement the economic-oriented baseline activities through support for the participatory
  identification andimplementation o f community-based micro-projects that directly andindirectly
  promote biodiversity conservation and sustainableuse o fnaturalresources. These
  biodiversity-fiendly micro-projects proposedby eligible beneficiaries (communities, resourceuser
  associations, local NGOs, etc) will be financed via a Fundfor LocalEnvironmental Initiatives
  (FIAL). FIALwill constitute the embryo of a sustainable conservation financing mechanism the  -
  future Foundationfor Biodiversity inGuinea-Bissau (FBGB). Once operating efficiently, it will
  evolve into a sustainablefinancing mechanismto support inperpetuityIBAP's operation and
  activities, including the managemento fprotected areas andbiodiversity conservation in
  Guinea-Bissau, andFIAL's biodiversity-fiendly community development initiatives.

  Inaddition, the component will support amulti-faceted, local-levelfacilitationprocessto promote
  stakeholder participation inthe overallproject andfacilitate access to the FIAL, as well as
  resource-specific activities related to fisheries andmangrove management. ExpandedFisheries
  Conservation and Management activities will concentrate support on increasing the protectiono f
  the more sensitive breeding andnurserygrounds that underpinthe fisheries ecosystem as a whole.
  These expandedactivities will develop andtest anew concept andpractice for the Conservationo f
  fisheries' resourcesinGuinea-Bissau, namely the introduction o f FishingReserves, Le., fishing
  zones governed by special regulations. Duringthis pilot phase, project interventions will focus on
  protected areas andtheir zones ofinfluence. Surveillance over the reservesandenforcement o f
  managementregulations will be implemented through local stakeholders, inpartnershipwith the
  extension andsurveillance services o fthe Ministryo f Fisheries. This pilot approach i s expectedto
  facilitate ownership o f local stakeholders over national coastal resourcesandto provide incentives
  for protection o f fish nursingand breeding grounds. Fundsunderthis component would support: (i)
  studiesto support the identificationand selection o f ecologically sensitive areas where the
  establishment o fFishingReserveswould be expected to promote biodiversity conservation; (ii)
  preparation of regulations for these Reserves, including support for the public consultation
  processes; (iii) preparingandimplementing participatory surveillance plansto enforce the
  regulations (including facilitating the establishment o fpartnerships betweenpublic, private and
  local communities); (iv) public awarenessand sensitization campaigns to promote a responsible
  fishing culture (as definedinthe FA0Code o fConduct for Responsible Fisheries) andawareness
  o fthe important roleplayed bythese Fishing Reserves; (v) regular meetings o fthe regional
  Conselhos Consultivos da PescaArtisanal; and(vi) biological andsocio-economic monitoring and
  evaluation of the impacts.

0 Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (US$0.63 million) This enhanced activity
  supportsan evaluationo f the environmental andsocial impacts o f destructive fishingandproposed
  offshore petroleum development, particularly as these may affect the attainment o fprotectedareas
  andbiodiversity conservation objectives. Itincludes the organization o fpublic hearings andother
  consultative mechanisms. Inaddition, the activity supports the revision o fpolicies to ensure
  harmonizationbothinternally andwith respect to national commitments to biodiversity-related
  international conventions (Biodiversity, Ramsar, CITES, Bonn). Furthermore, this enhanced
  activity will conduct an ecological study o fdestructive fishing practices, so as to mainstream
  biodiversity concerns into the broader policy framework for environmentalmanagement.

    0    Project Management. MonitoringandEvaluation. (US$1.69 million) This enhanced activity will
         enablethe efficient administration o f GEF project funds, the operation o fthe multi-institutional
         structures necessaryto ensurecoordinated biodiversity conservationbetween institutions andthe
         vertical integration o fbiodiversity concems within sectoral programs andprojects. Itwill also
         support the evaluation o fprogresstowards improvedprotection andmanagement o f globally
         significant ecosystemsandspecies.

10.      Benefits. The GEF Alternative incorporates the benefits o f the Baseline Scenario, andwill enable
further beneficial outcomes beyondthose already specified. Inaddition to the Baseline benefits, incremental
benefits to the global community include the ability to sustain a protected area system which i s capable o f
conserving andsustainingglobally significant andrepresentative biodiversity, despite competing economic
pressureson the resource base. GEF assistancewill enable Guinea-Bissau to protect andto utilize
sustainably the country's biodiversity beyonda nationallyjustified andaffordable level. Global benefits
will include enhancedmonitoring andinformation exchangethrough improvedrecord-keeping, andeffective
capacity to preserve endangeredspecies throughthe ability to fulfill internationalbiodiversity conservation
treaty obligations under CITES. Continued protectiono fmany additional ecological functions, ando f
option andexistence values, i s anunquantifiedbut a large benefit to the global community. Also, the better
understanding o f the threatspresentedby destructive fishingpractices andoil exploitation on coastal and
marineprotected areas andbiodiversity, andthe sharingofthe lessonslearned, will enhance the regional
andglobal capacity to address these issues.

11.      Incremental Domestic Benefits. Itis estimated that domestic benefits o fUS$2.7million will be
realizedwith the GEF Alternative case. Thesebenefits are associatedwith readily quantifiable sustainable
uses associatedwith direct interventions supportedthroughthe community development andfisheries
management initiatives. Other indirect benefits may also be realizedthrough improved coastalmanagement
(e.g., reducedcoastal erosion, improvedwater quality), but any incremental economic benefits from these
improvements have not been estimated or includedhere although they are acknowledgedby GOGBto be
one ofthejustifications for some level o f Baseline support to the sector as a whole. The US$2.7 million in
sustainableuse benefits are a best estimate o f incremental incomes that mightbe generatedthrough a
successfully targeted community development andfishery management program. Currently, some 54,000
people live inthe Archipelago andcoastal areas andthey are among the poorest inthe country, withmean
per capita incomes o f the order o fUS$ 100    - $150mually.  The project notionally will target the poorest
among these, seeking a sustainedincome improvement o f the order o f 20 percent over the project periodfor
one-half o fthe coastal population inthe affected area; such levels o fimprovement are consistent with pilot
projects elsewhere andare also consistent with the Government's development goals o fpoverty alleviation.
The notional benefit is thus estimated as the population  athe      affected target proportion athe
project life times the mean improvement inbaseincome: (54,000 people x 0.50) x 5 years x (0.20 x
$100/yr/person) =US$2.7 million

V. Incremental Costs
12.      Incremental Expenditures. The total expenditure under the Baseline Scenario is estimated to be
US$3.61million while the total expenditure under the GEF Alternative is estimated to be US$11.11
million. The incrementalexpenditures under the GEF Alternative are therefore US$7.50 million.

13.      Incremental Costs. The incremental expenditures of Us7.50 million are partiallyoffset by an
incremental domestic benefit o f US$2.70 million. This benefit would not have beenrealized inthe baseline
scenario, andis primarilyassociatedwith local sustainable direct uses from the community development
andfisheries management components o fthis project. The net result is thatthe incrementalcosts ofthe
GEFAlternative isUS$4.80 million, for which GEF assistanceis requested. The allocationofthese

                              Annex 6(A): Procurement Arrangements
              GUINEA-BISSAU: Coastal and Biodiversity ManagementProject

Procurement
General
The procurement o f goods, works andservices will be done inaccordance withthe Bank's Guidelines on
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, RevisedJanuary andAugust 1996,
September 1997, andJanuary 1999) andthe Guidelines on Selection and Employment of Consultantsby
the WorldBankBorrowers (January 1997,Revised September 1997, andJanuary 1999). The Bank's
standardbiddingdocuments for goods andthe standardforms o fcontract andrequestfor proposals for
consulting services will be usedunderthe project. Any goods or servicesnot financed by the Bankwill be
procuredinaccordancewith the public procurement regulations o f the country or the co-financing
institution's procurement regulations.

The Republic o f Guinea-Bissau has a National Procurement Code, which has been developed with support
from the World Bank andtestedinfive line Ministries. A CPAR will be completed after an adequate period
o f application o f the new code. Overall, the procurement environment i s acceptableto the World Bank, and
the new Code would facilitate NCB for goods andworks andthe adherenceto Bank'sprocurement
guidelines.

Advertisement
A generalprocurement notice willbepublished inthe UnitedNationsDevelopment Business,announcing
goods and consultant services to be procuredandinvitinginterested eligible suppliers and consultants to
express interest. Specific Procurement Notice inDevelopment Business will also be requiredfor all
consulting assignments exceeding US$200,000 per contract. Notificationandadvertising will be carried
out inaccordancewith the provisions inthe Guidelines.

Implementation
Responsibility for all procurement under the project will rest with the project implementationunito f the
Private Sector Rehabilitation andDevelopment Project (PSRDP). The C B M Project provides for
incremental strengthening ofthe procurement capacity o fthe PSRDP project implementationunitwith the
equivalent o f one full-time position. After one year o fproject implementation, the Bankmissionwill
re-assess the capacity o fthe PSRDP project implementationunit to effectively managethe procurement o f
the C B M Project.

Assessmentof procurementunitcapacities
Anassessment ofthe PSRDP-PIU capacities inprocurement was conductedFebruary 6-9,2002 andthe
main findings were that the PSRDP-PIU has had significant experience with World Bankprocedures and
feels comfortable inapplying them. The primary recommendations to reinforce andM e r improve this
situation were the following:
    e    The procurement team shouldcontinue to be reinforced with additional staff interms o f
         administration andfinalization o fprocurement documents. The regional short-term consultant who
         has beenproposed, will provide sufficient assistanceto the specialist inplace, who has the capacity
         andknowledgeto implementWorld Bankprocedures.
    e    The procurement specialist shouldlimitintervention inthe procurement activities to: (i)
         centralization o fprocurement activities inone procurement planto ensurethat the thresholds are
         respectedinterms o f methods (possibility o f group expenditures andaggregates, (ii) preparation o f
         the bidding documents and requests for proposals; and(iii) the component responsible
                                                                      advising



                                                      - 60 -

          duringthe evaluation ofthe bids.

Therefore, the assessment indicates that there shouldbe no major procurement problems. The PSRDP-PIU
always uses the World Bankprocurement procedures regardless o f the type o f contract or the amount.
This is due to (i) needfor respecting the rules o f the World Bank and(ii) o f an applicable
                  the                                                         lack
procurement code inthe country. It is also important to point out that a CPAR has never been undertaken
inthe country andthe newnational codewas approvedinJanuary2002, with substantial assistance inits
preparation from the World Bank. Ultimately, however the procurement arrangementsdescribed inthe
PAD should not anticipate any major impact on the financial management o fthe project. Without going
into substantialdetail o fthe new code, since the World Bank Staff have reviewed it andare comfortable
with its contents.

Readiness for implementation
A detailedprocurementplanfor the first year ofimplementationwas discussedduringthe negotiations. It
will be finalized andsubmitted for approvalbefore project effectiveness. A draft PIPhasbeenprepared and
found to be realistic ando f satisfactory quality. The PIP will be updated quarterly. A general procurement
planreflectingthe bidpackagesfor the entire project periodhas beenprepared. Itwill beupdatedquarterly

Goods
All contracts for goods estimated to cost over US$lOO,OOO equivalent eachshallbe subject to International
Competitive Bidding(ICB).     Goods contracts estimated below US$lOO,OOO, but above US$50,000 shall be
subject to National Competitive Bidding(NCB). Goods contracts estimated below US$50,000 shall be
subject to InternationalShopping (IS), including IAPSO andinternet shopping. Contracts estimated below
US$30,000 eachmay be procuredthrough National Shopping (NS).

Consultingservices
Except otherwise stipulated, all consulting service contracts will be awarded usingthe Qualityand
Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) method. Consulting service contracts estimated to cost less thanUS$50,000
for f r m s may be awarded through the Consultants Qualifications (CQ) selection method inaccordance
with the provisions ofparagraph 3.7 o fthe Guidelines, unless amethodology is necessaryto describe the
mission execution. For contracts o f a routine nature estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO, andwhere
well established practices and standards exist such as financial andtechnical audits, Least-Cost (LC)
selection methodmay be used. All consulting services o f individualconsultants will be procuredunder
individualcontracts inaccordance with the provisions ofparagraphs 5.1 to 5.3 o fthe Guidelines. In
exceptional cases, Single-Source selection would be usedinaccordancewith the provisions o fparagraphs

FinancialManagement
1. Summary ofthe FinancialManagementAssessment
Executive summary and conclusion
An assessmentwas undertaken to determine whether the implementing agency for the fiduciary aspects, the
Private Sector Rehabilitation andDevelopment Project (PSRDP), has acceptablefinancial management
arrangementsas requiredby the Bank's policies, including entities' system o f accounting, reporting,
auditing andinternal controls.

The PSRDP project i s rated"Satisfactory" inthe internal FMrating system of the Bank andhas
satisfactory financial management capacity. However, inorder to assistthe CBMP project, there will be a
need to strengthen the current organization by recruiting a new accountant, updating the accounting system
andpreparinganadministrative, financial andaccounting manual.

Staffing and implementation arrangements :

Basic Principles
The Project Management Unit (PMU) will take advantage o fthe existing capacity inthe Private Sector
RehabilitationandDevelopment Project     - ProjectImplementationUnit (PSRDP-PIU) by outsourcing there
its financial management andprocurement. The financial responsibilities o f the PSRDP-PIU will therefore
include collection andcontrol o f invoices, managemento fthe project's bank accounts, makingpayments,
keepingthe books o f accounts andpreparation o f the financial reports. The PSRDP has experience and
trained staff inplace, which avoids having to duplicate efforts andencounter the resulting significant delay
inproject start-up.

Fundswill be disbursed from two Special Accounts (one for IDA Credit andone for the GEF Grant) and
will be administered by the ChiefFinancial Officer (CFO) o fthe PSRDP team at the central level.

The CFO ofthe PSRDP team will be entrustedwith the project's overall financial management and
reporting andwill serve as the principal contact for Bank disbursement. Implementingentities (at the
national andregional levels) will be incharge of reporting with respect to their activities. Fund
managementwill follow the same procedures as those adopted for the PSRDP project to avoidhaving to
retrain staff andminimize the potential for errors.

The PSRDP-PIU financial management capacity has beensatisfactorily assessed, includingthe
maintenance o fproper accounts, the preparation o fproject progress reports, the ability to process and
maintain SOE documentation, and satisfactory annual auditing arrangements. SOEs will therefore be used
for all expenses. Furthermore, all expensesrelated to contracts below prior-review thresholds will be
claimed on the basis o f SOEs andthe supporting documentation underlying all SOEs will be made
available for review by Bank supervision missions at any time. Supporting documentation will be retained
by the PIU. The primaryresponsibility o fmaintaining the records rests onthe CFO, assistedby the project
accountant. The satisfactory assessment o fthe financial management systemwill be one condition o f
effectiveness.

StafJing
Overall, the PRSSP-PIU has satisfactory financial management capacity. The finance andaccounting staff,



                                                    - 65 -

consisting o f two persons (the chief financial officer -CFO- andone accountant), are already inplace. They
have good academicbackgrounds as well as professional experience, including project financial
management.

The CFO o f the PSRDP-PIU will be responsible for ensuring that financial management andreporting
procedures o fthe project would be acceptableto the Government andthe World Bank. The CFO reports
directly to the Project Coordinator o f the PSRDP-PIU. The CBMP-PMU's financial andprocurement
management outsourcing arrangementwith the PSRDP-PIU will be formalized throughaninternal
Ministerial Decision o fthe Ministryo f Economics andFinance prior to effectiveness.

Giventhe additionalrequirements o f the project, which has two financiers (IDA and GEF), one additional
financial officer will be hiredto sit inthe PSRDP-PIU with CBMP funds. The Terms o f Reference for this
new accountant were elaborated andsharedwith the counterpart team duringthe appraisal mission. This
accountant will be recruited(see action planattached) under the PPF andwill work under the technical
supervision of the PSRDP chieffinancial andaccounting officer. Inaddition, each o fthe implementing
units (IBAP, PMUDIAL, Fisheries, andEIA) will have an accountant'administrator to manage the 90-day
advance accounts. The recruitmento f the additional accounting staff with qualifications satisfactory to IDA
for the PSRDP-PIU, CBMP-PMU will be an effectiveness condition.

TheFinancial Management System {FMS)

The Financial Management Systemobjective will beto helpmanagementeffectively andefficiently provide
project resourcesto intendedbeneficiaries andthus achieve the set objectives. Specifically, the FMS must
be capable o fproducing quarterly, understandable,relevant andreliable financial information that will
allow management to plan, implement, monitor andappraisethe project's overall progress or lack o f it.
The existing computerized FMS o fthe PSRDP-PIU has been evaluated andallows for the proper recording
o f all project-related transactions as well as timelymonitoring o f expenditures per category, implementing
agency, andcomponent. There will only be a needto update the software for this project andelaborate the
chart o f accounts andthe format o f the reports prior to effectiveness.

Accounting Policies and Procedures
There will be also a needto elaborate a project specific manual o f administrative, accounting, andfinancial
procedures before effectiveness. This manualmust include accounting policies andprocedures, definition o f
respective duties with a good segregation, a budgeting system andall relevant administrative andfinancial
procedures, andthe relationbetween the components of the project andreportingmechanisms at each level.
To this end, the manualfor administrative, accounting and financial procedures o fthe PSRDP-PIU will be
adaptedto the project and submitted to the Bank for approval before effectiveness. All o fthe staff involved
intheprojectmustbetrainedinthoseprocedures.TheTORSofthis manualwere elaboratedduringthe
pre-appraisal mission and sharedwith the counterpart team.

Internal accounting controls for the PSRDP-PIU will be strengthenedto cope with the additional work and
will be satisfactory for providingreasonableassurancesthat accounts willbe properly recorded and
resources safeguarded.

Financial Management Information System (FMIS)
The FMIS is computerized with software used inseveral other IDA financed projects inthe region andhas
been found to be satisfactory for borrower andIDA purposes. The PSRDP-PIU will prepare quarterly
Financial Management Reports (FMRs) for which the format will be discussedandagreedbefore
effectiveness. The quarterly reports will cover financial management, procurement andphysical progress


                                                      - 66 -

monitoring; covering all activities financed under the project regardlessthe source o f funding. By project
effectiveness, the PSRDP-PIU would start andtest the ability o fthe FMIS to provide, with reasonable
assurance, accurate andtimely information for FMR-based disbursements(i.e. the Financial Management
Report, FMR). Thus, existing disbursement procedures, as outlined inthe Bank`sDisbursement Handbook,
willbe followedi.e. Direct Payment, Reimbursement andSpecial Commitments. A World BankFinancial
Management Specialist will make a financial managementreview o fthe project's progress within 18
months o f credit effectiveness.

Upon completion o fthe first 18-months following effectiveness, a review o fthe financial management
system will be made to assess the capability o fproducing FMRs. The PSRDP-PIU will submit the
following reports through the PMU: (a) semi-annual progressreports; (b) an annualreport and a proposed
financing plan; (c) a detailed progress report ontechnical andfinancial program activities (not later than
four weeks before the date o f the mid-term review); (d) mid-termreview agreedrecommendation report; (e)
relevant sections o f the implementationcompletion report (ICR)    three months before the closing date; and
(0a to ensureprojectachievement sustainability. Thereafter, eachFMRshallbeprovidedto IDAnot later
than45 days aRer eachsubsequent calendar quarter.

The annual financial statements o f the project which wouldbe prepared inaccordancewiththe new
guidelines o f IDA (Annual Financial Reporting and Auditingfor World Bank-Financed Activities), will
include at least a statement o f sources of funds, a statemento f reconciliation o fthe special accounts, a
balance sheet, andrequirednotes to the financial statements. Also they will be submitted to IDA no later
than sixmonths after the endofthe fiscal year. They wouldbe submittedto all donors andstakeholdersat
the annual May/June meeting.

Accounting o fthe ninety-day advanceaccounts would be done by the PSRDP-PIU uponreceipt o f
supporting documentation. The CBMP-PMU would only maintain a ledger to avoid delays due to the
requirement o ftraining additional staff andhaving the FMIS soRware installedat the four implementing
units (IBAP, PMUIFIAL, Fisheries, andEIA). Over time, responsibilities for financial management will be
increasingly transferred to IBAP to ensure that it will be a performing institution at the project's end. An
outside financial expert to be recruitedinthe secondyear o fproject implementationwill guide the transfer.

2. Audit Arrangements
The PIUwould be responsible for project financial management, including the preparation andproduction
o f the annual financial statements inaccordancewiththe new IDA guidelines (Annual Financial Reporting
and Auditingfor WorldBank-Financed Activities).

The project consolidated annualfinancial statements andstatement of expenditures will be audited by
independent external auditors acceptable to IDA, according to detailed terms o freference approved by
IDA. To effect efficiencies andalso ensure capture ofthe entire financial management system, one audit
would be carried out covering boththe PSRDP-PIU andCBMP-PMU. The auditors' report would be
submittedto IDAnolater than six months aRer the endo fa fiscal year. The auditors' report would include
a management letter to be issued at the end o ftheir audit. Duringthe pre-appraisal mission, the TORSwere
elaborated andsharedwith the counterpart team. Selection o fthe independent auditor will be a condition o f
effectiveness.

3. DisbursementArrangements
Traditional disbursements and withdrawal procedures (i.e Direct Payment, Reimbursement,
Replenishmentsand Special Commitments) will be inaccordancewith guidelines set out inthe
Disbursement Handbook during the first 18 months following project effectiveness. To this end, all


                                                      - 67 -

replenishment or reimbursement applications will be submitted monthly or when the Special Account is
reducedby one-third, whichever comes first. All replenishment or reimbursement applications will be fully
documented except for contracts under the prior review threshold to be determined as a result o fthe
procurement assessment. SOE documentation will be retained at the PSRDP for review by Bank staff and
annual audits.

Financial Management Reporting-based disbursement (FMR). The lack o fprevious financial management
reporting experience withinthe PSRDP-PIU does not favor immediate application o fthe FMR-based
disbursement method. Nevertheless, quarterly FMRs, including financial, procurement andphysical
progress, will be prepared as soon as the project is effective. Duringaninterimperiod o f 18 months, these
FMRwillbe reviewedandthe financial managementcapacity strengthened.At the end ofthe 18months an
assessment o fthe financial systemwill be done to evaluate the capability to switch to FMRdisbursements.
The credit is expected to be fully disbursed over five years.

 Use of statementsof expenditures(SOEs):
Disbursements based on Statements o f Expenditures (SOEs) will be used for: (i) with a value less
                                                                                 works

contracts less than US$lOO,OOO; (iv) individualconsultants for contracts less thanUS$50,000; (v) training;
(vi) FIAL grants and(vii) operating costs.

Disbursements made against SOEs shouldbe certified by the PSRDP Project Coordinator andthe CFO.
Supporting documentation will be retained by the executing agencies andwill be available for review as
requestedby IDA supervision missions andproject auditors.

 Specialaccount:
The Government will open two special accounts (SA) inthe name o f the project ina commercial Bank, to



                                                     - 68 -

which project funds will be deposited. Most ifnot all credit funds will be disbursed throughthis procedure,
with the PSRDP-PIUrelyingas little as possible ondirect payments from Washington. Only payment
amounts exceeding 20 percent o fthe balance inthe special account can be claimedthrough the direct
payment procedure. For subsequentdisbursements, the PSRDP-PIU will submit appropriate justification
on the use o f amounts disbursed earlier (bank reconciliation statementsandother reasonable
documentation) to IDA.An external auditor acceptableto IDAwill audit the special account annually.

The authorized allocation of the special account will be US$300,000 equivalent inFCFA for IDA and
US$480,000 equivalent inFCFA for the GEF. These amounts have been estimated to cover about four
months of expenditures. Replenishment applications shouldbe submitted at least once per month andmust
include reconciledbank statements, as well as other appropriate supporting documents.

Inorder to allow the four implementingunits (IBAP,PMu/FIAL, Fisheries, andEIA)to implementthe
project inan efficient manner, four 90-day advance accounts will be established. The balance inthese
accounts will not exceedone-twelfth o ftheir agreedwork program andbudget net o f major procurement
activities under the responsibilityofthe PSRDP-PIU. At the time replenishment o fthe SA i s requested, the
PSRDP-PIU will indicate on a reconciliation statementthe location andamounts outstanding inany other
project account.

Counterpart Fund Account
The Government's net contribution to the project i s entirely in-kind(staff, facilities, operating
cost, etc) andno counterfund account will be set up.

                       Additional Annex 11:STAP Review,and Response
                GUINEA-BISSAU: Coastal and BiodiversityManagement Project

The following STAP appraisal is baseduponthe Project Concept Document- Project PO49513 for Focal
Area B: B-Biodiversity.

Overview
The Project Concept Document is well written and sets out anambitious initiative to improve the
conservation o fbiological diversity within the coastal area o f Guinea-Bissau. The proposal i s
comprehensive inthat it attempts to integrate biological diversity conservation with sustainableuse o f
renewable coastal resources andpoverty alleviation andsocio-economic development.

The project is worthy of support, howeverthere are anumber o fpoints concerning the actualmeansof
promoting effective integration o fa wide cross-sectiono f stakeholdersinto the implementation o fthe
planned activities that could be better addressedinthe project design. These are set out inthe latter
sections o f this appraisal.

1. Scientific and Technical soundnessofthe project
The development andglobal objectives are sound especially as they seek to move Guinea Bissaufrom a
donor dependencyto self-sustainability for naturalresourcemanagement. It shouldbe notedthat although
there is a sustainabledevelopment goal mentioned inthe Development Objective, this is not includedon the
Global objective andsome explanation for this i s required. Giventhe politicalsituationinthe country the
project i s very ambitious andrisk negation measuresidentifiedinthe Critical Risks may not be complete.

The proposal i s almost totally devoid o f any reference as to how the project will be implemented.
Furthermore the project i s heavily skewedto a top down approach     - initiatingan effective andsustainable
institutional framework i s important but the proposal does not cover how a voice will be given to the
communities who will be impactedby the project outputs. A stakeholder analysis should be included to
c o n f i i a wide awarenesso f stakeholders. Target populations shouldbe clearly articulated for relevant
project outputs.

Specifically the proposal should articulate the tools, techniques andmechanisms it proposesto employ to
deliver the sector issuesandstrategic choices outlined inB.3 (page 8 & 9) as well as the personnel /
institutions that would support the project. There is no breakdown/justification for the financial requests
outlined insection C.

An analysis ofthe current institutional arrangements andtheir capacity to support the development ofthe
project along with specific areas that require strengthening shouldbe included.

Although the timeframe for each subcomponent listedinAnnex 1appearreasonable, how the delivery will
be linkedto the capacity buildingthat is required is not articulated.

How the project will be coordinated andmanaged to ensurethe many componentshbcomponents are
integrated andlinkedis not included.

2. Identification ofthe global environmentalbenefits and/or drawbacks
The global environmental benefitsandanypotential drawbacks are well set out inthe project proposaland
raise nor specific criticisms.



                                                      - 76 -

3. Fitwith GEFgoalsandoperational strategies
The project proposalappears to fit the GEF goals and operational strategies. There are no specific
criticisms to be addressed.

4. Regionalcontext
The regional context is well set out inthe Project Concept. Successfulimplementationofthe projectwould
have huge regional andGlobal significance as it would identify andarticulate methods o ftransferring from
a donor dependency to self-sustainability. Its emphasis on establishing an institutional framework rather
thanfocusing on increasing the scientific basefor conservation is significant.

5. Replicability ofthe project
Ifimplementedinaneffective manner, thereisgoodpotentialtoreplicatetheprojectwithinother areasof
Guinea-Bissau andthe surrounding region.

There are a number o fmore secondaryissuesthat couldbe better addressed, namely:

1.Linkages to otherfocal areas.
The relationshipo fthe proposedproject to establishedGEFoperational strategiesfor biodiversity and
operational programmes for enhancedmanagemento f coastal andmarine ecosystemscould be made more
explicit.

2. Linkages to other programmes and actionplans.
The project is clearly linked to four other current initiatives 2 specific to GB andother (mainly IUCN)
                                                               -                -
funded projects that establish the foundations for the current proposal.

3. Other benefits or damaging environmental effects.
A major potentialbenefit is that the proposedproject is likely to demonstrateto the private sectorthe
'worth' o f conservation.
There are no perceived adverse environmental affects.

4. Degree of involvement of stakeholders in theproject.
The proposal is weak inthis areaanddoes not articulate how linkages will be establishedbetween primary,
secondary andkey stakeholders.

5. Capacity-building.
Although included as an integral component o f the project, the detail o f how this will be accomplished is
weak. It i s not clear how capacity buildingdeveloped duringthe life o f the project will be maintainedor
even extended as a self-sustaining output beyondthe life o fthe project.

6. Innovativeness of theproject.
The proposal to target the establishment of aninstitutional framework to support (andbenefit fi-om)
conservation is an innovative feature.

Conclusions
1.       The proposed project is worthy o f support;

2.       Itis anambitious undertakingthat will depend largely upon a wide body o fpublic support ifit is to
         be successful andthe outputs will be self-sustaining. Such support will require effective


                                                      - 77 -

      stakeholder involvement inthe development ofthe planned activities andtheir on-going
      implementation;

3.    There is a lack o f specific detail as to how Interested andAffected Parties (IAPs) andawide
      cross-section o f stakeholderswill be encouragedto take an active part andwork towards fulfilling
      the project's objectives. Experience elsewherehas demonstratedthe importance o f engaging I A P s
      andother stakeholdersat anearly stage inproject formulation, andthe needto empower these
      participants through effective information exchangeandto enablethem to play an active part in
      plannedactivities.

4.    Given that specific measuresare taken to strengthen this part o fthe Project Concept Document, the
      project has good prospects o fmeetingits statedobjectives andcreating self-sustaining outputs.



  We trust that these comments will be ofhelp inreviewing the proposal.

                                 Responseto the Technical Review
             Guinea-Bissau: Coastal and Biodiversity Management Project

  Issuesraised during STAP Review and responses:
  1/Stakeholder Participation:
  The project is working from a base situationinwhich stakeholder involvement has been exceptional.
  IUCNandother development partners prioritized a slow but fi-uitfuldialogue with local communities
  prior to the creation o fprotected areas. A detailed socio-economic analysis o fthe Bijagos Islands was
  conducted in 1993by the National Planning Institute (INEP), as part o fthe process leading to the
  creation o fthe Bolama-Bijagos Biosphere Reserve. As a consequenceo ftheir inclusioninthe
  establishment o fprotected areas, communities perceive them as focal points for sustainable
  development. Furthermore, the Protected Area Law establishes a management committee for each
  protected area, with majorityrepresentation by community members. Thus, local communities will be
  directly involvedinthe implementationo f Component 2. Component 3 is a follow-up on existing
  activities by nationalNGOs. The inclusion o f some IDA funding will provide flexibility inaddressing
  concems o f the communities neighboring protected areas that might not be directly relatedto
  biodiversity. The PDF B funded a study by a localNGO o fpast Community BasedNaturalResource
  Management efforts andtheir impact, with recommendations for the implementationof Component 3.
  We agree with the reviewer that implementationmodalities o fthis Component require further
  discussion beforebeing finalized, andthe Task Team intends to do this during Appraisal. Component 4
  relies on the successful experience acquired by IUCNinthe Rio Graiide de Buba, where local

populations were given exclusive rights to managebarracuda spawning grounds. Generalization to
other areas will require addressingthe issue o fthe migrating fishemen from neighboringcountries that
dominate coastal fisheries. This issue hasbeen includedinthe project's stakeholder analyses, to ensure
that the project is properly targeted andsocially sustainable. Components 1,5 and 6 involve
institutional stakeholders. The Task Team has reliedon the project's Steering Committee to provide
overall guidance. The Committee consists o frepresentativesfrom Government, academiaandthe
NGO community. Projectpreparation has also been advised through the Project Consultative Council,
which includes representativesfrom interestedparties. The Task Team welcomedthe suggestionto
conduct a stakeholder analysis duringpreparation o fthe project, as this provided a clearer
understanding o f expectations that helpedto formulate a better project. Inaddition, the proposed
project has been subjected to a fullEnvironmentalAssessment, as per WorldBankrequirements, which
also included an assessment of its social impact.

Znmplementation Arrangements:
Section C.4 (Institutional an implementationarrangements) has beenrewritten to clarify
implementationarrangements, particularly for the periodbefore the establishment o f IBAP. Section
C.2 (Key policy and institutional reforms) provides a list o f the institutional reforms sought by the
project. Section D.3 (Lessons learned andreflected inproposedproject design) also provides further
justification for the project's institutional set-up. The project's objective i s not to create a new
institutional landscape, but rather to ensure the continuity o f on-going activities ina more sustainable
anda more strategic manner.The issueo fcapacity buildingis discussedinSection E.4 (Issues
Requiring Special Attentiodnstitutional). It should be noted that Components 11,111,IV seek to retain
staff trained through past or on-going activities.


3Kinkages to other focal areas
Landdegradation, landuse, or pollution are presently not major threats to coastal ecosystemsin
Guinea Bissau(incontrast to neighboring countries, where coastal ecosystemshave beenseriously
degraded, becauseo f industrial and urbandevelopment). There i s no significant industry inGuinea
Bissau andurbanizationi s limited. Figures from the 1980s showed that conversion o fmangroves to
rice had significantly reduced the amount o f litter produced, which inturnpotentially affected coastal
fisheries. However, the rate o f conversion has significantly decreasedto the point o f not being a major
threat. Hence linkages to other GEF Operational StrategiesandPrograms have not beenmade explicit.

AdditionalAnnex 12: Monitoring& Evaluation Plan, and ManagementInformationSystem
                GUINEA-BISSAU: Coastal and BiodiversityManagement Project

 This annex describesthe approachtaken to Monitoring& Evaluation (M&E),managementInformation
 System (MIS), andproject supervision.

 1.Approach to M&Eusedbythe project
 Becauseo f the weak institutional capacity inGuinea-Bissau, the project will makeuse o f a rigorous M&E
 system at bothproject and component level. The client has fully endorsedthe need for the project to
 integrate M&E into the managementprocess inorder to refine andadapt interventions during
 implementation.

 The M&E system will provide the followingtypes o f information:
     0    Progress inthe workplan
     0    Establishment o f systems
     0    Implementationofplannedactivities
     0    Achievement of goals
     0    Effectiveness o f the project
     0    Impact of the project
     0    Efficiency or cost-effectiveness

 Duringpreparation the project team has reviewedbestpractices inM&Eq dretainedthe following
 practices for its approach:
          Make use o f the World Bank/WWFProtectedAreas Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool as

                    Additional Annex 14: Summary of Safeguard Analyses
               GUINEA-BISSAU: Coastal and BiodiversityManagementProject

This annex summarizesthe key findingsofthe analyseson safeguardsthat have beencompleted for this
project.

1.ProcessFramework (PF)
Implementationo f the project will necessarily involve restrictiono f access to naturalresourcesinand
around the national parks andlegally protected areas. The Government o f Guinea-Bissau hastherefore
developed a ProcessFramework (PF) inorder to define the process through which populations living inand
around these parksandprotected areas will participate integrally inthe definition o f restrictions, the
assessment o f the impact o f any possible restrictions, the determination o fremedialmeasuresto redress
those impacts on segmentso fthe localpopulation, andthe resolutiono f any grievances or conflicts, as well
as the definition andimplementation o fa monitoring program to assess the adequacy o fthe project.

Eligibility:Bothresident and seasonalpopulations are fully entitledto participate integrally and
meaningfully inthe determination o f restrictions onnatural resourceuse, the assessment o f the impact o f
such restrictions, the definition o fremedialmeasuresto redressthose impacts, andthe monitoring o fthe
remedialmeasuresto ensurethat all persons affected are assistedto restore their previous standardo f living
inas short aperiodoftime aspossible.

Mitigativemeasure: The Fundfor Local Environmental Initiatives (FIAL) will finance micro-projects and
conservation activities proposedby the eligible populations. FLALwill have two windows, one for
community development andone for mitigative measuresnecessitatedby the collective determination o f
restrictions on access to resources. Community development measuresare those that benefit the entire
community, e.g., wells, boats, schools, clinics andother initiatives that are available to everyone inthe
community. Mitigativemeasures, by contrast, are initiatives that benefit only those people who lost access,
inwhole or inpart, to a specific resource. Moreover, sincethe purposeofthemitigative measureisto
assistthe affected population to restore their livelihoods, the measureswill have a major income restoration
aim.

Grievance: The grievance resolutionprocess provides a general framework for conflict resolutionpremised,
first, on finding mutually satisfactory solutions within the project framework and, then, failing that, within
the localtraditions andauthority o f the community or communities involved. The coastal groups
throughout Guinea-Bissau retain strong local, traditional leaders. Nevertheless, the specific details o f
grievance resolutionmustbe tailored to the traditions andcustoms o f each group andeach area.
Furthermore, reliance on local systems o f grievance resolution inno way precludes the intervention o f
administrative, police, or juridical authorities inthe exercise o f their stated powers. Where intense
grievances between two ethnic groups arise, the only solution may be the intervention o fpublic authorities
to decide upon the matter.

If mattercannotberesolvedinformallyattheprojectlevel,theissuecanberaisedwithtraditionallocal
   the
authorities. The project authority (i.e., IBAP or its contracted NGO)canraise the matter with the deputy
of the traditional chief, who will convene the parties concerned andexplore the grounds for mutually
satisfactory resolution. Ifthe deputy cannot resolve the matter, he may refer the matter to the chief, first
informally, then ifnecessary, formally. Inthe latter case, the local chiefwill pronounce the final resolution
at the local level.

Should the matter remainunresolved, the aggrieved partymay take the matter to court. Infact, at any
point inthis process, the complainant has the prerogative o f filing a court case, ifhe or she so wishes.

Monitoring: The PMUhasprimary authority for implementing a mechanism to monitor andevaluateall
project activities. The monitoring system will have three basic objectives: 1)to ensurethat no populations
are dislocated from their presentresidencesby the economic impact o frestrictions on naturalresources; 2)
to ensurethat project-affected people participate integrally in, andbenefit fully from, the FIAL,
income-restoration progam; and, 3) to involve the local populations as fully as possible inthe
implementation o f the monitoring system.


2. ResettlementPolicy Framework (RPF)
Effectiveparkmanagementthrough IBAP coordination may give rise to resettlement intwo ways:
populations resident inthe core areas within the park may haveto move inorder to protect the
environmental integrity o fthe core area; or, project investments through FIAL,may attract populations
resident out o f core areas andinto buffer zones inside or around the park, particularly when relocationis in
the interests o fthe communities affected.

The zones o fimpact are specifically those core areaswithin national andnaturalparks where communities
either now reside or are completely encircled by core areas. InOrango National Park, there i s one
community on Imbone Island,which has been declared a core areainconsultation with the resident
populations. InLagaos Cufada, there are six communities resident incore areas o f the park. InCacheu,
there are several communities inthe westernmost part o fthe parkthat are completely surrounded by core
areas. Finally, the number o f communities incore areas o fthe proposed Catanhezpark has yet to be
determined following the zoning o f the proposed protected area.

Three alternatives exist to resettlement:
1)       allow communities to continue to reside inthe core areas
2)       rezone the core areas to exclude resident communities;
3)       assist the communities to relocate to the extent that they are willing. The only viable alternative on
both environmental and social grounds is to offer commsties resident incritical core areas the opportunity
to relocate to neighboring areas o f their choice. To the extent that communities opt to relocate, population
pressures on the natural resources inthe core areas will be eased, at least inthe short term. Ifcommunities
preferto remaininthe core areaandthat zone is determined ecologically to be a vital environmental area,
then involuntary resettlement may be the only feasible option.

A detailed census o fthe protected areas hasbeenincludedas part o fthe implementationo fthe project, and
proposals for re-zoning are expected to emerge from that work. Fundshave been set aside inthe budget for
the legalwork requiredto put into law the rezoning.

The CBMP will undertake three measuresto reduce the extent o fresettlement:
    0    First,the CBMP will review the current zonationo fthe parks inorder to verify that the currently
         defined core areas are, infact, critical environmentalhabitats. Inthe instance that partsor all o f a
         core areaare not critical envi<onmentally, the core areawill be rezoned as a buffer area, where
         populations may reside andengage inusualproductive activities.
    0    Second, where communities reside inenvironmentally critical core areas, the CBMP, through
         IBAP,will consult withthe communities to determine whether they are willing to relocate, and
         where, as long as basic assistance is provided for home reconstruction, agriculturalproduction,
         social infrastructure, andother needs. Since the government professes that neither communities

        nor individuals shouldbe relocatedinvoluntarily, forced involuntary resettlement through the use of
         legal instruments will be, inall cases, the final resort employed only when communities resident in
         environmentally critical core areas decline to relocate.
    0    Third, the CBMP, through IBAP,will ensurethat communities that relocate, voluntarily or not,
        will be treated similarly and will be providedhouseplots andagriculturallands, with title, as near
        to their current communities as is environmentally possible.


3. Environmental and SocialManagementFramework (ESFM)
Following the on-site evaluation o fpotential social andenvironmental impacts o fthe project, an
EnvironmentalandSocial Management Framework (ESMF) has beenpreparedto provide mitigation
measuresto unintendednegative impacts o fthe project. Key recommendations with regards to participation
o f communities innaturalresourcemanagementissueshave been incorporated into the design o f the project
already. Inthe case that unintended impacts are detectedby the PMU, the ESFMwill serve as the tool to
mitigate the negative effects.


4. Environmental and SocialScreeningof Micro-Projects
Inorder to ensurethat Bank safeguardpolicies are adheredto withinmicro-projects, the proceduresmanual
for project cycle management o f FIALmicro projects will provide a screeningmechanism o fproposed
projects. Micro-projects that trigger Bank safeguardspolicies will not be eligible for the micro-project
grantmechanism.

Several stakeholder analyseshave been conducted for this project. Inaddition, the project team has utilized
information andreports providedbypartners onthe stakeholders. Inparticular, the following documents
provide analyses o f how the project will work with various stakeholders:
    Environmental and Social Impact Assessment/ EnvironmentalandSocial Management Framework
    (ESIAiESFM), Government o f Guinea-Bissau, 2004. The document describes which stakeholders
    influence the investments made by the project, andproposesa series o f actions andtools which the
    project can use during implementation should interventions to mitigate anthropogenic impact be
    required.
    ProcessFramework (PF) and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), Government o f Guinea-Bissau,
    2004. These two documentsprovide an analysis o fwhat populations mightbe affected bythe project
    following the implementationmanagement plans o f protected areas. The ProcessFramework describes
    how people will be consulted when decisions about a change inthe naturalresourcemanagement
    scheme willbe required. The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) provides the tool/policy that will
    apply ifre-location would be required as a consequenceo f the project.
    Guinea-Bissau Fisheries Sector Strategy Paper: 'Diagnosis andemergency restructuringplanto
    enhancethe domestic benefits o fthe fishing sector andits integration inthe world economy', World
    Bank,2003. This document provides ananalysis o fthe fisheries sectorandwhat stakeholders are
    relatedto the issues facing fisheries inGuinea-Bissau, including the issuesrelatedto trans-boundary
    movement o f fishermen.
    Socio-economic analyses specific to the protected areas. Eacho fthe protected areas participating in
    this project has undergone a socio-economic analysis as part o f the creation o f the protected area
    (except for Cantanhez for which the socio-economic analysis will be developed as part o f this project).

Understanding the diversity of stakeholders inthe protected areas participating inthis project is o f great
importance for the project. As it canbe seen from the table below, the composition o f ethnic groups and
landuse practices is different ineachprotected area. The stakeholder analyseshave helpedgeneratean
understanding o fthe interests o f stakeholders, and subsequently determined what types o fmicro-projects
will be supported by the FIALto createthe incentive for participatorymanagement ofprotected areas.
