Context

 Recognizing the current and future social and economic importance of the country's biodiversity, the
Government of Guinea Bissau and its partners have been working since the 1990s to conserve and
manage the coastal zone upon which it depends. In 2004, through the Coastal and Biodiversity
Management Project (CBMP) financed by the Global Environment Facility, the European Union, IUCN
and the World Bank, helped the Government establish five national parks (Cacheu Mangrove Forest
National Park, Cantanhez Forest National Park, Cufada Lakes National Park, Joao Vieira and Poilao
National Marine Park and Orango National Marine Park) covering almost 450,000 hectares and including
some 70,000 people, as well as a financially and administratively autonomous public agency to manage
them, the Institute for Biodiversity and Protected Areas (IBAP). The CBMP supported staff and
infrastructure for a national headquarters and local park management offices in each of the five parks,
as well as awareness-raising among local communities and the development of legally-recognized park
management plans. The CBMP also supported the establishment of the Fund for Local Environmental
Initiatives (FIAL) to complement biodiversity conservation efforts and demonstrate tangible benefits to
local communities from the parks. The FIAL mechanism provided block grants for pro-environment
development in communities in and around the parks, disbursing roughly US$1.0 million in grants under
the CBMP for environmentally-friendly community development in the national parks, including
initiatives such as wells, schools, rehabilitation of rice fields, bee keeping, palm oil extraction, and fish
processing. Lastly, the CBMP supported a participatory process to design and legally register a private
foundation, the Bioguinea Foundation, which would, over time, gradually build up an endowment fund
sufficient to provide sustainable financing for managing the country's parks and biodiversity in
perpetuity (safeguarding these from the chronic public budget shortages of the Government and
reducing their reliance on unpredictable donor financing).

The potential environmental and social impacts of the investments and activities supported under the
CBMP were identified through the preparation of an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment
(ESIA), including extensive stakeholder consultation, and addressed through the development and
application of the safeguard processes and procedures detailed in the following documents: (i)
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF); (ii) Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF);
and (iii) Process Framework (PF). The World Bank Safeguard Policies triggered were: Environmental
Assessment (OP 4.01); Natural Habitats (OP 4.04); Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12); and Physical
Cultural Resources (OP 11.03). The BCP itself, described below, is supporting a specific sub-set of the
CBMP activities, none of which are expected to give rise to significant social and environmental impacts.
Nevertheless, to minimize and mitigate any and all potential adverse environmental and social impacts
that could arise as a result of the activities supported under the BCP, OP 4.01 and OP 4.12 have been
triggered for this project.

Project Objective

The Biodiversity Conservation Project (BCP) builds on the achievements of its CBMP predecessor. Its
objective is to support the country to (i) strengthen IBAP's management of Guinea-Bissau's existing five
national parks, and (ii) pilot the establishment and operation of a mechanism to sustainably finance at
least two of these parks. This objective is consistent with the US$ 1 million grant recently approved by
the GEF for the Guinea Bissau Biodiversity Trust Fund Project, with which the BCP will be closely
coordinated.

Project Description

The project comprises the following three components:

Component 1: Strengthened capacity for management of coastal and marine protected areas and
biodiversity. (IDA: US$1,3M; GEF: US$613,100). This component, in coordination with donor partners,
aims to strengthen the participatory management and conservation of the existing network of Guinea-
Bissau's five national parks and biodiversity during the first phase of its transition to more sustainable
financing sources. It will build upon the protected area and biodiversity management initiatives
launched under the CBMP, ensuring that the core functions of IBAP and the five national parks are
financed for the four-year period during which the establishment and operation of the FBG is piloted.
Component 2: Establishment and Operationalization of the Bioguinea Foundation (IDA: US$388,475;
GEF: US$255,100). The component aims to support the establishment and pilot the operation of the
FBG, as a mechanism that could, in the medium term, sustainably finance the recurrent management
costs of at least the two marine national parks in the Bijagos Archipelago. It will comprise two sub-
components financed by the GEF and IDA, respectively: (i) Establishment of the FBG; and (ii) Piloting the
initial operation of the FBG.
Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (IDA: US$ 289,800; GEF
US$81,800). This component aims to ensure effective and efficient implementation of project activities,
in coordination with the other related donor initiatives. It will comprise two sub-components financed
by IDA and GEF, respectively: (i) Project implementation support and audits; and (ii) Monitoring and
evaluation.


Potential Environmental and Social Impacts

The Project, which is classified as Category B, aims to continue and strengthen a participatory process
for the management and conservation of parks and biodiversity in Guinea-Bissau, most of the activities
are expected to have positive impacts both on the environment and the social. A comprehensive
analysis of the possible social and environmental impacts of the CBMP is presented in the related ESIA
and ESMF. The BCP itself is supporting a specific sub-set of these activities, none of which are expected
to give rise to significant social and environmental impacts. Given the limited number and low-risk
topology of works expected to be supported by the BCP, the EMP Checklist format, designed to meet
the World Bank Environmental Assessment requirements under OP 4.01 for civil works contracts with
small, localized impacts has been adopted. This format has been further adapted to reflect the possible
social impacts identified under the BCP Process Framework which was prepared in response to OP 4.12.

In terms of specific activities, the BCP will be financing minor works in the form of installation of limited
signage in a national protected areas giving rise to the potential for minor/negligible environmental and
social impacts such as soil disturbance, erosion/sediment run off, or damage to existing vegetation.
Simple mitigation and monitoring measures in line with the mitigation measures presented in Section F
of the low-risk topology of works ESMP Checklist format will be applied.

Finally, given the highly participatory approach to implementing the park management plans as well as
the specific activities being financed under the BCP, it is not expected that any restriction of access or
involuntary resettlement issues will be encountered. Nevertheless, in the event these arise, the BCP will
adopt the existing processes and procedures of the CBMP FIAL ESMP detailed in its Operational Manual
and Resettlement Policy Framework.

Contexto

 Reconhecendo a actual e futura importância da biodiversidae no contexto social e económica do país, o
Governo da Guiné-Bissau e seus parceiros vêm trabalhando desde 1990 para preservar e gerir a zona
costeira dos quais ele depende. Em 2004, através do Projeto de Zona Costeira e Gestão da Biodiversidade
(CBMP), financiado pelo Fundo Global para o Meio-Ambiente (GEF), a União Européia, a UICN e pelo Banco
Mundial, foi possível ao Governo estabelecer cinco parques nacionais (Parque Naciona das Tarrafas de
Cacheu, Parque Nacional da Floresta de Cantanhez, Parque Nacional das Lagoas de Cufada, Parque
Nacional Marinho de João Vieira e Poilão e Parque Nacional Marinho de Orango), que abrangem quase 450
mil hectares, incluindo cerca de 70.000 pessoas, bem como uma agência pública financeira e
administrativamente autônoma para administrá-los, o Instituto de Biodiversidade e Áreas Protegidas (IBAP ).

O CBMP contribuiu com o suporte de pessoal e infra-estrutura para a criação de uma sede nacional e
escritórios de gestão local dos parques em cada um dos cinco parques, bem como acções de sensibilização
junto às comunidades locais e o desenvolvimento de planos de manejo dos parques, legalmente
reconhecidos. O CBMP também apoiou a criação do Fundo para Iniciativas Ambientais Locais (Fial) para
complementar os esforços de conservação da biodiversidade e demonstrar os benefícios tangíveis para as
comunidades locais dos parques. O mecanismo Fial forneceu subsídios para o desenvolvimento pró-ambiente
nas comunidades dentro e ao redor dos parques, desembolsando cerca de EUA $ 1,0 milhão em subvenções
ao abrigo do CBMP para o desenvolvimento da comunidade ecológica nos parques nacionais, incluindo as
iniciativas tais como poços, escolas, reabilitação de campos de arroz, apicultura, extração de óleo de palma, e
transformação do pescado.

Por último, a CBMP apoiou um processo participativo para a concepção e para registrar legalmente uma
fundação privada, a Fundação Bioguinea, que, ao longo do tempo, gradualmente, construirá um fundo de
dotação suficiente para fornecer um financiamento sustentável para a administração do parques do país e da
biodiversidade em perpetuidade ( salvaguardar estes a partir da crônica escassez de orçamento público do
governo e reduzir sua dependência de financiamento imprevisível dos doadores).

Os potenciais impactos ambientais e sociais dos investimentos e actividades apoiados no âmbito do CBMP
foram identificados através da elaboração de uma Avaliação de Impacto Ambiental e Social (ESIA), incluindo
consultas alargadas dos interessados, e dirigidas através do desenvolvimento e aplicação dos processos de
salvaguarda e os procedimentos pormenorizados nos seguintes documentos: (i) Processo de Gestão
Ambiental e Social (ESMF), (ii) Quadro de Reassentamento Política (RPF), e (iii) Quadro de Procedimento
(PF). As políticas de salvaguardas do Banco Mundial que foram engatilhadas foram: Avaliação Ambiental (OP
4.01); Habitats Naturais (OP 4.04); Reassentamento Involuntário (OP 4.12) e Recursos Físico-culturais (OP
4.11). O próprio BCP, descrito abaixo, está a apoiar um determinado sub-conjunto de actividades do CBMP,
nenhuma das quais é esperada para dar origem a significativos impactos sociais e ambientais. No entanto,
para minimizar e mitigar todo e qualquer potencial impacto social e ambiental adverso que possa surgir como
resultado das actividades apoiadas no âmbito do BCP, OP 4.01 e OP 4.12 foram engatilhados para este
projeto.




Objetivo do Projeto

O Projeto de Conservação da Biodiversidade (BCP) baseia-se nas realizações do seu predecessor, o CBMP.
Seu objetivo é apoiar o país a (i) reforçar o IBAP na gestão dos cinco parques nacionais existentes da Guiné-
Bissau, e (ii) o estabelecimento e funcionamento de um mecanismo piloto de financiamento sustentável, pelo
menos para dois destes parques. Este objectivo é coerente com os EUA $ 1,000,000 recentemente concedido
e aprovado pelo GEF Projeto de Fundo Fiduciário para a Biodiversidade para a Guiné-Bissau, com os quais o
BCP vai ser estreitamente coordenado.
Descrição do projeto

O projeto compreende as seguintes três componentes:


Componente 1: Fortalecimento da capacidade de gestão das zonas costeiras e marinhas protegidas e
da biodiversidade. (IDA: US$ 1,3 milhões; GEF: US$ 613,1 mil dólares). Esta componente, em
coordenação com os parceiros doadores, visa fortalecer a gestão participativa e conservação da rede
existente dos cinco parques nacionais e da biodiversidade durante a primeira fase de sua transição para
fontes de financiamento mais sustentáveis. Esta componente vai reforçar as iniciativas de gestão da
biodiversidade e áreas protegidas lançadas no âmbito do CBMP, assegurando que as funções nucleares do
IBAP e dos cinco parques nacionais sejam financiados para um período de quatro anos durante enquanto a
criação e o funcionamento da FBG é pilotado.


Componente 2: Criação e Operacionalização da Fundação Bioguinea (IDA: US$ 388.475; GEF: US$
255,100 dólares). A componente tem como objetivo apoiar a criação e o funcionamento piloto da FBG, como
um mecanismo que poderá, a médio prazo, financiar de forma sustentável os custos recorrentes de gestão,
pelo menos, em dois parques nacionais marinhos no arquipélago dos Bijagós. Esta componente será
composta de duas sub-componentes financiadas pelo GEF e pela IDA, respectivamente: (i) Criação da FBG, e
(ii) Pilotar o início do funcionamento da FBG.


Componente 3: Gestão de Projetos e Monitoramento e Avaliação (IDA: US$ 289.800; GEF US$ 81.800).
Esta componente tem como objetivo assegurar a implementação eficaz e eficiente das atividades do projeto,
em coordenação com as outras iniciativas de doadores. Esta componente será composta de duas sub-
componentes financiadas pela IDA e GEF, respectivamente: (i) Apoiar a implementação do projecto e
auditorias, e (ii) Monitoramento e avaliação.




Potenciais Impactos Ambientais e Sociais

O projeto, que é classificado como Categoria B, visa prosseguir e reforçar um processo participativo para a
gestão e conservação dos parques e da biodiversidade na Guiné-Bissau, a maioria das actividades está
prevista para ter impactos positivos sobre tanto o meio ambiente que o meio social. Uma análise abrangente
dos possíveis impactos sociais e ambientais da CBMP é apresentado no ESIA e no ESMF. O próprio BCP
está a apoiar um determinado sub-conjunto dessas atividades, sendo que em nenhuma das quais é esperado
que dê origem a impactes sociais e ambientais significativos. Dado ao número limitado e topologia de baixo
risco de obras que deverão ser suportadas pelo BCP, o formato de Checklist ESMP projetado para atender às
exigências do Banco Mundial de Avaliação Ambiental da OP 4.01 para contratos de obras com pequenos
impactos localizados, foi aprovado. Este formato foi posteriormente adaptado para refletir os possíveis
impactos sociais identificados no âmbito do Quadro de Procedimento BCP que foi elaborado em resposta ao
OP 4.12.

Em termos de actividades específicas, o BCP financiará pequenas obras sob a forma de instalação de
sinalização limitada em uma área protegida nacional que pode vir a ter o potencial de impactos ambientais e
sociais menores / negligiveis, como erosão do solo, perturbação / escoamento de sedimentos, ou danos à
vegetação existente. Simples mitigação e medidas de vigilância em conformidade com as medidas de
mitigação apresentadas na secção F da topologia de baixo risco de obras do Checklist formato EMP será
aplicado.
Finalmente, dada a abordagem altamente participativa para a execução da gestão dos planos dos parques,
bem como as actividades específicas a ser financiado no âmbito do BCP, não se espera que qualquer
restrição de acesso ou problemas de reassentamento involuntário sejam encontrados. No entanto, no caso
que estas se verifiquem, o BCP irá adoptar os processos existentes e os procedimentos do Fial CBMP ESMP
detalhadas em seu Manual Operacional e da Política de Reassentamento.

     A. Introduction
1.       Recognizing the current and future social and economic importance of the country's
biodiversity, the Government of Guinea Bissau and its partners have been working since the 1990s to
conserve and manage the coastal zone upon which it depends. In 2004, through the Coastal and
Biodiversity Management Project (CBMP) financed by the Global Environment Facility, the European
Union, IUCN and the World Bank, helped the Government establish five national parks (Cacheu
Mangrove Forest National Park, Cantanhez Forest National Park, Cufada Lakes National Park, Joao Vieira
and Poilao National Marine Park and Orango National Marine Park) covering almost 450,000 hectares
and including some 70,000 people, as well as a financially and administratively autonomous public
agency to manage them, the Institute for Biodiversity and Protected Areas (IBAP). The CBMP supported
staff and infrastructure for a national headquarters and local park management offices in each of the
five parks, as well as awareness-raising among local communities and the development of legally-
recognized park management plans. The CBMP also supported the establishment of the Fund for Local
Environmental Initiatives (FIAL) to complement biodiversity conservation efforts and demonstrate
tangible benefits to local communities from the parks. The FIAL mechanism provided block grants for
pro-environment development in communities in and around the parks, disbursing roughly US$1.0
million in grants under the CBMP for environmentally-friendly community development in the national
parks, including initiatives such as wells, schools, rehabilitation of rice fields, bee keeping, palm oil
extraction, and fish processing. Lastly, the CBMP supported a participatory process to design and legally
register a private foundation, the Bioguinea Foundation, which would, over time, gradually build up an
endowment fund sufficient to provide sustainable financing for managing the country's parks and
biodiversity in perpetuity (safeguarding these from the chronic public budget shortages of the
Government and reducing their reliance on unpredictable donor financing)1. It is expected that this
Foundation will be legally registered under UK law by December 2010.

2.      The potential environmental and social impacts of the investments and activities supported
under the CBMP were identified through the preparation of an Environmental and Social Impact
Assessment (ESIA), including extensive stakeholder consultation, and addressed through the
development and application of the safeguard processes and procedures detailed in the following
documents: (i) Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF); (ii) Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF); and (iii) Process Framework (PF). The World Bank Safeguard Policies triggered were:
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01); Natural Habitats (OP 4.04); Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12);
and Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11).

3.     The Biodiversity Conservation Project (BCP) builds on the achievements of its CBMP
predecessor, focusing principally on enabling the continuation of a core subset of the national park
management activities launched under the CBMP and on providing the means for the Bioguinea

1
    It was expected that capitalization of the endowment would be the objective of a second phase of the project.
Foundation to be operationalized and its fund raising program to be launched. The Project, which is
classified as Category B, aims to continue and strengthen a participatory process for the management
and conservation of parks and biodiversity in Guinea-Bissau, most of the activities are expected to have
positive impacts on the environment. Potential negative environmental impacts associated with
implementation of the park management plans are expected to be nil. Nevertheless, to minimize and
mitigate any and all potential adverse environmental and social impacts that could arise as a result of
the activities supported under the BCP, OP 4.01 and OP 4.12 have been triggered. The Environmental
and Social Management Plan presented below builds upon and updates the safeguard analyses,
processes and procedures of the CBMP. Given the limited number and low-risk topology of works
expected to be supported by the BCP, the EMP checklist format, designed to meet the World Bank
Environmental Assessment requirements under OP 4.01 for civil works contracts with small, localized
impacts has been adopted. This format has been further adapted to reflect the possible social impacts
identified under the BCP Process Framework which was prepared in response to OP 4.12.

     B. Project Objective

4.       The BCP Development Objective is to support the country to (i) strengthen IBAP's management
of Guinea-Bissau's existing five national parks, and (ii) pilot the establishment and operation of a
mechanism to sustainably finance at least two of these parks. This objective is consistent with the US$ 1
million grant recently approved by the GEF for the Guinea Bissau Biodiversity Trust Fund Project, with
which the BCP will be closely coordinated.

5.       The project rationale is to: (i) provide bridge funding to the management of Guinea-Bissau's
parks and protected areas network after the closing of the CBMP, and (ii) put in place the institutional
conditions needed to allow the country to gradually transition from its current dependence on
unpredictable, external project-based financing sources to a situation in which stable conservation
finance streams are available to support core biodiversity and protected area conservation activities in
at least two national parks in perpetuity, thus safeguarding their biodiversity and natural capital for the
benefit of current and future generations.

     C. Project Description

6.      The project comprises the following three components:

7.       Component 1: Strengthened capacity for management of coastal and marine protected areas
and biodiversity. (IDA: US$1,3M; GEF: US$613,100). This component, in coordination with donor
partners, aims to strengthen the participatory management and conservation of the existing network of
Guinea-Bissau's five national parks and biodiversity during the first phase of its transition to more
sustainable financing sources. It will build upon the protected area and biodiversity management
initiatives launched under the CBMP, ensuring that the core functions of IBAP and the five national parks
are financed for the four-year period during which the establishment and operation of the FBG is
piloted. More specifically, it will finance the following activities as needed in each of the five national
parks2: (i) the operating costs of participatory surveillance patrols and enforcement of park regulations
by IBAP staff; (ii) development or updates of park regulations and park-specific business plans; (iii)
periodic meetings of the Park Management Councils3; (iv) dissemination of information within and
about the parks (improved signs and communications materials); (v) awareness-raising and dialogue
with communities and other resource users living in and around the parks vis-à-vis park management
activities about biodiversity-friendly alternative technologies and alternative livelihoods; (vi) the
implementation of endangered and threatened species actions plans (primarily monitoring and
research); (vii) design and operation of consolidated endangered and threatened species databases;
(viii) targeted training/capacity building for IBAP staff and other stakeholders (for example training in
participatory species and protected area monitoring techniques, eco-tourism guiding and learning
exchanges between parks for IBAP staff, Park Management Council and community members); (ix)
development of annual business planning tools for IBAP; and (x) collaboration and participation in
regional and international fori for biodiversity and protected area management issues. The specific
types of expenditures to be financed include technical assistance, goods and services, a limited set of
minor works (sign posts), training and workshops, travel, per diems, salaries and other operating costs.
These will be financed solely by GEF until project month 15, and thereafter by IDA.

8.       Component 2: Establishment and Operationalization of the Bioguinea Foundation (IDA:
US$388,475; GEF: US$255,100). The component aims to support the establishment and pilot the
operation of the FBG, as a mechanism that could, in the medium term, sustainably finance the recurrent
management costs of at least the two marine national parks in the Bijagos Archipelago. It will comprise
two sub-components financed by the GEF and IDA, respectively: (i) Establishment of the FBG; and (ii)
Piloting the initial operation of the FBG.

9.       Sub-component 2.1: Establishment of the Bioguinea Foundation (GEF: US$255,100). Activities
to be financed under this sub-component include: (i) support to establish the FBG as a legal personality
with tax exempt status in Guinea Bissau; (ii) development and implementation of an Operational
Manual; financial management system and procurement guidelines; (iii) preparation of a business plan
and design of an associated financial capitalization strategy4; (iv) preparation of a financial investment
strategy to guide the management of FBG capital and its grant making decisions, as well as development
of other FBG operational policies as needed; (v) recruitment of an international fund manager for the
FBG's endowment; (vi) legal technical assistance as required for negotiating financing agreements (e.g.,
for contract negotiations with the private sector for sales of carbon credits generated under a REDD
project); and (vii) training for the FBG's Executive Secretariat staff and Board members, as well as IBAP
and other key national partners as needed (for example study tour, twinning arrangements,


2
  The specific national parks and activities to be supported by the project in any given year will be determined in accordance
with the priorities as identified during IBAP's overarching annual work program and budget exercise.
3 Park Management Councils have been established in each of the Parks, comprised of local stakeholders, to provide oversight
to park management, they meet bi-annually or ad hoc as needed.
4 This financial capitalization strategy will inter alia shall identify and target diverse mechanisms and financial resources for
securing both recurrent revenue streams and capital for the FBG sinking and/or endowment funds (e.g., national budgetary
contributions from park entry fees, tourism taxes, fishing licenses, mining royalties, etc.; private sector contributions;
international direct donor contributions; debt for nature swaps; etc.)
participation in international meetings on conservation trust funds, etc.). The specific types of
expenditures to be financed include technical assistance, training and workshops, travel, per diems and
other operating costs.

10.       Sub-component 2.2: Piloting the Operation of the Bioguinea Foundation (IDA: US$388,475).
Activities to be financed under this sub-component include: (i) establishment and operation of the
Board of Directors as the governance structure for the FBG (see Annex 6 for details on Board
membership and functions); (ii) the staffing, equipping and operation of a small Executive Secretariat;
(iii) any technical assistance and/or operating costs needed to support implementation of the
capitalization strategy, including inter alia design and production of communication materials, national
meetings, regional and international missions, a donor round table. The specific types of expenditures
to be financed include technical assistance, goods and services, training and workshops, travel, per
diems, salaries and other operating costs.

11.     Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (IDA: US$ 289,800; GEF
US$81,800). This component aims to ensure effective and efficient implementation of project activities,
in coordination with the other related donor initiatives. It will comprise two sub-components financed
by IDA and GEF, respectively: (i) Project implementation support and audits; and (ii) Monitoring and
evaluation.

12.      Sub-component 3.1: Project Implementation Support and Audits (IDA: US$ 289,800). This will
support activities linked to oversight and management of project implementation and coordination,
including: (i) operating costs; (ii) technical assistance to IBAP staff to ensure ongoing sound fiduciary and
safeguard management (including recruitment of key fiduciary and monitoring personnel, collaboration
with CAIA); (iii) coordination meetings; (iv) technical assistance to assist in the preparation and
monitoring implementation of annual and multi-annual integrated work programs and budgets across
all sources of funding; and (v) independent annual financial audits. The specific types of expenditures
to be financed include technical assistance, services, training and workshops, travel, per diems, salaries
and other operating costs.

13.      Sub-component 3.2: Monitoring and Evaluation (GEF US$81,800). This will support activities
linked to effective monitoring and evaluation, specifically including, technical assistance and operation
costs associated with the design and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation program. The
specific types of expenditures to be financed include technical assistance, services, training and
workshops, and per diems and other operating costs.

    D. Environmental and Social Footprint

14.     The nature, scale and scope of works foreseen under this project are limited to the installation
of signage within/around the national protected areas supported under the BCP. As such, the
environmental and social impact will be limited, site specific and temporary. Nevertheless, to ensure
that any possible impacts are mitigated and managed, the project team has prepared the Environmental
and Social Management Plan for low-risk topologies to ensure that works are conducted with minimum,
if any, environmental disturbance.

    E. Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework

15.     Guinea Bissau is making progress towards environmental and social protection. Protected areas
management and biodiversity conservation are guided by three principle strategic and policy
documents: (i) National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP, 2005); (ii) National Protected
Areas Strategies of 2007-2011; and (iii) National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP, 2004), as well as the
overarching national PRSP.

16.     The country has also signed and ratified many of the international environmental conventions,
including inter alia:
     The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. (CITES)
     The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat
        (Ramsar)
     The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals
     Convention on Biological Diversity
     United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC or FCCC)
     Kyoto Protocol Convention to Combat Desertification
     Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context
     Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to
        Justice in Environmental Matters
     Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage

17.     Significant national legislation is also in place, key among which is the 1997 Protected Areas
Framework Law; specific legislation creating each of the five national parks (varied years); 1994 Artisinal
Fisheries Law; 2004 Forestry Law; 2004 Hunting Law; and the 1998 Land Law. Additionally there are
some key pieces of legislation adopted by the National Assembly but awaiting promulgation by the
President and hence are not yet fully enacted. These include the 2006 update of the Protected Areas
Framework Law, and the recently approved (July 2010) Environmental Impact Assessment Law which
introduces a legal requirement for taking into account environmental and social impacts of investments
and development policies. A National Environmental Framework Law is currently under preparation.

18.     Detailed descriptions of ratified international conventions and national legislation are presented
in the CBMP ESIA and the BCP Process Framework.

    F. Relevant World Bank Policies

19.     The BCP is classified as Category B. Two World Bank safeguard policies were triggered for this
project: Environmental Assessment (OP4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12).
20.      OP 4.01: Because this project aims to continue and strengthen a participatory process for the
management and conservation of parks and biodiversity in Guinea-Bissau, most of the activities are
expected to have positive impacts on the environment. The project is designed to help protect critical
habitats for key species within the five national parks, and to monitor and evaluate park performance in
this effort. It will support the implementation of selected elements of the participatory park
management plans prepared under the CBMP, including ongoing monitoring of compliance with park
rules by local IBAP staff, as well as biodiversity monitoring and awareness-raising for communities living
in and around the parks about biodiversity-friendly technologies and livelihoods5. Although potential
environmental impacts associated with implementation of the park management plans are expected to
be nil, World Bank OP 4.01 was triggered as the project will support implementation of specific activities
contained within the existing park management plans that may include very limited civil works, more
specifically the installation of limited park signage which could generate small, reversible, limited and
time-bound environmental impacts6. Given the limited number and low-risk topology of the works
expected to be supported by the BCP, a simple ESMP has been prepared in line with the streamlined
ESMP checklist format designed to meet the World Bank Environmental Assessment requirements
under OP 4.01 for civil works contracts with small, localized impacts. This simple ESMP reflects the
principles and guidelines of an ESMF.

21.      OP 4.12: The project builds on a base of exceptional stakeholder participation, particularly in
the local communities and resource users that live in and around the protected areas and depend upon
them for their livelihoods. The existing national park management plans themselves are the result of a
multiyear, participatory process and have been validated by local stakeholders in and around each park.
Their implementation is being overseen by the Park Management Councils, with broad representation of
local stakeholders, including 13 out of its 26 members being drawn from the resident communities and
resource users themselves. Given this, conflicts are not expected to arise during their implementation.
Nevertheless, the project will support the update/preparation of national park internal regulations thus,
to be sure that any potential risk of restriction to resource use is addressed, World Bank OP 4.12 has
been triggered. The Process Framework for the CBMP has consequently been updated for use by IBAP
in continued management of the parks. The recommendations have been incorporated in the
streamlined BCP ESMP below.

     G. Implementation Arrangements

22.      IBAP is the implementing agency for the BCP. IBAP was one of the key implementing agencies
under the CBMP, responsible for the implementation and oversight of all CBMP supported park
management and biodiversity conservation activities within and around the five national protected
areas. The basic capacity for implementation of project safeguard policies and procedures is in place.
Under the CBMP, both IBAP and the Government's Environmental (and Social) Impact Assessment Cell
(CAIA, which sits in the Prime Minister's Office) staff received specific training in application of the CBMP
specific ESMF/ESMP and RPF/PF policies and procedures, and have gained five years of practical

implementation experience in overseeing their implementation. The current project will provide
continued funding and training for IBAP staff in each of the parks to (i) strengthen their capacity to
identify and address any environmental and social issues that might arise during implementation of the
park management plans and (ii) function as `antennas' for CAIA, in order to monitor for any
development projects commencing near the parks that would require an Environmental and Social
Impact Assessment, and report this immediately to CAIA.

    H. Potential Environmental and Social Impacts

23.      A comprehensive analysis of the possible environmental and social impacts of the CBMP is
presented in the related ESIA and ESMF. The BCP itself is supporting a specific sub-set of these
activities, none of which are expected to give rise to significant environmental and social impacts. Given
that the BCP will be financing minor works in the form of installation of limited signage in a national
protected areas there is potential for minor/negligible environmental and social impacts such as soil
disturbance, erosion/sediment run off, or damage to existing vegetation. To this end the mitigation
measures presented in Section F of the Safeguards Information Screening CheckList and the Guidance on
Potential Mitigation Measures (see Part 3 and 4 below, respectively) will be applied. Although not
expected, it is also possible that project activities, specifically the update of internal park regulations,
could require the implementation of a limited number of income restoration projects. In this event, the
processes and procedures, including the ESMF screening tools, procedures and processes developed for
the FIAL microprojects under the CBMP and detailed in the FIAL Operational Manual will be adopted.
Similarly, in the unlikely event that any resettlement issues arise, the CBMP Resettlement Policy
Framework will be adopted.

    I.   Environmental and Social Management Approach

24.      As noted above, no major environmental and social impacts are envisaged as a result of the BCP.
Nevertheless, the Director of IBAP will be responsible for ensuring that any environmental and social
issues that arise are addressed. Park staff and the members of the Park Management Council will be
responsible for monitoring the implementation of the small works associated with the park signage
activities. More broadly, the detection of/monitoring for unforeseen impacts in the parks will be
conducted by the IBAP staff and communities as part of their regular patrols and monitoring activities.
Any unexpected impacts from project activities will be reported to the Park Director and through him to
the Director of IBAP. In the event that any external, non-project financed development activities in the
vicinity of the five national parks are observed to be giving rise to negative impacts upon the national
parks, this shall be reported to CAIA, the agency responsible for ensuring the application of the national
ESIA legislation.

    J.   Budget

25.     Implementation of the ESMP activities will fall within the ambit of regular implementation of the
park management activities (e.g. staff salaries, fuel, park management council meeting costs, etc.).
Thus, the budget for the ESMP activities is subsumed in the overall project costs. Nevertheless,
although it is fully expected that any potential restriction of access issues resulting from the update of
the internal park regulations will be resolved at the local level, in the context of the participatory park
governance mechanisms and/or those of traditional authorities, a fund of $5,000 has been set aside to
cover the costs of facilitation of a more formal grievance process by a local NGO should it be required.
Refresher training for park staff and community guards in detection of impacts and monitoring of
safeguards will be conducted by a safeguard specialist and is expected to cost $4000.

    K. Monitoring and Reporting

26.      The Director of IBAP will have the overall responsibility for ensuring that any environmental or
social impacts are appropriately addressed. Although the project's environmental impacts are likely to
be negligible, monitoring for unexpected environmental and social impacts will be nevertheless be
conducted on a continuous basis by park staff and community guards as part of their regular patrol and
surveillance activities. These staff will report observations to the Park Directors, who in turn will report
these to both the Park Management Councils and to IBAP's Chief Operating Officer and Director for
IBAP.

27.     In addition to the above, IBAP staff and their community partners will specifically monitor for
potential environmental and social impacts associated with (i) installation of signage and (ii)
updating/preparing internal park regulations for individual parks. This will be done in accordance with
the ESMPs outlined below (Attachment Part 2). Detailed guidance on the processes and procedures for
monitoring for social impacts are provided in the BCP Process Framework. Implementation of the ESMP
and Process Framework will also be verified in the field by the World Bank team as part of its regular
supervision missions.

28.     Lastly, a detailed monitoring system will be designed and implemented for the BCP as a whole.
Environmental and social indicators will be integrated into this system and monitored and reported on a
quarterly basis.

          took place
                         Historically, it is worth noting that the project builds on a base of exceptional
                         stakeholder participation, particularly in the local communities and resource
                         users that live in and around the protected areas and depend upon them for
                         their livelihoods. IUCN and other partners prioritized the development of a
                         slow but vital dialogue with local communities throughout the 1990s, and laid
                         the seeds for their ongoing participation in the creation and management of
                         the protected areas. This has been further reinforced by their participation in
                         the CBMP and the FIAL. The existing national park plans themselves are the
                         result of a multiyear, participatory process and have been validated by local
                         stakeholders in and around each park. Their implementation is being
                         overseen by the Park Management Councils, with broad representation of
                         local stakeholders, including 13 out of its 26 members being drawn from the
                         resident communities and resource users themselves. Their involvement,
                         alongside local authorities and technical ministries in the Park Management
                         Councils (of which they comprise half) ensures their continued engagement in
                         the evolution of these parks, and reinforces the community view of them as
                         focal points for sustainable development.
