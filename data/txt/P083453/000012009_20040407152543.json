Biodiversity Management\n            Project will facilitate responsible management of natural\n            resource management in, and around five protected areas, and\n            in three reserved fishing zones in Guinea-Bissau, while\n            assisting the country in setting up a process of\n            environmental, and social screening of development projects.\n            It is foreseen that land acquisition, and thus resettlement,\n            will occur as a result of project implementation, and this\n            policy framework sets the guidelines to avoid as possible,\n            or minimize adverse impacts on local populations, and,\n            provides compensation as follows. Land losses will be\n            compensated at replacement costs, while housing and any\n            physical structure will be replaced, in which case\n            construction materials and assistance will be provided as\n            needed. It is important to note, that house gardens,\n            agricultural fields, grazing lands, and other common areas\n            lost will be replaced with plots of equal size and\n            productive potential, to include as well infrastructure,\n            such as access to water and transport availability.\n            Continued access to natural resources in the core areas may\n            be permitted under specific conditions, but alternate access\n            will be provided in the resettlement area. Resettlement\n            sites will be provided basic social infrastructure, such as\n            village wells, communal stores, schools, clinics, and\n            electricity. Farmers particularly affected by annual, or\n            perennial crop, and rice losses will be allowed harvesting,\n            and, will later be provided with alternative plots of equal\n            size, soil fertility, and productive capacity for\n            agricultural purposes. Improved seeds, and technical\n            assistance on processing techniques will be provided.\n            Similarly, assistance in fisheries development will be\n            provided through improved technologies, and processing techniques."}, "docdt": "2004-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
