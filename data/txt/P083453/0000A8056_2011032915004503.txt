                         Implementation Status Overview
                           Tangible results have been achieved by the Institute for Biodiversity and Protected Areas (IBAP) in the parks, by the Fund for Local Environment Initiatives (FIAL), as well as by the
                         Environmental Impact Assessment Unit, bringing about concrete benefits to both the environment and the resident participating communities. IBAP continues to effectively manage
                         the Protected Areas network. FIAL is advancing well, consolidating and expanding its interventions in the parks and bringing visible benefits to the park communities. The project as a
                         whole continues to progress well towards attainment of the overarching PDO as well as towards the end of project outcome targets for each of the components. Both institutions
                         continue to join forces to develop and promote community activities and micro-projects related to conservation and alternative micro-project. On the fisheries component, the Post of
                         Caravela is up and running; the legislative package comprised of the Fisheries Law and the Artisanal Fisheries regulations and decrees for creation of the Reserve Fishing Zones
                         (RFZs) have been approved by the Council of Ministers on January 13, 2010. CAIA's role continues to be increasingly recognized and the Environmental Impact Assessment Law
                         and Despacho Conjunto was approved by the Parliament in May 2010 and was promulgated and published in the official gazette in September 2010. Significant progress has been
                         made towards the establishment of the BioGuiné Foundation, which is now on the cusp of being legally registered. The incorporation of the Bioguié Foundation is expected to take
                         place before March 31, 2011.
