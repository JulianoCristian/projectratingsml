This integrated program of\n            reforms and investments aims at reshaping the unbalanced\n            Malian education system, improving its performance and\n            relevance and promoting a more cost effective use of scarce\n            sectoral resources. Principally, this will be achieved by\n            expanding access to primary education, but also by\n            developing a viable option for secondary & higher\n            education.   It will be hybrid in nature, consisting of,\n            first, a quick disbursing element to be released in three\n            yearly tranches against implementation of a sectoral\n            adjustment program. Secondly, it will include an investment\n            element focusing on primary education and the management of\n            sectoral resources."}, "docdt": "1989-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
