PROJECTS COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO - AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECTS
LOANS 1217-ME AND 1569-ME (FIRA V AND VI)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Fifth and Sixth
Agricultural Credit Projects executed by the FIRA trust funds in Mexico. The
Fifth Credit was completely disbursed in May 1979, as envisaged during
appraisal while the Sixth Credit was fully disbursed in June 1981, nine
months ahead of schedule.
The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and Caribbean Region -
Agriculture Division 4; a country visit by project staff taking place in May,
1982.
The PCR is based on the Borrower's background information, the
Staff Appraisal Reports (961-ME and 1968-ME), the President's Reports dated
February 18, 1976, and May 3, 1978, respectively, the Loan, Project and
Guarantee Agreements dated March 11, 1976, and September 27, 1978.
Supervision reports, correspondence with the Borrower and internal Bank
memoranda on project issues as contained in relevant Bank files have also
been reviewed.
A copy of the draft report was sent on October 20, 1982, to
FIRA, NAFINSA and SHCP. Comments have been received from both FIRA and
NAFINSA and are attached as Annexes I and II.
While in general we agree with the comments of FIRA and NAFINSA,
we have the following observations on NAFINSA's letter:
(a) Contributions by Beneficiaries, Page 4 - The requirement for
sub-borrowers to contribute some capital of their own to
investments financed by FIRA was in most instances fulfilled.
The reference in para 3.30 of the Completion Report refers
only to the fact that there were some instances of non-
compliance;
(b) Participation by NAFINSA, Page 4 - NAFINSA was always sent
copies of letters written after each supervision, summarizing
all the issues and major points. Announcements to FIRA of
each supervision mission was also routinely copied to NAFINSA.
In a letter dated February 22, 1982, the Bank advised NAFINSA
of the completion mission for FIRA V and VI, requesting their
active participation in the completion exercise. However,
NAFINSA did not participate in the post-evaluation exercise
or in the final wrap-up meeting in the field.

MEXICO
PROJECTS COMPLETION REPORT
FIFTH AND SIXTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECTS
Loans 1217-ME and 1569-ME
Highlights
1.        The Fifth and Sixth loans, together amounting to US$325 million,
continued to provide support, through the Trust Fund for Agricultural
Investments (FIRA), an agency of the Central Bank of Mexico, to public and
private banks for credit operations in livestock, crop and agroindustries,
including a program to strengthen training, technical assistance, monitoring
and evaluation, and demonstration. Although the projects were implemented at
a time when FIRA was expanding rapidly with its total lending program
burgeoning from Mex$ 11 billion (US$500 million) in 1977 to Mex$ 46 billion
(US$1.9 billion) in 1981, the projects had a positive impact on lending to
agriculture and on institution building. They also allowed the Bank to
maintain a continuous dialogue with the Mexicans on interest rate policy,
institution building and the role of credit in agriculture.
2.        Overall, project objectives and targets set at the time of
appraisal were met or exceeded. During implementation, about 36,400 subloans
were made compared to 14,800 estimated at appraisal. The impact on
production and farm income including that of low-income producers was
favorable; incremental production of annual crops and livestock generally,
was either equal to or greater than appraisal estimates. Yields for annual
crops were superior to appraisal projections particularly in irrigated areas,
and livestock production results compared favorably to appraisal targets.
Economic rates of return were also higher: about 34% for the Fifth project
and 37% for the Sixth, compared to an estimated 20% to 42% and 28%
respectively. The combined economic rate of return for both projects was
35%.
3.        The following points may be of particular interest:
a) the gap between agricultural credit interest rates on the one
hand and inflation levels and commercial rates on the other
hand, initially only existent for low-income producers,
progressively widened as no provisions were made for periodic
adjustments during implementation as recommended by the
appraisal team for the Sixth credit.    This impacted on (i) an
accelerating demand for credit; and (ii) a slow deterioration
of FIRA's sound financial position as the cost of its funds
have started to accelerate more rapidly than its interest
earnings (paras. 2.07, 2.08, 3.10, 3.11 and 7.07);
b) significant progress was made in two areas of institution
building: expansion of training and evaluation system. As a
result, FIRA was able to expand markedly its technical
iv



assistance to participating banks (paras. 3.22-24, 4.02-05,
5.07-09) and to provide for the first time sufficient details
on the production impact of its investments (paras. 3.25-28,
5.14); and
c) FIRA's capabilities for sectorial analysis, planning and
programming and internal control of subloans proved less than
adequate in the face of strongly expanded demand. These
problems were addressed through the ongoing Seventh project
(paras. 5.11-13, Chapter VII: Conclusions).

I. BACKGROUND
1.01      The Mexican GNP grew at an average annual rate of about 6% during
the 1970s.   Agriculture remains an important sector in the economy,
accounting for about 40% of the total labor force, slightly over 7% of GNP,
and about 17% of total export earnings.    Since 1965, total farm production
has increased at an average annual rate of about 2.3%, somewhat lower than
the annual population growth rate of 2.9%.    Consequently, agricultural
imports have increased sharply during the 1970s, reducing substantially the
favorable net trade balance in agriculture.    Since the mid 70's Government
has allocated increasing resources to improve performance of the agricultural
sector. Organizational changes have been made in the public sector by
combining the old Secretariats of Agriculture and Livestock and Water
Resources under the Secretariat of Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH),
more emphasis has been placed on improving rainfed agriculture ancl a massive
program to increase basic food production and improve rural living standards
has been put into effect through the Mexican Food System (SAM) program,
administered by the office of the President. An important part in its
overall agricultural development strategy was to improve and expand
agricultural credit systems through both the public and private banks. In
this, the trust fund FIRA, and more recently also FICART, are the official
vehicles for implementation of Government's agricultural credit policies,
with FIRA operating mainly through the private banks for lending to
medium-income producers (MIPs) and the best of the low-income producers
(LIPs), and FICART, operating through BANRURAL, serving the broad spectrum of
LIPs.
1.02      Until 1955, when the first of the three FIRA trust fundsl/ was
established, the public agricultural banks had been the major source of
institutional credit for agriculture in Mexico.    However,large-scale on-farm
development lending, including technical assistance, by private and public
banks did not occur until after 1965, when the second FIRA trust fund (FEFA)
was established. Although, only about 30% of producers receive institutional
credit, funds from institutional sources, mainly FIRA and BANRURAL2/,
accounting for over 90% of total funds, have increased by at least 10% per
annum in real terms since 1968,    with an outstanding loan portfolio of over
Mex$ 170 billion in 1981.
1.03      To support the Government's program, the Bank, prior to FIRA V and
VI, financed four loans to FIRA between 1965 and 1975 - totalling US$275
million -- to provide medium- and long-term funds for investments. By
1/  FIRA consists of three trust funds administered by the Bank of Mexico.
Trust Fund for Crop, Livestock and Poultry Credit (FONDO); Special
Agricultural Credit Trust Fund (FEFA); and the Technical Assistance and
Loan Guarantee Trust Fund (FEGA).
2/  National Rural Credit Bank (BANRURAL), the largest of the public
agricultural banks. (For further details on BANRURAL refer to Rainfed
Agricultural Development Project, Loan 1945-ME, SAR.)



- 2 -
participating in this program, the Bank assisted FIRA in increasing its
activities in the agricultural sector, enabling it to:     (a) make increased
resources available to the private and public banks3/; (b) set standards for
economic, financial and technical soundness of subloans for investment
purposes; (c) provide support to LIPs by channeling funds directly to that
group; and (d) improve training programs and upgrade the technical assistance
capabilities, particularly of the field staffs of participating banks.
1.04      With FIRA V and VI loans, (equivalent to US$325 million) the Bank
has continued to provide support to FIRA and currently FIRA is implementing
the Seventh Credit Project also financed by the Bank. With the completion of
the Seventh Project by mid-1983, the Bank will have provided US$925 million
to FIRA for development under these seven projects.
II. FORMULATION
Preparation and Design
2.01       The Fifth and Sixth Projects were prepared by FIRA and represented
a continuation of activities financed under the four previous credit projects
for livestock, crops and agroindustries. Table 1 provides a summary of the
principal features of the project, including costs and financing.
2.02      The Project Performance Report (PPR) for the Third Project
indicated that technical and managerial improvements at the farm level had
not sufficiently complemented the use of credits. On the other hand, the PPR
for the Fourth Project stated that, for livestock investment, more emphasis
had been placed on breeding stock than on land improvement. Additionally,
inadequate focus on research, technical assistance and development of
appropriate technology was cited as a serious impediment to the project. The
report also suggested that (a) it was no longer desirable for the Bank to
focus only on FIRA, but rather that it should analyze the agricultural credit
system as a whole; and (b) Bank staff were unable to provide proper
supervision to the increasingly large and complex agricultural program; and
(c) too much emphasis was given by the Bank to individual on-farm investment
models at appraisal instead of to sector policies and issues.
2.03       Since the PPR for the Fourth Project was completed after the Fifth
and Sixth Projects were appraised, the lessons learned under the Fourth
Project were not fully reflected in these two projects. However, both
provided for increased training and development of technical staff of FIRA
and the participating banks, for training of beneficiaries, and for
improvement of research and demonstration farms. In addition, beginning in
the Fifth Project, BANRURAL was included to provide support to the LIP group.
3/ The Mexican Government has recently nationalized the private banking
system in Mexico. The implications of this decision with respect to the
present agricultural credit system are not clear at the time of writing
this report, but the matter will be discussed with Government and
clarified before proceeding with the Eighth loan (para. 7.12).



-3-
Objectives and Description
2.04       FIRA V and VI were to finance technically and financially sound
investment plans for annual and perennial crops, beef, dairy, dual-purpose
ranches, and small agroindustries. The projects also included finance for
training, demonstrations, technical assistance and monitoring activities
carried out by FIRA and the participating banks. The objectives were to (a)
increase production for domestic consumption; (b) expand the contribution of
the agricultural sector to export earnings and import substitution; (c)
provide more rural employment; and (d) raise the income of farm families.
2.05      FIRA V included a substantially expanded low income producer (LIP)
component (47% compared to 20% in FIRA IV) and, for the first time, a
specific component for project monitoring of impact and pilot schemes for
group farming enterprises. FIRA VI reduced the LIP component to 34% of the
project, due to the availability of alternate funds for LIPs under the PIDER
projects and other projects funded by IDB.
Cost and Financing
2.06      At appraisal, FIRA V and VI project costs were estimated at US$413
million and US$627 million, with the Bank financing US$125 and US$200
million, respectively. Bank contributions for the two were earmarked,
respectively, at 30% and 32%; FIRA contributions at 42% and 39%;
participating banks at 15% and 14%; and producers, at 13% and 15% (Tables 2
and 3).
Sublending Terms
2.07      At negotiations, the major issue in both projects was related to
interest rates on subloans. The Fifth Project fixed interest rates for
on-farm investments by LIPs at 7.6% for first-time-sub-borrowers and 9% for
others. Interest rates to MIPs were fixed in eight categories, according to
the size of the loan, from 11.5% to 14.5%. Interest rates, however, were
negative (inflation averaged about 14.3% for period April 1974 to May 1975)
and the appraisal mission recommended at least a 0.5% increase in all rates.
This, however, was not accepted by the Mexican officials on the grounds that
(a) interest rates were then on the decline, and (b) that it was deliberate
Government policy to show preference for the agricultural sector.     By and
large, the interest rates, except for the LIPs, were in line with ACF4/ and
the banking system continued to attract domestic savings. Consequently, at
negotiations, this position was accepted by the Bank.
2.08      In preparing the Sixth Project, the appraisal mission recommended
interest rates linked to ACF. While maintaining the preferential rate of 11%
for LIPs; it was recommended that the interest rates for MIPs should be ACF
plus two points. In addition, the Bank proposed that the interest rates for
4/ ACF reflects the average cost of funds to the banking system in Mexico,
and is calculated montly by the Central Bank. It follows the inflation
rate, although with a time lag.



- 4 -
new subloans should be fixed twice per year, at the beginning of each
agricultural cycle, based on the ACF of the preceding six months.     However,
because of the then ongoing stabilization program, the Mexicans were able to
convince the Bank that the rate of inflation would continue to decline.
Because of this, it was agreed at negotiations that the Bank's recommendation
that the loan documents contain a trigger clause to revise the rate of
interest, depending on the movements in ACF, should not be included.
Consequently, first-time LIP sub-borrowers were charged 11% and other LIPs
paid 13.5% for crops and livestock production and 14% for agroindustrial
subloans. MIPs were to pay 16% to 17%, depending on the size of the
subloan.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01       The Fifth Loan became effective on August 30, 1976, with the MIP
component starting at a fast pace, and the LIP component, which depended
largely on BANRURAL's eligibility for rediscounts, moving slowly. Gradually,
however, the program for small producers was accelerated and the loan was
disbursed on schedule.
3.02       The Sixth Loan became effective in January 1979.    The lending
program for commercial producers was completed in February 1980, two years
ahead of schedule, and the program for low-income producers was fully
disbursed by mid-1981, more than one year ahead of schedule.
Reallocation of Funds
3.03      During project implementation, several reallocations of funds were
made under the projects to increase the funds available for MIPs by about
US$17 million, mainly for livestock production. Agroindustries and technical
services were reduced by US$10 million and US$7 million, respectively, to
provide the needed amounts.    The reallocation (Table 4) reflected the
accelerated pace of commitments of MIP subloans and, at the same time, the
shortage of suitably trained technicians for agroindustrial lending. The
reduction in the technical services component did not affect the overall
technical services program of FIRA, since the program was maintained with
FIRA's own funds. A summary of the final allocations by categories is given
in Table 5.
Project Costs and Financing
3.04      Project costs for FIRA V and VI are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.
The increase in the size of the Fifth Project was a result of increased
counterpart funds (US$64 million) made available by FIRA, participating banks
and the producers. While the private banks' investment in the project
amounted to 10% in total, the investment in LIP subloans was only 2%. The
producers' contribution shown in Table 2 is an approximation as FIRA did not
maintain records of contributions.



- 5 -
3.05       In both  projects FIRA rediscounted 66% of the total funds through
the private and mixed banks and 34% through BANRURAL.     While the private and
mixed banks operations were strongly biased to borrowers from the MIPs group,
accounting for 88% of all MIPs loans, the BANRURAL portfolio was
predominantly channeled to LIPs    and accounted for 85% of lending under the
projects to the LIP group5/.
Disbursements
3.06      Disbursements for FIRA V and VI are summarized in Table 6.
Initially, for FIRA V, the issue of what exchange rate to apply arose when
the date of effectiveness coincided with a devaluation that reduced the value
of the peso by about 60%.   Thus, disbursement requests under the Fifth
Project were delayed at first but started flowing in rapidly at the agreed
old exchange rate (US$1 to Mex$ 12.5) for expenditures prior to September 1,
1976. By June 30, 1977, disbursements were already ahead of appraisal
estimates; thus, disbursement was completed as envisaged during appraisal.
3.07       Early disbursements were mostly for the MIP component of the loan,
and, by September 30, 1977, over 90% of the funds for MIPs had been
disbursed. Meanwhile, only 13% of the LIP component had been disbursed.
Apparently, there were two main reasons for the slow LIP disbursements:
first, funds for LIPs were available in an IDB credit program and, second,
private banks were apprehensive to lending to LIPs because they felt that
this group was too risky and their costs for servicing this clientele would
be much higher.
3.08      Under the Sixth Project, disbursements moved much more rapidly than
expected and were completed by June 1981, nine months ahead of schedule. By
February 1980, FIRA had completed the project lending program to commercial
farmers (over two years ahead of schedule), and by the end of 1980, had fully
committed the LIP program.
Sublending Terms and Conditions
3.09       Shortly after the Fifth loan became effective, the borrower pointed
out that the Government had set the annual interest rate to be charged by
FINASA (the public bank that lends to sugarcane producers and mills) to all
sugarcane producers at 10.5%, which was lower than the interest rates for
MIPs (11.5% to 14.5%) specified in the Project Agreement.In January 1977, the
Bank agreed that LIP loans for sugarcane production could be made in
accordance with FINASA's standard terms (10.5%) but it would allow no change
for MIPs. Consequently, there was no financing by the Bank of FINASA loans
to MIPs.
3.10      During implementation, as a result of higher than anticipated
inflation (1977 - 21%), the Bank requested an increase in interest rates
prevailing in agricultural credit. The Government granted only a part of
that requested, and in March 1978 a new schedule of interest rates, ranging
5/ For details see Tables 2 and 3.



- 6 -
from 11 to 17%, for FIRA's medium- and long-term lending was approved by the
Ministry of Finance. 6/.    However, these new rates were still negative,
since inflation rates were about 16% in 1978 and 20% in 1979.
3.11      For the Sixth Project the interest rates made effective in March
1978 (para 2.08) were therefore applied to the lending program and no further
adjustments were made during project implementation, although the rates were
below inflation levels.
Number, Average Size, and Beneficiaries of Subloans
3.12      The number of subloans under the Fifth Project (17,800) was much
larger than was expected at appraisal (7,371) 7/ for two reasons.     Firstly
because the amount of the Bank loan, in Mexican pesos, increased with the
1976 devaluation. The average exchange rate of disbursements was 1 US$ =
20.75 pesos, while SAR calculations were based on the then prevailing rate (1
US$ = 12.50 pesos). Secondly, the average size of subloans was smaller than
anticipated at appraisal (in thousands of Mexican pesos - LIPs8/, 650 to
571; MIPs, 353 to 298; and agroindustries, 8,226 to 2,529).     While no reasons
for this difference can be found, it is clear that the lending institutions
were much more efficient than anticipated by being able to handle a much
greater number of loans without any significant increases in their resources.
3.13      While the total number of subloans under the Sixth Project
(14,900) was almost equal that estimated at appraisal, there was quite a
difference in the mix of loans, whereby the number of crop loans increased by
99% while livestock loans decreased by 43% (Table 6). The average size of
loans declined (in thousands of Mexican pesos, for crops 1,214 to 670, and
agroindustries 3,600 to 1,800). The significant increase in crop loans
reflected the Government policy of encouraging the increased production of
basic food crops.
3.14      It was estimated at the appraisal of the Fifth loan that 46,000
families would directly benefit from the subloans, of which about 80% would
be LIPs, several of whom would receive institutional investment credit for
the first time. In addition, the relatively poor sections of the rural
population was also to benefit from the substantial increase in employment
opportunities (a total of about 20,000 man-days in the first three years)
under the project. FIRA reported that 145,000 producers benefited directly
from the project, of which about 81% were LIPs9/. For the Sixth Project, it
6/ For details see Table 7.
7/ See Table 8.
8/ While average LIP loans are greater than average MIP loans, the amount per
beneficiary is much less for LIPs since most of these loans were for
groups of ten or more ejidatarios while MIP loans were usually for
individual owners.
9/ For explanation see footnote 8/ pp. 6



was expected that about 67,000 families would directly benefit under the
livestock and agricultural components, and, at full development, 9,000
full-time jobs and 9,000 man-years of employment would be created. FIRA has
reported that 142,800 beneficiaries have received funds under the project.
However, the above numbers included some elements of double counting, as
repeater loans were included in FIRA's records.
3.15      FIRA's lending to ejidos under the Sixth Project increased
substantially from 65% to 77% of LIPs.    Less was lent to individual
ejidatarios, as participating private banks preferred to lend to groups of
farmers instead of to individuals because of the cost advantages.
Regional Distribution of Rediscounts
3.16      About 50% of FIRA's lending program is directed to the relatively
rich irrigation areas in Mexico's Northwest, Northeast, and Central Districts
(Table 9).    However, FIRA has now been making efforts to diversify its
program to reach producers in the more marginal areas.
Crop and Livestock Program
3.17      Project investments for crop and livestock are summarized in Table
10. The project investments shown for FIRA V refer only to subloans made and
do not include producers' contributions, since this information is not
available.
3.18      Under the Fifth Project, 65% of the total livestock investment,
related to the acquisition of breeding cattle and 31% to construction and
irrigation. Perennial crops represented 49% of LIP investments and 39% of
total investments in crop production. Of the total investment in crop
production, machinery and equipment, mainly tractor purchases, accounted for
37%, while on-farm irrigation and land improvement together accounted for
24%.
3.19      By contrast, in the Sixth Project 50% of the total livestock
investment was for purchases of animals and about 33% for construction and
irrigation.    Machinery and equipment investments were again high,
representing 50% of all crop production investments. Perennial crops
represented 33% of LIP investments. Breeding stock procurement made up 50%
of total livestock investment. In some cases, according to Bank supervision
missions, subloans financed replacement of inferior quality animals (mainly
dairy) with animals of higher quality.
Agroindustries Program
3.20      The number of agroindustrial enterprises financed under FIRA V and
VI were 189 and 511, respectively, compared to 93 and 326 estimated at
appraisal (Table 9).    Only about 20% of projects financed in the Fifth
Project related to new investments, the remainder relating to extensions,
modifications and modernization of existing enterprises. The majority of
expenditure was for additional machinery, machinery modifications and factory
extensions and modernization. Over 90% of subloans were to MIPs and
approximately 75% were loaned through private banks.



- 8 -
3.21      The Sixth Project continued the trend of the Fifth with investments
in existing projects still remaining high and the majority of expenditures
again relating to machinery and buildings. LIP's participation remained at
less than 10% of total lending and about 85% was financed through private
banks.
Technical Services
3.22      The Fifth Project allocated US$9.2 million of the loan proceeds for
demonstration facilities, training programs and monitoring and evaluation of
the impact of the project. That amount was later reduced to US$2 million
(para 3.03), but FIRA's total expenditure of about US$15 million for
technical assistance and training in 1978 and 1979 which far exceeded the
amount included in the project for such activities, allowing FIRA to maintain
its program.
3.23      FIRA, in connection with the Fifth Project, started a
"Demonstration Program for Integrated Enterprises" (PRODIE) that included
seven farming systems in six different regions, with the objective of finding
and propagating efficient methods of management and production adequate for
group farming in the different areas of the country. The program selected
farming communities representative of each region. FIRA's technicians helped
design an investment project, organized a training program for the farmers
and provided intensive technical assistance to the operation in its initial
stages. Bank supervision missions found PRODIE and other demonstration
efforts to be playing a very positive role in demonstrating low cost
production techniques and in furthering the management capabilities of
"ejidos."
3.24      Of the US$7.2 million allocated for technical services in the Sixth
Project, including the foreign exchange costs of vehicles and training aids,
only US$3.7 million remained after reallocations (para 3.03). However, this
reduction did not affect the quality or quantity of technical services
provided under the project since FIRA used part of its existing staff and
facilities for this purpose. The cost of this was Mex$59 million and was
borne by FIRA through its general budget. Thus, including these funds, Mex$
229 were spent for technical services directly related to the project of
which 71% was allocated for technical assistance to farmers. Part of the
remaining funds were used to construct four new demonstration centers and to
help modernize 19 others.
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.25      Under the fourth credit project, FIRA had established a monitoring
and evaluation unit ("Registros Continuos"), which was not fully operational
until the final phase of disbursement. Information gathering was restricted
to a sample survey of LIP's farming enterprises and results were inadequate
and inconclusive.
3.26      With the agreement of the Bank, the "Registros Continuos" Unit in
early 1977, selected 446 sample farms to collect data regularly over a period
of five years. Samples were selected on a stratified random basis by farming



- 9 -
systems to represent the main livestock and cropping activities financed by
FIRA. The random selection of samples, representative of each activity, was
restricted geographically to those parts of the country in which each
activity was concentrated. They were classified as LIPs (ejidal), LIPs
(individuals), and MIPs on the basis of 150, 83, and 213 samples,
respectively, to represent milk production (in temperate areas), dual purpose
(milk/beef in humid/subhumid tropics), beef (arid areas), annual crops,
(irrigated and rainfed) and perennial crops.
3.27      To date, the Unit has analyzed data collected through 1980 and this
data forms the basis of the impact analysis of both the Fifth and Sixth
Projects. It is not possible to assess statistically the representativeness
of this sample, but, based on recent observations of a Bank field mission, it
was concluded that the sample was adequate in terms of activity and area.
However, it was considered that more effort could have been made to increase
the number of samples, particularly after the first few years when the Unit's
field staff had established a routine for handling their alloted samples and
had gained more experience. Since then FIRA has taken steps to improve this
area (para. 5.14).
3.28      The Bank had provided, as part of the technical services program
in the Sixth Project funds to assist in the financing of the development of
the monitoring and evaluation    system.  These funds were, however,
reallocated (para 3.03) and the total program was financed by FIRA from its
own resources.
Consultants' Services
3.29       The Bank had provided for up to 60 man-months of consulting
services to assist with local training and further improvement to dairy
production, and 12 man-months of consulting services for the FIRA monitoring
program. Although the Bank pressed for the use of these consultancy
services, FIRA was reluctant to meet the Bank's requirements for
consultants. These funds were later reallocated.
Compliance with Loan Conditions
3.30      In both the Fifth and the Sixth Projects, it was agreed that there
would be a producers' contribution.     FIRA maintained no aggregate
information on the beneficiaries' contribution, and there were no clear
guidelines for the participating banks requiring the proper recording of this
information until late in the Sixth Project. Moreover, occasional sampling
by the Bank supervision missions of subloan evaluation reports found several
instances of no or inadequate contributions by sub-borrowers to help meet the
total investment costs of a subproject.
3.31      While in both projects a precise definition of LIP and MIP subloan
beneficiaries was agreed upon at negotiations (Table 1), the Bank of Mexico
issued a different definition. Reviews by supervision missions of sample
subloan evaluations showed that in many cases beneficiaries' income was
higher than allowed in the Project Agreement, but this was attributed to use
of the Bank of Mexico definition. FIRA, on the recommendation of the Bank,



- 10 -
issued instructions to participating financial institutions on the correct
definition. However, the necessary internal control procedures to improve
compliance did not become effective until the Seventh Project.
3.32      FIRA did not maintain adequate records to determine the number of
project beneficiaries, excluding repeater loans. However, in other respects,
adequate records were maintained to record project operations.
3.33      There is no evidence to indicate that procurement procedures, as
outlined in the loan documents, were not adhered to under both projects.
Accounts and Audit
3.34      FIRA maintained separate project accounts within its overall
accounting system. This system was audited annually by independent,
qualified Mexican firms of accountants. Certified copies of the audited
financial statements were sent to the Bank annually.
Reporting Requirements
3.35      FIRA had undertaken to appoint a senior professional in the Office
of Planning to be responsible for the preparation and submission of reports
to the Bank, as well as coordinating the various activities relating to the
projects. Although FIRA had submitted quarterly reports as was required,
there were delays and reports were not always conclusive. Information
relating to producers' contributions, number of beneficiaries, and the
regular impact analysis was not received.
IV. PROJECT IMPACT
4.01      Notwithstanding the limited sample, the completion mission has been
able to conclude that the Fifth and Sixth Projects had favorable impact on
production and farm income, as well as supporting low-income producers to
transform their farming operations into commercial enterprises. Through
these projects, FIRA financed a wide array of investments for crop and
livestock development plus agroindustries expansion. During project
implementation, 36,400 subloans were made, compared to 14,800 estimated at
appraisal, covering an area of 3.9 million ha. As shown in Table 10, the
bulk of FIRA's lending was for crop production, especially under FIRA VI,
reflecting the Government's emphasis on grain production during that period.
Technical Services
4.02      At the very outset of the Bank's association with FIRA under the
first credit project in 1965, the need for FIRA and its other institutions to
develop strong technical capabilities was recognized for using farm credit
operations as a vehicle for accelerating the introduction of appropriate
technologies into Mexican agriculture. Unfortunately at this time, official
research (particularly applied research) and extension services were weak,
ineffective, badly organized and poorly funded. Although this situation has



- 11 -
improved dramatically since the mid-1970s, much support is still needed
before these services can meet all the demands of the Mexican agricultural
production complex.   One of the most pressing needs is a system to speed up
the integration of new technologies into farming systems which will maximize
the effectiveness of on-farm credit.
4.03       In this regard,  FIRA has played and continues to play an important
role. The Bank has continued to support these efforts in all seven credit
projects it has financed to date, not only through funding, but also through
many formal and informal contacts between technicians of the Bank and FIRA.
Today FIRA is recognized in Mexico as one of the leading institution in the
development of technologies appropriate for the country's small, medium, and
large farmer groups.
4.04      FIRA's strategy for promoting technological transfer is based
mainly on the concept of demonstration/training centers. Centers are gene-
rally single purpose and are located in ecological environments appropriate
to the technological package being promoted. They are generally situated on
farmers lands (mostly ejidos) under agreements whereby the farmer(s) provide
land and labor with FIRA providing funds for establishment and operations.
As soon as the centers become established, they meet their own operational
costs (including farm labor).
4.05      In 1972 FIRA had about eight centers concentrating mainly on
developing low cost livestock production technologies. Today there are 90
centers countrywide where, in addition to livestock, work on a range of
annual and perennial crops is underway. Also, there are centers specializing
in drip irrigation techniques, improved tree seedling production, seed and
rhizobium production, and agroindustries; additionally, coordinated programs
with SARH in dairy production systems and tick control are in operation, and
each year some 200 demonstration plots of up to 5 ha are financed in farmers
fields.
Yields Production and Project Output
4.06      As Table 12 shows, the after-investment yields for annual crops
financed under both projects were generally higher than the appraisal
estimates, particularly in the irrigated areas for wheat where yields were
4.2 to 4.8 tons per ha, compared to 3.2 to 4.0 tons/ha estimated at
appraisal. Likewise, sorghum yields were 5.1 to 5.6 tons/ha compared to 3.5
tons per ha estimated and cotton 2.7 to 2.9 tons/ha compared to 2.2 tons per
ha estimated. In the dry land areas, yields of maize were about the same as
appraisal values, while, for beans, actual yields were less for both LIP
(ejidal) and LIP (individual) groups, but greater for the MIP groups.
Working with FIRA technicians, however, ejido groups in various parts of the
country obtained significant increases in average maize yields under rainfed
and irrigated conditions, demonstrating that LIPs can produce high yields of
annual crops equally as efficiently as MIP farmers with technical and
institutional support given under the projects.
4.07      As was the case for annual crops, the performance of the livestock
sample groups -- representing intensive dairy production in the plateau



- 12 -
states, dual-purpose (milk/beef) production in the semi-humid/humid tropic
states, and beef production in the semi-arid/arid northern states -- compared
favorably with appraisal estimates, as shown in Table 13.
4.08      Of particular note were the high milk yields/head for the intensive
dairy operations, particularly from the LIP (ejidal) and MIP farms, which
averaged 4,800 and 5,300 liters per lactation, respectively, reflecting
better management of these farm types compared with the LIP (individual)
farms (3,350 liters per lactation).    The studies showed that the larger LIP
(ejidal) and MIP dairy units were more receptive to the adoption of modern
intensive milk production technology than the LIP (individual) units which
did not have the resources to provide the high managerial input required to
sustain the production levels achieved by the other groups.     In addition,
FIRA has shown at its centers in temperate areas that the cost of milk
production based on irrigated pasture grazing system can be reduced by 45%
compared to the traditional stabling system.    Reductions of 40% have also
been made in the costs of rearing replacement heifers while yields per
lactation have increased to 5,000 liters/cow compared with the traditional
yield of 4,500 liters. However, in the predominantly dual-purpose production
areas of the sub-humid and humid tropics, production of beef and milk per
hectare for the LIP (individual) farmers groups was considerably higher than
for the other two groups, since the LIP individual farmers made more
intensive use of their limited land resource.
4.09       In tropical areas FIRA has demonstrated that a management system
based on sown pastures and legumes can greatly increase carrying capacities
and the production of milk and meat per hectare. Above all, it has been
demonstrated that such systems can be managed by ejido groups given technical
backstoping.   Other results in seed production, seedling tree production and
small animal operations have been equally impressive.
4.10      The incremental production, as shown below, of annual crops, milk
and beef for both projects, estimated from the sample data, were about equal
to or greater than the appraisal estimates, except for maize for which the
actual output was only 30% of the estimated values due largely to the
unsatisfactory guaranteed price for maize through 1980. On the other hand,
actual incremental production of wheat for which prices were more favorable,
was some 100% greater than the appraisal estimate. Of the livestock
products, milk production was about 200% greater than estimated at appraisal
in spite of the low farmgate prices and escalating feed costs which prevailed
from 1977 to 1981.    Over this period, milk output from the traditional
production areas in the plateau states fell by 30%, with many farmers
changing from dairying to more remunerative cropping activities. Although
the project farmers were affected by the unfavorable cost/price situation,
they were nonetheless willing to increase output.    This was partly due to the
replacing of inferior animals with better quality animals with high
production levels.
4.11      The annual incremental production and appraisal estimates for both
projects are as follows:

Revised Estimate Based     Appraisal

------------ (000 tons) -----------
Maize                            136                   682
Wheat                            238                   121
Beans                             56                    62
Sorghum                          187                   151
Cotton                           57                     56
Milk                             659                   210
Beef                              82                    54
4.12      Table 14 shows the estimated before and after development incomes
of beneficiaries. Incomes of LIP individuals were much higher than estimated
at appraisal. In the case of the LIP (ejidal) group, the after-development
net family incomes for dairy enterprises were lower than before development,
while the increases for annual irrigated and rainfed crops were minimal.
However, the labor input of these operations was much higher than for
equivalent LIP (individual) and MIP operations.      It was found that, by
mutual consent, the ejidatario group members most often preferred to be
working members and to receive wages even though this often resulted in
overemployment. When these wages are taken into account, actual family
incomes were some Mex$ 30,000 more and much greater than their incomes before
development. The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit concluded that the overall
social impact of the projects on the LIP (ejidal) operations was
significant. Under the projects, it is estimated that about 35,000
additional full and part-time jobs per year were created, considerably more
than the combined appraisal estimates of 20,000.
Financial and Economic Returns
4.13       The financial rates of return for both annual and perennial crop
enterprises ranging from 18 to 30% (Table 15), calculated from the monitoring
data, were favorable for all farmer groups, indicating that the on-farm
investment plans were well conceived and executed. In the case of the
livestock enterprises, the financial returns for LIPs (individuals) and MIPs
were also satisfactory ranging from 13% to 56%. With the LIP (ejidal) group
the returns were only -11% for dairy and 2% for dual-purpose enterprises.
However, when incomes for the LIP (ejidal) operations were adjusted to
include the wages of participating ejidos (para. 4.12), the returns for these
operations were also satisfactory, at about 12% for dairy and 13% for dual-
purpose enterprises.
4.14       Revised economic rates of return for both projects have been
calculated by FIRA based on 1978 constant prices, using the shadow wage rate
of 55% times the nominal wage. Output prices utilized were 1981 forecast
prices in 1978 constant terms for maize, wheat, sorghum, cotton, soybeans,
cocoa and coffee, which were adjusted for handling processing and transport
to reach a farmgate equivalent. Other outputs were priced according to
market conditions.   The economic return for both projects was 35%, while the
economic returns for Loan 1217-ME and Loan 1569-ME were 34% and 37%,
respectively. The appraisal estimate for 1569-ME was 28% and, although no
overall return was estimated for 1217-ME, the returns on individual farm
models calculated at the appraisal ranged from 20% to 29%.



- 14 -
4.15       FIRA also estimated the economic rates of return for the various
cropping and livestock enterprises for each farmer group (Table 15), and
except for the dairy operations for both groups of LIP farmers and the LIP
(ejidal) dual-purpose operations, all were satisfactory. The low returns for
LIP farmers were due mainly to a combination of high labor input and low milk
prices in the case of LIP (ejidal) and a higher-than-average cost/price
relation for the smaller LIP (individual) production units.
Future Strategies
4.16      In spite of the often excellent results obtained at many of the
FIRA-supported demonstration/training centers in developing new farming
systems that were more profitable than traditional systems (and equally
safe), the adoption rate by surrounding farmers could be improved
substantially.   The shortfall is probably because FIRA has concentrated most
of its efforts on the actual work of developing new farming systems and
maintaining the centers, and apart from minor efforts such as local field
days, generally neglected widespread promotional work. This fact was
mentioned time and again by Bank supervision missions from 1976 onward and
FIRA was urged to strengthen this part of its demonstration center
activities, but only recently has FIRA taken steps to improve the situation
with its decentralization program.      The demonstration centers have been
reorganized into a separate division with headquarters in Cuernavaca, but
responsibility for their management now rests with state and regional
centers of FIRA. Formal and informal contacts with technicians from SARH
irrigation and rainfed districts, the local and private banks, and producers
are being stepped up, and joint efforts to develop ejido lands, involving
FIRA, SARH and private, public and mixed banks, have been commenced in some
parts of the country. These efforts, however, should be watched by the Bank
in future supervision missions, and encourage SARH to work closely with FIRA
in the development and promotion of new farming systems.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.01      FEFA is the agricultural trust fund, of the three funds making up
FIRA, and it is the one that actually administers Bank projects. All the
funds are financially secure and consistently earn annual profits (Table
18).
Financial Position of FEFA
5.02      At the end of 1981, of the total liability of Mex$ 32,600 million,
Mex$ 23,100 million was owed to Banco de Mexico and may be considered loan
capital (Table 18).   FIRA does not have any bad debts as collections from the
participating banks are made automatically through the Bank of Mexico.
5.03      FEFA's operating profits of Mex$ 1,284 million in 1979 (38% of
gross income) has since decreased steadily to Mex$ 806 million in 1981 (10%
of gross income), reflecting the increasing cost of funds which represented
72% of gross income in 1982, compared to 60% in 1980 and 43% during the years



- 15 -
1977 to 1979. The cost of funds as a percentage of loans receivable,
representing over 90% of total assets, was 11.8% in 1981, compared to 7.6% in
1980 and 5.5% in 1979. This is a result of using increasingly external funds
since 1980 at commercial interest rates and, as of 1981, absorbing some
foreign exchange risks. While FIRA's profits still remain reasonably high,
the trend of declining profits arising from the increasing cost of funds and
the possibility of absorbing further foreign exchange risks will seriously
affect FIRA's future profitability and financial security. The solution to
this lies with, either with devising an adjustment system linking interest
rates closely to ACF, or for Government to lower the cost of funds to FIRA.
Program of Rediscounts
5.04      The expansion of FIRA's rediscount program has been impressive,
with annual growth rates of about Mex$ 10 billion in the last three years
(Table 16). The investment in annual crops has increased since 1978 at the
expense of livestock investments, reflecting the Government's emphasis on
basic food production. As a consequence, FIRA's rediscount mix is now about
equally divided between short, medium and long term funds compared to about
five years ago when the proportion of medium and long term funds were
higher.  After a significant fall to 14% of total lending in 1978, FIRA's
lending to LIPs has progressively increased to 44% in 1981. The growth in
rediscounts to MIPs reflects FIRA's success in consolidating the involvement
of the private banking sector in lending to commercial agricultural
producers.   From 1977 to 1981, 83% of FIRA's total lendings went through
private and mixed banks, representing 99% of short-term and 66% of medium-
and long-term lendings.
Fund Substitution
5.05      The continuing high demand for agricultural credit whereby it is
estimated that only about 30% to 40% of farmers receive institutional credit
and the fact that FIRA approves only about 65% of the total credit
requirements of the participating banks in 1980 suggests that there was no
fund substitution at the institution level.    However, while there was no
positive evidence of fund substitution, FIRA loaned at relatively low
interest rates throughout the implementation period and some subloans were
made to producers whose finances indicated they could possibly have been
financed at higher rates.
Source of Funds
5.06      Bank loans played an important role in the early 1970s up to 1975,
representing, on average, about 20% of FIRA's lending program compared to 5%
in 1981 (Table 17). FIRA's increased lending program was supported mainly
with domestic funds from Banco de Mexico, plus funds recuperated fromsub-
loans. The Government paid the amortization on foreign loans and, until
1981, absorbed all foreign exchange losses. Since 1980, external funds have,
however, progressively increased as a percentage of total funding (20%),
resulting in the higher cost to FIRA (Table 18).



- 16-
Technical Services
5.07      The introduction of appropriate improved production technologies as
the prime ingredient for success in its agricultural credit has been pursued
by FIRA since the mid-1960s (para 4.02). From 1970 to 1981, technical
assistance costs varied from 1.88% to 3.26% of total outstanding loans. In
addition to the concept of delivering technology through demonstration
centers (para 4.04), FIRA conducts training courses for its own technical
staff -- including scholarships outside the country -- for participating
banks' technicians and for the beneficiaries themselves. There were 2,600
courses between 1976 to 1981, beginning with 219 courses in 1976 and
increasing to 700 in 1981. Likewise, there were 34,700 participants in these
courses, beginning at 2,800 in 1976 increasing to 11,400 in 1981.     Low-income
producers comprised 41% of the course participants.
5.08      The total number of FIRA-approved technicians dedicated to the
evaluation of project subloans and the provisior. of technical assistance rose
from 2,800 in 1977 to 5,700 in 1981, 1,000 of whom were FIRA's own staff in
1981, the others being employed by the participating private/mixed banks.
FIRA defrays part of the cost of the participating bank staff members asso-
ciated with lending operations to ejidatarios and other low-income producers
(up to 3% of the loan amount and, in special cases, up to 6%), and issues
guarantees to private and mixed banks for the recovery of the funds they used
for subloans to LIPs. During 1977-81, total guarantees granted amounted to
Mex$ 15.4 billion, with only a 1.5% loss on recuperation.
5.09      During the years 1975-78, FIRA's technicians found it difficult to
keep pace with its increased lending program and many of its technicians
were more involved in loan evaluations than in providing technical
assistance. This has since improved with the decentralization of FIRA. FIRA
had reluctantly under the Second Project (1968) agreed to some regional
reorganization, but, while there were some physical changes, there was no
real change in the existing spirit of centralized management. In early 1981,
however, an effective reorganization was carried out in FIRA's head office by
the creation of a Subdirector General and five subdirectors. In addition,
the Regional and State offices were given greater autonomy and quality
control procedures were introduced at the regional level.
Public Banks
5.10      The Bank had envisaged that FIRA would provide a positive influence
on the operations of BANRURAL. This influence has not, however, been as
successful as hoped and FIRA has little or no influence over the technical
assistance provided by BANRURAL to sub-borrowers. The creation of FICART
to service BANRURAL exclusively as a competing rediscounting window has not
contributed to the cooperation between BANRURAL and FIRA. The lack of Bank
influence over 80% of lending to LIPs must be an important consideration for
any future credit project.   It is clear that if the Bank wishes to retain a
significant association with LIPs lending in any such project, changes in the
present organization will be needed to include FICART as the main
rediscounting agency for BANRURAL. This would require a thorough study of



- 17 -
the FICART/BANRURAL system by the Bank.    While FIRA will probably continue to
service a smaller LIP clientele through BANRURAL, most of its future
operations will probably be with MIPs and LIPs through the other banks.
Organization and Management
5.11       Until 1979, FIRA had no comprehensive manual on operating
regulations and procedures and neglected effective planning and programming,
and consequently, participating banks had no clear-cut direction regarding
investment programs or the Government's development priorities.
5.12      While FIRA's general accounting operated adequately, there were
weaknesses in its data base system and it was not possible to determine
accurately subloan beneficiaries contributions or the number of
beneficiaries that had subloans.    The system of subloan control was also
weak, resulting in errors, subsequently corrected, in the compilation of
subloans for Bank disbursement. In addition, periodic reports were usually
late because no official had been assigned to oversee the coordination of
reports and meeting of loan conditions.
5.13      The Seventh Project included specific measures to rectify the above
weaknesses, which have since either been corrected or are currently in the
process of being corrected.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.14       Although a monitoring and evaluation department was created and
sample subprojects were selected for an impact study (para 3.27), FIRA placed
minimal importance on evaluating the overall economic and social impact of
its lending activities until the late 1970s. FIRA has, however, since
changed its attitude to monitoring and evaluation, and, with the Bank's help,
has recently taken steps, under the Seventh Project, to adapt its operations
to the needs of the total FIRA operation at local, state, district, and
country levels. In addition to field supervision visits, Bank staff,
including a specialist in monitoring and evaluation from CPS, participated in
a monitoring and evaluation seminar organized for FIRA staff at Harvard in
May 1982.   It was agreed that the Bank would follow up this dialogue in
future supervisions with assistance from the staff of CPS when necessary.      It
was the department responsible for monitoring and evaluation in FIRA that
researched and developed the basis for the regional reorganization now in
place.
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.01      By and large, the scope and focus of the Fifth and Sixth Projects
were similar to previous credit projects, although the two projects supported
larger investment programs. Thus, although they supported larger investment
programs, the Fifth and Sixth Projects placed primary emphasis on beneficiary
on-lending activities supported by strong technical assistance and training
activities.



- 18 -
6.02      However, during appraisal, more attention should have been given to
institution building:   capabilities for sectoral analysis, planning and
programming, internal control system, and institutional coordination.     While
the appraisal team of the Sixth Project proposed interest rates linked to the
cost of funds (ACF), with provision for periodic adjustment, in retrospect it
seems that the matter should have been supported more vigorously during
negotiations.
6.03      The Bank's insistence on increasing the LIP component of the loans
(47% in FIRA V and 34% in FIRA VI) was effective in contributing to the
agricultural credit needs of LIPs, particularly since FIRA's total lending to
LIPs had since increased to 25% in 1980 and 44% in 1981.     While the provision
of credit was of prime importance, the inclusion of technical assistance tied
to the lending was of even greater importance, and the subsequent realloca-
tion of funds identified for the technical services category to subloans did
not affect the overall spending program of FIRA in this area.
6.04      The timing of Bank supervision missions was adequate, and the
missions reflected a reasonable level of continuity in terms of staff
participation. The thrust of the Bank's supervision work was directed toward
institutional aspects. The missions were prompt in identifying principal
issues and problems relating to project execution. Remedial actions were
recommended as necessary, although FIRA had been slow in adapting corrective
measures. Generally, the relationship between Bank staff and FIRA management
was good, and has continued to be satisfactory.
6.05      Monitoring and evaluation undertaken by FIRA at Bank prompting in
earlier projects and included in the design of the Fifth and Sixth Projects
suffered in the earlier stages of development because the activity was new to
FIRA and the Bank itself had only limited experience. The Bank did, however,
provide funds for technical consultancy, but, despite promptings, the service
was not utilized under the project. Unfortunately, it also took some time
for the Bank to convince FIRA that monitoring and evaluation of project
impact was not merely a Bank requirement, but primarily a measure that would
be of great benefit to FIRA in its overall operations.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      By and large, project objectives and targets, set at the time of
appraisal, were met under FIRA V and VI projects. Through its association
with the Bank, FIRA developed significantly to become the leading second-tier
financial institution for agricultural credit in Mexico, consistently
profitable, with a sound financial base.
7.02      FIRA's lending program, increasing from Mex$ 11.2 billion in 1977
to Mex$ 46.2 billion in 1981, has played a significant role in the
involvement of the private, mixed and public banks in lending to agriculture
and in supporting low-income producers. However, while there is a high
demand for credit, it is reasonable to assume that growth was somewhat
influenced by FIRA's negative interest rates. In developing its increased



- 19 -
lending program, FIRA has promoted agricultural diversification and
development in the farming sector, serving as an important vehiclLe for
accelerating the introduction of new and appropriate production technologies
into Mexican agriculture.
7.03      While FIRA has increased its penetration in the farming sector, it
can still play a vital role in the transfer of appropriate technology to
producers. Project results indicate that production increases came from
increased cropped land and through increased intensification and
productivity. The financial and economic rates of return of both the Fifth
and Sixth Projects were, on average, higher than appraised, based on the
available sample. However, these data could be used more by FIRA to help in
project planning strategies to ensure maximizing investment in the most
profitable enterprises. At the field level technicians also could pay more
attention to financial evaluation at the investment planning stage,
particularly ejido livestock programs which generally tend to perform less
effectively than the other farmer groups.
7.04      The inclusion of BANRURAL's participation in the projects provided
the opportunity for greater Bank influence in agricultural credit in Mexico.
However, while there was a positive influence on subloan appraisals, there
was very little influence exercised over the technical assistance provided to
the over 80% of LIPs financed under these projects.     The role and
contribution of the public banks in this field will need to be addressed
during future Bank projects.
7.05      While FIRA achieved some institutional development during the
course of the projects, with the continued improvement of its appraisal
procedures and general delivery of credit, many significant changes were not
effected until the Seventh project. As a result of the experience and
lessons gained up through the Sixth Project, the Seventh project was designed
to:
(a)  strengthen FIRA's planning mechanism and coordination with
pertinent public agencies and additional qualified staff;
(b)  provide an operating regulations and procedures manual to
furnish direction and guidelines to participating banks in
lending to agriculture;
(c)  intensify training programs for the technical staff of FIRA and
the participating banks in order to strengthen the credit and
technical assistance delivery system; and
(d)  strengthen and improve FIRA's data base system and its
monitoring and evaluation capabilities.
7.06      As a result of the Seventh Project, the reorganizations at FIRA's
head office have now been effected, complementing the regional
reorganization,along with proper delegation of authority and responsibility.
Already there are signs of increased quality control in subloans and the



- 20 -
delivery of technical assistance.    The operations regulations and procedures
manuals and the data base system are in the process of development. The
monitoring and evaluation systems are also currently being reorganized.
7.07       Interest rates during the period of the projects were generally
negative, partially because of a Government policy that called for interest
rates in agriculture to be somewhat lower than commercial rates (also
allowing a subsidy to LIPs), but mainly because of the higher than envisaged
rates of inflation during the period and lack of a mechanism for automatic
review. In the Seventh Project, the Mexican Government finally agreed to
address this problem by (a) basing the interest rates agreed at appraisal on
a formula related to the ACF; and (b) providing for annual scrutiny and
reviews in circumstances where the average ACF over three consecutive months
differed by three or more points from the previous 12 months average. While
these arrangements still left flexibility as to how to determine revised
interest rates for the various categories, a basic principle of adjustment of
interest rates during the execution period was thus adopted.
7.08       FIRA will continue to have an important role in the Mexican
agricultural scene, providing funds and technical assistance to promote
agricultural expansion and development. Through its linkages with private,
mixed and public banks, FIRA can be instrumental in increasing the coverage
of institutional credit in agriculture, which is currently estimated at 30 to
40%.
7.09      To increase its leverage and to provide impetus to agriculture,
FIRA will need to mobilize additional resources, internally as well as
externally, in order to maintain a sustained financial growth of at least 10
to 15% in real terms. On the institutional front, while FIRA has worked
assiduously in streamlining its organization for improving the quality of its
investment program and its operations, there is still room for further
improvements, especially in the area of impact analysis, planning and
programming, internal control, and inter-agency coordination.
7.10       Inasmuch as the Bank has financed seven projects for a total of
US$925 million, the fundamental questions at this time are what impact has
the Bank had on FIRA and the credit subsector and what role, if any, can the
Bank play in the future.   As discussed earlier, the first question can be
answered positively. The Bank has made significant contributions, not only
in terms of resource transfer, but also in terms of institution building and
interest rate policy.
7.11      Concerning the second question, the Bank has a crucial role to play
in the future by providing continued support to FIRA. In the area of
institutional improvements, more emphasis, within the confines of the next
project, should be directed toward improving the quality of FIRA's:
(a) planning and programming capabilities, particularly with respect to
preparation of projects in line with Government agricultural development
policies (para. 5.11); (b) expanding the scope of its monitoring and
evaluation to encompass evaluation of FIRA's whole investment portfolio
(para. 5.14); and (c) improving its internal control system, particularly to
obtain better coordination between financial, technical, and operational
activities (para. 5.12).

7.12      The problem of negative interest rates increased over the life of
the projects (paras. 3.10, 3.11) and even though steps were taken to correct
this under the Seventh Project, the problem continues. Indeed interest rates
are more negative today than ever before. Clearly it would be impossible for
the Bank to continue to operate with FIRA under conditions of constant
erosion of interest rates. One solution appears that FIRA could adopt an
adjustable rate system linked to ACF as already adopted by some of the trust
funds in the Bank of Mexico. However, while recognizing the desirability
that all rates be maintained at or near positive levels, it must be realized
that there are still large numbers of low-income farmers starved for credit
and for whom some measure of interest subsidization can be justified. To the
extent that this is accepted in Mexico, a case can be made to provide FIRA
with low-interest Government funds, so that its cash flow position will not
suffer (para. 5.03).
7.13       FIRA has now requested the Bank to consider an Eighth Project and
within the framework of such an exercise, FIRA should (a) prepare a position
paper, highlighting its finances and operations, achievements, strategy and
targets for further lending, and credit needs within agriculture and
outlining its perceived role in promoting agricultural growth and reducing
regional imbalances; (b) discuss its program for institutional strengthening
and staff development; (c) determine a more concise definition of
beneficiaries and various target groups; and (d) prepare a proposal outlining
an adjustable interest rate structure linked to the cost of funds. Moreover,
the Government should clearly define the boundaries of operation for the
various trust funds and public banks dealing with agriculture, for example,
FIDEC, which is now also involved in marketing. Also, because Government has
asked the Bank to consider operating directly with FICART, the respective
roles of FIRA and FICART in any future project(s) needs clarification along
the lines outlined in para. 5.10.

1/  In the intensive dairy operations a large percentage of productivity was due to purchased
concentrate feeds and roughages. Thus the production data/ha shown above do not indicate
the actual productivity if all feed had been home grown. The before and after investment
comparison is therefore merely a measure of the increase in intensiveness which resulted
from the investment program.

Dear Mr. Kapur:
Fifth and Sixth Projects
Loans 1217-ME and 1569-ME
Project Completion Report
We refer to your letter of October 20 enclosing the Project
Completion Report on the Fifth and Sixth Projects. We feel that the Report
gives a true and objective picture of FIRA's situation at the time when the
loans were disbursed (1976-June 1981). However, to give a more accurate
idea of the part played by FIRA in the above-mentioned projects, we are
attaching a number of observations and comments.
Yours, etc.

OBSERVATIONS AND COMMENTS ON THE PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ON THE FIFTH AND SIXTH IBRD PROJECTS
(Loans 1217-ME and 1569-ME)
Point 1.01 It is stated at the end of this paragraph that FIRA operates
mainly through the private banks for lending to MIPs and the
best of the low-income producers. We would point out that FIRA
operates with the entire sector of LIPs, not only with best
ones, and that if its results have been satisfactory this is
because the loans are accompanied by technical packages enabling
those producers to improve their production and productivity.
Point 3.29 With respect to the use of consultants, FIRA did its best to
find consultants who could really help solve its problems during
project execution, unfortunately without positive results in
most cases. However, consultants' services were used to improve
the system for measuring credit impact and the electronic
computing system, and foreign advisers were used to help with
livestock production in tropical areas, cultivation of tropical
fruit trees, and training. Nevertheless, many of these
expenditures were financed out of FIRA's own resources, and
consequently the World Bank was not notified.
Point 3.30  It is customary for FIRA to provide ample information both to
the participating banks and their experts and to its own experts
concerning the characteristics of projects in which
international sources are participating, including information



-43                                ANNEX I
Page 3 of 4
on the conditions to be met by subloans if they are to be
financed under those projects. The technical experts were duly
informed of the conditions of the Fifth and Sixth projects,
including the producers' obligation to contribute certain
percentages of the investment out of their own resources.
However, the participating banks, including BANRURAL, took some
time to adapt to these new provisions for making the producers'
contribution obligatory. The problem has now been solved.
Point 5.10 1. The influence that the World Bank hoped FIRA would have over
BANRURAL's operations did in fact have positive results, albeit
to a limited extent. This influence consisted mainly in credit
approval procedures, based on a technical appraisal of the
beneficiary prior to granting of the credit. The official banks
in existence prior to the creation of BANRURAL did not use this
credit analysis system, and it was not until they started their
discounts with FIRA that they introduced the FIRA mechanism.*
2.  However, despite FIRA's efforts and attempts to work on a
more coordinated basis with BANRURAL, the latter did not
cooperate, a situation that became worse with the creation of
FICART, increasing its financial independence and consequently
reducing its need for other resources.
3. Moreover, BANRURAL's LIP participation in the Fifth and
Sixth Projects is not indicative of FIRA's total activity, in
which BANRURAL's participation averages only about 20% a year of
total discounts to LIPs.

4. We would point out that the credit needs of the agricultural
sector in general and of the LIP sector in particular are so
great that the participation of all sources is required, for
which reason we feel that FIRA can increase the flow of
resources to this subsector even further through the
nationalized banking system, which has substantial experience in
serving the LIPs, with better results and at lower cost. We
therefore believe that the next stage will be to improve the
operating procedures of the official banking system until its
efficiency level is at least equal to that of the nationalized
system.
5. Lastly, while it is stated that there were some shortcomings
in implementation of the Fifth and Sixth Projects, these have
already been corrected in the Seventh Loan.

Subject: Loans 1217-ME and 1569-ME
Dear Mr. Kapur:
I refer to your letter of October 20, 1982 enclosing the Project
Completion Report on the referenced loans, in which you asked us for our
comments so that they could be included in the report to be submitted by your
department to the Executive Directors of the World Bank.
I take the liberty of enclosing a number of comments by our
organization on the report in question, which we trust will serve your
purposes.

Comment on Project Completion Report
for Loans 1217-ME and 1569-ME
Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NAFINSA), in its capacity as financial
agent of the Mexican Federal Government, is pleased to have been able to
contribute to the success of the loans that have for some time been extended.
to the Banco de Mexico (BANXICO) by the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD). The success of these operations is evidenced by the
fact that IBRD has on a number of occasions agreed to grant BANXICO the
largest loans till then granted to any institution.
The loans under discussion here were intended to finance credit
assistance programs through the rondo de Garantia y Fomento a la Agricultura,
Ganaderia y Avicultura (FIRA). These were the fifth and sixth such loans to
the BANXICO trust fund.
We are in agreement with IBRD in describing the development of FIRA
in favorable terms, and we feel that one of the great benefits of IBRD's
financing successive FIRA programs is the capacity this working together gives
FIRA in solving problems inherent in credit programs. Consequently, we are
certain that even if a number of problems which arose in connection with loan
1567-ME have not been resolved, they will find a solution in loan 1891-ME. An
answer has indeed already been found, at least contractually, for some of
these problems, such as the amount and adjustment of interest rate schedules
for crop subloans, and also appropriate measures for better channeling of
credit resources under the programs.



- 47 -                         ANNEX II
Page 3 of 5
We share IBRD's desire to see FIRA programs channel greater resources
to lower-income farmers, so as to avoid any form of poor distribution of
credit in the countryside, without however in any way leading to a
decapitalization of FIRA.
We are confident that the measures taken by the President of the
Republic for the nationalization of the banking industry will promote better
planning of agricultural activities now that BANXICO has been provided with
the necessary authority and instruments for carrying this out.
I now take the liberty of putting forward a few comments on matters
which we feel to be important:
Macroeconomic Policies: In view of the results achieved with loan 1569-ME, in
particular the orientation of resources to crop production as opposed to
stockraising (IBRD financing to category (l)(a)(i) (agricultural subloans to
low-income farmers) rose from the programmed figure of US$32,100,000 to an
amended figure of US$55,600,000), as a result of the attention devoted by the
Government to the production of basic foodstuffs under the Mexican Food System
(SAM) program, we should indeed pay greater attention to the consequences that
the Government's macroeconomic policies can have on lending, as was the case
here with the SAM program. This applies all the more when the Bank is
extending sizable loans to finance FIRA programs and particularly when we bear
in mind that nationalization of the banks will make agricultural planning
possible.
Interest rates: We feel that the problems arising from the schedule and
mechanisms for adjusting interest rates have now been solved in loan 1891-ME.
However, we do feel it necessary to point out that interest rates are never
more than an economic tool or instrument, never an end in themselves, so that
changes in interest rates should not respond solely to increases or decreases



ANNEX II
- 48 -
Page 4 of 5
in the cost of raising funds, but changes in rates should be placed in a
global context whose principal objective is and will remain self-sufficiency
in foodstuffs.
Contributions by Beneficiaries:    The fifth and sixth FIRA programs contained
a provision requiring subborrowers to contribute some capital of their own to
investments financed by FIRA, but to date this requirement has not been
fulfilled. We are of the opinion that it is important to insist that
beneficiaries should participate financially in their own ventures, and
reinvest all their resources in their farms, so that in the future BANXICO can
devote itself primarily to those farmers who require the most assistance.
Channeling of Resources:    The problems that have arisen between BANXICO and
IBRD regarding the amounts set aside to finance low-income farmers call for a
definition of the type of farmer to be supported by FIRA as well as definition
of the type of farmers to be supported by the Fideicomiso para Cr6ditos en
Areas de Riego y de Temporal (FICART), a trust fund set up within the Banco
Nacional de Credito Rural, S.A. (BANRURAL), so as to enable each institution
to assign resources to the appropriate category of farmers.
Participation by NAFINSA: As financial agent for the Federal Government,
NAFINSA should be informed both by BANXICO and by IBRD on the progress of
loans, particularly in regard to contractual requirements affecting all the
parties involved in the loan process. Nevertheless, neither IBRD nor even
less BANXICO has shown any interest in informing NAFINSA on the performance of
contractual clauses. Even during the frequent supervision missions and the
project completion mission no invitation was extended to NAFINSA, giving rise
to misunderstandings, disagreements and misinformation that in one way or
another affected the progress of the loan. We hope that, as a result of our



ANNEX II
- 49 -                        Page 5 of 5
sending you these remarks, you will no longer reach any agreements or accept
any reports regarding performance of contractual provisions without NAFINSA's
having participated or at least having been informed.
