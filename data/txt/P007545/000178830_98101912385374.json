Project\n            seeks to increase the production of key agricultural\n            commodities to meet demand in a rapidly expanding domestic\n            market, as well as to increase income and employment in\n            rural areas. It will provide medium- and long-term credit\n            for investment in livestock production, annual and perennial\n            crop development, and agroindustries. It will include a\n            low-income producer's component, comprising\n            approximately one-third of the lending program, for\n            producers with net annual earnings of less than 1,000 times\n            the regional minimum daily wage. A program of applied\n            research, training and monitoring will provide technical\n            support to credit operations. About 67,000 families will\n            benefit from the project; their real incomes are expected\n            to, on the average, double within six years. The project\n            will create over 14,000 full-time jobs and about 4,000\n            man-years of temporary employment annually. The project has\n            no special risks."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
