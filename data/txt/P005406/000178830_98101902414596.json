channel of financing for local communes. The\n            project will provide a line of credit and technical\n            assistance to FEC to help finance revenue-earning\n            infrastructure projects. In view of the insufficient\n            appraisal and supervision capability of FEC and the\n            inadequate personnel and financial resources of the local\n            communes, the project is designed on a pilot basis, focusing\n            on strengthening FEC as an institution. The project will\n            increase the availability of water supply and sewerage,\n            electricity, urban development and transportation, as well\n            as warehouses, markets and slaughterhouses in local communes\n            dispersed throughout Morocco."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
