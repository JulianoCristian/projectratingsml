       Fiscal Reform Loan (FFRFRL) aims to support the regions of\n            the Russian Federation in developing and implementing fiscal\n            reform programs that will promote financial transparency,\n            budgetary accountability, and strenghtened fiscal management\n            policies and practices at the regional level. It is\n            undertaken in the context of recent improvements in the\n            framework for fiscal federalism in Russia. The adjustment\n            loam provides financing to the Federal Budget to support a\n            broad range og reforms. The government will create a\n            Regional Fiscal Reform Fund (RFRF), a separate transfer\n            mechanism in the Federal budget, specifically to reward, on\n            a competitive basis, regions that have undertaken\n            significant fiscal reforms. Operation of the RFRF will be\n            governed by procedures agreed between the Bank and the\n            Government, including the process and timing of disbursement\n            to regional budgets. Three tranches will be released based\n            on the accomplishment of agreed upon conditionality. Key\n            benefits of the project include improved fiscal management,\n            greater budgetary transparency and accountability, more\n            effective use of resources, and in the longer term, improved\n            service delivery at the regional level of government."}, "docdt": "2001-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
