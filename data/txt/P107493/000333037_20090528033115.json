objectives of the\n            Economic Governance Reform Grant Program (EGRG) for\n            Guinea-Bissau are to: (i) promote efficiency, transparency,\n            and accountability in the use of public resources through\n            improved public financial management (PFM); and (ii) foster\n            private sector development mainly through the development of\n            a modern legal framework for private investment and\n            improvements in the business environment. The series aims to\n            support the government's efforts to implement the\n            country's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).\n            Specifically, the one-tranche development policy grant (EGRG\n            I) in the amount of SDR 5.4 million (US$8 million\n            equivalent) focuses on reforms that will help promote\n            efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of\n            public resources, and foster private sector development by\n            reducing the up-front costs and uncertainties of business\n            creation and promoting a level playing field for private\n            investors. These two planks are critical components of PRSP\n            pillars one (good governance, macroeconomic stability, and\n            public administration reform); and two (private sector-led\n            growth). The grant is thus an integral part of International\n            Development Association (IDA) Interim Strategy Note (ISN)\n            for Guinea-Bissau for FY09-10 planned to be presented to the\n            board together with this operation."}, "docdt": "2009-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
