The Local Government\n            Reform and Engineering Project's outcome is rated as\n            unsatisfactory, sustainability as likely, institutional\n            development impact as modest, Bank performance as highly\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance as highly\n            unsatisfactory. The results of more than a decade of Bank\n            assistance to Mozambique's cities have been\n            disappointing. The Bank needs to give more attention to the\n            role of cities in the country's economy and the\n            government's modest yet politically significant\n            decentralization reform. Continuous and rigorous oversight\n            by Bank management of Bank/borrower relations is needed to\n            detect and correct failings before project outcomes suffer.\n            A perfunctory attitude by the Bank toward borrower reports\n            of final costs, audits, and implementation completion\n            reports can undermine borrower accountability and learning\n            too. In order to succeed, projects in war-affected countries\n            must take explicit account of the conflict."}, "docdt": "2002-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
