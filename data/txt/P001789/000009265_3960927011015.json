The project will strenghten\n            the institutions responsible for planning, operation and\n            maintenance of urban services. It will assist their efforts\n            to achieve financial viability through resource mobilization\n            at the local level. It will also introduce affordable cost\n            recovery mechanisms for urban services and housing. The\n            project will focus on the rehabilitation of vital\n            infrastructure and housing in conjunction with demonstration\n            of policies that will make possible the provision of\n            resources for future maintenance. To deliver this, it will\n            bring together the following aspects: (i) the rehabilitation\n            of infrastructure networks, housing and municipal services;\n            (ii) demonstration of policies for cost recovery and\n            replicability in rehabilitation; and (iii) training and\n            technical assistance to provide human resources and\n            institutional strengthening. An integral part of the project\n            will be (iv) the creation of employment through labor\n            intensive methods of rehabilitation and lines of credit of\n            small and microenterprises."}, "docdt": "1988-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
