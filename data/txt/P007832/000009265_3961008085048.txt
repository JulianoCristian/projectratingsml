MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF
PANAMA FOR A BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Panama for US$ 35.0 million to help finance a Basic
Education Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard amortization term, grace
period, and interest rate for fixed-rate US dollars single currency loans, with an expected
disbursement period of 3-6 years. The total project cost is estimated at US$ 58.0 million.
2.    Background. The Panamanian economy is among the more prosperous and stable
in Central America, with relatively high socioeconomic indicators. Its two percent annual
population growth rate and fertility rate of 2.9 percent are the lowest in the region, and
GDP per capita is high, at US$ 2,600. But these statistics mask a highly inequitable
income distribution. In 1989, the poorest 20 percent of the population received just two
percent of national income, the lowest share in Latin America. This group has seen its
relative position worsen since 1980, when it received nearly four percent of national
income. The economy is highly segmented, between the dynamic, internationally-oriented
service sector, which generates about 75 percent of GDP, and the domestically-oriented
sector, characterized by policy-induced rigidities and low productivity. While Panama's
wealth has cushioned it from the worst economic consequences of its failure to undertake
structural adjustment, the country is paying for economic mismanagement in the forrn of
missed opportunities.
3.    Generally good indicators for basic education hide a skewed expenditure pattern
and management shortcomings evident in poor quality and inadequate coverage. Basic
education is defined as two years of preschool, primary (grades 1-6) and lower secondary
(7-9) cycles. The gross enrollment rate at the primary level is 105 percent, but only 28
percent in preschool and 77 percent at the lower secondary level (grades 7-9). Sectoral
spending has been consistently high in recent decades, and continues to be high today, at
5.1 percent of GNP and 16.4 percent of total public expenditures. But public resource
allocation for education has the effect of heightening disparities in income distribution.
Higher education serves ten percent of all students, but it receives almost one third of
public education resources, while the 1.7 percent of education expenditures allocated to
the pre-primary level is far below international levels (Costa Rica spends 3.6 percent, and
Mexico spends 6.1 percent). This is a common issue in many countries in the region
where a fixed share of budget resources is constitutionally mandated for higher education.
The Bank has started a policy dialogue with the Government to search for a more rational
allocation of budget resources among the different levels of education.
4.    Problems of educational quality are not as obvious as they are in many other
countries in the region. Panama has a well qualified teaching force, and a relatively low
student-teacher ratio of 25:1. Good textbooks are available in the market, and teachers
can select and recommend to their students those that are most suitable for the curriculum.
But the quality of education is not even. Students in the low-income brackets cannot



2
purchase their books and usually do not find them in school libraries. Multigrade classes
are taught by teachers without specialized training in the methods of multigrade teaching.
Since multigrade classes are typical of remote rural communities, it is generally the
children of the poor who attend such classes and receive an education of lesser quality.
This results in low efficiency of basic education, where it takes an average of 13 years to
complete the nine-year cycle. Little infonnation is available on student achievement, and
consequently, there is no sound basis on which to identify needs for change. The
Government thus plans to provide textbooks for poor students, and specialized training
and teaching materials for multigrade teachers. It will also develop a student achievement
evaluation systemi.
5.    Inequities also exist in the availability of educational benefits for the poor.
Enrollment rates are high at the primary level, but very few children have access to pre-
school services, even though early educational experiences have long been recognized as
improving student performance at the primary level. Pre-school education promotes
school readiness, lowers repetition and dropout rates, and improves development of
academic skills in primary school. Pre-primary education is offered mainly in kindergarten
classes attached to primary schools. A non-formal program, the Community and Family
Centers for Initial Education (CEFACEI), has been started by the Government on a small
scale, using community volunteers as educators and facilities available in the community.
Non-formal models of preschool education have been proven to be highly effective, at a
considerably lower cost than the formal models, But the CEFACEIs lack an appropriate
curriculum adapted to the culture of the disadvantaged. The kindergarten curriculum is
not easily handled by unqualified community educators, and it does not provide for
parental involvemrent in the early development of the child. The Government has
requested the Bank's assistance to provide low cost pr -school education services
targeted to the poor, and the project will expand the CEFACEI system of pre-school
education and provide it with child-centered developmental activities, adequate
educational materials, and practical training for tihe conmunity educators.
6.     Children in rural areas are often forced to drop out of school at the end of the
primary cycle, unless their parents can send them to the nearest town for the upper grades
of basic education (grades 5-9). While it is the Goverrunent's policy for all children to
complete the basic cycle, many are effectively denied access because of poverty. The
Government operates a program of scholarships for primary and secondary students
through the Instituto para la Formaci6n y Aprovechamiento de Recursos Humanos
(IFARHU), and has decided to establish a new budget line for scholarships entirely
targeted to the poor.
7.    The Ministry of Education (MOE) has an adequate institutional structure for
administration and supervision of the public school system, at the central, provincial and
district levels. However, it lacks a robust information system, and its capacity for planning
and policy-making is poor. A proposed reform of the education system has been in
preparation since 1979, when a Commission was created for that purpose by the National
Assembly. In June 1995, the National Assembly passed the Education Law which would:
(a) reinforce MOF's role in defining educational policy; (b) create an advisory body to the
MOE, conposed of representatives of parents, the Catholic church, MOE and the teachers
union; (c) extend provision of free education to two years of pre-school; and, (d) provide



3
a framework for strengthening the role of the community in education and deconcentrate
some of MOE's functions. These provisions are fully consistent with recommendations
reflected in the Bank's sector report (Report No. 13701-PAN, March 17, 1995) discussed
with the Government in May 1995. The Government has requested the Bank's assistance
in strengthening its planning and policy-making capacity through the financing of a series
of policy studies to support the medium- and long-term reforms.
8.    Primary school infrastructure compares favorably with that of many other Latin
American countries, but maintenance has been neglected. At the primary level, about 350
classrooms are severely deteriorated and need to be replaced. About 1,700 classrooms
need varying degrees of repair or rehabilitation.
9.    Government Strategy. The development goals of the Government of Panama are
a globally integrated economy and a more equitable society, driven by sustainable private
sector growth. The new Administration's economic program, "Public Policies for Social
Development with Economic Efficiency", focuses on: (1) private sector development and
employment creation; (2) fiscal adjustment and public sector modernization; (3) poverty
alleviation and human resources development; and (4) environmental conservation. The
Government's strategy for mitigating poverty and inequality consists of four chief
elements. The first is the introduction of conditions that will revive sustainable growth. In
this context, the economic program emphasizes reform policies that will mitigate the bias
against employment creation and reduce the high cost of the consumption basket. In
addition, the incentive framework will be altered to encourage increased agricultural
production and employment opportunities in the countryside, where most of the poor are
located. The second facet of the strategy is to improve efficiency and equity in social
expenditures, especially in education and health, targeting subsidies to the most vulnerable
groups. Third is the introduction of social safety net mechanisms like the ongoing Social
Investment Fund, for the financing of community-generated social development projects.
The fourth facet is institutional modernization and capacity-building of the public sector
for the efficient use of public resources.
10.   Consistent with the economic program, the Government's strategy for the
education sector assigns top priority to basic education and to ensuring equitable access
for the poor to the full benefits of education. In line with these priorities, the short-term
strategy calls for providing opportunities for poor children in rural and marginal urban
areas to receive quality educational services to achieve effective learning, and to complete
the nine years of the basic cycle. For the same purpose, the Government has decided to
extend access for the poor to pre-school education, in order to enhance their readiness and
increase their success in primary and lower secondary education, thus reducing grade
repetition and promoting efficiency of educational investments. The project will address
these Government concerns through the reorientation of the scholarship program, the
teacher training and textbook programs and the pre-school education program.
11.   In the longer term, the Government is contemplating deeper reforms of the
education system involving more equitable financing of educational costs, more active
participation of parents and NGOs in the management and financing of the schools,
updating the basic education curriculum to make it more relevant to the needs of society



4
and the demands of the economy, and developing MOE's institutional capacity for
planning and policy-making.
12.   Project Objectives. The objective of the project is to improve the quality,
efficiency and equity of the Panamanian system of basic education. Specific objectives are
to assist the Government in: (a) improving the quality of basic education; (b) improving
equity in access to basic education services for lower income children in rural and urban
marginal areas; (c) expanding coverage of pre-school education through community-
based, non-formal models; and (d) reinforcing the planning, supervision and policy-making
capacity of the Ministry of Education. The project would focus on the poorest
corregimientos containing 41 percent of the school population in grades 1-9.
13.   Project Description. In order to achieve these objectives, the project includes the
following three components: (a) Improvement of Quality of, and Expansion of
Access to, Primary and Lower Secondary Education (US$ 44.4 million or 77 percent
of total project costs) would include: (i) in-service teacher training to upgrade the
pedagogical capacities of nearly 4,000 teachers serving in the rural areas, with emphasis
on multigrade teaching techniques; (ii) provision of textbooks and teaching materials for
about 700,000 poor students, including the purchase and distribution of textbooks for
children in rural and urban marginal areas and development and distribution of educational
materials for multigrade classes; (iii) reorientation of the scholarship program to target an
additional 3,500 poor students per year; (iv) development of an education assessment
system; and, (v) rehabilitation of some 2,000 classrooms; (b) Expanding Non-Formal
Pre-School Education (US$ 5.6 million or 10 percent of total project costs) with
community participation and integration of health, nutrition, and education services at the
local level, through the CEFACEI model and a pilot mother-to-mother model; and (c)
Strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education (US$ 8.0
million or 13 percent of total project costs) through: (i) developing planning and policy-
making capacity by conducting policy studies on community participation, optimization of
budget resource allocation among the different levels of education, and delegation of
MOE's functions to regional offices; and, (ii) development of a management inforrnation
system (MIS).
14.   Project Implementation. The project would be implemented over five years by
MOE through its regular line departments. Adequate administrative capacity exists in the
central ministry offices and in the provincial and district offices to implement and supervise
implementation of the project components. A project team will be organized for each
component within the respective department, and a MOE advisory committee will provide
guidance. A small Project Administration Unit (PAU) will be established under the
Secretary General of the MOE and will have general coordination responsibility for
project implementation. A PAU Director has already been appointed to the Bank's
satisfaction. The PAU will serve as the liaison between the Bank and the MOE line units,
and it will be responsible for administration of the project. Scholarships will be
implemented by IFARHU. To assist in the construction and rehabilitation of classrooms in
the rural areas, MOE will enter into agreement with the Social Emergency Fund (FES). In
existence for four years, FES has recently been restructured with technical assistance from
IDB and UNDP. The Bank's appraisal mission concluded that IFARHU and FES have
adequate institutional capacity to implement their respective subcomponents. A

breakdown of estimated costs and financing is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Panama are provided in
Schedules C and D, respectively. The SAR, No. 15109-PAN. is also attached.
15.   Actions Agreed. During negotiations, the Government agreed to: (a) conduct
Annual Project Reviews with an Annual Project Implementation Review Report, and
prepare an Annual Implementation Plan for the following year starting in July 1997; (b)
furnish to the Bank, during the month of August 1996, a budget and an investment plan
for, and the targets to be achieved in, the implementation of the project in 1997, and
exchange views with the Bank on said budget, plan and targets, by no later than
September 30, 1996; (c) conduct a mid-term review in 1999; and (d) follow the Bank
procurement guidelines for all procurement of goods and services under the project and
also apply the Special Provisions for the procurement of goods and consultant services,
which differ from the national procedures, to project implementation; (e) maintain within
MOE a Project Administration Unit with functions and responsibilities satisfactory to the
Bank; (f) ensure that the PAU is staffed at all times with essential staff satisfactory to the
Bank; and (g) include (i) in MOE's budget separate lines covering fees for pre-primary
community educators (promotoras and madres lideres) and operating and maintenance
costs of the schools included under the project; and (ii) in IFARHU's budget a separate
line covering the scholarships for primary and lower secondary students.
16.   As conditions for effectiveness, the borrower will: (a) submit a detailed project
implementation plan for 1996 for all components: (b) provide evidence that a budget line
has been included in the 1996 Government's budget for promotoras, scholarships and
operating and maintenance costs; (c) provide evidence that the revolving fund has been
established and that the deposit for the first three months of expenditures for project
implementation has been made; (d) put into effect the Operational Manual; and (e) ensure
that the implementation agreements between MOE and FES, and between MOE and
IFARHU have been signed.
17.   Project Sustainability. The project design is based on the agreed objectives of
improving the quality of basic education and ensuring that children from the more
disadvantaged strata have access to the system and receive the maximum benefit from
their educational experience. This is the country's top priority for the sector and has
strong backing from the Government, the teachers union, and the legislature. Community
participation, especially in the operation of the pre-school education component, will also
contribute to enhancing the project's sustainability. Incremental recurrent costs would
account for less than one percent of the projected sector budget in the last year of project
implementation, an amount well within the limits of the Government's financial capacity.
18.   Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. This is the first Bank operation in
the Panamanian education sector. Successful education projects in Latin America have
been characterized by simplicity and clarity in design. The objectives of each component
should be as independent and measurable as possible, with explicit timetables for key
actions. These lessons have guided the establishment of the components and the
monitoring indicators of this project.



6
19.   The use of poverty indexes has proven effective in focusing investments on the
poor. However, when a poverty index classifies geographical areas too broadly, such as
states or provinces, poverty pockets may not be identified and served. Therefore the
poverty index has been refined for the current project. While it originally classified only
districts by poverty level, it now classifies the corregimientos (the third administrative
level of the governmental system; Panama has 9 provinces, 67 districts, one region and
510 corregimientos') by poverty level. The proposed project will focus on the poorest
185 corregimientos.
20.   Research and Bank operations have shown that kindergarten and early childhood
development programs can improve school readiness, lower repetition and drop out rates
and improve academic performance at higher levels of education. Disadvantaged groups
(rural children and children from families with low socio-economic status) benefit the
most. Reaching the home environment and encouraging parental involvement also appear
to strengthen the impact of the interventions. The proposed project would expand the
informal CEFACEI model (community-administered, pre-primary centers staffed by a
community-chosen educator with or without formal training) in areas of dense population
and train rural mothers to stimulate their pre-school children in areas of socialization and
pre-school learning. The project will also finance the production and broadcasting of
radio programs to address parents about child rearing practices. As these activities
indicate, the project would focus exclusively on disadvantaged groups and involve parents.
21.   Experience in Latin America has shown that the viability and sustainability of
improvements in student achievement depend in large part on the Government's
monitoring and assessment capacity. As in most developing countries, official educational
achievement data collection is almost non-existent in Panama. The proposed project
would create an education assessment system to provide the necessary information for
improving the overall quality of the education system. Due to its inherently controversial
nature, the establishment of such a system requires strong institutional and public support;
the proposed project would address this issue by incorporating teacher training and a
publicity campaign for the evaluation program. This component would be used to monitor
the impact of all project components on student achievement. The results of the pilot test,
administered in year one to students that have not yet benefitted from the project, will be
compared with the results of the test administered in year four to students of the same
schools, that will have received the services provided under the project.
22.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The project is fully consistent with the Bank
Group's Country Assistance Strategy for Panama and the Bank's policy objectives. The
Country Assistance Strategy, discussed by the Board on February 7, 1995, with the
Panama Rural Health Project, adopts a selective strategy focused on reviving sustainable
growth and poverty alleviation. The strategy calls for a two-pronged approach. On the
one hand, the ongoing Economic Recovery Loan would be the key instrument to promote
restoration of a viable medium-term fiscal framework and elimination of policy distortions
iPanama has 9 Provinces, 67 Districts and 1 region and, until 1993, it had 510 Corregimientos. In 1993,
the county seat of the district of Santiago de Veraguas was split, and the new corregimiento of Canto
del Llano was formed, so today there are officially 511 corregimientos. This document uses data
from the original 510 corregimientos.

required to mount an efficacious poverty alleviation strategy. On the other hand, the
lending program should be devoted to direct interventions in support of poverty
alleviation, especially through the development of human resources. The Bank's priorities
in human resource development are to expand coverage and improve the quality of basic
education and health. The Bank recently approved a Loan to support a Rural Health
Project (Loan 3841-PA), which provides for health care and nutrition supplementation for
children and mothers in the same disadvantaged groups targeted by the pre-school
component of the proposed project. The proposed project will focus on poverty
alleviation by providing students in the most depressed areas of the country with essential
educational inputs like textbooks and other learning materials, and access to the benefits
of pre-primary and basic education. In doing so, the project will also enhance the
efficiency of the basic education system and increase the effectiveness of public
expenditures on education. The proposed project was prepared taking into account the
programs of other major aid agencies. The 1DB has financed a technical education loan
for the upper secondary level, and continues to focus on that age group. USAID used to
be an important source of external assistance to the education sector, but has reduced its
activities, leaving a large gap in assistance.
23.   Environmental Aspects. The project will have no direct environmental effects,
and has been classified as C.
24.   Program Objective Category. The project falls under the Program Objective
Category of Poverty Reduction and would support a program of targeted interventions as
part of the Government's national policy of equitable access to education opportunities, by
channelling resources especially to poor and rural areas, thus contributing to poverty
reduction and the development of human resources. Townships were chosen as targeting
units so that project interventions can have the maximum effect in poor areas. The project
will target the poorest corregimientos (185 out of 510, containing 41 percent of the school
population from grades 1 to 9) in accordance with a composite poverty index. The Index
is composed of key indicators of three variables: housing, education and health.
25.   Participatory Approach. As the parental role is crucial in early childhood
development, this project incorporates parents in the delivery of the pre-primary
curriculum. The project will support community-administered CEFACEIs, and give
parents and communities a prominent role in selecting teachers and administering the
funds to pay the community educators. Teachers' unions, which have a strong influence
on the education system in Panama, have been consulted during project preparation.
26.   Project Benefits. The main benefits of the project will be an increase in future
earnings due to improved productivity, especially for students from low-income families
and rural areas. This will result from improvements in the quality of education and a more
equitable and efficient allocation of resources. The internal rate of return (IRR) for the
Improving Quality and Equity in Basic Education Component (77 percent of total project
costs) is high, at 19 percent.
27.   The project will also produce significant savings through the expansion of the low
cost non-formal preschool program. The new program will benefit 22,000 children. The
cost of pre-school education per child will be reduced by more than 50 percent, from



8
US$288 to US$124 per annum. Thus, estimated savings in expenditures for pre-school
education is US$3.6 million per annum. The expansion of the community-based pre-
school system will have additional indirect benefits for women by providing them
employment opportunities as child-care providers and by freeing mothers' time for wage-
earming jobs.
28.   Another source of major savings would come from expanding access to lower
secondary schools through the reallocation of existing scholarships for poor students, so
that they can attend schools outside of their towns, which currently have extra capacity. If
more schools were to be built to accommodate the same number of students near their
homes, the total cost would be approximately US$19.5 million. Over the life of the
project, the program would provide financial support up to 9,600 students from rural
low-income families, at a cumulative cost of US$3 million, allowing them to relocate and
attend upper grades of lower secondary schools where there is currently extra capacity.
The savings, therefore, derive from the fact that more students would be accommodated
without the need to build additional schools.
29.   Project Risks. This is a relatively low risk project. The main risk arises from the
lack of experience of the Government, particularly in the education sector, in
implementing Bank projects. This risk will be attenuated through: (a) the adoption of a
simple PAU structure; (b) the establishment of a solid base-line data base needed for
project monitoring; (c) the appointment of experienced managers to head the PAU; (d) the
preparation of a detailed manual of project operating procedures; and (e) the provision of
technical assistance within each component and intensive supervision.
30.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
