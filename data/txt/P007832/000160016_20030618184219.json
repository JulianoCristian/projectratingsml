EDUCATION PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "3994", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated satisfactory\n            while project sustainability is rated highly likely. The\n            performances of both the World Bank and the borrower are\n            evaluated as satisfactory. The following lessons can be\n            concluded from the project experience. 1) Project Design:\n            The project design intentionally followed the lessons\n            learned from prior education projects implemented in Latin\n            America by keeping project components simple and\n            well-defined. This approach was validated by the\n            Borrower's sharp focus and ease of implementation of\n            the components from the outset. The implementation\n            experience generally yielded results that served to\n            strengthen component design, achieve the development\n            objectives, and output indicators. The flexibility within\n            components and ability to make changes during execution\n            (e.g. production of student multigrade guidebooks rather\n            than activity cards; emphasis on eduction management\n            information system development for institutional\n            strengthening) that were agreeable to both the government\n            and the Bank, was a central factor in maintaining project\n            relevancy while supporting the evolving education strategy.\n            2) Continuity of Project Management: caused the successful\n            implementation of the project. 3) Commitment and Interest of\n            High Level Ministry Officials: Top Ministry officials\n            participated in policy decisions to facilitate\n            implementation of the First Basic Education Project, as well\n            as in the shaping of strategies for conceptualization and\n            preparation of the new Second Basic Education Project. It is\n            also important to have an administration willing to continue\n            operations initiated by the former government, not just for\n            continuity in improving education quality, equity and\n            access, but also for building on improvements in the\n            modernization and strengthening of the Ministry and\n            implementing agency. 4) Targeting: Students in lower income\n            families usually have no access to quality preschool\n            education programs or to necessary school materials and\n            texts. The project's emphasis on specifically targeting\n            the poorest areas within Panama and refining the areas of\n            poverty down to the neediest 185 corregimientos, enabled the\n            project to impact areas where the need was highest. 5)\n            Community Participation. The project's support of\n            parent and community participation in physical maintenance\n            of schools and in provision of non-formal preschool\n            education services in rural and marginal urban areas has\n            shown that community involvement in the operation of schools\n            adds an important dimension to the effectiveness of publicly\n            provided education by mobilizing local support for the\n            schools and increasing pride in achievement on the part of\n            students and teachers. 6) Gradual Expansion of Non-formal\n            Preschool. Experience shows that instead of moving to a\n            massive expansion of the project's less expensive,\n            non-formal preschool model utilizing community\n            participation, there is a need to consolidate\n            institutionalization of the program at the central and\n            regional levels, while building education ministry's\n            institutional capacity to follow up and promote the program\n            among dispersed rural populations that are difficult to\n            reach. For this reason, a continued course of gradual\n            expansion has been chosen, aiming to reach the children in\n            remote rural localities and marginal urban communities first\n            under the Second Basic Education Project."}, "docdt": "2003-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
