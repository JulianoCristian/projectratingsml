Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 An implementation support mission was carried out from October 29 - November 5, 2014.

 Project implementation continues to progress in a satisfactory way. Almost all end-of-project targets have been met or exceeded, in some cases
 considerably.
 Staff of the Project Implementation Unit are working with MADR management to implement the transition plan agreed between MADR on the one hand
 the Ministry of Finance and the Department of National Planning and the World Bank on the other hand. The task team, with support from the CMU, will
 need to work closely with the Borrower to ensure that the necessary policies, institutions, and implemntation arrangements are in place by June 30,
 2015 to allow implementation responsibility to be assumed by MADR and orderly closing of the World Bank project.
 The World Bank task team, with support from FAO, has begun preparing the Implementation Completion Report (ICR). In parallel, the World Bank/FAO
 team is coordinating closely with the firm that is carrying out the final Impact Evaluation to ensure that the study design of the Impact Evaluation
 meets the highest possible standard of technical quality.

 The next implementation support mission is planned for February 2015.
