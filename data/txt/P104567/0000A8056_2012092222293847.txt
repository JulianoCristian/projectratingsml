                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1.       The project is progressing very well, thanks to a substantial budget increase that the GoC assigned to the project in 2011 (34 billion Pesos) and in 2012 (50 billion pesos).
                         The amount of national funds earmarked for the project is an evidencing the Government commitment to this project, which has become the second best financed program of the
                         Rural Development Directorate of the MADR. In 2012 IBRD loan finances only project staff and consultants as there are not enough funds left in the loan to finance new productive
                         alliances.

                         2. In 2011, 127 new productive partnerships were initiated, a substantial increase from the average of 55 productive partnerships per year approved during the period 2008-2010. In
                         2012, with a budget of 50 billion pesos allocated, the number of productive partnerships financed with contract signed is expected to be around 175. To this date, there are 243
                         partnerships under implementation at different stages. Which is to say that the goal of 300 partnerships financed for the second project should be reached on o before the end of
                         2012. However, because implementation of a partnership takes about two years, the implementation period for the partnerships approved this year will go beyond the closing date of

                         the project, September 2013, which means that the Government will have to request an extension of the project closing date, even though all funds will have been committed.

                         3. As shown by the table of indicator achievement, most of the targets have already been surpassed, expect for the targeted increase in sale volumes which is likely not be reached
                         by the end of the project because: (i) a large number of alliances are with perennial crops, which like cocoa, start producing only after four years; (ii) most of the alliances will be
                         financed in the last two years of the project therefore without enough time to show results in sale volumes.
