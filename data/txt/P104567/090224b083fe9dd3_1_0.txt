I. Disbursement Profile
1.        Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.    Context at Appraisal
1.      Country and Sector Background. Poverty in Colombia has long been
disproportionately rural and closely linked to agriculture. In 2007 when the Second Rural
Productive Partnerships Project (PAAP-II) was appraised, the rural poverty rate stood at 68%,
and most of the 8 million rural poor were engaged in small-scale agriculture. The sector was
characterized by slow growth, low productivity, a weak human capital base, and a high level
of informality. Lacking access to improved technologies and modern inputs, many producers
were uncompetitive, and most remained effectively cut off from markets. The agricultural
policies prevailing in the country at the time made extensive use of subsidies, which benefited
mainly commercial producers while at the same time undermining their ability to compete in
export markets (World Bank 2003). The effects of these policies were particularly unfortunate
because Colombia was in the process of entering into a free trade agreement with the USA and
other countries, which increased the pressure to become more competitive.
2.      Government Sector Strategy. Colombia’s 2006-10 Development Plan (DP)
formulated by the National Planning Department (DNP) included two objectives of direct
relevance to the agricultural sector: (i) increasing the participation of the agricultural sector in
international markets and expanding internal markets, and (ii) increasing rural income through
the promotion of agriculture entrepreneurial activities, agribusinesses, rural tourism, and
microfinance. In pursuit of these objectives, the DP set out three main initiatives: (i) stabilizing
the incomes of producers, for example through the Agro Ingreso Seguro (AIS) Program; (ii)
strengthening health and food safety standards, for example through the Sanitary and Phyto-
sanitary Systems Program; and (iii) raising the incomes of the rural poor, for example through
the Rural Productive Partnerships Project. 1 While the First Rural Productive Partnerships
Project (PAAP-I) was a pilot designed to link smallholder producers with commercial partners,
under the DP the Second Rural Productive Partnerships Project (PAAP-II) was strategically
aligned with the objectives of the AIS Program, which sought to generate income
improvements and strengthen competitiveness of rural producers in response to the challenges
of globalization and the country’s trade opening. Poverty alleviation remained a concern,
however, and the DP included a separate equity pillar which emphasized the need to improve
income generation capacity among the rural poor by increasing agricultural productivity,
promoting rural entrepreneurship, and supporting agribusinesses.
3.     Rationale for World Bank assistance. At appraisal, the World Bank had long been
engaged in supporting rural development efforts in Colombia. Over the course of the previous
two decades, it had financed several decentralized rural development projects, as well as a
considerable amount of analytical work. 2 From 2002 until early 2008, it supported the First




1
     To avoid confusion, the Rural Productive Partnerships Project is referred to in this Implementation
     Completion Report as the First Rural Productive Partnerships Project (PAAP-I, P041642).
2
     Earlier World Bank-financed operations included the Agriculture Technology Development Project, the Peace
     and Development APL I, the Magdalena Medio Regional Development I and II, and the Sierra Nevada
     Sustainable Development Project. In addition to supporting lending operations, the World Bank had conducted


                                                       1
Productive Partnerships Support Project, which used an innovative approach to link
smallholder producer organizations with the private commercial sector. The effectiveness of
the approach had been demonstrated by the spreading of an entrepreneurial culture among rural
producers, strengthening of local institutional capacity, and the generation of increased income
and employment in rural communities. In September 2006, the Government of Colombia asked
the World Bank to finance a follow-up operation, citing the positive results of the first phase
and referring to the Bank’s global experience in implementing projects to enhance rural
competitiveness.

1.2.   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
4.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase rural competitiveness and
build up rural entrepreneurship in poor rural communities in a sustainable manner through
demand-driven partnerships with the commercial private sector.
5.    The Key Indicators relate to three main sub-themes that are embedded in the Project
Development Objective: (i) competitiveness, (ii) entrepreneurship, and (iii) sustainability.
Key Indicators for Competitiveness:
 • The total sales volume by the producer organizations under all partnerships reaches at
     least a cumulative Colombian pesos (Co$) 350 billion in year 5
Key Indicators for Entrepreneurship:
 • At least 75% of participating producer organizations have a manager
 • At least 75% of participating producer organizations maintain a system of accounts
 • At least 75% of participating producer organizations have cumulatively recuperated at
     least 70% of the competitive grant (i.e., the government financial incentive, or
     Incentivo Modular) they were expected to return to the revolving fund as programmed
     in their annual operating plans
Key Indicators for Sustainability:
 • At least 80% of regional management organizations (OGR) have their contracts yearly
     renewed
 • Local governments provide over a period of five years at least Co$22 billion as co-
     financing to the partnership investments
 • At least 75% of the producer organizations remain linked to commercial partners 24
     months after the end of project support to that partnership

1.4.    Main Beneficiaries
7.      The main beneficiaries of the Project were the 25,500 small and medium-sized rural
producer households that were to be enrolled in productive partnerships. The Project was
designed to operate nationwide, but the initial focus was on Departments characterized by a
high concentration of rural poor and having the minimum amount of infrastructure needed for
agricultural products to reach markets. Each year, the National Intersectoral Commission
(CIN) specified which Departments and commodities were to be prioritized, consistent with
the policy guidelines issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR).
From 2008 to 2012, the Project operated in 27 of Colombia’s 32 Departments. Following a
change in government priorities that was reflected in 2013 in a significant increase in co-
financing, activities were expanded to cover all 32 Departments. 3
8.      The eligibility criteria for producer organizations wanting to submit partnership
proposals were spelled out in the operational manual. To encourage participation of specific
disadvantaged groups, it was decided that at least 2,550 producer households included in
partnerships supported through the Project (10% of total planned beneficiaries) would be
headed by women and that at least 1,275 producer households (5% of total planned
beneficiaries) would be made up of indigenous people or people of Afro-Colombian descent.
These targets were reflected in the project results framework. To promote the participation of
indigenous people and people of Afro-Colombian descent, an Indigenous and Afro-Colombian
Peoples Development Framework was prepared incorporating inclusion practices that had been
used successfully during the first phase. The framework called for the PCU to carry out
culturally adapted promotional activities and consultations involving the two groups, and it
accorded preferential treatment during the selection process to partnership proposals submitted
by these two groups.

1.5.     Original Components
9.       The Project had three components: (i) partnership promotion and preparation:
(ii) partnership implementation; and (iii) management, monitoring and evaluation.
Component 1: Partnership promotion and preparation (US$12.32 million, of which IBRD
US$3.41 million)
10.     Component 1 financed information campaigns in partnership with regional and local
governments, as well as national and regional business round tables that were designed to
communicate and publicize the Project’s annual competitive calls for partnership proposals to
rural producer organizations and the private agri-business sector. It also covered the expenses
related to the evaluation and ranking of partnership proposals, the preparation of pre-
investment feasibility studies for pre-selected partnerships, the preparation of all legal
documentation and agreements for the final selection, the approval process for the government
financial incentive, and the establishment of a business and operational plan for each
partnership.



3
    From 2013 onwards, calls for proposals were issued in all 32 Departments, but no partnerships were financed
    in the Department of Vichada, because the proposals received from the Department of Vichada did not make
    it through the selection process.


                                                      3
Component 2: Partnership implementation (US$327.13 million, of which IBRD US$24.42
million)
11.    Component 2 financed grants (known as the Incentivo Modular) that were awarded to
beneficiary producer organizations for use in improving on-farm infrastructure; purchasing
machinery and equipment; financing consumable inputs such as seed, fertilizer, and veterinary
supplies; or paying for hired labor. Component 2 also paid for technical advisory services,
marketing studies, and training activities designed to increase the productivity and
entrepreneurial capacity of the beneficiary producer organizations (these were usually carried
out by local non-governmental organizations, private consulting firms, universiti4es, and
research institutions). Finally, Component 2 supported training and capacity building activities
that benefited intermediaries, such as the Regional Management Organizations (OGR) and
Local Management Organizations (OGA).
12.     The Incentivo Modular could not exceed 40% of the total partnership investment cost,
and it was initially capped at Co$4 million per beneficiary producer household. In 2012, under
Decree No. 321/02, this cap was increased to Co$5 million, to offset the loss in purchasing
power that had occurred due to inflation. The grant amount could be increased to a maximum
of Co$6 million per beneficiary producer household during the course of subproject
implementation if the partnership could demonstrate that it had mobilized an additional Co$2
million per household in commercial credit. 4
13.    Based on the positive experience of the first phase, the Incentivo Modular was
administered under the supervision of a Trust Company and was paid out in three tranches to
individual trust accounts controlled by each beneficiary producer organization. The operational
manual specified that the grant disbursements were conditioned on the funds being used in
accordance with the partnership business plan and under the supervision of the Trust Company
and MADR. Also based on the experience of the first phase, a portion of the Incentivo Modular
was supposed to be paid into a revolving fund managed by the producer organization, as
programmed in the partnership’s annual operating plan.
14.    In summary, the typical financing package for a productive partnership financed under
Component 2 was composed of: (i) the Incentivo Modular; (ii) the contributions of the
beneficiary producer households (e.g., labor, land, and materials); (iii) the contributions of the
commercial partner (e.g., technical assistance, packaging materials, seeds, and fertilizers); (iv)
contributions by the Departmental Secretariat of Agriculture and the local municipal
government; (v) commercial credit (in some cases); and (vi) support received from other
collaborating institutions (e.g., the national service for apprenticeship, SENA).
Component 3: Management, monitoring and evaluation (US$6.12 million, of which IBRD
US$1.48 million)
15.   Component 3 financed project administration costs associated with the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU), paid for staff in the Rural Development Directorate (DDR) of
MADR who were involved in project implementation, and covered operational costs


4
    For example, if the partnership obtained a credit of Co$100,000 per household, the government financial
    incentive could be increased by Co$100,000 per household. This 1:1 relationship would be respected up to a
    maximum of Co$2 million per household.


                                                      4
associated with running the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system, carrying out evaluation
studies, and commissioning yearly technical and financial audits. The central PCU in Bogota
was staffed with a project coordinator, technical specialists (in agribusiness, environment,
social development, etc.), fiduciary staff, and M&E specialists. The national level staff based
in the PCU in Bogota were supported by eight decentralized regional teams.

1.6.   Revised Components
16.    There were no revisions to the original components.

1.7.    Other significant changes
17.     Extensions of the project closing date. The original closing date was September 30,
2013. On January 17, 2013, the closing date was extended by 15 months, until December 30,
2014, to allow for adequate supervision and support of the subprojects approved during 2012
until the end of their implementation period, which typically ranged from 18 and 24 months.
On December 19, 2014, the closing date was extended a second time by six months, to June
30, 2015. By then the loan was almost fully disbursed, but the extension was considered
necessary to allow sufficient time for: (i) the preparation of the final impact evaluation being
carried out by an independent consulting firm, (ii) the submission of overdue audit reports for
2012 and 2013, and (iii) the putting in place of the necessary policy, fiduciary, and operational
arrangements needed to transition the Rural Productive Support Program to MADR.
18.     Reallocation of loan proceeds. The first closing date extension in January 2013 was
accompanied by a reallocation of loan proceeds. US$2 million were reallocated from the
category Consultants’ Services to Cost-Sharing Transfers to cover the additional supervision
costs that would be incurred by the PCU over the longer implementation period.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1.    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
19.     Background analysis. Following the receipt of the Government’s request for a follow-
on operation to the First Rural Productive Partnerships Project, the same World Bank team that
was engaged in supervising the first phase was charged with preparing the second phase.
Working in close collaboration with the PCU, the World Bank team prepared the follow-on
operation in just under 12 months (Concept Review Meeting to Effectiveness). The team was
careful to note the implementation experience of the first phase, and it identified a number of
bottlenecks that needed to be avoided in the follow-on operation. For example, it identified the
need to strengthen decentralized implementation capacity and delegate more responsibility to
the regional level as a way of ensuring faster, more efficient, and more sustainable
implementation of subprojects. A second concern was to shorten the subproject preparation
cycle, without compromising on the quality of the pre-investment studies and the strength of
the partnership arrangements. A third concern was to reduce the transaction costs associated
with establishing commercial partnerships, as a way of ensuring greater engagement by the
private sector. In addition, the World Bank team recognized that efforts were needed to ensure
the provision to beneficiary producer organizations of enhanced, more sustained technical
assistance, along with training in organizational and managerial capacities.




                                               5
20.     Project design. The design of PAAP-II was fundamentally sound. Because PAAP-I
was a pilot that used an innovative and previously untested design, implementation of the
original project had been characterized by a steep learning curve. PAAP-II benefited from this
experience, and many lessons learned during the first phase were reflected in the design of the
second phase.
21.      PDO and PDO Indicators. The PDO was defined in a way that was relevant, adequate,
and in line with the Government of Colombia’s priorities. The PDO indicators were concretely
defined at the outcome level and focused on results that were attributable to project-supported
activities. The PDO indicators were closely related to the activities and objectives of each
component. To ensure that the indicators would be monitored properly, care was taken to
ensure that the PCU had strong M&E capacity at the central and particularly at the regional
level.
22.    Partnership selection process. The transparent and competitive process used to select
partnerships under the first phase had been identified as a key factor generating credibility
among beneficiary producers and the private sector. At the same time, the evaluation procedure
used had proved effective for ensuring the participation of disadvantaged groups, such as
indigenous peoples and people of Afro-Colombian descent. The same basic partnership
evaluation process was maintained in the design of the project.
23.     Encouraging private sector participation. Another lesson from the first phase
adopted in the design of the Project was the importance of actively involving prospective
commercial partners in the partnership building process, to overcome the widespread distrust
prevailing in the private sector about working with smallholder producer organizations. The
project design included resources that would allow the PCU to reach out to potential
commercial partners through the organization of national and regional business round tables,
among other measures.
24.     Involvement of financial institutions. Under PAAP-I, many participating producer
organizations had experienced difficulty accessing commercial credit. The design for PAAP-
II therefore included stronger measures to entice financial institutions to provide credit to the
selected partnerships. Use of the revolving funds mechanism was made mandatory, and
producer organizations were encouraged to use it as a tool to finance their continuing
operations. A secondary objective of the revolving funds was to allow producer organizations
to build up their credit worthiness, which was expected to enable them to obtain commercial
financial credit.
25.     Implementation arrangements. The principal implementation agency was the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR). The Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) was situated within the Rural Development Directorate of MADR. The PCU
coordinated activities at the national and regional level, drawing on the services of multiple
actors, many of them decentralized (see Annex 2). In recognition of the uneven capacity of the
decentralized actors and institutions, the project design included initiatives and activities to
strengthen the capacity of the participating institutions.
26.    Risk assessment and mitigation. At appraisal, Overall Project Risk was assessed as
“Moderate,” and proposed risk mitigation measures were considered appropriate. The risk
assessment exercise was influenced by the experience of the first phase of the Project, as few
of the risks that had been identified in PAAP-I had materialized. In retrospect, the risk


                                               6
assessment appears to have been appropriate, as the two risks rated “Substantial” are the ones
that turned out to be the most relevant. The first risk rated “Substantial” was: Banking sector
not willing to provide finance for crop production. The second risk rated “Substantial” was:
Planned transfer of the PCU to MADR may reduce quality of project management. Mitigation
measures were proposed for both risks, but in the end the mitigation measures proved only
partly effective (see Sections 2.2 and 2.5).

2.2.    Implementation
27.     Implementation Progress was rated “Satisfactory” from effectiveness up until mid-
2010. At that point, the rating was downgraded to “Moderately Unsatisfactory” for about eight
months due to significant delays in implementation progress caused mainly by cuts in
counterpart funding (described below). After corrective measures were taken by the
Government and implemented by the PCU (discussed below), in early 2011 the rating was
upgraded to “Moderately Satisfactory,” and seven months after that it was upgraded again to
“Satisfactory.” The “Satisfactory” rating was maintained until project closing in mid-2015.
Despite a somewhat uneven implementation experience, at project completion almost all of the
PDO and Intermediate Result Indicators had been achieved, and in a number of cases
performance exceeded end-of-project targets, sometimes substantially. Factors that affected
implementation, positively and negatively, are described next.
28.     Fluctuations in government co-financing. Three national elections took place during
implementation, resulting in changes in budgetary allocations to the Project that affected
implementation performance. Between 2008 and 2010, the budget twice was reduced by
significant amounts, and as a result the number of partnerships financed for a long time
remained well below planned levels. After the change in government that occurred in mid-
2010, allocations to the Project were significantly increased, which allowed a rapid expansion
in the number of partnerships financed and a scaling up in coverage to include the entire
national territory. Following the re-election of the Santos administration in 2014, government
financing decreased again as the newly installed leadership in MADR reassessed national rural
development priorities while awaiting the outcomes of the Havana peace talks. This slowed
disbursements to existing partnerships and led to a temporary moratorium on the approval of
new sub-projects.
29.     Adjustments to implementation procedures. The decline in government funding that
occurred between 2008 and 2010, combined with higher than expected fixed costs, led to
implementation delays during the early life of the Project and negatively affected ratings for
implementation progress. Following recommendations made by several World Bank
supervision missions and repeated in the 2010 Mid-Term-Review (MTR), the PCU responded
by making adjustments to operating procedures that allowed it to work more efficiently.
Significant changes were made to administrative processes that increased the responsibility of
the Regional Management Organizations, narrowed the scope of the pre-investment feasibility
studies, shortened the subproject implementation period to 18-24 months to align it with the
agricultural production cycle, and lowered the number of payment tranches to the trust
company from three to one. The PCU also intensified its outreach to the private sector and
regional stakeholders, which allowed it to more effectively promote the productive
partnerships approach among these groups and increase their engagement in the project. These
actions led to efficiency gains in implementation and to an upgrade in project ratings.



                                              7
30.    Leveraging of resources from new stakeholders. Another recommendation made by
World Bank supervision missions was for the PCU specifically to seek out additional resources
from other stakeholders to offset the cuts that had been experienced in the MADR budget. The
PCU consequently stepped up its engagement with stakeholders, notably local governments,
and as a result the amount of co-financing increased tremendously. At project completion in
mid-2015, the amount of co-financing received from government agencies and other partners
had exceeded projections by more than four-fold. Beginning in 2011, the additional funds made
possible a major increase in the number of partnerships financed, with the end-of-project total
eventually exceeding the end-of-project target.
31.     Production losses due to adverse weather. From 2009 to 2011, unusually adverse
weather significantly affected a large number of subprojects. Especially between the second
half of 2010 and first half of 2011, unprecedented precipitation hit the country in the form of
an extreme ola invernal (a weather phenomenon influenced by La Niña), causing severe
negative impacts on agricultural production. Beginning in 2014, some regions of the country
felt the effects of new episode of the weather phenomenon El Niño. Extended and intense
droughts, particularly along the Atlantic coast, negatively affected agricultural production in
many areas. While most agricultural production activities regularly are subjected to variable
weather, during the life of the Project the effects appear to have been unusually severe in many
parts of the country. The final impact evaluation carried out in early 2015 revealed that the vast
majority of beneficiary producers reported having suffered significant losses during project
implementation from fire (97%), from flooding (87%), from landslides (82%), from drought
(42%), and from outbreaks of diseases (34%). These weather conditions had serious adverse
impacts on production and sales, and on the producers’ ability to repay into their revolving
funds.
32.     Delays in transitioning PAAP to MADR. To ensure institutional sustainability, the
project design called for the activities being supported under the Project to be transitioned
eventually to MADR and for the PCU to be integrated into MADR’s administrative structure.
During the Mid-Term-Review, however, it was determined that direct integration of the PCU
would not be possible because of MADR hiring regulations, which stipulate that staff
recruitment must be carried out according to Colombian national labor law. Despite this
obstacle, the World Bank and the Government agreed to maintain their commitment to
transition the Productive Partnerships Program to MADR following the closing of the Project.
In the wake of the 2014 national elections, changes in leadership and strategy within MADR
created uncertainty about the Government’s commitment to the productive partnerships
approach. Even though a plan to transfer implementation responsibility to MADR following
the closing of the Project had been prepared and approved by DNP and the Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit, delays in decision-making within MADR had adverse consequences for the
then ongoing subprojects. In addition, these delays affected 124 subprojects that had been
selected from the 2014 call for proposals and approved for full government-financing, but
which remained without funding after project completion (these 124 unfunded sub-projects
stood to benefit more than 6,300 producer households).

2.3.   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization
33.    M&E design. The design of the project results framework was adequate. The PDO
Indicators are clear, measurable, and directly linked to the three principal sub-themes
embedded in the PDO (competitiveness, entrepreneurship, and sustainability). Although the


                                                8
Results Framework adequately captures the majority of expected project outputs and outcomes,
in retrospect some indicators might have been defined differently, and some end-of-project
targets set at more realistic levels. For example, the PDO indicator that measures total sales
realized by participating producer organizations measures the nominal value of sales
denominated in current Colombian pesos. Use of this unit of measurement is prone to risks,
however, because factors beyond the control of the Project can dramatically affect the nominal
value of sales (such as inflation and exchange rate volatility). For this reason, a more
appropriate unit of measurement might have been the percentage change in volume of sales
compared to a baseline year. Similarly, in the case of the PDO indicator that measures the
repayment rate for the revolving funds, even though the majority of revolving funds remain in
operation and are being maintained, the end-of-project target proved to be very ambitious. This
highlights the difficulty of setting targets for indicators at appraisal, especially in cases
involving innovative practices for which no benchmark values are available during the design
stage.
34.     M&E implementation. M&E implementation was more than adequate. Monitoring
data on project activities, outputs, and outcomes were collected at centralized and decentralized
levels, allowing the project results framework to be fully populated. Over time, the PCU made
numerous adjustments to the way it monitored progress of individual partnerships, taking into
account lessons learned from experience. Depending on the nature of the information and the
collection cost, some indicators were monitored monthly, others quarterly, and still others
yearly. Responsibility for collecting information was clearly defined and distributed as
appropriate among producer organizations and commercial partners, OGAs and OGRs, and
PCU staff. Collection of information by producer organizations and commercial partners and
by OGAs and OGRs was complemented by regular verification field visits carried out by PCU
staff. During the initial years of project implementation, data collection activities weighed
heavily on OGAs and OGRs, and the MTR mission carried out in 2010 reported that many
were struggling to keep up as the number of partnerships proliferated. The launch in early 2011
of the M&E online platform brought significant efficiency gains in the collection of monitoring
data, and from that point on the M&E system functioned very smoothly.
35.     It is worth noting that the Project’s M&E online platform has been recognized by
numerous internal as well as external users as a best practice model. It can be used not only to
capture, store, analyze, and access information about the performance indicators appearing in
the project results framework, but it also contains a wealth of additional information about the
partnerships, including the size and composition of their membership, the nature of their
productive activities, their business and management processes, information of their annual
operating plans, etc. In addition, it can be used to archive and allow password-protected access
to pre-investment studies, progress reports, evaluations, and other materials related to the
project.
36.     A final point about the M&E online platform is that it contains information about
indirect beneficiaries, specifically, households belonging to producer organizations that did not
receive the government financial incentive grant but that benefited indirectly from collective
goods and services financed through the Project, such as common infrastructure and
community-level technical assistance. This information proved extremely useful in the
estimation of spillover effects.

37.     M&E utilization. During implementation, information from the Project’s M&E online
platform allowed the PCU, the World Bank supervision team, and the Government to monitor
the status of individual subprojects and to track implementation progress of the overall Project.
The fact that information could be accessed easily and shared quickly contributed to more
efficient communication between the central PCU, the OGAs and the OGRs, and the World
Bank supervision team, which allowed emerging problems to be identified and addressed
before they became unmanageable.
38.     In addition to supporting real-time management activities, information from the M&E
online platform was used for several studies. For example, the sampling strategy used for the
Economic and Financial Analysis (EFA) summarized in Annex 4 was based on information
from the M&E online platform. Similarly, the final impact evaluation of the Project carried out
in 2015 combined data collected from 899 beneficiary producers and 1,481 control group
producers with data obtained from the M&E online platform (details of the final impact
evaluation are presented in Annex 6). Finally, in 2014 the International Center for Tropical
Agriculture (CIAT) used information from the M&E online platform to assess the effectiveness
of the Project in reaching disadvantaged groups (i.e., indigenous people and people of Afro-
Caribbean descent) and in serving post-conflict zones, using the data of the Project’s M&E
system.

2.4.    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
39.     Safeguards compliance. PAAP-II was classified as Category B and triggered the
following safeguards policies: Environmental Assessment (OD/BP 4.01), Natural Habitats
(OD/BP 4.04), Forests (OD/BP 4.36), Pest Management (OD/BP 4.09), and Indigenous
Peoples (OD/BP 4.20). Because inconsistent monitoring of safeguards compliance had been
identified as a weakness under PAAP-I, measures were introduced under PAAP-II to ensure
more consistent safeguards monitoring. Throughout implementation, the PCU was staffed with
a qualified environmental and social development specialist whose role was to monitor
compliance with the applicable requirements. As a further incentive, the results framework
included indicators relating to the satisfactory implementation of the Environmental
Management Plans (EMP) and Social Plans (SP). These measures taken at the PCU level were
reinforced at the subproject level. Information regarding environmental and social safeguards
was disseminated during every call for partnership proposals, and subproject proposal
templates included sections specifically dedicated to environmental and social safeguards
compliance, which ensured that subprojects with unacceptable environmental and social risks
were dropped during the selection process.
40.     Environmental safeguards. Compliance with environmental safeguards policies was
rated “Satisfactory” throughout the life of the Project. Each productive partnership was
required to undertake an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and to prepare and
implement a fully-funded Environmental Management Plan (EMP). Typically the EMPs
included training on good agricultural practices, and in many cases also obligated producer
organizations to obtain certification showing that production met environmental standards as
required by the commercial partner. As reflected in the Intermediate Results Indicator, at
Project completion 88% of partnerships supported by the Project complied satisfactorily with
the EMP implementation requirements. The implementation of the EIA and the EMP was
supervised by the OGAs and OGRs. Throughout implementation, the Regional Environmental
Authorities (CAR) monitored the Project’s environmental impacts, and it never identified any


                                               10
negative effects caused by Project-supported activities. MADR did not receive any complaints
relating to adverse environmental impacts generated through activities related to the Project.
On the contrary, the Project generated positive externalities that benefited the environment, as
it encouraged the adoption of good agricultural practices.
41.     Social safeguards. Compliance with social safeguards policies was rated “Satisfactory”
throughout the life of the Project. As reflected in the Intermediate Results Indicator, at Project
completion 86% of the partnerships supported by the Project were found to have complied
satisfactorily with the social plan implementation requirements. As mentioned previously, an
Indigenous Peoples and Afro-Colombians Development Framework was prepared which
included the implementation of culturally adapted promotional activities and consultations
regarding the calls for subproject proposals. Also, in the selection of partnership subproject
proposals, preferential treatment was given to proposals received from indigenous peoples and
people of Afro-Colombian descent, to ensure that these two disadvantaged groups were not
excluded from the opportunities provided by the Project. At project closing, the end-of-project
target relating to the participation of indigenous people and people of Afro-Colombian descent
were greatly surpassed. With 9,252 beneficiary households from these groups participating in
partnerships at project completion (instead of the assumed 1,275), the Project successfully
reached and included indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples in its activities.
42.     Procurement. The Project’s procurement function was rated “Satisfactory” by most
implementation support missions (procurement was rated “Satisfactory” 13 times and
“Moderately Satisfactory” 3 times out of 16 total ratings). During implementation, two ex-post
procurement reviews were conducted (in 2011 and 2014). Minor inconsistencies were detected
in a small number of cases regarding compliance with World Bank procurement procedures,
but despite these shortcomings, the vast majority of procurement processes were performed in
conformity with World Bank policies and procedures. Supervision missions and reports of the
ex-post procurement reviews consistently led to the preparation of action plans designed to
strengthen procurement functions and encourage the use of the World Bank Procurement Plan
Management System (SEPA). No fraud or corruption issues were detected during
implementation.
43.     Financial Management and Audits. The Project’s financial management function
was rated “Moderately Satisfactory” by most implementation support missions (financial
management was rated “Moderately Satisfactory” 12 times and “Satisfactory” 4 times out of
16 total ratings). The implementing agency had qualified staff working on financial
management issues, and most of the time they provided timely interim financial reports.
Nevertheless, hiring of auditors was consistently delayed, and the implementing agency
required close supervision and support. In general, audit opinions were unqualified, but audit
performance from 2012 onwards was deficient. Waivers had to be granted by the World Bank
due to the late submission of the 2012, 2013, 2014, and final audits.

2.5.    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
44.     Transition arrangements. The project design called for the Productive Partnerships
Program that was being supported through PAAP-I and PAAP-II to be transitioned to MADR
following the termination of World Bank financing. In mid-2014, the PCU prepared a
transition plan that laid out a route by which implementation responsibility could be shifted to
MADR. In late 2014, the transition plan was reviewed and accepted by MADR, DNP, and the


                                               11
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit. The PCU subsequently began to implement the agreed
actions, transferring administrative records, technical materials, and equipment to the Rural
Development Directorate of MADR. Because a change in leadership in MADR occurred
around this time, implementation of the transition plan fell behind schedule. The
implementation delays were compounded by uncertainties about whether or not funding would
be made available by MADR to ensure continuity in the monitoring of ongoing partnership
subprojects, as well as financing of 124 new partnership subprojects that had been selected in
the 2014 call for proposals. At the time this ICR was being prepared, MADR was continuing
to express its commitment to maintain the Productive Partnerships Program, but no decision
had been taken regarding the institutional arrangements under which the Program would be
operated.
45.     Maintenance arrangements for infrastructure. Many of the productive investments
financed under the Project are being maintained through the initiative of producer
organizations. Based on data collected from 83 partnerships, the impact evaluation estimates
that 82% of producer organizations are continuing to collect annual fees from the members to
finance operations and maintain infrastructure, especially the common goods that constituted
the majority of the investments (e.g., cooling tanks, bulk storage facilities, and collection
centers).
46.      Sustainability of institutional capacity. In a similar vein, the strengthened
institutional capacity attributable to the Project has proved to be enduring. The training
provided to producers and producer organizations went far beyond the teaching of improved
production practices, as training activities also covered topics such as business development,
accounting principles and methods, and enterprise management. The results of the beneficiary
survey (Annex 7) show that the capacity-building activities supported by the Project benefited
not only individual producers and producer organizations, but also commercial partners. One
of the most important benefits identified during the national and regional stakeholder
consultation workshops (Annex 8) was the hands-on training provided to community-level
organizations, which allowed them to assist producer organizations “in a holistic manner”
(quoted from Annex 8). The success of this holistic approach to capacity building is reflected
in the fact that the majority productive partnerships have continued to operate even after project
support has long ended. Continued monitoring of PAAP-I partnerships indicates that 62% of
first phase partnerships were continuing to operate seven years after PAAP-I closed. In the
case of PAAP-II partnerships, 80% of producer organizations are continuing to sell to a
commercial partner 24 months after project support ended. In addition, the vast majority of
producer organizations have demonstrated the ability to establish new partnerships when an
earlier partnership dissolves (Annex 7).
47.      Future prospects for productive partnerships in Colombia. There can be little doubt
that the productive partnerships approach will continue to feature in the Government’s rural
development strategy going forward. The success of the Productive Partnerships Program is
clearly recognized in the current National Development Plan (NDP), which includes several
initiatives that appear to have been modeled on the PAAP-II implementation experience.
Furthermore, since mid-2014 DNP has been engaged in the preparation of the Misión para la
Transformación del Campo (Mission to Transform the Countryside), also known as the Misión
Rural, which lays out the Government’s vision for rural development in the country over the
next 20 years. A centerpiece of the agricultural development strategy described in the Misión


                                               12
Rural is a proposed initiative to promote Alianzas Incluyentes (Inclusive Alliances), which are
explicitly modeled on the productive partnerships supported under PAAP-I and PAAP-II. The
goals of the Alianzas Incluyentes initiative are ambitious; the Misión Rural envisions
expanding coverage from the approximately 43,000 families supported under PAAP-II to
about 230,000 families by 2025 and about 570,000 families by 2035. While fiscal realities
could constrain these ambitious plans and lead to a more modest rate of expansion, the
Government’s commitment to continue using the productive partnerships approach seems
beyond question.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.   Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation Arrangements
Rating: High
48.     Relevance of objectives. The PAAP-II objectives of increasing rural competitiveness
and sustainably building up rural entrepreneurship in poor rural communities were highly
relevant at appraisal, and they remain highly relevant at project completion. The 2014-18
National Development Plan (NDP) contains three main pillars: (i) strengthen the peace-
building process and ensure sustainability to allow the country and its citizens reach their full
potential as a nation; (ii) integrate the rural sector and its communities to close the social gap
and to enhance connectivity for productive inclusion and access to public goods, social services
and information; and (iii) reduce social and territorial urban-rural disparities through the
development of the rural sector to ensure equal opportunities. The NDP highlights the need to
improve the productive capacities and business skills of rural communities, which it suggests
can be achieved through promotion of producer organizations, the strengthening of partnership
arrangements that stimulate increased agricultural production and trade, and the provision of
training in business plan development, among other activities. In all of these areas, the
objectives pursued under PAAP-II are well aligned with the NDP.
49.     The PAAP-II objectives remain highly relevant not only for the Government but also
for the World Bank. The Colombia Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY12-16 describes
three main areas of engagement: (i) expanding opportunities for social prosperity; (ii)
promoting sustainable growth with enhanced climate change resilience; and (iii) promoting
inclusive growth with enhanced productivity. PAAP-II contributed to all three areas,
particularly the third, by supporting activities designed to improve the productivity and
competitiveness of small rural producers, increase their engagement in formal markets, and
generate dynamic public and private sector involvement.
50.     Relevance of design. The approach to rural transformation embedded in the project
design -based on promoting entrepreneurship and improving competitiveness among
smallholder farmers by engaging them in demand-driven partnerships with the private sector,
while at the same time strengthening decentralized institutions- was highly relevant at appraisal
and remained highly relevant at project completion. The NDP and the Misión Rural both cite
the PAAP-II experience and indicate that the productive partnership approach is one of several
that the Government can use to move smallholders away from rural welfare programs and get
them engaged in commercially viable enterprises. The success of PAAP-II in linking
smallholders to markets is especially relevant in the context of the various free trade
agreements into which Colombia has entered in recent years, which are likely to expose


                                               13
Colombian producers to increased competition and require them to develop new, more
entrepreneurial skill sets.
51.     Relevance of implementation arrangements. The Project’s implementation
arrangements -especially the use of transparent, competitive calls for proposals that were
evaluated using an inclusive yet decentralized process- proved extremely effective for
generating successful and sustainable productive partnerships. The implementation
arrangements worked well under a wide range of circumstances, as evidenced by the fact that
the Project was able to serve many different types of beneficiaries, including beneficiaries from
so-called “disadvantaged groups,” such as indigenous people, people of Afro-Colombian
descent, women, and people living in post-conflict areas. Based on the PAAP-II experience,
similar implementation arrangements have since been replicated in other projects and countries.
By 2015, more than 20 World Bank projects in Latin America, Africa, and Asia have adopted
features of the productive partnerships approach.

3.2.   Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Substantial
52.     The Project Development Objective implicitly includes three principal sub-objectives:
(i) increase rural competitiveness, (ii) build up rural entrepreneurship in poor rural
communities, and (iii) do so in a sustainable manner. The following assessment of the Project’s
efficacy is based on the degree of achievement of the PDO indicators, taking into account as
well complementary information from the impact evaluation conducted by an independent
consulting firm. (The Data Sheet presents the full list of indicators and achievements, and
Annex 6 summarizes the main findings of the impact evaluation.)
53.    Increase in rural competitiveness. Achievement of this sub-objective is rated
Substantial, based on PDO Indicator 1. At appraisal, the cumulative value of sales by all
beneficiary producer organizations was expected to reach Co$350 billion. This target was
exceeded by 63%. At project closing, the cumulative value of sales stood at approximately
Co$572 billion.
54.     Examination of the sales data reveals that the target value was exceeded because the
number of productive partnerships formed was much higher than anticipated (725 partnerships
were formed, more than double the target of 300 partnerships set at appraisal). In contrast, the
average value of sales per partnership was lower than anticipated. Three factors appear to have
constrained the value of sales per partnership: (i) the budget cuts experienced during the early
years of implementation, which delayed the establishment of many partnerships; (ii) the fact
that many more partnerships than anticipated involved perennial crops (e.g., cacao, rubber,
lime, mango, avocado), which take a long time to become established, delaying the start-up of
sales; and (iii) a series of extreme weather events, which adversely affected agricultural
production and sales in many parts of the country. These factors slowed the growth of sales by
many partnerships relative to projections, but they may well turn out to be temporary. For most
partnerships, the value of sales continues to increase, and it seems very likely that the projected
average value of sales per partnership may yet be achieved.
55.     Evidence from the impact evaluation further supports the conclusion that the Project
increased the competitiveness of beneficiary producer organizations. The impact evaluation
results show that beneficiary producers have considerably greater access to sales contracts,


                                                14
collection centers, and transport services for their products compared to control group
producers (all differences being statistically significant at the 1% or 5% significance level).
Similarly, producers benefiting from the Project have better access to improved, certified
inputs and credit for productive investments, and they also reinvest a relatively large part of
their net revenues in their agricultural production compared to the control group. Moreover,
when comparing the production area at the beginning of the Project and at its completion, the
impact evaluation finds a significantly larger increase in the land area for cultivation between
beneficiary producers (5.4 hectares) and the control group (4 hectares). The impact evaluation
also shows significant income and employment generation impact among beneficiary
producers (see Section 3.5 and Annex 6).
56.     Build-up of rural entrepreneurship. Achievement of this sub-objective is rated
Substantial, based on PDO Indicators 2, 3, and 4. By project closing, 83% of participating
producer organizations had a manager, exceeding the target set at appraisal of 75%. Similarly,
by project closing, 80% of participating producer organizations were maintaining a system of
accounts, exceeding the target set at appraisal of 75%. 5 Finally, at project closing 50% of
producer organizations had recovered at least 70% of the grants made from their revolving
funds, falling short of the target set at appraisal of 75%.
57.      With respect to PDO Indicator 4, although the target set at appraisal was achieved only
partially, closer examination of the data on the recovery of grants made from the revolving
funds reveals a more nuanced picture (see Table A3.4 in Annex 3). Three results stand out.
First, across the entire universe of producer organizations, on average 64% of the grants made
from revolving funds were recovered, not far below the 70% recovery level used in establishing
the target. Second, among the 50% of producer organizations that achieved the target recovery
rate of 70%, the average amount recovered was 98%, significantly higher than the 70% target.
Third, most of the producer organizations that had not achieved the target recovery rate of 70%
are involved in the production of perennial crops (e.g., cacao, rubber, and mango). Because of
the long initial start-up period for perennial crops, production and sales start later than for
annual crops, limiting producers’ ability to repay the grant in early years. Taken together, these
results show that the revolving funds are working reasonably well, and as production and sales
pick up in partnerships involved in the production of perennial crops, it is likely that the target
set at appraisal will be achieved.
58.     Sustainability of partnerships. Achievement of this sub-objective is rated Substantial,
based on PDO Indicators 5, 6, and 7. At project closing, 88% of the Regional Management
Organizations (OGR) were having their contracts renewed annually, exceeding the target set
at appraisal of 80%. Also at project closing, the PCU had succeeded in mobilizing Co$104.5
billion in co-financing (mainly from municipal governments), far exceeding the target set at
appraisal of Co$22 billion. Finally, at project closing 80% of the partnerships that had been




5
    Indicators 2 and 3 were considered successfully achieved based on standardized evaluation procedures carried
    out by the OGRs. For instance, Indicator 2 relating to management was considered successfully achieved only
    when it had been established by the OGR that (i) a manager was in place, and (ii) the manager was performing
    satisfactorily with respect to at least 7 out of 10 pre-defined criteria.


                                                      15
operating for 24 months or more were actively linked to a commercial partner, exceeding the
target set at appraisal of 75%. 6
59.     Further evidence to support the conclusion that the partnerships formed under PAAP-
II will endure comes from the impact evaluation. Productive activities are more likely to be
sustained when producers actively reinvest in their enterprises. The impact evaluation data
show that beneficiary producers are more likely than the control group to reinvest part of their
net revenues into their enterprise. In addition, a significantly higher share of beneficiary
producers obtained credit for productive investments than producers in the control group (see
Annex 6 for details).

3.3.     Efficiency
Rating: Substantial
60.     An ex-post Economic and Financial Analysis (EFA) was carried out to measure the
economic efficiency of the Project. The EFA is based on data collected from a sample of 56
sub-projects drawn from a population of 257 sub-projects that had completed at least one cycle
of production and sales by the end of 2014, among other criteria. The sample of 56 sub-projects
was selected using a three-step procedure. In the first two steps, the sample was stratified to
ensure inclusion of sub-projects from different geographical regions and different sub-sectors.
In the third step, the final selection of sub-projects was done randomly. Primary data were
collected on these 56 subprojects and combined with secondary data obtained from project
records to calculate measures of economic and financial performance based on incremental net
benefits generated by the sub-project investments. The EFA results are relevant for 727 sub-
projects, representing 83% of the IBRD loan of US$30 million. 7 (Additional details about the
EFA, including the sampling and evaluation methodology, are described in Annex 4.)
61.     At appraisal, based on the assumption that 300 productive partnerships would be
financed and using a discount rate of 12%, the Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) to the
direct investments in subprojects was estimated at 24%, the Economic Internal Rate of Return
(EIRR) at 15%, and the aggregate Financial Net Present Value (FNPV) at US$67 million.
When indirect costs were included (i.e., pre-investment feasibility studies, technical assistance
and capacity, and project management and monitoring costs), the FIRR decreased to 18% and
the EIRR remained at 15%.
62.     At completion, the economic and financial indicators were recalculated 8 based on
actual costs and revenue flows recorded up until the time of project closing combined with
projections for the remainder of the 15-year period of analysis. Reliance on projections was


6
    Indicator 7 was estimated based on a relatively small number of partnerships. Of the 725 partnerships
    operating at project closing, only 134 had been active for more than 24 months. Of those 134, 107 were still
    linked to a commercial partner (80%). To provide additional evidence on the sustainability of partnerships,
    the sample was expanded by including partnerships that had been formed in PAAP-I. In the expanded sample,
    79% of producer organizations reported a continuing active partnership with a commercial partner.
7
    The number of 727 partnerships covered by the EFA differs from the number of 725 partnerships in operation
    at project completion, because the data for the EFA date from mid-December 2014, when 727 partnerships
    had signed subproject agreements. By project completion, two of those partnerships had not started operations.
8
    The ex-ante EFA done at appraisal used a slightly different methodology than the ex-post EFA done at
    completion, which should be taken into account when comparing results.


                                                       16
necessary because many sub-projects involved perennial crops with long gestation periods,
leading to deferred benefit streams.
63.    Financial analysis results: Using a discount rate of 12%, the FIRR was estimated at
29% and the FNPV at US$132 million. 9 When indirect costs were included, the FIRR
decreased to 27% and the FNPV to US$124 million. To test the robustness of these results in
the face of possible adverse technical, climate-, or market-related events, net incremental
income was reduced by 20%; under this scenario, the FIRR decreased further to 25% and the
FNPV to US$90 million.
64.    Economic analysis results: Using a discount rate of 12%, the EIRR was estimated at
26% and the aggregate ENPV at US$96 million. When indirect costs were included, the EIRR
decreased to 25% and the ENPV to US$89 million. When net incremental income was reduced
by 20% to reflect the impacts of possible adverse technical, climate-, or market-related events,
the EIRR decreased to 22% and the ENPV to US$63 million.

3.4.     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
65.    The overall outcome rating is based on the High relevance, Substantial efficacy, and
Substantial efficiency of the investments.

3.5.    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
66.     The conclusions presented in the following sub-sections draw on several sources of
information: (i) the final impact evaluation conducted in 2015; (ii) the targeted impact
assessment led by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) in 2014;
(iii) views expressed by participants in nine stakeholder workshops held in 2015; and
(iv) monitoring data from the Project M&E system.
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
67.     Poverty. The final impact evaluation carried out in 2015 used propensity score
matching techniques to compare the experience of project beneficiaries with that a control
group. The impact evaluation concluded that the net income of project beneficiaries increased
on average by 29% compared to the control group, while gross income increased by 20%.
Consistent with this finding, the impact evaluation also found a significant difference between
beneficiary producers and members of the control group in the perception of economic well-
being. Increased income was not an explicit objective in the Results Framework (increased
income is considered a long-term outcome that should not be measured at the level of
individual projects), but the finding is nevertheless significant because higher-order objectives
of the Project were to increase the income of beneficiaries and reduce poverty. The impact
evaluation also found that, compared to the control group, project beneficiaries realized
significant improvements in savings and access to credit (including from the revolving funds).
Finally, the impact evaluation determined that the Project generated significant amounts of
employment. All of these findings support the idea that the Project made a significant


9
    If the costs are included of non-paid labor (family labor) valued at market wage rates, the FIRR decreases to
    21% and the FNPV to US$67 million.


                                                       17
contribution to poverty reduction. The impact evaluation results relating to savings, credit,
employment generation, and spillovers are described in more detail below and in Annex 6.
68.     The CIAT impact assessment carried out in 2014, which focused specifically on
disadvantaged groups (i.e., indigenous people, people of Afro-Colombian descent and
internally displaced populations), similarly generated evidence that the Project has had a
significant and positive impact on the income of beneficiary households. Since the CIAT study
focused on a sub-group of project beneficiaries, the results cannot be extrapolated to the larger
population, but they are consistent with the results of the impact evaluation. The CIAT study
concluded that the income of beneficiary households that received productive and business
training under the project is 34% higher than the income of households that did not receive
training, in part because the beneficiary households receive on average 120% more income
from sales of the product produced under the partnership than other households. The income
effects remain positive and significant three years after project support to the partnerships ends.
The study found also that the benefits extend beyond income gains: households that received
productive and business training have a 10% greater probability of being classified as food
secure than households that did not receive training. This effect persists even three years after
project support ended. Results of the CIAT study are summarized in “Productive Partnerships:
An effective instrument for the inclusion of vulnerable population groups in diverse contexts
of Colombia.”
69.     Gender. Promoting gender inclusion was not an explicit objective, but the Project
Results Framework included an Intermediate Results Indicator that measured participation by
female-headed households. The Project was highly successful in reaching women producers;
direct project beneficiaries included 9,922 female-headed households, far more than the end-
of-project target of 2,550 female-headed households. Female-headed households thus
represented 23% of all beneficiary households.
70.    Disadvantaged groups. Direct project beneficiaries included 9,252 households headed
by indigenous people and people of Afro-Colombian descent, far exceeding the target of 1,275
such households. The CIAT study compared the performance of partnerships involving people
from these two disadvantaged groups to partnerships involving people from other groups and
found that the former performed as well and in some cases even better than latter (CIAT 2014).
71.    Conflict-affected zones. The Project operated effectively in many extremely
challenging environments, including conflict-affected areas. Data from the Project’s M&E
system show that about 15% of beneficiary households are located in conflict-affected zones
and that participation in those zones increased steadily over time.
(b) Institutional Change / Strengthening
72.     PAAP-II helped institutionalize the productive partnerships approach within MADR by
contributing to the establishment of policies, procedures, and human resources needed to
support, manage, and monitor hundreds of partnerships throughout the country. The
Project also contributed to building decentralized capacity, both in the public and private
sector: important legacies of the Project include the many Regional Management
Organizations that today are specialized in the provision of managerial and financial
intermediary services, as well as the many private firms and civil society organizations with
experience in providing technical assistance services as Local Management Organizations.



                                                18
73.      An important key to the success achieved by the Project in affecting institutional
change was the enormous amount of training provided to key actors. During its lifetime, the
Project sponsored 589 trainings and workshops that targeted many different groups. This
training clearly made a difference: a recurring theme in the beneficiary assessment workshops
is that the Project was extremely successful in combining classroom training with hands-on
learning (see Annex 8).
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
74.     Private sector engagement. One outcome that was not foreseen at preparation was the
degree of engagement of the private sector. Based on the experience of PAAP-I, the PCU made
a deliberate effort under PAAP-II to reach out to agribusiness firms, with the objective of
countering their inherent distrust of working with public institutions and smallholder producers.
This effort paid off: at completion, 369 new commercial partners had become involved with
PAAP-II, with each new commercial partner participating in 1.8 partnership subprojects on
average. The PAAP-II partnerships were established with a mix of large firms (42% of
partnerships), medium-sized firms (38%), and small firms (20%). The contribution made by
these commercial partners to the Project exceeded expectations, as many commercial partners
ended up providing technical assistance and/or financing investments in productive
infrastructure that directly benefited their partnering producers.
75.     Employment generation. Although employment generation was not an explicit
objective, it is important to note that the Project generated a large number of new jobs.
Extrapolating from the results of the EFA, it is estimated that the 725 partnerships created
under PAAP-II generated approximately 10,150 new jobs. In addition to supporting the
creation of new jobs, the Project also had a positive impact on existing jobs, as wages paid to
existing workers increased during the course of project implementation (see Annex 6).
76.     Spillover effects. The focus in this ICR is on the benefits that have accrued to direct
beneficiaries, but it is important to note that the Project generated considerable spillover
benefits that have accrued to non-beneficiary producers. More than 11,000 rural households
that were not members of a producer organization enrolled in a PAAP-II sub-project
nevertheless adopted (at their own expense) improved practices promoted through the Project
or were able to benefit from collective goods paid for by the Project. These spillover benefits
are documented in the impact evaluation (Annex 6), which included as one of its control groups
“nearby producers.” One significant spillover effect is the 24.4% higher gross income found
for “nearby producers” compared to “distant producers,” showing that the impact of PAAP-II
on Colombia’s rural sector was amplified beyond direct project beneficiaries (see Annex 6).

3.6.    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
77.     Impact evaluation. The impact evaluation involved structured surveys with 899
beneficiary households, 582 distant control group households, and 899 nearby control group
households drawn from a sample of 83 partnerships. As part of the same impact evaluation,
interviews were also conducted with representatives of 80 producer organizations and 80
commercial partners. The impact evaluation concluded that the Project exceeded most key
targets and had statistically significant impacts on targeted beneficiaries in several socio-
economic aspects compared to the control group. For example, data collected as part of the
impact evaluation show that the net and gross income of project beneficiaries increased by
29% and 20%, respectively, when compared to the net and gross income of the control group.


                                              19
Similarly, the impact evaluation found that the Project had led to a significant increase in
employment within beneficiary producer organizations compared to non-beneficiary producer
organizations. Further details and findings relating to the impact of the Project on key socio-
economic variables are presented in the Data Sheet, Sections 3.2 and 3.5, and in Annex 6.
78.     Beneficiary survey. The questionnaires used for the impact evaluation survey included
a number of questions designed to assess why various stakeholder groups decided to participate
in the Project, their perceptions of the relevance of the Project in meeting their needs, and their
level of satisfaction with the goods and services that they received. The main finding of the
beneficiary survey findings are summarized in Annex 7.
79.     Stakeholder workshops. To complement the quantitative evidence obtained through
the impact evaluation and the beneficiary survey, the Project organized eight regional
stakeholder workshops and one national stakeholder workshop. The purpose was to capture
the perceptions of the main stakeholder groups regarding the successes of the Project, identify
bottlenecks encountered during implementation, and collect lessons learned. More than 300
representatives of beneficiary producer organizations, commercial partners, OGAs, OGRs,
Departmental Secretariats of Agriculture, and other institutions participated in these
stakeholder workshops. Benefits identified by the participants include the strengthened
relationship between producers and commercial partners, the adoption of good agricultural
practices to improve product quality, the opening of access to new markets, the inclusiveness
of decision-making processes, and increases in income and improvements in the standard of
living of many producers. Participants in the workshops stressed the need to reduce
bureaucracy and delays in the partnership selection process, better integrate researchers and
academics in research and development activities, improve the relevance of training activities,
and strengthen partnerships even after the flow of project resources has ended. (The main
findings are summarized in Annex 8.)

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
80.     Sustainability of outcomes. A number of factors can be expected to contribute to the
sustainability of outcomes after closing of the Project: (i) strengthened institutional capacity in
the agricultural sector at national and especially regional level; (ii) strengthened technical and
managerial skills of producers and producer organizations, as reflected in the use of improved
inputs and production practices; (iii) improved access to productive infrastructure financed
through the government financial incentive; (iv) existence of revolving funds, most of which
are being maintained by producers, and resources which are frequently used to support
partnership activities; and (v) increased collaboration among public and private sector actors.
81.     Performance and reputational risks. Despite the factors mentioned above, several
risks remain that pose a threat to development outcomes. The largest risk stems from the
continuing uncertainty surrounding the Government’s commitment to the Productive
Partnerships Program. MADR management has repeatedly stated that it intends to continue the
productive partnership approach, but the level of financial resources to be provided remains
unclear. If the PCU is not maintained and assigned an adequate operational budget, ongoing
partnerships will likely suffer from a lack of robust supervision, and the Project’s M&E system
will be unable to collect and record new data. The lack of support from the PCU would likely
be mitigated by the capacity that already exists within many producer organizations and the


                                                20
strength of existing partnerships, which will allow them to continue to operate even in the
absence of continued support. Some partnerships-especially new ones that are not yet well
established- are likely to fail, however, which could undermine the strong image of success
that PAAP has established over the years.
82.     Other risks. As was highlighted in the ICR of PAAP-I, macroeconomic and weather
risks remain potential threats to the sustainability of the project outcomes. However, many
partnerships have demonstrated resilience in the face of adverse macroeconomic and weather
shocks, so this risk is considered moderate to low.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.   Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
83.      When PAAP-II was prepared, both the justification and the rationale for World Bank
support were solid. The Project directly addressed the Government’s rural development
priorities at the time, and it was well aligned with the World Bank Country Partnership Strategy
FY07-FY11.
84.     Preparation of the Project was made easier by the fact that the Task Team was able to
build on the implementation experience of a well-established and successful first phase
operation. It must be recognized that the team that prepared PAAP-II had carefully assessed
the experience of PAAP-I, recognizing key lessons learned, and incorporating those lessons
learned into the design of the follow-on operation. At the project level, adjustments were made
to the Results Framework, monitoring and evaluation plan, financial management and
procurement procedures, and safeguards enforcement systems that streamlined
implementation and reduced some of the obstacles that had plagued PAAP-I. At the sub-project
level, adjustments were made to the eligibility criteria, identification and screening procedures
for proposals, implementation support mechanisms, and evaluation procedures that reduced
start-up times, lightened administrative burdens on beneficiaries, and increased the rate of
successful outcomes.
85.      The results of these adjustments are reflected in the fact that PAAP-II achieved virtually
all of its major objectives, succeeded in institutionalizing the productive alliances approach
within MADR, trained a large cadre of people and organizations in the implementation of
productive partnerships, and will leave behind hundreds of thriving partnerships whose
prospects for continued growth and enduring success appear bright.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
86.     Throughout the life of the Project, World Bank task teams carried out two supervision
missions per year. The teams, comprising mainly World Bank staff but complemented as
needed with external consultants, consistently included a full complement of technical,
fiduciary, and safeguards specialists. During the supervision missions, the task teams worked
closely with their counterparts in the PCU to monitor ongoing activities, track progress



                                                21
achieved against the performance indicators, identify emerging challenges, and find timely
solutions. The aide memoires and Implementation Status and Results (ISR) reports filed
following the supervision missions show that the task teams consistently paid close attention
to detail, realistically assessed progress and challenges, regularly made constructive and
proactive recommendations to address problems, and followed up on agreements made.
87.     The close and trusting relationship that developed between the World Bank task teams
and the PCU was not affected adversely by several changes in leadership (four different Task
Team Leaders served on the Project throughout its lifetime). A hand-over mission was carried
out prior to every change to introduce the incoming Task Team Leader to key contacts in
MADR and in the PCU, provide opportunities to interact with other task team members in the
field, and familiarization with ongoing project activities.
88.     The implementation support provided by the World Bank task teams was continuous,
but not always entirely consistent. On several occasions, changes in World Bank operational
policies and procedures, or changes in the ways in which existing operational policies and
procedures were implemented, led to minor implementation delays as the PCU adjusted. For
example, in 2014 task teams across the World Bank were instructed to tighten up with respect
to the application of certain procurement procedures; in the case of PAAP-II, the perception of
the PCU was that the rules of the game had changed, as supporting documentation that
previously had been considered acceptable started being sent back for revisions.
89.     In addition to providing implementation support, the World Bank task teams acted as
global ambassadors for the productive partnerships approach. Because PAAP was one of the
first World Bank-supported projects to use the productive alliances approach, it attracted a
great deal of attention not only within Colombia but throughout Latin America and even
beyond. Task team members invested considerable time and effort in making presentations to
different groups about the PAAP experience. As the effectiveness of the approach started to
become apparent, interest in PAAP grew, and requests to visit the Project proliferated.
Particularly during the final years of implementation, the World Bank received many requests
from government agencies, non-governmental organizations, development agencies, producer
organizations, and other groups to help arrange learning exchanges and study tours.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
90.     The World Bank identified a project that directly addressed the government’s rural
development priorities and was well aligned with the World Bank Country Partnership
Strategy, produced a design that was appropriate for the objectives, and successfully
incorporated lessons learned from the earlier operation. During implementation, World Bank
task teams provided close and continual supervisions, were responsive to ongoing needs, and
proactive in addressing emerging challenges.




                                              22
5.2.   Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
91.     Government commitment to the Project varied throughout the course of
implementation. Three national elections were held during the life of the Project, each of which
resulted in changes in government priorities that affected the fortunes of the Project.
92.     The government that was voted into office during preparation was keen to build on the
success of PAAP-I, and it supported the preparation process with ample human and financial
resources. However when a fiscal crisis broke out in 2008, shortly after effectiveness had been
declared, the amount of counterpart funds provided was significantly reduced. This caused
serious implementation delays that for a while jeopardized the achievement of the development
objective and led to the downgrading of the overall project rating to Moderately Unsatisfactory
for about eight months in 2010.
93.     In 2010, national elections led to the inauguration of a new government. This
government was strongly supportive of the rural development agenda and sharply increased
the amount of counterpart funding provided to the Project, making it one of the best-financed
projects in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR). From 2011 to 2014,
the commitment of the government to the Project was satisfactory, and as a result
implementation performance improved significantly.
94.     In 2014, following another national election, the returning administration became more
ambivalent about the productive partnerships approach, and amidst a fiscal downturn the
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit did not make a firm financial commitment to finance a
third phase of the Project.
95.   Based on the experience described above, Overall Government Performance is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
96.     The PCU within MADR was responsible for implementing PAAP-II. The performance
of the PCU and the performance of MADR differed considerably, which was possible because
the PCU operated with a certain degree of autonomy.
97.     Generally speaking, the PCU performed well throughout the life of the Project. The
PCU was staffed by qualified and highly engaged professionals, many of whom were very
committed to the Project and who carried out their activities with great dedication in the face
of an ever-changing institutional environment. The PCU management team ably oversaw the
successful implementation of a large and diverse work program, made certain that activities
and outcomes were well documented, ensured that fiduciary functions were carried out in
compliance with World Bank and government policies and procedures, and maintained
proactive communications with partners and stakeholders at national and departmental levels.
The PCU management team was especially effective in instilling a learning culture among the
staff, making effective use of the Project’s well-developed M&E system to identify lessons
learned that could be used to adjust and improve operating procedures. With support from the


                                              23
management team, PCU staff pursued their assigned tasks with enthusiasm while
demonstrating flexibility and agility in incorporating lessons learned based on feedback
received from partners and stakeholders. The esprit de corps established within the PCU
proved especially important during the periodic phases when political support for PAAP waned
and budget allocations decreased. Despite the generally satisfactory performance, the PCU
exhibited a number of weaknesses typical of project implementation units, some of which took
longer than expected to resolve. Notable among these was the inconsistent performance in
complying with fiduciary requirements, including the timely submission of financial
management reports and annual audits (it should be noted, however, that the late submission
of financial reports was due in part to forces beyond the control of the PCU).
98.      In contrast to the consistently satisfactory performance of the PCU, the performance of
MADR was more variable. MADR adequately supported the Project throughout much of its
life, especially between 2011 and 2014 when PAAP enjoyed strong political support from the
Presidency, but changes in leadership within MADR sometimes undermined this support. Lack
of MADR support was particularly problematic during the final phase of the Project, which
unfortunately coincided with the turnover of many senior management positions. The resulting
institutional paralysis severely affected PAAP by delaying the preparation and timely
implementation of the transition plan, reducing the availability of resources to sustain ongoing
activities, and creating uncertainty about the future of the PAAP program. As the project
closing date of December 30, 2014 approached, it became clear that MADR was unprepared
to assume responsibility for the supervision of the approximately 120 sub-projects then under
implementation, so the government requested a six-month extension of the closing date to
allow time for the preparation of a transition plan. The transition plan was duly prepared and
approved by DNP and the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, but following the closing of
the Project on June 30, 2015, it was not fully implemented. This led to interruptions in the
implementation of on-going sub-projects, undermined the viability of the PAAP program
within MADR, and threatened the sustainability of the positive impacts that had been achieved
by the Project.
99.     Based on the generally satisfactory performance of the PCU and the varying
performance of MADR, Overall Implementing Agency Performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
100. Based on the Government Performance rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory and the
Implementing Agency Performance rating of Moderately Satisfactory, and taking into account
the fact that the Project achieved a Satisfactory outcome, Overall Borrower Performance is
rated Moderately Satisfactory.

6.     Lessons Learned
101. The productive partnerships approach can be a cost-effective way to boost
productivity, expand production, improve competitiveness, and link farmers to markets.
The approach is flexible and can be adapted to fit the needs of many different target groups,
value chains, and production environments. It has the capacity to serve not only well
established producer groups but also disadvantaged groups.


                                              24
102. Selection of sub-projects through an open, competitive process based on clearly
defined technical evaluation criteria can be crucial for establishing credibility among
stakeholders and avoiding political interference. Project beneficiaries—both producer
organizations and their commercial partners—have consistently indicated that the process used
by PAAP ensured that sub-projects were approved based on their merit, leaving few
opportunities for financing to be steered by government officials or local authorities to friends
and associates.
103. Accompanying producer groups over an extended period while they grow and
mature is crucial for ensuring long-term success. Instead of providing a one-off injection of
resources to launch a commercial partnership, PAAP accompanied producer organizations
over the course of their partnership subproject implementation period (18-24 months), with the
goal of building the capacity needed to ensure long-term survival. Technical assistance
provided under the Project focused on strengthening productive capabilities and
complementary training in managerial competencies and business development skills.
104. Transition planning for World Bank-financed projects should begin early and not
left to the final months of implementation. Ideally, transition planning should begin at the
time of the Mid-term Review and be monitored continuously thereafter. This will help to
ensure that project-supported activities can be moved smoothly to government agencies
following the closing of the World Bank loan, without suffering disruptions.
105. Successful projects that are not effective in communicating their achievements to
key audiences may have difficulty securing funding going forward. Despite a wealth of
evidence showing the positive results achieved by PAAP, MADR has struggled to secure
funding for a follow-on operation. One reason appears to be that key decision makers in DNP
and in the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit appear to be unfamiliar with the achievements
of the PAAP program.
106. CGIAR Centers are a source of information, knowledge, and capacity that can be
tapped to support project design and implementation activities. The impact assessment
carried out by CIAT provided insights leading to important lessons learned that not only have
helped document the outcomes of PAAP-I and PAAP-II but also will be extremely useful in
informing the design of future operations. The CIAT study has been particularly influential in
making the case that the productive partnerships model can effectively serve disadvantaged
groups in the population.

Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
107. The implementing agency (MADR) confirmed its agreement with the ICR conclusions
and ratings (the formal response appears in Annex 9). The Borrower’s Completion Report
(summarized in Annex 10) does not raise any significant issues that contradict the findings of
this ICR or demand an explanation.

A2.2 The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR) implemented the
Project through the Rural Development Directorate (DDR). In addition, MADR’s Productive
Value Chains Directorate provided technical advice to the Project through its participation in
the National and Regional Intersectoral Committees (see below).
A2.3 The National Intersectoral Committee (NIC) supervised the overall implementation
of the Project. The NIC was headed by the Minister of Agriculture in MADR and included
representatives of the Ministry of Environment (MinAmbiente), the National Planning
Department (DNP), the Administrative Unit for Territorial Consolidation (UAECT), the
National Export Promotion Institute (Pro-Colombia), the National Apprenticeship Service
(SENA), and the Colombian Rural Development Institute (INCODER).
A2.4 The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) managed the day-to-day operations of the
Project. The PCU was composed at the national level of a project coordinator and specialists
in agribusiness, environment, social development, fiduciary analysis, accounting, monitoring
and evaluation, as well as administrative support staff. The national PCU was complemented
by eight regional teams each comprising a regional coordinator, experts in agribusiness,
finance, environment, social development and project administration.



                                                                          27
A2.5 The Regional Intersectoral Committees (RICs) were created for each of eight
regions. Each RIC was responsible for: (i) defining the launch dates for the competitive calls
for subproject proposals and the business round tables; (ii) approving the proposals selected
by the Departmental Secretariats of Agriculture; and (iii) approving the grant awarded to each
partnership. The RICs were composed of local representatives of the same institutions
represented in the national committee.
A2.6 The Departmental Secretariats of Agriculture (SAs) disseminated information
about the invitations to submit subproject proposals and received and ranked the profiles based
on technical criteria. They also participated in the RIC and co-financed partnerships.
A2.7 The Regional Management Organizations (OGRs) were NGOs, consulting firms,
chambers of commerce, universities and other institutions with demonstrated capacity to
manage the process of structuring, preparing, and supervising the implementation of
partnerships. The OGRs were contracted competitively on a long-term basis to provide the
following services: (i) evaluation of the partnership subproject proposals presented to the SAs;
(ii) supervision of partnership preparation and structuring; (iii) supervision and monitoring
partnership implementation; (iv) reviewing and approving changes in the composition of the
government financial incentive grant to the partnerships under their supervision; (v) assessing
the performance of the OGAs that provided technical assistance to the partnerships; and (vi)
functioning as a secretariat for the RICs. Some OGRs involved in PAAP-II had participated in
the implementation of the first phase project.
A2.8 Local Management Organizations (OGAs) were private rural development
organizations specialized in the provision of certain goods and services and having knowledge
of local conditions. They assisted the partnerships during preparation, and provided the
partnerships with transfers of management skills and technology during implementation.
OGAs were selected competitively by the partners from a roster of OGAs approved by the
OGRs. Their services were paid by project funds. Some OGAs involved in PAAP-II had
already participated in the implementation of the first phase project.

                             Annex 3. Outputs by Component

A3.1 The Second Rural Productive Partnerships Project (PAAP-II) consisted of three
components. This annex briefly summarizes the outputs achieved under each component.
A3.2 Component 1: Partnership promotion and preparation (US$12.32 million, of
which IBRD US$3.41 million)
A3.3 Component 1 supported the identification and preparation of partnerships. This
involved several steps, including the issuing of annual competitive calls for partnership
proposals, the evaluation of partnership subproject proposals after they had been submitted,
the preparation of pre-investment feasibility studies for pre-selected partnerships, the
preparation of all necessary legal documentation, the approval of the financial incentive, and
the establishment of a business and operational plan for each partnership.
A3.4 The partnership selection process worked as follows: Every year, the Departmental
Secretariats of Agriculture (SAs) launched sensitization campaigns that culminated in calls for
partnerships proposals. After the period for submitting proposals ended, the SAs conducted an
initial evaluation of the proposals that had been received and pre-selected a certain number
(the number of proposals pre-selected in each Department was determined by MADR). The
SAs then forwarded the pre-selected proposals to the Regional Management Organizations
(OGR), which conducted a separate evaluation. The top 40% proposals ranked by the OGRs
were selected for pre-investment feasibility studies. The OGRs carried out pre-investment
feasibility studies to determine whether the proposed partnerships were viable based on
technical, commercial, financial, environmental, and social criteria. The PCU presented the
results of the pre-investment feasibility studies to the National Intersectoral Committee (NIC),
which reviewed the proposals and approved those that had been rated as viable. To complete
the process, legal agreements were drawn up among the partnership stakeholders, and
operational plans were defined
A3.5 Between 2008 and 2014, seven calls for partnership proposals were issued. In total,
more than 4,200 proposals were received, of which 3,081 were judged to have complied with
the eligibility criteria. Detailed information about the partnership proposal selection process
appears in Table A3.1 below.

A3.7 Component 2: Partnership implementation (US$327.13 million, of which IBRD
US$24.42 million)
A3.8 Component 2 supported the implementation of the partnerships identified and prepared
under Component 1. Matching grants (known as Incentivos Modulares, or government
financial incentives) were awarded to fund the activities laid out in the partnerships’ business
plans, including construction of on-farm infrastructure, purchasing of machinery, equipment,
and consumable inputs, and payment of labor costs. Component 2 also covered expenses
related to securing technical advisory services, preparing studies, and contracting training to
increase the productivity and entrepreneurial capacity of beneficiary producer organizations.
Finally, Component 2 supported the activities of project intermediaries, particularly the OGRs
and OGAs.
A3.9 The partnerships established under PAAP-II proved to be enduring. At project
completion, 725 of 744 partnerships established during PAAP-II (97.4%) were still operating.
Of the 19 partnerships that were no longer operating, just over 40% had discontinued
operations because their productive activities had been adversely affected by climatic shocks
(e.g., flooding, severe precipitation, or drought), and about 40% more had discontinued
operations because of implementations issues (e.g., lack of coordination among members of
the producer organization, failure of the municipality to provide promised funding, lack of
security).
A3.10 The number of beneficiaries served by partnership subprojects established under
PAAP-II was somewhat smaller than anticipated. Each partnership subproject served 58.5
beneficiaries on average, compared to 85 beneficiaries projected at appraisal. The number of
beneficiaries per partnership was lower than projected in part because as it became clear that
the most successful partnerships were those with strong solidarity between the members of the
participating producer organization, the PCU scaled back efforts to encourage expansion of
producer organizations. In addition, as the Project expanded into more remote, less densely
populated areas of the country, it became increasingly difficult to identify large producer
organizations.
A3.11 Coverage of the Project was extensive. At project completion, partnerships were
operating in 31 of Colombia’s 32 Departments. The densest coverage was achieved in the
Departments of Antioquia, Huila, Cauca, Risaralda, Bolivar, Meta, and Norte de Santander
(see Figure A3.2).

A3.12 Beneficiaries included both direct beneficiaries and indirect beneficiaries. In total,
42,552 producer households benefited directly from PAAP-II. Of the households that benefited
directly, about 23% were households headed by women and about 22% were households made
up of indigenous people or people of Afro-Colombian descent. An additional 11,057 producer
households benefited indirectly, in the sense that they belonged to producer organizations that
did not receive the government financial incentive grant but still benefited from collective
goods, such as community infrastructure, technical assistance, etc. In other words, an
additional 26% of non-beneficiary producers compared to the baseline Trends in key output
indicators financed under Component 2 are shown in Table A3.2. (Sales data are not included,
as they are discussed elsewhere in Section 3.2 and Annex 4.)

A3.13 PAAP-II was active in many different sub-sectors, with the heaviest concentration in
specialty coffee, cacao, fruits (especially fruits with short production cycles), and livestock.
PAAP-II financed productive investments over a vast area; by completion, sub-projects had
financed investments on approximately 67,000 hectares. Table A3.3 and Figures A3.3 and
A3.4 display the distribution of key partnership characteristics of subprojects in operation by
major product lines.

A3.14 PAAP-II was extremely effective in leveraging co-financing, not only from the central
government, but also from decentralized governments at the Departmental and municipal
levels. At completion, the total budget of PAAP-II stood at Co$104.5 billion, nearly five times
the Co$22 billion projected at appraisal.
A3.15 PAAP-II engaged actively with the private sector. By closing, 369 new commercial
partners had entered into PAAP-II partnerships, and 73 commercial partners that had
participated in PAAP-I partnerships remained engaged throughout the second phase (some of
these also entered into new, additional partnerships during PAAP-II). The PAAP-II
partnerships were established with a mix of large firms (42% of partnerships), medium-sized

firms (38% of partnerships), and small firms (20% of partnerships). The contributions of these
commercial partners included mainly technical assistance (e.g., workshops, demonstrations,
visits to processing plants) but also productive infrastructure (e.g., cooling tanks, storage
facilities, packaging materials).

A3.16 PAAP-II supported the establishment of revolving funds, which were initially financed
using funds recovered through the partial repayment scheme of the government financial
incentive grant managed by the producer organizations. The idea behind the revolving funds
was to provide producer organizations with a mechanism that they could use to finance their
continuing operations. By completion, 399 revolving funds were in operation. As reflected in
PDO Indicator, once a revolving fund had been established, the goal was to recover 70% of
the funds that were scheduled to be repaid. Although this target was not achieved (see
discussion in Section 3.2), across all producer organizations that had revolving funds, the
average recovery rate was 64% of the repayments programmed in their business plans, not
much below the 70% target (see Table A3.4). For many product lines, the repayment rate into
the revolving fund significantly exceeds the 70% target, reflecting the very high repayment


                                                35
rate (98%) of the 50% of producer organizations that exceed the 70% threshold. It is
noteworthy as well that most of the producer organizations which do not meet the 70%
repayment threshold produce perennial crops (e.g., cacao, forestry), which have long gestation
periods, limiting producers’ ability to repay quickly.

A3.17 Component 3: Management, monitoring and evaluation (US$6.12 million, of which
IBRD US$1.48 million)
A3.18 Component 3 covered project management costs at the national and regional level. It
financed the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), paid for staff in the Rural Development
Directorate (DDR) of MADR who supported the Project, as well as operational costs for the
monitoring system, evaluation studies, and yearly technical and financial audits. The central
PCU in Bogota was staffed by a project coordinator, several technical specialists, and a team
of fiduciary specialists (see Annex 2). The PCU was supported by eight teams operating at the
regional level. The number of PCU staff increased gradually over time as the number of
partnerships grew and demand for their services increased (Figure A3.5).

A3.16 Throughout the life of the project, the PCU produced all required progress and fiduciary
reports, including independent audits. As described in Section 2.4, audits were unqualified, but
audit performance was deficient from 2012 onwards, as the Bank had to grant waivers due to
the late submission of the 2012, 2013, 2014, and final audits.
A3.17 An important achievement of the PCU was the establishment of a Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) online platform, which provided access to information on progress
achieved against the project indicators, as well as information about the various partnerships
(participants, membership of the participating producer organizations, productive activities,
business activities, etc.). The M&E online platform also served as a repository for all PAAP-
II related pre-investment studies, reports, and training materials. Data available through the
project M&E online platform was used for many studies, including the Economic and Financial
Analysis (EFA), the CIAT impact assessment, and the final impact evaluation.

                              Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis


A4.1 Annex 4 summarizes the results of the ex-post Economic and Financial Analysis (EFA).
In addition to describing the methodological framework used for the IEFA, it presents the main
financial/economic feasibility indicators and compares them to those calculated at project
appraisal. The detailed tables and appendices of the Economic and Financial Analysis can be
found in the project files.
A4.2 Overall project outcome and impact. The main economic benefit generated by the
Project have been increases in net income realized by participating producer groups. These
increases in net income can be attributed mainly to increases in production, productivity (yield),
cultivated area, volume of marketed products, and/or product quality (unit price). Economic
benefits also have been generated in the form of increased seasonal and permanent employment
within participating agribusiness firms. Although difficult to quantify and value, an important
additional benefit has been the empowerment of many participating producer organizations
through capacity building and technical assistance, which has increased their ability to work
effectively and efficiently with commercial partners and build long-term relationships. Finally,
the Project has generated environmental benefits, since beneficiaries were mandated to develop
environmental management plans that have helped to mitigate negative environmental
externalities.
A4.3 Project outputs. In providing co-financing in support of 746 productive partnership
subprojects, the Project strengthened producer organizations in 54 sub-sectors. The support
provided to producer organizations proved to be enduring: of the 746 producer organizations
involved in PAAP-II sub-projects, only 19 (3% of the total number of supported partnerships)
had stopped operating by December 2014. 12 The 727 productive partnership subprojects still
operating in December 2014 were benefiting 42,713 direct beneficiaries. 13




12
     The sub-projects that stopped operating included four involving plantain; three involving mango; two
     involving cocoa; two involving specialty coffee; two involving aquaculture; and one each involving livestock,
     maracuya, sugar, bamboo, cotton and melina). The total investment of the cancelled partnerships represented
     COP 14.3 million, of which COP 3.6 million was financed through Incentivo Modular.
13
     The numbers of 746 partnerships established and 727 partnerships in operation used in the Economic and
     Financial Analysis (EFA) differs from the numbers of 744 partnerships established and 725 partnerships in
     operation at project completion, as the EFA was launched in mid-December 2014, when 727 partnerships had
     a signed subproject agreements. By project completion in June 2015, it had become clear that two of those
     partnerships would not be able to start operating due to problems in the induction process.

A4.4 Eligible investments. Support was provided in the form of (i) the Incentivo Modular
(mainly used to pay for on-farm infrastructure; machinery and equipment; consumable inputs
such as planting materials and fertilizers; labor; etc.), and (ii) technical assistance and training.
The maximum grant per household was established in the PAD at US$1,818, which could
increase to US$2,726, if the partnership was able to obtain an additional US$909 or more per
family in the form of commercial credit. While the amount of financing provided by the Project
through the Incentivo Modular was limited to 30% of the partnership investment costs, the
remaining 70% could come from different sources, including producer contributions (usually
provided in kind as land, labor, equipment and/or materials, all valued at market prices);
agribusiness partner contributions (often technical assistance, packaging materials, seeds,
fertilizer); local government contributions (usually financing); and contributions from other
partners such as the National Service for Apprenticeship (SENA), NGOs, or development
agencies.
Methodological approach for Ex-Post Analysis
A4.5 The financial and economic cost-benefit analysis entailed three distinct phases:
(i) population definition, sample selection, and review of secondary information to identify
information gaps; (ii) field data collection and validation of data through telephone
conversations with the producer organizations; and (iii) data aggregation and analysis.
A4.6 The sample for the EFA was selected in November 2014, using secondary information
and the project data base. Because many of the partnerships that were operational at that time
were still getting established and had not recorded significant sales, the following criteria were
used to define the eligible partnerships from among the 727 partnerships that were in operation
at that time, to ensure that partnerships selected for inclusion in the EFA would be sufficiently
mature to allow estimation of benefits:




                                                      38
     (i)      Partnerships that had completed the implementation of the sub-project funded
              through the matching grant, as indicated by the disbursement of the final tranche of
              the Incentivo Modular by 31 December 2014;
     (ii)     Partnerships active in one of the main productive sub-sectors, 14 defined as sub-
              sectors that had received at least of 2.5 percent of the total investment support
              provided by the Project (these included cocoa, specialty coffee, livestock, plantain,
              rubber, avocado, blackberry, and aquaculture);
     (iii) Partnerships that had completed at least one cycle of production and sales

A4.7 Application of these criteria reduced the number of partnerships eligible for inclusion
in the EFA to 257 partnerships, These 257 partnerships had investments in sub-projects totaling
US$146 million, or about 37% of the total investments made in sub-projects under PAAP II.
The difference between total number of approved sub-projects (746) and the number of sub-
projects included in the population eligible for inclusion in the EFA (257) stemmed from the
fact that a significant number of sub-projects had been approved during the later years of
project implementation, so many did not meet the criterion of having completed at least one
cycle of production and sales. Out of US$146 million in total investment associated with the
257 eligible partnerships, US$31 million (21%) came from the Project through the Incentivo
Modular, whereas US$115 million (79%) was contributed by beneficiaries, local governments,
or other sources.

A4.10 From this population, a sample of 56 sub-projects was selected through a 2-stage
process stratified by main sub-sectors and geographic location. From each of the 8 most
important sub-sectors, 7 sub-projects were selected so as to have a minimum critical number
to assess the efficiency of investments in each of these sub-sectors (see Table A4.4). 15 One
sub-project could not be visited due to security concerns during the period of field work and
had to be dropped from the sample. This occurred very late in the survey so it was not possible
to replace it with another sub-project. The final selection of partnerships (after stratification)
was done on a random basis. However, given the geographic dispersion of the population and
the limited resources in terms of time, human and transportation costs, geographic proximity
was taken into account during the final selection. Therefore, the productive partnership sub-
projects were located along four routes: Route 1 (Risaralda); Route 2 (Quindios and Caldas);
Route 3 (Meta) and Route 4 (Valle del Cauca).
Information gathering and systematization
A4.11 Information available in the M&E system for each of the productive subprojects in the
sample was extracted, analyzed, and systematized. Based on this analysis, gaps were identified
in the data needed to conduct the ex-post cost-benefit analysis. An Excel-based data collection
tool was designed to ensure consistency in data collection while allowing for sufficient
flexibility to reflect specificities of each sub-sector. To assess the performance of the
productive subprojects, past data on key technical and financial parameters were collected from
the producers associations. In addition, the most likely scenarios for the future evolution of
these parameters were discussed with producer organizations and other key informants for both
the “with” and “without project” situation.




15   One sub-project could not be visited due to security concerns during the period of field work and had to be
     dropped from the sample.

Calculation of efficiency parameters
A4.12 Using the primary and secondary data, a detailed ex-post cost benefit analysis was
conducted for each of the 55 subprojects, covering a 10-year period. In addition to the Internal
Rate of Return (IRR), the following parameters were estimated (by partnership and by family):
incremental annual net income, employment generated (family, seasonal and permanent), and
incremental Net Present Value (NPV) using a discount rate of 12 percent to reflect the
opportunity cost of capital.
A4.13 The IRR and NPV were calculated from both the financial and the economic
perspective, using market and economic prices, respectively. Given the importance of family
labor (which in many cases accounted for the bulk of production costs), the FIRR was
calculated both with and without family labor valued at market wage rates. For the economic
analysis, conversion factors for Colombia estimated by the Planning National Department
DNP 16 were used to transform market prices into economic prices. Table A4.5 displays the
conversion factors used in this analysis.

     The conversion factors were obtained from the Sub-directorate of Projects and Information for the Public
     Investment. For further details, refer to: https://www.dnp.gov.co/programas/inversiones-y-finanzas-

A4.14 Based on the results of the sample analysis, average incremental net income flows were
calculated for each sub-sector. This provides the basis for the extrapolation of results from the
sample to the universe of the eight sub-sectors by multiplying the average cost and revenue
streams by the number of sub-projects in each sub-sector.
Ex Post Economic and Financial Analysis of Productive Partnerships
A4.15 Out of the 55 sub-projects analyzed, 43 sub-projects (79%) were found to have FIRRs
above 12%, and 12 sub-projects (21%) were found to have FIRRs below 12%. The low returns
of some sub-projects is attributable to the long delays in sub-project implementation due to
late disbursement of counterpart funds from other public funding sources. In case of rubber,
the 15 year period covered by the analysis does not capture the full benefits stream, given that
rubber trees have a seven-year gestation period and a productive life spanning several decades.
A4.16 Aggregated financial and economic indicators are displayed in Tables A4.6 and A4.7.
FIRRs range from 18% (rubber) to 38% (plantain) and average 29% across sub-sectors. Adding
the incremental costs of family labor valued at market rates reduces the FIRR to 21% on
average. The overall EIRR is 26%, ranging from 16% (rubber) to 40% (plantain). The
aggregate FNPV is US$132 million, which falls to US$67 million if family labor valued at
market rates is included. The ENPV comes to US$96 million.

A4.18 Sensitivity analysis. To test the robustness of the results against adverse technical,
climate or market related events, sensitivity analysis was conducted on the full-cost scenario
(i.e., including proportionate indirect costs) by imposing a 20% reduction of net incremental
income. The results were found to be quite robust, with the FIRR decreasing only slightly to
25% and the FNPV to US$90 million. Applying economic prices, the EIRR falls further to
22% and the ENPV to US$62 million.


                                                               43
A4.19 Employment creation. On average, each partnership generated 14 full time jobs.
Extrapolating from these results to the entire population of subprojects, it is estimated that
PAAP-II generated nearly 3,750 full time jobs. Partnerships involved with production of
plantain and blackberry generated the largest number of full time jobs on average (37 jobs and
26 jobs, respectively). If the rate of employment creation is similar among all 746 sub-projects
supported by the Project, then the total number of equivalent jobs created would be
approximately 10,444.
A4.20 Incremental income. In 2014, average annual incremental net income per beneficiary
generated by subprojects ranged from US$193 (cocoa) to US$4,754 (aquaculture). The low
incremental net income observed in some sub-sectors (e.g., cocoa, avocado, and rubber) is due
to the long gestation periods for these commodities, which results in negative returns during
the first few years when trees are still maturing and have not begun to produce. When average
annual incremental net income is calculated for the period Year 3 through Year 15, the average
net returns look considerably more attractive, ranging from US$1,863 per beneficiary
(plantain) to US$4,400 (livestock).
Comparison of ex ante and ex post EFA results
A4.21 In comparing the results of the ex post EFA with those of the ex-ante EFA, several
methodological differences need to be taken into account. First, the ex-ante analysis was
mainly based on business plans for about 50 sub-projects funded under PAAP-I, combined
with ex-post data from a small sample of only eight sub-projects. Second, the analysis was
based on total net benefits rather than on incremental net benefits, and hence no “without
project” scenario was considered. Third, in the ex-ante analysis, the commodities analyzed
(fish, onion, sugar, mandarin oranges, African palm) and used as basis for estimating the
overall project returns turned out to be quite different from the commodities that actually
benefited from the investment.

A4.22 Cocoa partnerships. The Project has supported 146 cocoa partnerships, with a total
investment value of US$84 million (21% of total investments in productive partnerships), of
which US$19 million was contributed by the Incentivo Modular. Cocoa partnerships benefited
9,906 producers (23% of all project beneficiaries).
A4.23 Seven cocoa partnerships were analyzed in detail: ASOVICA, ASOPROBEL,
PROASPEN, PALENQUE, UNION TEMPORAL RIO DUDA, AGROSABANA, and
ASOCAMPOARIRI. These seven partnerships represent a total investment value of US$3.27
million, of which US$0.8 million was contributed by the Incentivo Modular. Investment costs
fell into the following categories: agricultural inputs (40%); equipment and capital goods (6%);
technical assistance (15%); labor (10%); Social and Environmental Plans (10%); OGA (16%)
and hired management (3%). Out of seven cocoa partnership subprojects analyzed, all reported
increases in cultivated area, six reported increases in yields, two reported improvements in the
quality of their cocoa, and one reported receiving higher prices.
A4.24 The average investment in cocoa partnership subprojects was US$0.46 million (of
which US$0.12 million was contributed by the Incentivo Modular). The financial and
economic indicators for each subproject. The average FIRR and FNPV are 19% and US$0.25
million (or US$4,231 per beneficiary). Eliminating the incremental costs of family labor
valued at market wage rates from the analysis, the IRR increases to 29% and the resulting NPV
to US$0.57 million (or US$9,529 per beneficiary). The average EIRR for the seven
partnerships is 20% resulting in an average ENPV of US$0.38 million (or US$6,292 per
beneficiary) applying a 12% discount rate.
A4.25 On average, the incremental annual net income per productive subproject after project
year 3 is US$172,629 (and US$2,990 per family). 17 Cocoa partnerships also show an important
average increase of annual family labor of 3.35 person/days (equivalent to 12 person/year),
and an average increase of annual seasonal labor (paid worker) of 848 person/days (equivalent
to 3 person/year). Little permanent employment is created at the level of the associations: an
average of 0.71 person/year (depending on the partnership).
A4.26 Specialty coffee partnerships. The Project has supported 102 coffee partnerships
benefiting 7,849 producers (18% of the total project beneficiaries). The total investment value
was US$78 million (20% of total investments in productive partnerships), of which US$17
million was contributed by the Incentivo Modular.
A4.27 Seven coffee partnership subprojects were analyzed in detail: CAFEMASU, ASOAPIA,
ASOCAFES, ACOC CAFÉ SANO, CUCHILLA DE DAN JUAN, APECAFEQ, and ALTOS
DE LA SIERRA. The total investment volume amounts to US$4.5 million (including US$1.02
contributed by the Incentivo Modular). On average, investment costs fell into the following
categories: agricultural inputs (30%); equipment and capital goods (22%); Social and
Environmental Plans (17%); OGA (15%); technical assistance and training (13%); and hired
management (2%).

A4.28 The average investment in special coffee partnership subprojects was US$0.65 million
(of which US$0.15 was contributed by the Incentivo Modular). The average FIRR and FNPV
are 28% and US$0.44 million, respectively (or US$5.51 per beneficiary). Removing the costs
of family labor valued at market wage rates, the IRR increases to 36% and the resulting FNPV
to US$0.84 million (US$10,352 per beneficiary). From the economic perspective, average
EIRR and ENPV are 32% and US$0.54 million (or US$6,717 per beneficiary) when applying
a 12% discount rate.
A4.29 The project investment has impacted on the productive base of the associations.
Therefore, out of seven special coffee subprojects analyzed, five reported increases in
cultivated area, all seven reported increases in yield, six reported improvements in coffee
quality, and three reported receiving higher prices.
A4.30 On average, the incremental annual net income per productive subproject after project
year 3 is US$183,647 (or US$2,474 per beneficiary). Coffee partnerships have generated an
average annual increase of non-paid labor of 2,755 person/days (equivalent to 10 person/year)
and of seasonal labor of 2,095 person/days (equivalent to 7 person/year). On average, non-
permanent employment has been generated in the coffee partnerships, with the exception of
ASOCAFES that has recruited a manager.
A4.31 Livestock partnerships. The Project has supported 113 livestock partnerships with a
total investment value of US$70 million (18% of total investments in productive partnerships),
of which US$13 million was funded by the Incentivo Modular and US$57 million by the
counterparts, benefiting 6,099 producers (14% of the total number of beneficiaries).
A4.33 Seven livestock partnerships were evaluated: AGROGANAL I, AGROGANAL II,
CORELAC, ASOLHER, APRAGEN, ASOPROAGRO, and ALMEGAN. The total
investment value of US$3.37 million included US$0.52 million contributed by the Incentivo
Modular IM. On average, investments fell into the following categories: agricultural inputs
(34%); equipment and capital goods (22%); OGA (18%); Social and Environmental Plans
(11%); technical assistance and training (10%); and hired management (4%). Out of the seven
livestock projects analyzed, all have shown increases in milk production per cow, six have
reported increased birth rates, three reported having received higher prices, three have reported
increased lactation periods, and one has reported increased grazing areas.
A4.34 The average investment in livestock partnership subprojects was US$0.48 million (of
which US$0.07 was contributed by the Incentivo Modular).
A4.35 The average FIRR and FNPV per partnership are 18% and US$0.16 million (or
US$4,753 per beneficiary), respectively. By removing the “unpaid” family labor valued at
market wage rates, average FIRR increases to 20% and the FNPV rises to US$0.22 million
(US$6,242 per beneficiary). The average EIRR and ENPV are 19% and US$0.17 million per
partnerships (US$4,978 per beneficiary) applying a 12% discount rate.
A4.36 On average, the incremental annual net income per productive subproject after project
year 3 is US$137,203 (or US$4,400 per beneficiary). The impact in term of employment
generation has been low across the analyzed partnerships: 1.63 non-paid person/year and 0.68
person year for seasonal jobs were created. One permanent employment has been generated on
average per livestock partnership.

A4.37 Plantain partnerships. The Project has supported 55 plantain partnership sub-projects
in the plantain sector with a total investment value of US$19 million (5% of total investments
in productive partnerships), of which US$5 million was funded by the Project and US$13
million by diverse counterparts contributions, benefiting to 2,854 producers or 7 percent of the
total project beneficiaries.
A4.38 Seven plantain partnerships were evaluated: AGROPEBERL, APLABAL,
ASOPLABEL, ASOPLAGEN, I, ASOPLAPIA, ASOPLAPIA II, and FRUTANDINA,
representing an average total investment of US$2.43 million (including US$0.76 million that
was contributed by the Incentivo Modular). Each plantain partnership benefited 70 producers.
Investments fell into the following categories: Equipment and capital goods (12%); agricultural
inputs (44%); labor (16%); technical assistance and training (5%); Social and Environmental
Plans (7%); OGA (13%) and Manager (2%). Out of seven plantain subprojects analyzed, five
reported increases in cultivated area, all seven reported increases in yield, and two reported
having received higher prices.
A4.39 The average investment in plantain partnership subprojects was US$034 million (of
which 0.10 was contributed by the Incentivo Modular). Average FIRR and FNPV were
estimated at 20% and US$0.19 million (or US$2,811 per beneficiary). Removing the costs of
family labor valued at market wage rates, the FIRR increases to 38% and the resulting FNPV
to US$0.68 million (or US$9,883 per beneficiary). The average EIRR for the 7 partnerships is
40%, resulting in an average ENPV of US$0.64 million (or US$9,250 per beneficiary)
applying a 12% discount rate.
A4.40 On average, the incremental annual net income per productive subproject after project
year 3 is US$121,927 (or US$1,863 per beneficiary). On average, plantain partnerships
generate relatively more employment, as they lead to increased use of family labor (an
additional 26.87 persons / year) and increased use of seasonal paid workers (an additional 9
persons / year, equivalent to an increase in permanent employment of one person / year.)
A4.41 Rubber partnerships. The Project has supported 36 rubber partnerships for an
investment value of US$18 million. Of this amount, US$3 million was contributed by the
Incentivo Modular, and US$15 million came from counterpart funding, benefiting a total of
1,766 producers.
A4.42 Because of security issues, it was not possible to meet with or collect data from
ASOPROCAVIS II was not possible due to reason of public order, so only six out of seven
partnerships were analyzed: ASCULTICAUCHO, ASOHECALDAS I, ASOHECALDAS II
ASOHECESAR, CORPOCAME, and VILLA LA PAZ. The total investment in rubber sub-
projects totaled US$2.9 million (including US$0.48 million contributed by the Incentivo
Modular), benefiting an average of 260 producers per subproject. Investments fell into the
following categories: Equipment and capital goods (11%); agricultural inputs (39%); labor
(3%); technical assistance and training (11%); Social and Environmental Plans (11%); OGA
(21%) and Manager (3%). Out of seven rubber subprojects analyzed, 5 reported increases in
cultivated area and in yield, and 2 reported improvements in rubber quality.
A4.43 The average investment in rubber partnership subprojects was US$0.49 million (of
which 0.08 was contributed by the Incentivo Modular).




                                              47
A4.44 The average FIRR and FNPV are 14% and US$0.05 million (or US$1,166 per
beneficiary), respectively. Eliminating in the incremental flows the costs of family labor valued
at market wage rates, the IRR increases to 18% and the resulting NPV to US$0.16 million (or
US$3,756 per beneficiary). The average EIRR for the 6 partnerships is 16% resulting in an
average ENPV of US$0.11 million (or US$2,528 per beneficiary) applying a 12% discount
rate.
A4.45 On average, the incremental annual net income per productive subproject after project
year 3 is US$111,918 (and US$2,696 per family 18). Rubber partnerships also show an increase
on average of annual family labor of 1,565 person/days (equivalent to 5.43 person/year), and
an average increase of annual seasonal labor (paid worker) of 523 person/days (equivalent to
1.82 person/year). Little permanent employment is created at the level of the associations: an
average of 1 person/year (depending on the partnership).
A4.46 Avocado partnerships. The Project has supported 146 avocado partnerships sub-
projects that sum up to an investment value of US$10 million (2% of total investments in
productive partnerships), of which US$3 million was contributed by the Incentivo Modular
and US$7 million came from counterpart funds. Cocoa partnerships benefited 1,466 producers
(3% of the total project beneficiaries).
A4.47 Seven avocado partnerships were analyzed in depth: APATEX APROARÉ,
ASOAGROACEBAL, ASOFRUTOS, ASOHOFORMA, ASOPROQUIN and FUNDEA.
These seven partnerships represented a total investment value of US$2.08 million, of which
US$0.59 was contributed by the Incentivo Modular. Investments fell into the following
categories: Equipment and capital goods (16%); agricultural inputs (34%); technical assistance
(14%); Social and Environmental Plans (15%); OGA (17%) and Manager (4%). Out of seven
avocado subprojects analyzed, six reported increases in cultivated area, all seven reported
increases in yield, and five reported increase in prices received. The average investment in
avocado partnership subprojects was US$0.29 million (of which US$0.08 million came in the
form of a contribution from the Incentivo Modular).
A4.48 The average FIRR and FNPV are 21% and US$0.15 million (or US$3,323 per
beneficiary), respectively. Eliminating in the incremental flows the costs of family labor valued
at market wage rates, the IRR increases to 31% and the resulting NPV to US$0.36 million (or
US$7,793 per beneficiary). The average EIRR for the seven partnerships is 24% resulting in
an average ENPV of US$0.17million (or US$3,785 per beneficiary) applying a 12% discount
rate.
A4.49 On average, the incremental annual net income per productive subproject after project
year 3 is US$87,083 (and US$2,037 per beneficiary). Cocoa partnerships also show an
important average increase of annual family labor of 2,087 person/days (equivalent to 7
person/year), and an average increase of annual seasonal labor (paid worker) of 839
person/days (equivalent to 3 person/year). Little permanent employment is created at the level
of the associations: an average of 0.55 person/year (depending on the partnership).
A4.50 Blackberry partnerships. The Project has supported 24 blackberry partnerships that
sum up to an investment value of US$9 million (2% of total investments in productive


18
     Including the cost of non-paid labor valued at market prices.

partnerships), of which US$2 million was contributed by the Incentivo Modular and US$6
million by counterpart. Cocoa partnerships benefited 1,238 producers (3% of all project
beneficiaries).
A4.51 Seven partnerships were analyzed in depth: AFRUZAP, ASMOBEL,
ASOCOMPARTIR, ASOFRUMO, ASOMORA, COPAC, and FRUTIMORA. They
represented a total investment value of US$3.44 million, of which US$0.76 was contributed
by the Incentivo Modular. Investments fell into the following categories: Equipment and
capital goods (18%); agricultural inputs (39%); technical assistance (13%); Social and
Environmental Plans (10%); OGA (17%); and Manager (3%). Among the seven blackberry
subprojects analyzed, all reported increases in cultivated area and in yield, four reported having
received increase in prices, and one reported having significantly improved blackberry quality.
The average investment in blackberry partnership subprojects was US$0.49 million (of which
0.10 came through the Incentivo Modular contribution).
A4.52 Average FIRR and FNPV are 28% and US$0.43 million (or US$7,628 per beneficiary),
respectively. Eliminating in the incremental flows the costs of family labor valued at market
wage rates, IRR increases to 32% and the resulting NPV to US$0.58 million (or US$10,270
per beneficiary). The average EIRR for the 7 partnerships is 35% resulting in an average ENPV
of US$0.59 million (or US$10,431 per beneficiary) applying a 12% discount rate.
A4.53 On average, the incremental annual net income per productive subproject after project
year 3 is US$171,235 (and US$3,251 per beneficiary). Blackberry partnerships also show an
important average increase of annual family labor of 3,339 person/days (equivalent to 12
person/year), and an average increase of annual seasonal labor (paid worker) of 3,744
person/days (equivalent to 13 person/year). Little permanent employment is created at the level
of the associations: an average of 1.68 person/year (depending on the partnership).
A4.54 Aquaculture partnerships. The Project has supported 17 aquaculture partnerships for
a total investment value of US$7 million (2% of the total investments in productive sub-
projects), of which US$2 million was contributed by the IM and US$5 million by counterpart.
Aquaculture partnerships benefited 660 producers (22% of all project beneficiaries).
A4.55 Seven aquaculture partnerships were analyzed in depth: MEDIO BAUDO, ASOPISAN,
PAAS, ASOPEZ, AGROCAMTO, COOPISAIPE, and COOPEZCA, representing a total
investment value of US$3.37 million, of which US$0.66 was contributed by the Incentivo
Modular. Average investments essentially fell into the following categories: Equipment and
capital goods (10%), agricultural inputs (41%), labor (15%), technical assistance (11%), Social
and Environmental Plans (6%), OGA (14%), and Manager (3%). Among the seven aquaculture
subprojects analyzed, all seven reported reductions in mortality and increases in the density of
fish, six reported having received higher prices, and five reported increases in cultivated area.
The average investment in aquaculture partnership subprojects was US$0.48 million (of which
US$0.09 million was contributed by the Incentivo Modular).
A4.56 The average FIRR for aquaculture projects is 21%, and the average FNPV is US$0.20
million (or US$6,087 per beneficiary). Removing the cost of family labor valued at market
wage rates, the IRR increases to 24%, and the NPV rises to US$0.29 million (or US$8,885 per
beneficiary). The average EIRR for the seven partnerships is 27% resulting in an average
ENPV of US$0.32 million (or US$9,831 per beneficiary) applying a 12% discount rate.

A4.57 On average, the incremental annual net income per productive subproject after project
year 3 is US$122,420 (and US$3,518 per beneficiary). Aquaculture partnerships also show
important increases in the use of family labor of 2,388 person days (equivalent to eighth full
time jobs per year), and an average increase of annual seasonal labor (paid worker) of 1,139
person/days (equivalent to four full-time jobs per year). Little permanent employment is
created at the level of the associations, however: aquaculture projects generate only around 1
person/year (depending on the partnership).

                          Annex 6. Summary of Impact Evaluation


A6.1 This Annex summarizes the main results of the impact evaluation of the project
conducted in 2015. To estimate the Project’s results and impacts, an independent firm
(Econometria) implemented structured household surveys with 899 beneficiary producers and
1,481 comparable control group producers. The household survey questionnaire modules
captured main socio-economic household and production characteristics to assess the Project’s
effect on results, PDO outcomes, as well as longer-term impacts. The sampling strategies to
select beneficiary producers and control group producers for the evaluation, as well as the
quasi-experimental methodologies used for the intermediary results and impact analyses are
described below.
A6.2 To complement the information collected through the producer household surveys,
additional in-depth interviews were held with representatives of 80 producer organizations and
80 commercial partners, which were chosen randomly to be representative for their respective
population. The objective of these complementary interviews was to capture additional
information to assess producer organizations’ and commercial partners’ roles in determining
the project’s intermediary results and impacts, and to control for relevant determinants in the
impact analysis. Finally, additional findings from of these surveys regarding producer
organizations’ and commercial partners’ views on satisfaction, advantages, and challenges of
the Project are presented in Annex 7.
Sampling and Methodology
A6.3 General sampling strategy. Three types of producers were sampled for the impact
evaluation: (i) beneficiary producers of the Project, i.e. the “treatment group” (ii) control group
producers who lived in or near the localities of the beneficiary producers, i.e. the “nearby
control group”, and (iii) control group producers who lived far from the localities of the
beneficiary producers, i.e. the “distant control group”. To be selected into the (nearby and
distant) control group sample, non-beneficiary producers had to have the same or very similar
characteristics as the beneficiary producers in terms of the eligibility criteria for project
participation (e.g., the criteria defined in the calls for proposals, such as social, demographic,
and economic characteristics, but also in terms of agricultural production and size). This
similarity between beneficiary and control groups is crucial to obtain reliable results which can
be attributed to the Project, as it controls for self-selection in the impact analysis and enables
the estimation of spillover effects generated by the project. The sampling strategy was designed
to be able to estimate statistically significant differences in average results between treatment
and control at a 95% confidence level.
A6.4 Sampling of beneficiary partnerships and producers (treatment group). To select
the beneficiary producers to be interviewed for the impact evaluation, in a first step
partnerships of the Project were selected according to the following criteria: partnerships to be
selected (i) had to have finalized all investments financed through the government financial
incentive grant provided through PAAP-II, (ii) had to have passed at least one production cycle,
and (iii) had to have passed one cycle of sales. At the time of the impact evaluation design
(early 2015), these criteria resulted in a population of 202 partnerships for the analysis.
Furthermore, it is important to note that the impact evaluation sample is stratified on the main


                                                53
productive systems supported through the government financial incentive grant (i.e., specialty
coffee, cacao, dairy cattle livestock, blackberry, other short-cycled fruits, such as plantain and
others). Within each of these productive system strata, simple random sampling was applied
to select the partnerships for the impact evaluation sample. Of those selected partnerships,
beneficiary producers were divided in strata based on the size and amount of the government
financial incentive grant they had received. For the final impact evaluation sample, beneficiary
producers within each stratum were selected randomly, so that the proportion of strata in the
impact evaluation sample mirrored the proportion in the population. It is important to note that
the sampling strategy for the impact evaluation is based on project characteristics as of
December 31, 2014; some of the characteristics had changed slightly by project closing (e.g.,
total number of partnerships and beneficiaries, investments made per productive system, etc.).
Yet, the overall results of the impact evaluation can be expected to be valid.
A6.5 The sampling strategy resulted in a final sample of 899 beneficiary producers from 83
PAAP-II partnerships located in 86 municipalities. The distribution of those beneficiary
producers across the productive system strata is displayed in Table A6.1.

A6.6 Sampling of control group producers. The sampling design for the impact evaluation
included two control groups, “distant” and “nearby.” The distant control group can be
considered the control group commonly used in impact analyses. As the producers sampled in
the distant control group are expected not to have been influenced by project activities (given
that they are far outside its radius of action), the results found for these groups can be
considered as the “pure” counterfactual to the beneficiary household treatment group. In
addition, the impact evaluation included a nearby control group to assess whether the Project
generated externalities to non-beneficiaries and thereby created potential spillover effects
beyond the Project’s direct beneficiaries. The measurement of potential positive spillover
effects is important, because ignoring their existence can lead to an underestimation of the
overall impact of a project (e.g., when producers who benefited from spillovers are selected
into the control group). The nearby control group for the impact evaluation of PAAP-II was
composed of producers who lived in or near the localities of the beneficiary producers, but did
not directly benefit from the Project. Producers in both control groups were randomly selected
from non-beneficiary producers who lived in or near the localities of the beneficiary producers
(nearby control group) and/or who lived far from the localities of the beneficiary producers
(distant control group). The final control group sample was composed of 582 distant control
group producers and 899 nearby control group producers.

A6.7 Methodologies used for analyses. Due to the lack of representative baseline data, the
analyses on intermediary results and impacts used quasi-experimental methodologies.
Regarding the comparison of results for the beneficiary producers to the control group
producers, it is important to recall that both nearby and distant control group producers had to
have the same or very similar characteristics as the beneficiary producers. As a result,
propensity score matching was used to pair beneficiary producers and control group producers
with the same or very similar characteristics to reduce confounding biases in the impact
analysis. For the analysis of intermediate results, differences in means in the variables of
interest between beneficiary producers (i.e., treatment group) and control group producers are
presented. For estimating the Project’s impact, difference-in-differences analysis was used.
Finally, expansion factors were used to make the results representative of the population of
partnerships evaluated.
Intermediate results related to the PDO
A6.8 Increase in competitiveness. From the descriptive statistics based on the producer
household surveys, one finds that the majority of sales prices obtained by beneficiary producers
were at least around what was agreed with the commercial partners. As shown in Figure A6.1,
51% of project beneficiary producers agree that their product’s sales price turned out to be
higher than initially agreed with the commercial partner. 57% of them believe that this was
caused by market prices generally being higher than expected at the agreement. Of the 25%
who received a sales price lower than agreed with the commercial partners, 70% similarly
explain this by changes in the overall market price.

A6.9 When assessing other aspects that relate to competitiveness, the results show that—
compared to control group producers—beneficiary producers have considerably greater access
to sales contracts, collection centers, and transport services for their products. Similarly, more
producers benefiting from the Project have access to improved, certified inputs and obtained
credit for productive investments, and they also more of them reinvest part of their net revenues
in their agricultural production compared to the control group. These reinvestments in
productive assets can be expected to lead to further increases in sales in the future. Table A6.2
displays the differences in means between the treatment group (i.e., beneficiary producers) and

impact regression results. All but one differences between treatment and control producers are
statistically significant at the 1% or 5% significance level.

A6.10 When comparing the production area at the beginning of the Project and at its
completion, the impact evaluation finds a significantly larger increase in the land area for
cultivation between beneficiary producers and the control group. At project completion, project
beneficiaries cultivate an average of 5.4 hectares compared to 4 hectares for non-beneficiaries.
The data also reveal that about half of the beneficiary producers started to produce new crops
during project implementation: for instance, 73% of the sampled cocoa producers who
participated in partnerships started to grow new crops, which demonstrates flexibility and
search for alternatives.
A6.11 Building up entrepreneurship. The impact evaluation results also show that PAAP-
II has led to an increase in entrepreneurial skills among beneficiary producers compared to
producers who did not benefit from the Project. For example, a statistically significant larger
portion of beneficiary producers went from not managing to managing accounts and/or


                                                  56
registries due to the project. Furthermore, a significantly higher percentage of beneficiary
producers gained access to technical assistance than the control group, in both group and
individualized assistance. Another important finding is that access to market information
through cell phones or the internet is significantly higher for beneficiary producers at project
completion than for the control group producers. Table A6.3 displays those findings in terms
of differences in means and regression results.

A6.12 Sustainable production and partnerships. The first result to consider regarding
sustainability is the duration of productive partnerships established during project
implementation, as in many businesses new partnerships fail during the first year. In this regard,
it is noteworthy that 97.5% of the PAAP-II partnerships continue to be active at project
completion. 65% of the partnerships which were sampled for the impact evaluation and which
had completed the investments through the financial government incentive still had their initial
commercial partner. In terms of maintenance of the productive investments made by the
Project at the producer organization level, the survey results from 83 beneficiary partnerships
in the impact evaluation show that 82% of beneficiary producer organizations collect annual
fees from their members to finance their operations and to maintain its capital infrastructure.
Another factor which influences the sustainability of production is related to productive
reinvestments, and as described above, beneficiary producers are more prone to reinvest part
of their net revenues in productive activities than the control group. In line with this finding, a



                                                      57
significantly larger proportion of beneficiary producers obtained credit for productive
investments than producers in the control group (25.6% compared to 16.1%). Similarly, 18%
of beneficiary producers state to have savings for future investments or unforeseen expenses
compared to 7.8% of control group producers. This difference is significant at the 1%
significance level.
A6.13 The data also show significant improvements in beneficiaries’ savings and access to
credit, including financing from the revolving funds. Regarding the latter, a related interesting
finding is that the funds collected through the revolving funds are mainly used for (i) giving
out loans to non-beneficiary producers of the same producer organization (42%), financing
technical assistance (25.3%) and (iii) purchasing specialized machinery (20.3%). This result
demonstrates that the revolving funds are fulfilling their purpose, and these investments can
be expected to have a positive impact on the sustainability of production beyond the direct
project beneficiaries.

Beyond PDO results: Impacts on income and employment
A6.14 Income increases. The results of the impact evaluation show large positive and
statistically highly significant average income effects. As displayed in Table A6.4, the net
income of project beneficiaries increased on average by 29% compared to the control group,
at a significance level of 5%. Similarly, the increase in gross income is estimated to be 20%
higher on average than for the control group, at a 10% significance level. As propensity score
matching was used in the analysis to ensure a control group with the same or very similar
characteristics, this increase in income can be attributed to the project. Underlining this finding,
when asking about producers’ perception of their economic well-being, beneficiary producers
rate themselves on average at 3.1 out of 5 (i.e., highest well-being) compared to 2.9 for control
producers. This difference is statistically significant at the 1% significance level, and
equivalent to a 4% increase out of the highest score of 5. Although increases in beneficiary

incomes was not an explicit objective of the Project, the ultimate goal of such development
operations is poverty reduction, which evaluation results attributed to PAAP-II confirm.

A6.15 Employment generation. PAAP-II also led to the creation of new employment in the
beneficiary producer organizations. The data of the impact evaluation show that before the
Project appeared, a producer organization employed on average 1.7 persons at least half-time,
while this number had increased to an average of 2.8 persons at project completion. In other
words, average total employment growth within the producer beneficiary organizations during
the life of the Project was 65%. The three most common types of new jobs created are
administrative manager, accountant, and technical support. The impact evaluation not only
finds an increase in the number of jobs at the producer organization level, but also in the
number of day-labor employed and the wage paid for it. Figure A6.3 shows the increase in
day-labor used over time by product line analyzed in the impact evaluation. Furthermore, in
all product lines the wage of day-labor increased by 50% between 2008 and 2014.

control group to assess whether the Project generated positive externalities to non-beneficiaries.

A6.16 The analysis found significant spillover effects in income for non-beneficiary
producers living near well-performing project partnerships. Specifically, the average increase
in gross income of those producers was 24.4% higher than for producers in the distant control
group. This result shows that the impact of PAAP-II on Colombia’s rural sector was amplified
beyond direct project beneficiaries.

A7.1 To complement the focus of the impact evaluation on assessing project outcomes
(Annex 6) and the focus of the stakeholder workshops on qualitative results (Annex 8), the
several questions were added to the questionnaire used for the impact evaluation. The aim was
to gather information from different project beneficiaries (i.e., participating producers,
representatives of producer organizations, and commercial partners) regarding their motives to
participate in project-supported activities and enter into a productive partnership, to learn about
the advantages and disadvantages experienced from this participation, and their overall
satisfaction with their productive partner and project institutions, among other issues. The
results of this beneficiary survey are summarized below by type beneficiary. They are based
on structured interviews with 899 beneficiary producers, 80 representatives of producer
organizations, and 80 commercial partners participating in PAAP-II. The selection of the
interviewees was based on stratified random sampling (details on the sampling methodology
appear in the final evaluation report and are summarized in Annex 6).
A7.2 Producers. Producers’ motivations enter into a productive partnership with a
commercial partner were mostly related to securing sales and prices and the opportunity to
obtain technical assistance and training. Table A7.1 displays the distribution of yes/no
responses of beneficiary producers interviewed to different questions on motivations. These
expectations were largely achieved by the Project, as demonstrated by figure A7.1.

A7.3 The most common advantages that producers state to have obtained from participating
in PAAP-II are technical assistance and training, as well as secure sales and better prices. 74%
of producers believe that their business management skills have improved thanks for the
support of PAAP-II, and 58% of them believe this improvement to have been substantial.
A7.4 Other advantages mentioned by producers relate to their membership in a producer
organization (PO). For instance, 70% of producers state that belonging to their PO has allowed
them to improve their negotiating power. Of those, 43% believe this improvement has been
substantial. Similarly, 74% of producers believe that belonging to the PO has helped them in
increasing their production levels. 27% believe this increase to be significant, 62% to be
moderate, and 11% to be little.
A7.5 Regarding the difficulties of participating in the Project, the problems mentioned most
often were slow administrative processes and compliance with the eligibility criteria.

A7.6 Also, producers stated several disadvantages that they encountered from belonging to
productive partnership. The most common one that 64% of producers agreed to is the need to
comply with high product quality requirements asked for by the commercial partner. However,
overall 6% of producers rated the performance of their commercial partner as excellent, 39%
as good, 34% as regular, 14% as bad, and 7% did not express an opinion.

A7.7 Producer Organizations. For purposes of the survey, 82 representatives of producer
organizations (PO) were interviewed. 84% of POs rated the support received from PAAP-II as
adequate, mainly because the Project (i) encouraged agricultural activities in the region, (ii)
stimulated the formation of additional partnerships, and (iii) promoted the active participation
of the partnership partners. Specifically, satisfaction ratings of the partnership establishments
between the POs and the producers as well as the commercial partners were high. Similarly,
POs stated to be largely satisfied with the performance of the OGR and OGA during project
implementation, reflected by ratings of no less than 3.8 out of 5 (i.e., high satisfaction) on the
different activities of these institutions (see tables below).

A7.8 Producer organizations provided different types of support to the producers, led by
training activities and technical support, but also in form of credit (e.g., from the reserves of
the revolving funds). The figure below displays different support activities in order of
frequency.

A7.9 When POs were asked about different benefits that they perceive to have obtained as
well as key acquisitions made after joining the project, market expansion was most commonly
agreed to. However, decreases in costs and access to specialized machinery also were
commonly cited (see Table A7.6).

A7.10 Related to the above and similar to the producer responses, POs named secure sales
and prices as well as technical assistance and training to be key advantages derived from their
participation in PAAP-II. Moreover, prompt payment and better prices due to higher product
quality were stated as well (Figure A7.4). In terms of disadvantages, high product quality
requirements again was mentioned most commonly, and it was also pointed out that prices
agreed with the commercial partners at the establishment of the partnership sometimes turned
out to be lower than market prices at the time of harvest/sales. Also, 28% of POs criticized that
it was not possible for all member of the PO to join PAAP-II (Figure A7.5).

A7.11 Finally, regarding the relationship with their commercial partner, 65% of POs
confirmed that they maintained the partnership with the same commercial partner since the
beginning of the Project. Of the 35% who changed their commercial partner, the main reasons
in order of frequency were that (i) the price agreed in contract turned out to be less than the
market price at time of harvest, (ii) the PO had problems with transporting the product to the
commercial partners’ collection center, (iii) the commercial partner did not comply with the
contract agreement, and (iv) the PO had problems in meeting the product quantities and/or
quality standards required by the commercial partner. Those POs that terminated the
partnership rated the difficulty they had in finding a new commercial partner as 3 out of 5 (1
meaning very easy, 5 meaning very difficult).
A7.12 Commercial partners. The beneficiary survey interviewed 80 commercial partners.
About 50% of them were wholesale marketers, 38% food processors, and the rest largely
retailers and agents for municipal or local supermarkets. The majority (90%) stated that they
primarily serve the domestic market. The majority (40%) were small companies (50 or fewer
employees), 33% were large companies (more than 200 employees), and 27% were medium-
sized companies (between 51 and 200 employees). More than 90% of commercial partners
agreed to the statement that their motivation to enter a productive partnership with smallholder
producer organizations was driven by business reasons, but also by corporate social
responsibility. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of commercial partners confirmed that they were
contacted by the PO to establish a partnership, 15% said they were invited by an OGA, and in
14% of cases the commercial partners reached out to producer organizations. The table below
shows that small companies, many involved in food processing, established the largest number
of partnerships with producer organizations in PAAP-II.

A7.13 Similar to producers and POs, commercial partners expressed a high level of
satisfaction with different aspects of project implementation. Satisfaction rates also are high
with regard to product quantity and quality delivered to the commercial partners (see table
below). Specifically, 64% of commercial partners stated they received products transacted
under partnership agreements on time as agreed, 4% stated that products were delivered early,
14% stated that products were delivered late, and 18% stated that they had not set a specific
delivery time among the partners.

A7.14 The satisfaction of the commercial partners with the partnership was also reflected in
that fact that 48% confirmed to have provided (financial) support to their partner PO. The
figure below demonstrates that this support took mostly the form of technical assistance,
capacity-building, but also the provision of specialized machinery and financing.

A7.15 Also in line with producers and producer organizations, commercial partners agreed
that the main advantages of PAAP-II were related to stable sales and better prices due to higher
product quality. 81% of commercial partners agreed that the Project has contributed to the
regional development. Regarding sustainability, 60% of commercial partners confirmed that
the producer was sustained even after project support ended.

A8.1 In April and May 2015, the Project Coordination Unit organized a series of regional
workshop and one national workshop (the latter held in Bogota) to capture the main
stakeholders’ perceptions on the successes of the Project, to identify the challenges and
bottlenecks encountered during project implementation, and to express lessons learned and
resulting recommendations for improvements. As shown in Table A7, more than 300
representatives of project beneficiary producer organizations, commercial partners, OGA,
OGR, Departmental Secretariats of Agriculture, and other institutions related to the Project
participated in these stakeholder workshops. The selection of the participants was based on
their role and relationship with the Project. In the case of producer organizations, most
commonly the legal representative participated in the workshops. Of the commercial partners,
the person in charge of managing the relationship with the producer organizations or the
technical person for purchases/shopping was invited. From the Government agencies, officials
involved in the management committees of the partnerships participated. Other participants
(e.g., from academia) had generally a thorough knowledge of PAAP-II and a high degree of
involvement in the development of partnerships (e.g. CIAT which conducted an assessment on
the impact of the productive partnerships on disadvantaged groups).

A8.2 The different workshop participants were divided in four stakeholder groups to
understand their different opinions regarding standardized guiding questions:
(1) beneficiary smallholder producers and producer organizations, (2) commercial partners,
private sector companies, and associations, (3) Government agencies, and (4) non-
governmental organizations, international development agencies, and academia. The
workshops were conducted with support from the German Agency for International
Cooperation (GIZ) using Metaplan, a standardized methodology developed by GIZ to
effectively guide workshop discussions (described in Guía de Sistematización, GIZ, 2006).



                                                        69
A.8.3 The results of each meeting were summarized in a workshop document and the
synthesis of all nine workshop discussions is described in the publication “Alianzas
productivas. Sistematización de una experiencia exitosa” (Colombian Ministry of Agriculture
and Rural Development, 2015). The following summarizes the main opinions collected from
the various stakeholders during these workshops on project benefits and successes, challenges
and bottlenecks in its implementation, as well as lessons learned and resulting
recommendations. Several of these qualitatively collected responses are in line with the
findings of the beneficiary survey (Annex 7) and the impact evaluation (Annex 6).
Benefits and successes of the project (by stakeholder group)
 (i)    Smallholder producers and producer organizations
   •    The Project is demand-driven and promotes the adoption and the importance of the
        relationship between producer and the commercial partner as the main mechanism for
        the development of a successful business
   •    The Project strengthens the financial stability of the producer organization through the
        establishment of the revolving fund
   •    The Project fortifies the social cohesion within the producer organization and to help it
        pursue its purpose as defined by its members
 (ii)   Commercial partners, private sect companies, and associations
   •    The Project ensures the adoption of good agricultural practices to improve product
        quality, which will eventually be a unique characteristic demanded by the market
   •    The Project opens access to new markets and stimulates the involvement of smallholder
        producers (and marginalized populations) in value chains, during a time of increased
        interest by consumers in inclusive business and corporate social responsibility
   •    The Project generates capacities within the company, in terms of strengthening its
        relationship with smallholder producer organizations
 (iii) Government agencies
   •    The Project combines training and capacity-building with hands-on practice, allowing
        to assist organized rural communities in a holistic manner
   •    The Project serves the interests of both commercial companies and rural communities
   •    The Project is participatory in decision-making processes, and its permanent
        monitoring systems allows it to present results reports to the supervisory agencies
 (iv)   NGOs, international development agencies, and academia.
   •    The Project contributes to our social objective to empower small producers and to
        develop sustainable production skills among the rural population
   •    The Project develops agricultural instruments with small producers, bringing them
        closer to formal markets in a sustainable manner and away from welfare projects
   •    The Project determines the organization and community participation, improving the
        standard of living and income of the project beneficiaries

Challenges and bottlenecks of project implementation (by topic)
 (i)    Administrative issues
   •    Delays caused by late disbursements from entities such as municipalities or SENA,
        which could be resolved by permanent alerts from the OGR or MADR
   •    Communication problems with the trust company due to lack of infrastructure in the
        regions (e.g. the practice of managing physical documents instead of digital)
   •    Insufficient training on the procedures for contracts and payments
 (ii)   Subproject proposal formulation
   •    Inconsistency in the investment plans with regard to the logic of the resource
        implementation
   •    Misunderstandings between those who make the pre-investment studies and those who
        subsequently execute the partnership
   •    Insufficient consultations on the subproject planning with the main actors
 (iii) Preparation of subproject implementation
   •    The time between the submission of the subproject proposal, the formulation of the
        pre-investment studies, and the implementation of the subproject may take up to 1.5
        years, which leads to the discouragement of the producers and even to the withdrawal
        of some of the partners, and/or changes in productive conditions initially proposed
   •    The provision of the government financial incentive grant is slow
   •    The schedule for producers to attend the trainings provided should be more flexible
 (iv)   Relationship among stakeholders
   •    Coordination problems among the different stakeholders
   •    Partnership committees tend to procrastinate necessary decisions
   •    Lack of planning and continuity of processes during times of changes in regional
        governments
 (v)    Social ties
   •    Unsatisfactory ethical soundness among partners to avoid conflicts of interest
   •    Skepticism of producers regarding the proposed partnership scheme
   •    Communication with accompanying organizations lacks proper channels that allow to
        know the status of the subproject
 (vi)   Territorial vulnerability
   •    Insufficient state programs that support the formulation of agricultural projects
   •    Institutional weakness to effectively support agricultural producers
   •    Lack of precise and reliable data based on statistics for informed decision-making



                                              71
 (vii) General risks identified by stakeholders
   •    Lack of precision in defining the responsibilities of the OGA
   •    Problems related to the repayment to the revolving funds by the producers
   •    Little support provided after the first year of investment
Lessons learned and recommendations (by topic)
 (i)    Administrative issues
   •    Reduce bureaucracy in the trust administration
   •    Shorten the process time between subproject selection and their approval
   •    Ensure the timely delivery of funds by the co-financiers
 (ii)   Capacity building
   •    Put even greater emphasis on training processes
   •    More strongly promote the importance of good agricultural practices, as their
        continuous application ensures land not to degrade in the short-term
   •    Modify the proposal selection process, so that not only traditional supply chains
        projects are considered but also allow for agricultural innovation projects
 (iii) Relationship among stakeholders
   •    Reach out and consult more with the private sector, so that the productive projects reach
        economies of scale and do not suffer from a lack of commercial partners
   •    Improve communications on the project’s progress to farmer organizations and other
        interested actors
   •    Invite academia to be more integrated into the Project through training, research and
        development
 (iv)   Access to resources
   •    All producers related to the Project should adopt changes in their practices and new
        technology to reach progress and development in the agricultural sector
   •    Budgetary ceilings per municipality should be applied and more resources should be
        allocated to the poorest regions and municipalities
   •    Continue to strengthen the partnerships even after the execution of the project resources
        are completed

                          Annex 10. Summary of Borrower's ICR


A10.1 The Second Rural Productive Partnerships Project (PAAP II) was a follow-up project
to the World Bank-financed Productive Partnerships Support Project, whose lessons learned
and results were incorporated into the design and operations manual of PAAP-II.
A10.2 During implementation, PAAP-II was affected by various changes in the government’s
budget allocations. Budget cuts were experienced in 2008, 2009 and 2010, which led to initial
delays in project implementation. The slow start-up of the Project in terms of partnership
projects was overcome by the larger-than-planned budget allocations beginning in 2011.
A10.3 Given the large scale of the Project and the need to ensure a full and thorough
monitoring of the partnerships in operation until the end of the subproject support, it was
necessary to request two extensions to the loan. The first request was to extend the Project end
date until December 2014 and included the allocation of US$2 million of unallocated loan
funds. The second request was to extend the project end date until June 2015 for the purpose
of preparing a transition plan that would allow the PCU to hand over project operations to the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR) in an orderly manners
A10.4 The activities of PAAP-II aimed to address two key issues of Colombia’s rural
development agenda: the persistent poverty and low competitiveness in rural areas. This
objective was achieved, as the Project supported an increase in rural competitiveness and
entrepreneurship through 725 partnerships that provided support to producer organizations for
their agribusiness activities and ensured demand for their products from the formal private
sector.
A10.5 At appraisal the Project was expected to benefit 25,500 smallholder producers and their
families in the agricultural sector. This goal was exceeded, as PAAP-II benefited 42,552
farmers who participated in partnerships in operation.
A10.6 The Project was successful in reaching disadvantaged groups, which participated in a
large percentage of partnerships (22% of partnerships). The Project thus served as a means for
advancing the social inclusion of indigenous, Afro-Colombian and displaced peoples, while
also proving to be a good platform for addressing needs in post-conflict areas.
A10.8 The project results demonstrate that smallholder farmer are able collectively to
intervene in the market, fulfill commercial agreements, develop negotiating capacity, and take
advantage of being organized to competitively and sustainably integrate into value chains.
A10.9 PAAP-II generated real savings in the beneficiary project organizations, which at the
end of project implementation were operating 399 revolving funds. This demonstrates that the
revolving fund mechanism works and is a potential tool for linking smallholder producers to
the conventional banking system.
A10.10 PAAP-II involved the commercial partners from very early in the subproject cycle,
including them in the development of partnership proposals as well as in the structuring and
execution of the pre-investment feasibility studies. These measures significantly improved
business indices from the beginning of the production phase. In addition, the design and
integration of specific logistics and marketing tools was an important development from the



                                              75
first phase project. At the end of the project, 80% of partnerships have a large or medium-sized
company as commercial partner. Meanwhile, 20 large companies are participating in 38% of
partnerships in operation.
A10.11 The Project strengthened capacity among organizations representing the stakeholders
involved in the supported partnerships (e.g., smallholder producers, consultants for the pre-
investment studies, technical assistants, business management apprentices, and teachers) by
implementing strategies that allowed them to overcome technical and organizational
weaknesses in different areas. The capacity-building strategy promoted by the Project was
based on a clear vision of agribusiness and helped bring about a paradigm shift for small-scale
agricultural production.
A10.12 The Project succeeded in building partnerships at the local, regional and national levels,
involving both public and private stakeholders. It allowed for the joining of efforts and
resources to support the rural population through a feasible and profitable business model,
which would also lead to the compliance with expected project indicators and results. In other
words, PAAP-II established an excellent platform for institutional coordination, which has had
a particularly positive effect in vulnerable areas.
A10.13 The Project managed to leverage resources from other sources: including the
contributions made by the beneficiary producer groups themselves, 4.6 Colombian pesos were
leveraged for every 1 Colombian peso invested through the government incentive grant. The
project resources (including leveraged funds) were administered in an efficient manner:
project administration and management costs represented only 4.98% of total investments.
A10.14 The Project made important conceptual and operational contributions to the MADR
by conceptualizing and operationalizing a "pathway to competitiveness" for smallholder
producers, which can be used in support of the government’s policy of linking organizations
representing smallholder producer s with the formal financial system.
A10.15 During the second phase of the project, the PCU improved many operational policies
and procedures. It introduced effective new procedures for establishing partnerships,
streamlined processes for evaluating partnership proposals and pre-investment studies,
tightened up project implementation and management activities, and strengthened monitoring
and evaluation practices. With the help of these changes, PAAP-II was able to develop
powerful instruments and build up an institutional infrastructure of great credibility recognized
and valued at the regional and national level.
A10.16 PAAP-II developed a monitoring and evaluation online system, which allowed for the
active participation of all stakeholders involved in the implementation of the partnerships. The
system also served as a dissemination tool and platform with permanently available training
materials and tutorials.
A10.17 The management of financial resources through a trust company and the use of one-
time disbursements to trusts managed by the partnerships themselves (patrimonios autonomos)
helped to streamline project activities and eliminated restrictions to project execution within
the same fiscal year. This was an important factor in allowing the Project to achieve its targets.
A10.18 The Project was active in 86 sub-sectors, covering not only agriculture but also
livestock, forestry, and aquaculture. As the Project was based on open competitive calls for



                                               76
partnership proposals, it responded to demand in different areas of the country, where the local
actors defined the product lines.
A10.19 Given the successful results of the project implementation, an approved transition plan
was elaborated with objective of continuing and extending the productive partnerships
approach. The transition plan gave an outline of potential future operations under Colombian
legislation and within the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. At the time of this
report, however, this plan has not been fully implemented.
