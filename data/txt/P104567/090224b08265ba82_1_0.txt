                         Implementation Status Overview
                         An implementation support mission was carried out from May 5-13, 2014.

                         Project implementation continues to progress in a satisfactory way. As of June 30, 2014, 624 sub-projects were under implementation, more than twice as many as the end-of-project
                         target of 300 sub-projects.* In addition, the number of beneficiaries was already 1.5 times greater than the end-of-project target (37,304 beneficiaries, compared to the projected
                         25,500 beneficiaries).

                         The 2014 call for for sub-project proposals has been the most successful to date in terms of the number of submitted proposals: 1,047 proposals were received and are currently
                         under review. These figures reflect the continuing strong efforts of the project implementation unit and of the regional and local implementation agencies to reach out effectively to
                         eligible producer organizations and business partners in 31 of Colombia's 32 departments. The strong response to the 2014 call for proposals also shows that the 2013 re-

                         organization of the Ministry of Agriculture did not adversely affect the sub-project solicitation, evaluation and approval process.

                         Data collected by the Project M&E team demonstrate that the sub-project approval process has been very inclusive, in the sense that it has been successful in mobilizing the
                         participation of indigenous and Afro-Colombian producers; as of May 2014, the end-of-project target for these marginalized groups had been exceeded more than six fold
                         (beneficiaries included 8,666 indigenous and Afro-Colombian producers, compared to the target of 1,275 indigenous and Afro-Colombian producers). Similarly, the project has been
                         extremely successful in reaching women producers; the number of female heads households that have benefited from the Project is more than three times the end-of-project target
                         (7,819 female heads of household, as compared to the target of 2,550 female heads of household).

                         With the Project scheduled to close on December 31, 2014, the procurement of the external impact evaluation was launched in May 2014. Proposals have been received and are
                         currently being reviewed.

                         The next implementation support mission is tentatively planned for October 2014.
