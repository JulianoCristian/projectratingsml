                         The implementation of the Project is progressing in a satisfactory way and, during 2012, the Project met the final 300 sub-project target. There are at the moment 421 sub-projects
                         under implementation. This result is the direct effect of the valuable work of the Project Implementation Unit and the strong support of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
                         Resources (MADR).

                         For 2013, the Project has been given a budget of 70.000 million CO$ that will further strengthen the presence of the Project across the whole country, since the Ministry of Agriculture

                         decided to expand the scope of this intervention to the totality of the departments of the country (32). This initiative is coupled with the extension of the closing date of the Project,
                         which will now continue to operate under World Bank procedures until December 2014. After that date, the Ministry of Agriculture will continue the Project with national resources
                         only.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         With the collaboration of CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical), the World Bank team started to elaborate a framework for the evaluation of the Project, in order to
                         assess its effectiveness, efficiency and impact. The model, once defined in details, could be adapted to similar interventions in Latin America and the Caribbean.
