   were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the productive partnerships approach can be a cost-effective\n            way to boost productivity, expand production, improve\n            competitiveness, and link farmers to markets. Selection of\n            sub-projects through an open, competitive process based on\n            clearly defined technical evaluation criteria can be crucial\n            for establishing credibility among stakeholders and avoiding\n            political interference. Accompanying producer groups over an\n            extended period while they grow and mature is crucial for\n            ensuring long-term success. Transition planning for World\n            Bank-financed projects should begin early and not left to\n            the final months of implementation. Successful projects that\n            are not effective in communicating their achievements to key\n            audiences may have difficulty securing funding going\n            forward. Consultative Group for International Agricultural\n            Research (CGIAR) centers are a source of information,\n            knowledge, and capacity that can be tapped to support\n            project design and implementation activities."}, "docdt": "2015-12-14T00:52:01Z"}
