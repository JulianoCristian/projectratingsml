                         Implementation Status Overview
                         An implementation support mission was held from December 2 to 6, 2013.

                         The implementation of the Project is continuing to progress in a very satisfactory way. There are at the moment 498 sub-projects under implementation, which is more then 60% over
                         the project goal. This result is the direct effect of the valuable work of the Project Implementation Unit, the strong support of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources
                         (MADR), and the well functioning system of regional and local implementation agencies.

                         At the moment of the supervision mission the project had established in 31 of 32 departments, with the last department coming on line by February of 2014. Over 41,000 farm families
                         have benefited directly from the project (receiving the producer incentive) with at least 8,000 more farmers having benefited indirectly (improving their market acess, receiving
                         technical assistance, being part of an association, but not receiving the producer incentive). The number of direct beneficiaries is 60% above the target number.

                         The sales indicator is staying below the targeted value. It is now around CO$ 288 billion, whereas the target value is Co$350 billion. The project team is exploring if the low
                         performance on this indicator is based on a excessively optimistic target values or other factors.

                         For 2014, the Project has been given a budget of 70.000 million CO$ ($39m), almost completely from Government funds. The Government continues with its intent to continue and
                         expand the project, with its own budget after closure of the Loan.

                         The next implementation support mission is planned for June 2014.
