                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      In two letters dated October 5, 2012 the Ministry of Economy and Public Credit
of the Republic of Colombia requested the World Bank to proceed with the restructuring
of Loan 7484 – CO. This restructuring of the IBRD Loan would provide for (i) a first 15-
month extension of the Closing Date from September 30, 2013 to December 31, 2014;
and (ii) a reallocation of Loan proceeds. The proposed extension of the Closing Date
would allow the Project to supervise and support the sub-projects approved during 2012
until the end of their implementation. The reallocation of Loan Proceeds would allocate
the funds that prudentially were not allocated at the beginning of the Project.


B. PROJECT STATUS

The ratings for the achievement of the PDO and the Overall Implementation Progress are
both Satisfactory.

In 2011, 127 new productive partnerships were initiated, a substantial increase from the
average of 55 productive partnerships per year approved during the period 2008-2010. In
2012 the number of productive partnerships financed with contract signed has reached
175. By mid 2012, there were 243 partnerships at different stages of implementation. The
goal of 300 partnerships financed by this Project was achieved by the end of 2012. Most
of the other targets set for this Projects seem at the moment achievable and many of them
have already been surpassed.

The GoC has shown strong commitment to the Project, increasing its contribution to the
Project’s budget from 34 billion Colombian Pesos (COP-US$18.5 million) in 2011 to
COP 50 billion (US$27.2 million) in 2012, making the Project the second most financed
by the Rural Development Directorate of the MADR. In 2012, the IBRD Loan was
financing only the project staff and consultants as there are not enough funds left for the
loan to finance new productive partnerships.

The Project disbursement rate was 97% at end of 2012.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES


This Restructuring Paper is proposing two changes: (i) a first 15-month extension of the
Closing Date from September 30, 2013 to December 31, 2014; and (ii) a reallocation of
Loan proceeds.


      Extension of Closing Date

                                            4
All the partnerships were selected by the end of 2012 and are at the moment financed by
national contributions. However, as discussed in the PAD and confirmed in the four years
of project implementation, it takes on average two years to implement a partnership
subproject, between the different processes involved: the producers association needs to
be established; the contract with the purchaser needs to be negotiated, the investment
plans for the association's members must be drafted, a bank account must be opened, and
technical assistance must be provided during at least one production cycle or one year.
Because of this, the implementation period of the partnerships approved will go beyond
the closing date of the project, September 2013. An extension of the Closing Date is
therefore necessary in order to allow a full and careful supervision of all the partnerships
approved and to provide them with the Project support until the end of their
implementation period.

       Reallocation of Loan proceeds

Considering the significant progress demonstrated by the Project and its high
disbursement levels, it is necessary at this point to allocate the USD 2,000,000 that, as a
prudential measure, were not originally allocated. This reallocation of Loan proceeds
evenly divides the unallocated funds between Consultants’ Services and Cost-Sharing
Transfers. The funds assigned to Consultant’s services will help to cover the additional
supervision of MADR until the new Closing date. Details of the reallocation are
provided in the table below:
