This restructuring will provide\n            for: (i) a first 15- months extension of the closing date\n            from September 30, 2013 to December 31, 2014; and (ii) a\n            reallocation of loan proceeds. This extension of the closing\n            date will allow the project to supervise and support the\n            sub-projects approved during 2012 until the end of their\n            implementation. The reallocation of loan proceeds will\n            allocate the funds that prudentially were not allocated at\n            the beginning of the project."}, "docdt": "2013-01-08T00:00:00Z"}
