Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 An implementation support mission was carried out from February 17 to 27, 2015. Submission of this ISR has been delayed to allow a more complete
 accounting of the implementation status of the transition plan and the arrangements put in place to ensure the continuity of the Productive Partnerships
 Program

 Project implementation has progressed in a satisfactory way. As of December 31, 2014, 727 sub-projects were under implementation, more than twice
 as many as the end-of-project target of 300 sub-projects. Similarly, the number of beneficiaries was more than 1.5 times greater than the end-of-project
 target (42,813 beneficiaries compared to the projected 25,500). Five of the seven Project Development Objective indicators had surpassed their
 respective end-of-project target, while two indicators had reached their targets by 96% and 69%. As highlighted in earlier ISRs, the Project has been
 very successful in mobilizing the participation of indigenous and Afro-Colombian producers, as well as of female-headed producer households
 (exceeding the end-of-project targets for these groups more than six-fold and more than three-fold, respectively).
 More complete results of the Project performance and outcomes will become available in the coming months. A draft of the Government's Impact
 Evaluation has been delivered, and the World Bank task team has started to prepare the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) with support from
 FAO.
 During the past months, World Bank task team, with support from the Country Management Unit, has worked with the Government to put in place all
 necessary arrangements to ensure the continuity of the Productive Partnerships Program. MADR continues to implement the transition plan agreed with
 the World Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and the National Planning Department. In June 2015, MADR extended the contracts of key staff of the Project
 Implementation Unit and allocated budget resources to allow the Program to continue implementing following the closing of the Project on June 30,
 2015.
 While only time will tell what will be the long-term legacy of the Project, some achievements are already becoming evident. The Project has contributed
 to the institutionalization of the productive alliances approach by contributing to the establishment within MADR of policies, procedures, and human
 resources needed to support, manage, and monitor the hundreds of partnerships that remain in operation nationwide (partnerships exist in 31 of the
 country’s 32 Departments). In addition, the Project has contributed to building decentralized capacity at the regional and local level, both in the public
 sector and in the private sector. Public officials throughout the country are today familiar with the identification, validation, preparation, and
 implementation of productive alliances-type operations, and they can count on the services of large numbers of organizations experienced in the
 provision of financial intermediary services (Organizaciones de Gestión Regional - OGRs), as well as large numbers of private and civil society
 organizations with experience providing technical assistance services (Organizaciones de Gestión Acompañante - OGAs).
 Prospects for the future look promising. For the last two years, the National Planning Department (DNP) has been engaged in the preparation of the
 Misión para la Transformación del Campo (“Misión Rural”), which lays out the Government’s vision for rural development in the country. A centerpiece
 of the agricultural development strategy contained in the Misión Rural is a proposed initiative to promote Alianzas Inclusivas (“Inclusive Alliances”),
 which are modeled on the productive alliances support under PAAP. The goals of this initiative are ambitious; the Misión Rural document envisions
 expanding from the 49,000 families supported under PAAP as of 2014 to 230,000 families by 2025 and 570,000 families by 2035. While fiscal realities
 might constrain these plans and lead to a more modest rate of expansion, at this point the Government’s commitment to continue using the productive
 alliances model seems assured.
