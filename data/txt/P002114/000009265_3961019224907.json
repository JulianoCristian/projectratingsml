Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) condition for loan\n            effectiveness should not lead to a situation in which the\n            beneficiaries would sign a time-based, rather than an\n            activity-based contract; (ii) beneficiary institutions\n            should be more actively involved in project appraisal; (iii)\n            counterpart funds should be vigorously pursued through the\n            Ministry of Finance and also, allocated funds should be\n            transferred directly to the project account ;(iv) project\n            funding of major components should be fully reimbursed by\n            the World Bank and this will prevent non completion of vital\n            project components due to inadequate counterpart fund; and\n            (V) communication between all parties involved in project\n            implementation should be encouraged on a day to day basis."}, "docdt": "1996-08-08T00:00:00Z"}
