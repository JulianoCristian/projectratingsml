coordinating\n            technical education. To achieve the first objective, the\n            project will assist four Federal polytechnics and the\n            Federal Technical College, Yaba, by strengthening the\n            academic and practical training of the staff, providing\n            technical assistance to commission and develop workshop and\n            laboratory facilities and to fill specific gaps in the\n            teaching staff. To strengthen institutional capability for\n            planning and coordinating technical and vocational education\n            and training, the project will assist the National Board for\n            Technical Education (NBTE), the Federal Ministry of\n            Education and the Project Office in upgrading their\n            capability for curriculum development, statistical analysis,\n            monitoring educational standards and equipment procurement."}, "docdt": "1987-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
