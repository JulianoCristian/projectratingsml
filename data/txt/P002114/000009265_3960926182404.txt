MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR A TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Federal Republic of Nigeria for US$23.3 million equivalent is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would be payable over 20 years, including 5
*        years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate and would assist in
improving the quality and efficiency of selected Federal polytechnics, and
the Federal Technical College (FTC), Yaba. The project would be cofinanced
by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) (UK) for US$ 1.2 million
equivalent.
2.        Background.  During the past decade Nigeria has made major strides
in developing its social and economic infrastructure, assisted by immense oil
revenues. The sharp drop in oil prices in recent years, however, has clearly
illustrated Nigeria's economic vulnerability. Directly related to the
recognized need to diversify the country's economic structure and increase
productivity is the critical problem of developing human resources. With
large Federal subsidies, Nigeria embarked upon a program of universal primary
education in 1976. Irrespective of the program's quality, the expansion of
primary education has been impressive, particularly in the northern states
where enrollment rates have nearly doubled. Similarly, the Government has
invested heavily in university-level education: the number of universities
has increased from 12 a decade ago to 24 at present. Responsibility for
pre-service training of technical manpower for industry and commerce is
generally shared as follows: skilled workers and craftsmen are trained in
technical secondary schools, technicians in polytechnics/colleges of tech-
nology, while engineers/higher level managers (business, administration,
etc.) are tra'ned in universities. The Federal Government operates 10 poly-
technics and i technical secondary school (FTC), while the various states
operate an additional 17 polytechnics and about 120 technical secondary
schools. While total enrollment in these institutions is abc t 116,000, poor
quality and low efficiency result in a combined annual output of only about
15,000 craftsmen and 5,000 technicians (excluding output from business/
management programs). Nigeria's technical education institutions face three
main obstacles: (a) budget austerity at Federal and state levels which has
resulted in severe cutbacks in non-wage instructional expenditures, thus
*        sharply reducing practical skills training; (b) weak institutional management
and organization; and (c) shortages of trained and experienced teaching
staff. They also operate under capacity with high overhead and adminis-
tration costs.
3.        The education and training of middle-level technical manpower is
critical to Nigeria's program of structural adjustment away from heavy
dependence on oil and towards a diversified industrial and service economy,
supported by an agricultural sector which would again become a net exporter
of food products. The highest demand in the labor market is presently at the
middle and lower levels, which are precisely the levels addressed by this
project. A recent survey of unemployment since the oil slump showed that



- 2 -
while unemployment for unskilled secondary school leavers was over 40%, it
was only 8.7% for university and polytechnic graduates. This latter figure,
however, overestimates unemployment among polytechnic graduates because it
includes graduates of social science and humanities (about 50% of polytechnic
enrollment is in business/management) who usually find it more difficult to
obtain jobs. The introduction of a second-tier foreign exchange market,
combined with the Government's recent trade liberalization policies are
expected to create an improved climate for employment generation.
4.        The main thrust of the Government's strategy in technical education
in the short and medium term is to rehabilitate and strengthen existing
institutions, although in the long term the establishment of new technical
institutions in response to anticipated shortages of skilled manpower is not
ruled out. Also, the Government plans to gradually complete, on a selective
basis, essential instructional facilities that were abandoned at various
stages of completion as a result of declining oil revenues. Additionally,
the Government plans to strengthen the National Board for Technical Education
(NBTE), which was established in 1977 for planning technical and vocational
education in the country, and the Industrial Training Fund, a parastatal also
established in 1977 to finance apprenticeship and on-the-job training schemes
with the help of a 1% payroll tax collected from private industry. These
features of the Government's strategy are sound, as their main focus is on
strengthening existing institutions. On the financing side, as in other
post-secondary institutions, the Government has introduced cost sharing.
Overall, students in polytechnics are responsible for approximately 30% of
recurrent costs (including feeding costs), which is probably the highest
contribution in Sub-Saharan Africa. Still, the policies for cost sharing and
cost recovery need to be further expanded to include, in particular, portions
of the cost of instructional materials end the full cost of housing. In
addition, there is need to: (a) consolidate inefficient programs among and
within institutions; and (b) develop centers of excellence to avoid dupli-
cation of costly programs.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has not been active in
the education sector in Nigeria for over a decade. To prepare for a more
active role, it is currently undertaking studies of primary education and of
the costs and financing of universities. Its strategy, and the thrust of its
sector and project work, is to assist the Government in addressing key
sectoral issues of reinforcing educational quality, promoting internal effi-
ciency, and improving financial management to achieve greater access to
schooling; and in relating training to labor market requirements. The
project is intended as an introductory operation involving a quick injection
of essential inputs with substantial impact and high returns. It would also
serve to re-establish relations, initiate a policy dialogue and prepare the
groundwork for possible broader-based policy-oriented operations.
6.        Project Objectives.   The project aims to:  (a) upgrade the
quality, efficiency and throughput of selected Federal technical training
institutions; and (b) strengthen institutional capability for planning and
coordinating technical education.
7.        Project Description.  The project is deliberately simple in design
and limited in scope taking into account the lack of experience in imple-
menting education projects and the complex Federal-state relationship in the



- 3 -
management and financing of education. It includes: (1) Improving quality and
efficiency of the instructional program in four Federal polytechnics and the
Federal Technical College (FTC), Yaba, by providing essential instructional
inputs including teaching materials, library books, spare parts and equip-
ment, and consumable materials fcr laboratories and workshops. Only Federal
polytechnics were included to simplify project implementation and management.
The four polytechnics were selected on the basis of various criteria
including geographical spread and the Government's plan to designate these
relatively more developed institutions as "centers of excellence" and
principal catchment institutions for their respective zones. The project
would also: (a) strengthen management of the institut'ons; (b) reinforce
staff development; (c) upgrade and regularize industrial attachment as an
integral part of the training program; td) establish equipment and facilities
maintenance units; and (e) initiate in two of the four polytechnics programs
for training technical teachers and Advanced Crafts Programs in three of the
polytechnics, using the staff and facilities of the institutions.
(2) Strengthening institutional capability for planning and coordinating
technicel education. The project would assist NBTE, the Technical,
Vocational and Science Education Division (TVSED) of the Federal Ministry of
Education and the Project Office, which are key Federal institutions with
nationwide responsibilities in technical/vocational education. The project
would finance technical assistance, training and equipment for these bodies
to strengthen their capability for curriculum development, statistical
analysis, monitoring educational standards, equipment procurement and initial
operating costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$27.9
million iquivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$24.5 million
equivalent. The ODA has agreed to finance, on a grant basis, portions of the
technical assistance and fellowship component estimated at US$1.2 million
equivalent. The proposed Bank loan of US$23.3 million equivalent would
finance the x.maining foreign exchange costs. The Government would
contribute the local costs, of about $3.4 million equivalent. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Nigeria are given in Schedules C and D respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6907-UNI dated
November 11, 1987, is being distributed separately.
8.        ARreed Actions. The Government has agreed on the following actions:
(a) increasing budgetary allocations for instructional materials for Federal
polytechnics and the FTC from about 2X of the recurrent budget at present to
at least 52 of the recurrent budget by 1989, and to at least 10% of the
recurrent budget by 1992 in current prices; (b) presenting the allocation for
instructional materials for the Federal polytechnics and the FTC as a
separate and identifiable item in the budget; (c) undertaking annual reviews
of the allocations to ascertain the budgetary targets indicated in (a) above
have been achieved and to furnish the Bank with the results of such review;
td) preparation for Bank review by June 30, 1990 of a plan for the introduc-
tion of Technical Teacher Training and, on an interim basis, Advanced Crafts
Programs in the remaining Federal polytechnics; (e) preparation of an outline
of a three-year work program (1989-1991) for NBTE for Bank review within 6
months after project effectiveness; (f) preparation by NBTE of a compre-
hensive study and an action plan for a phaFed implementation of the principal
recommendations on issues in technical/vocational education, including the



- 4 -
cost and financing of the sub-sector, for Bank review by June 30, 1990;
(g) the appointment of an agency to implement the technical assistance and
fellowship components of the project, as a condition of effectiveness;
(h) opening of a project account with an initial deposit of N 3 million as a
condition of effectiveness, and semi-annual replenishment with projected
counterpart contribution; and (i) introduction of the following efficiency
measures in the project polytechnics by end 1992 at the latest, and in other
Federal polytechnics to the extent possible: increasing staff teaching hours
to about 18 hours per week, increasing class size to 16 students in workshops
and 32 students in lecture, and decreasing students' contact hours to 18
hours in workshops and 10 hours in lectures.
9.        Justification.  An improvement in the quality of technical training
would result in improving the efficiency and productivity of the industrial/
technical labor force in the long term, and would complement the Bank's
investment in other sectors where implementation is constrained by a shortage
of skilled manpower. In the short term, by putting the substantial sunk
costs of Government (unfinished buildings, underutilized equipment, and
instructors) to more efficient use, the project would yield considerable
benefits by increasing throughput and improving instructional quality in
technical/industrial fields while reducing unit costs by about llX through
efficiency measures. Further, as this is the only on-going lending operation
in education, it would serve as an important vehicle for the Bank and the
Government to pursue sustained dialogue on various sectoral policies,
including those directed toward reduction of unit costs, consolidation of
inefficient instructional programs, provision of adequate support for
non-wage recurrent costs, and cost recovery.
10.       Risks.  The principal risk involves FME's lack of experience in
implementing Bank-financed education projects. This was a persisteat problem
in the implementation of the three previous education projects. In light of
experience, the status of the ProJect Office and of the project manager have
been elevated so that the latter would now have full authority to take
decisions on most project implementation questions. In addition, he would
have better access (because of his new rank) to the highest levels of
authority at the Federal Ministry of Education on matters of educational
policy.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
