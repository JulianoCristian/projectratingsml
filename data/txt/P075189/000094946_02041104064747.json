  capacity and produce systemic information to help government\n            promote effective education reform. There are four project\n            components. The first component provides school improvement\n            grants to 650 basic schools and 50 general secondary schools\n            to support training, technical assistance, and outreach and\n            evaluation costs. The second component sets internationally\n            recognized standards, establishes a modern and\n            internationally recognized system for assessment and\n            examinations, and establishes and develops a sustainable\n            Education and Assessment Service for Serbia (ESAS).\n            Specifically, the component finances training and study\n            visits for key specialist and administrative/logistical ESAS\n            staff; equipment, software, materials, and books; develops\n            and field-tests standards-linked external assessment\n            instruments; and covers national costs, technical\n            assistance, and recurrent costs. The third component\n            promotes effective management of educational resources and\n            monitoring of performance by improving the educational\n            information and financing systems. The fourth component\n            funds educational decentralization; it strengthens\n            governance and management capacity in primary and secondary schools."}, "docdt": "2002-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
