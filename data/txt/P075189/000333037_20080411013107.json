Project for Republic of Serbia were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: building institutional capacity in\n            using student assessment data and education information\n            systems takes time, especially if limited data are available\n            at the outset and information systems have to be built from\n            scratch. In five years, a country can reasonably be expected\n            to start collecting such data but getting education planners\n            at all levels to start using the data usually takes longer.\n            Future projects should set more realistic objective (e.g. if\n            starting from a low base have as an objective to collect\n            data but not built capacity) within a given timeframe.\n            Moreover, rather than wait for perfect Education Management\n            Information System (EMIS) to emerge, countries need to work\n            with existing data systems and gradually improve them.\n            Objectives involving decentralizing financing and management\n            of schools require strong and broad government ownership."}, "docdt": "2008-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
