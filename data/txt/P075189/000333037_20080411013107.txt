F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's development objectives (PDO) as described in the credit agreement
(schedule 2) is to: "assist the Republic of Serbia to further define and begin to implement




                                             ii

a process of education reform through strengthening institutional capacity, improving
information collection, and decentralizing education responsibilities and financing."

  There is an important discrepancy between these PDOs listed in the Development
Credit Agreement (DCA) and those described in the project appraisal document (PAD).
In particular, the PDOs in the PAD appear more ambitious compared to those listed in the
DCA. In particular, the PAD is more ambitious by including improving teaching and
learning as a PDO. At the same time, the PAD is more vague in terms of committing to
decentralizing education responsibilities and financing; it emphasizes "empowering local
communities to take responsibility for their schools" as opposed to a formal process of
decentralization. In the PAD, the PDOs were: (i) building capacity and producing
systematic information to help government promote effective education reform; and (ii)
improving teaching and learning in schools and empowering local communities to take
responsibility for their schools.

  Formally, this ICR will assess the performance of the loan against the PDOs in the
DCA. However, as will be discussed below, this report will recognize that the project did,
in fact, seek to improve learning and teaching, and tracked indicators related to progress
in these areas. Moreover, the ICR will assess both whether communities were empowered
to take responsibility of their schools (as intended in the PAD) but also whether the
project helped decentralize education responsibilities and financing (as intended in the
credit agreement).

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
No changes were made to the PDOs.

  In terms of PDO indicators (discussed below):
  There is a discrepancy between the indicators included in the PAD and those in the
Supplemental letter to the DCA. The PAD lists ten PDO indicators:

  1.    Improved governance and management of education in Serbia as indicated by
defining the roles of various levels/institutions and the introduction of various tools,
systems and procedures (report cards, EIS, school board and municipal manuals).
  2.    Monitoring of basic performance indicators by municipalities (baselines set
during appraisal) including per student spending, municipal financial commitment to
education per student, student/teacher ratios by language group, etc.
  3.    Performance data on student achievement produced and made available to the
public.
  4.        Use of funding formula to monitor system efficiency and equitable per student
distribution of public funding for education in Serbia.
  5.    Improved ability of schools to design school development plans.
  6.    School Boards and parents more able to assist in defining school quality and
providing support to the principal and teaching staff.
  7.    Teachers more able and willing to be flexible and inventive in teaching methods.
  8.    Schools which have an improved physical environment and equipment.
  9.    Improved in-service training delivery capacity and utilization at the regional level.
  10. Improved teacher/student satisfaction with school life on survey.


                                            iii

  The Supplemental letter only includes three of these, slightly re-worded (i.e. number 1,
2 and 4):
  1.    Improved governance and management of education in the Republic of Serbia, as
indicated by the Ministry of Education and Sports reporting to municipalities on
performance, functioning of the information system and the existence of school board
manuals and municipal education governance guidelines.

  2.    Monitoring of basic performance indicators by municipality, including share of
local funding for education, overall spending per student and student-teacher ratios.

  3.    The production of standards-based information on student achievement in primary
education.

  Consistent with the differences in PDOs, the PAD appeared more ambitious (than the
credit agreement) with indicators clearly meant to monitor progress in improving
teaching and learning (i.e. indicators 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10).

  Although the PAD's PDOs did not explicitly mention decentralizing education
responsibilities and financing as does the DCA, one indicator ("Use of funding formula to
monitor system efficiency and equitable per student distribution of public funding for
education in Serbia") was clearly meant to capture progress on this front.

  Below, the three outcome indicators listed in the Supplemental Letter are listed first but
four additional indicators (from the PAD) which focus on improving teaching and the
school's involvement in improving learning (e.g. via school development plans) and
progress on decentralizing are also included. Combined, these seven outcome indicators
and their associated 12 output indicators provide ample evidence about the status of the
project's five objectives. In addition, the ICR looked separately at the three remaining
indicators in the PAD to ensure that their status, too, were consistent with the conclusions
drawn in this report.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Background
Nearly ten years of strife, international isolation and poor economic management
devastated the economy of the area today known as the Republic of Serbia. The economy
suffered severely during the ten years of conflict­ GDP in 2001 was less than half its
level at the beginning of 1990s, and the number of poor doubled.

In 2000/01, the newly elected government of the Republic of Serbia (then known as the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) started to mobilize international support for
macroeconomic and public finance reforms. The World Bank and the European
Commission responded with an Economic Recovery and Transition Program (ERTP)
which outlined four major objectives of short- and medium-term policy reforms: (i)
restoring macroeconomic stability and external balance; (ii) stimulating growth and
creating a basis for a sustainable supply response; (iii) improving social wellbeing of the
most vulnerable and building human capital; and (iv) investing in improved governance
and effective institutions.

Sector Background
In this tumultuous environment, the education sector also suffered. During the period
when Serbia was part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the government
created an extensive network and cadre of primary schools and teachers and provided
nearly universal access to basic education (primary GER was 98.9 percent in 1990/91).
However, as military conflict prevailed and economic performance and public
expenditures declined in the 1990s, basic education suffered from severe budget cuts--
per student expenditure for primary education fell from $554 in 1990 to $263 in 1999--
though enrollment rates remained high and Serbia is on track to meet the Millennium
Development Goals for education.1

By the time of project appraisal (2002), the government had identified restructuring and
improving the public education system as a key priority area for facilitating economic
recovery and promoting economic competitiveness, for creating a democratic society, and
for re-integrating Serbia into the international community. A government strategic paper
(from 2002) outlined an ambitious reform agenda to which the project was aligned.


Rationale for Bank Assistance
The Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) (from 2001) was to provide the
government with analytical and advisory assistance, adjustment lending, technical

assistance and investment operations. Within this overall assistance framework, the
Bank's aimed to support government efforts to improve efficiency and the quality of
education service delivery among other social and economic services by providing
technical assistance to develop reform strategies, draft legislation and build capacity
where the Bank has comparative advantages.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The project development objectives (PDO), as stated in the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA), is to: "assist the Republic of Serbia to further define and begin to
implement a process of education reform through strengthening institutional capacity,
improving information collection, and decentralizing education responsibilities and
financing."

It is important to note that the PDO statement in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
includes an additional objective of "improving teaching and learning in schools." Also,
the PDO in the PAD does not have an explicit goal, as in the DCA, about "decentralizing
education responsibilities and financing." Rather than aiming for a formal process of
decentralization, the PAD emphasizes "empowering local communities to take
responsibility for their schools". The reasons for the discrepancy between the DCA and
the PAD are not clear. However, judging from the design of the project in the detailed
project description in the DCA and in the PAD, it is unambiguous that the project aimed
at a broader set of objectives than those formally stated in the DCA.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

No changes were made to the PDOs.

(a) PDO Indicator(s)

The key performance outcome indicators, as stated in the PAD, are as follows:

    1. Improved governance and management of education in Serbia as indicated by
        defining the roles of various levels/institutions and the introduction of various
        tools, systems and procedures (report cards, EIS, school board and municipal
        manuals).
    2. Monitoring of basic performance indicators by municipalities (baselines set
        during appraisal) including per student spending, municipal financial commitment
        to education per student, student/teacher ratios by language group, etc.
    3. Use of funding formula to monitor system efficiency and equitable per student
        distribution of public funding for education in Serbia.
    4. Performance data on student achievement produced and made available to the
        public.


                                             2

    5. Improved ability of schools to design school development plans.
    6. School Boards and parents more able to assist in defining school quality and
        providing support to the principal and teaching staff.
    7. Teachers more able and willing to be flexible and inventive in teaching methods.
    8. Schools which have an improved physical environment and equipment.
    9. Improved in-service training delivery capacity and utilization at the regional level.
    10. Improved teacher/student satisfaction with school life on survey.

It is important to note that the Supplemental Letter to the DCA only included three of the
above mentioned indicators, i.e. number 1, 2 and 4 (with slightly altered language). No
subsequent legally binding letters were exchanged between the Government of Serbia
and the Bank regarding expanding or changing the list of project outcome indicators.

The intention of this ICR is to assess performance of the project in line with PDOs in the
DCA and in the PAD. Therefore, this ICR uses a select number of indicators which are
clearly linked to measuring the objectives of the project: indicators 1-7.

(b) Intermediate Outcome Indicator(s)

The PAD listed 28 component output indicators: 9 indicators for the School Grants
Component; 4 indicators for the Decentralization Component; 5 indicators for the
Education Information System (EIS) Component; 8 indicators for the Student Assessment
and Development Component; and 2 indicators for the Project Management Component.

During the MTR (in February 2005), the list of component output indicators was
condensed to 12, with three indicators for each of the four main components of the
project. This was formally agreed on with Government and reflected in a letter dated
May 20, 2005. The relationship between the PDOs, outcome and output indicators (and
components of project) is illustrated in a figure in Annex 10.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The School Improvement Grants Component was intended to directly benefit roughly
300,000 students and 25,000 teachers in about 650 primary schools (about 60% of the
total) and 50 secondary schools (about half of the general secondary schools). The direct
beneficiaries of the other project components, which were expected to improve the
quality of education, enhance efficiency in resource allocations and public accountability
for education, were education policy makers, government administrators, school
managers, education professionals, stakeholders and community, business and parent
groups.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: School Improvement Grants (total estimated cost US$ 5.66 million)
The objective of this component was closely aligned with one of the PDO (as articulated
in the PAD)­ to improve teaching and learning in schools and to empower local



                                              3

communities to take responsibility for their schools ­ by providing grants for schools and
their communities to design and implement school-based improvement projects. School
staff were meant to be trained in preparing school development plans, a process which
was intended to provide them with opportunities to analyze the issues and problems they
faced and prioritize their needs.

The school grant proposals were intended to be designed by teams consisting of teachers,
parents, students and local community representatives in primary and secondary schools.
The grants were intended to be used to solve school problems of priority identified in
school development plans.

The component envisioned supporting approximately 700 schools which could receive a
maximum of $7,000 per grant and be eligible to receive the grant only once during the
project's life. According to the project scheme, 40 percent of the funds were intended for
equipment provision and small adaptation works while 60 percent were intended for in-
service teacher training.

Component 2: Standards and Assessment Development (total estimated cost
US$ 2.15 million)
The objectives of this component were (1) to raise the focus on quality in Serbian
education by setting internationally recognized standards; (2) to establish a modern and
internationally-recognized system for assessment and examinations; and (3) to establish
and develop a sustainable Education Standards and Assessment Service for Serbia.

The Project was to support the government in establishing and developing a specialized
technical unit for standards, assessment and examinations, initially known as the Centre
for Evaluation and later known as the Institute for Evaluation of Quality in Education, as
a primary vehicle to develop a valid, reliable, practical and internationally recognized
system for assessment and examinations. The Project was also to provide training,
necessary equipment and materials, piloting assessment instruments, support for the
national costs of OECD/PISA-Plus and technical assistance to guide the activities listed
above.2 The Project support for recurrent costs of the ESAS was designed to decline over
three years to ensure its sustainability.

Component 3: Education Information System (total estimated cost US$ 2.66 million)
The objective of this component was to promote effective management of resources and
monitoring of academic performance at central, regional, municipality and school levels.
This was to be achieved by improving education statistical information and by training
school directors, school secretaries, and municipality and ministry staff to use the data for
performance monitoring and decision making for resource allocations. The Project also
aimed to develop an analytical framework based on per pupil-based funding to be
implemented by central and potentially municipal funding authorities. This component




2PISA PLUS was carried out by the Institute for Psychology of the University of Belgrade.




                                                   4

was intended to support the related goals of developing greater municipality and school
autonomy and community participation within a decentralized governance education
structure.

Component 4: Education Decentralization (total estimated cost US$ 1.1 million)
The objective of this component was to strengthen governance and management capacity
in primary and secondary education. Specifically, three layers of education management
were identified to be supported under this component. It aimed (1) to strengthen the
capacity of municipalities to assess the educational needs and support to schools located
within their jurisdictions; (2) to improve the capacity of school directors to manage
schools and to work effectively with the school board and the municipality; and (3) to
strengthen the role of the MoES and its school inspectors in supporting the improvement
of the management, governance, and performance of primary and secondary education.

In addition, because the overall legal and regulatory framework for political and fiscal
decentralization in general and for the education sector in particular was unclear, the
following studies on educational governance and management were planned in order to
understand the current situation better and identify suitable decentralization options for
Serbia: (1) municipal education finance and expenditure, (2) educational norms and their
impact on efficiency and equity, (3) transfer of ownership of public schools to
municipalities, and (4) transferring of republic financing to municipalities to pay teacher
salaries.

Component 5: Project Management (total estimated cost US$ 0.6 million)
A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was established and given the administrative and
fiduciary responsibilities related to the project. Coordinators for the various project
components were appointed from MoES employees for ownership and sustainability
reasons, except for EIS and Assessments who were hired externally on a consultant basis.
The PCU Director was also hired on a consultant basis.

Groupings of components to facility discussion in ICR

In the discussions below, it will be convenient to group the components in three,
reflecting their different nature and focus: providing small grants directly to schools vs.
working on strengthening the capacity of the ministry to manage the system vs. project
management. In monetary terms, the two first groups were roughly of the same size, each
approximately half of the total loan. This grouping was not, however, used by the
government or IDA during implementation, nor has it been agreed with the Borrower.

Minister/Ministry started to show interest in this component, they proposed a new
activity to establish model schools across the country. Hence, the model school program
was included under this component. However, the PDO related to decentralization was
not changed as a result and only the output (not the outcome) indicators were changed to
reflect the focus on model schools.

Other minor changes include (a) an increased focus on disadvantaged schools in the
school grant component (towards the end of the project); and (b) an increase in the
number of schools receiving a grant.

1.7 Other significant changes
The project received a six month no cost extension to support preparation of a Delivery
of Improved Local Services (DILS) project, through which several SEIP activities are
being extended.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry



                                            6

The project did not benefit from a detailed sector analysis because of the urgency of
addressing the needs in the sector. These included the physical needs of Serbia's
education system after more than a decade of isolation from the rest of Europe and
budgetary neglect due to war and economic mismanagement. A decision was taken at the
concept stage to be immediately responsive to the needs of the country by funding an
evolving reform process, rather than wait a year or more for a more refined and detailed
sector analysis to be produced.3 However, given the high enrolment rates, emphasis was
put on quality improvements.

Still, the choice of using a school grant as a main vehicle of the project was appropriate
given the project's objectives and a decade of experience of the Bank using grants in
other regions of the world to achieve similar objectives. At the time of the design, school
grants had been successfully implemented in both Latin America and the Africa region
for more than a decade. Although these projects were still not subjected to rigorous
impact evaluations, qualitative evidence was emerging that they were an effective way to
achieve objectives similar to those of the Serbia project in a cost-effective and flexible
manner (e.g. decentralizing decision-making, empowering local communities to take
responsibility of their schools, etc).4 The project in Serbia was one of the first to bring the
idea of a school grant to the Europe and Central Asia region, and this was wisely done by
first piloting the idea using funds from the government of Switzerland.

One weakness in the design of the school grant component was that it was only to a
limited extent integrated into the ministry's and municipalities' other activities. The funds
were designed to flow in parallel to other funds supporting schools, and the activities
envisioned to be carried out by schools were not designed to be carried out jointly with
the ministry's education inspectors. This lack of integration placed the component
without a clear sponsor and supporter within the ministry.

The choice of including a group of components to strengthen the capacity of the ministry
(group 2 in table 1) was also appropriate given the project's objectives (both as they were
expressed in the PAD and in the DCA). Combined, these components were well-suited to
significantly strengthen the ministry's ability to promote effective education reforms (the
first PDO in the PAD).

The project could also have benefited from a more realistic evaluation of the time it
would take to implement the second group of components. It can take years to build an
effective EIS and ensure that reliable data is collected, and it can take even longer for
end-users to start using the information for decision making. The same statement is
equally true for collecting data on student assessments. The project design might

therefore have considered how improvements in the quality of data available to policy
makers and managers could have been achieved even while the new, comprehensive data
collection system was being designed and implemented.




2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status,
and actions taken, as applicable)

Two factors gave rise to problems during the early stages of implementation: (1) lack of
experience in operating the Special Account set up for the project and misunderstandings
related to co-financing; and (2) changes in ministerial leadership. The first problem
slowed disbursements during the first two years of the project. Unfortunately, just as the
first problem was resolved, elections resulted in a change of government and a new
leadership which was unfamiliar with the project's objectives and procedures.

The change of government in April 2004 resulted in a significant setback for the project
and, in particular, for the group of components dealing with strengthening capacity of
education managers. The incoming leadership had not previously worked with the Bank,
was not aware of the project's objectives and activities, and decided to halt virtually all
activities, and close down the newly set up Center for Evaluation (supported under
component 2 on student assessment). While they were able to stop all activities ­even
preventing teachers from attending training courses ­ they were not able to close down
the Center for Evaluation. Apart from halting any progress towards meeting the project's
objectives, the halt of disbursements also meant that salaries to staff at the Center went
unpaid. As a result, some staff members who had been trained as part of the project left.

The problems were largely resolved by the mid-term review in February 2005. The
change in leadership left the project in limbo for most of 2004 and was not resolved until
early 2005, shortly after yet another new minister of education was appointed (in October
2004). Following the government's April 2004 decision to halt to virtually all new
disbursements, the Bank quickly downgraded the project to "unsatisfactory" and the
focus of supervision shifted to explaining the project to the new leadership. However, the
project remained at a standstill until a new minister was appointed in October 2004.
Thereafter, some problems persisted and it was only by early 2005, at the time of the
midterm review (MTR), that disbursements resumed. The new Education Law formally
closed the Centre for Evaluation, but a new Institute for Evaluation of Quality in
Education was established as a successor with essentially the same functions and staff.

While the mid-term review resulted in renewed commitment to an accelerated
implementation schedule, only minor changes were made to the project. The
inconsistencies in the project's objectives and main outcome indicators between the
credit agreement and PAD were not discussed, and despite the set-back (and somewhat
slow implementation progress), the level of ambition was not scaled back. Moreover, the
MTR changed the focus of the decentralization component (from supporting more



                                             8

decentralized financing and management to supporting "model schools") but did not
change the PDO to reflect this change. The mid-term review did sharpen the wording of
the output indicators. More importantly, the pace of implementation was significantly
accelerated following the MTR, suggesting understanding of, interest in and commitment
to the project.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design: While the outcome and output indicators were appropriate, there were too
many and the team should have paid greater attention to ensuring consistency between
documents and between PDOs and indicators. The inconsistencies between the
documents (i.e. the PAD and the DCA) obscured what the project's main objectives were
(e.g. was improved teaching in school, or decentralization of financing explicit goals or
not?) and which indicators would be used to monitor the project (e.g. was the
introduction of per capita finance an outcome indicator or not?). Moreover, there were
too many (28) output indicators, implying a very large workload simply to fulfill the
M&E requirements. Wisely, the team decided to reduce the number to 12 at the MTR.

M&E implementation: Impressive improvements were made in the M&E framework
during the course of the project and following the mid-term review the Government kept
regular and careful track of the agreed indicators. However, M&E continued to be
constrained by a confusing starting point from the design stage. As the project matured,
visible improvements were made in terms of re-defining outputs, and selecting clever
ways of measuring them (e.g. questionnaires administered to treatment and control
groups to assess stakeholder satisfaction). Reflecting strong commitment to improving
the M&E framework, the Bank team and the PCU were able to improve the M&E
framework further during the last year of the project. Because a formal exchange of
letters between the Bank and Government did not take place, this ICR continued to use
the M&E framework outlined in the PAD (and the MTR). However, the ICR benefited
from the numerous indicators tracked in the revamped indicators' table.

M&E evaluation: The ability to evaluate the project was gradually strengthened
throughout the project. To a large extent, the weaknesses at the outset reflects that the
World Bank in 2002 was only gradually realizing the importance of strong M&E in
project. In hindsight, it is likely that had the M&E framework been well-designed, an
evaluation of the project at the mid-term review stage would probably have signaled that
the project was in need of more adjustments with regard to the second group of
components to reach the project's objectives. By contrast, towards the end of the project,
indicators were providing timely and high-quality information on the project's
achievements (and shortcomings).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)




                                              9

Safeguard management performance: The environmental category for this project is C,
and therefore, no environmental assessment was necessary.

Procurement: Overall Borrower performance in respect of procurement activities were
considered as satisfactory.

Project implementation was responsibility of the PCU established within the Ministry of
Education (Ministry of Education and Sport as it was previously called) to implement the
project and staffed with experienced staff. The PCU was responsible for the fiduciary role
of the project (procurement and financial management) and performance of procurement
function under the project was rated as satisfactory. However, due to personnel changes
in the PCU (the procurement officer left the PCU before mid term review in Feb 2005)
procurement activities were performed by the FM specialist with assistance of the PIU
director which caused certain delays in procurement. At that time capacity of the PIU to
perform procurement was assessed as not sufficient.

After the mid term review, an employee of the Ministry was assigned the task of
procurement activities under the project. Due to the lack of experience with World Bank
projects, the officer was assisted by World Bank PAS which was considered as on-the-
job-training. During the course of implementation the officer has developed sound
procurement management procedures and an appropriate procurement filing system
which responded to the needs of the project.

Three procurement audit reports reflected above findings and/or comments.

In terms of financial audits, project financial statements were audited on an annual basis
by independent auditors and all audits reports had unqualified (clean) opinions.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed
by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

Many of the reforms started under the project are expected to be continued and, through
the proposed Delivery of Improved Local Services (DILS) project, extended. For
example, the Institute of Education Quality Evaluation is now fully funded from the
government budget and has a continuing program of national assessments and providing
support to teachers on assessment issues. The Ministry is committed to mainstreaming
the school grant facility, through an Education Innovation Fund which would be partially
supported through the DILS project as new innovations are introduced but with
increasing contributions over time from the regular government budget. The DILS project
will also support the next stage of development of the use of education statistics, through
piloting the use of reports cards for municipalities as they assume more education
responsibilities.

3. Assessment of Outcomes



                                             10

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Consistency with CAS (TSS) objectives

The project development objectives were consistent with the 2001 Transitional Support
Strategy (TSS) and remain consistent with the current (prepared in 2004) 3-year Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS). In particular, both the TSS and CAS emphasize the
                                       5

importance of improving the social well-being of the most vulnerable and building
human capacity (although the wording changed somewhat between the two strategies).
The two strategies also emphasize the importance of improving governance and building
more effective institutions (although the CAS places a bigger emphasis on the efficiency
and size of the public sector). The project's objectives were well-aligned with both
TSS/CAS objectives by investing directly in improving learning opportunities for
children in Serbia through the school grant program, and, towards the end of the project,
increasingly targeting poorer schools to ensure that the most vulnerable students were
supported with the grant. Moreover, the project's emphasis on introducing student
assessment and building an education information system are essential ingredients in
improving governance and building more effective education institutions.

Consistency with Government priorities and appropriateness of overall sector strategy
and project scope

This Project was fully consistent with the government priorities to improve its education
systems. In 2001, the Ministry of Education (MoE) prepared a Strategy Document
through an intensive process of consultation with domestic stakeholders and with
international partners, including the OECD, UNICEF, and the World Bank.6 The strategy
included (i) decentralization of the education system through a redefined role of the
central administration, regional and local educational authorities, (ii) democratization of
the system through stakeholder participation and inclusion of civic education, (iii)
improvement of the quality of education through establishing quality assurance and
evaluation systems, improving professional quality of teachers and developing new
curriculum and textbooks, and (iv) linking between education and economic needs.

This ICR assesses the performance of the project against a combined set of objectives,
from the DCA and from the PAD. In particular, the following five objectives are to be
assessed:

Assist the Republic of Serbia to further define and begin to implement a process of
education reform through
    (i)       strengthening institutional capacity;
    (ii)      improving information collection;
    (iii)     decentralizing education responsibilities and financing;

    and (added from PAD)

    (iv)      improving teaching and learning; and
    (v)       empowering local communities to take responsibility of their schools.7

The PAD did not explicitly provide linkages between the PDO and the indicators but, in
most cases, the wording of the outcome indicator indicates which objective it was
intended to measure. Annex 10 provides an illustration of the relationship between
objectives, indicators (both outcome and outputs) and the components.8

Objective 1: Strengthen institutional capacity.
Achievement level: Substantially achieved.

This objective is closely related to the first outcome indicator ­ improved governance and
management of education in the Republic of Serbia, as indicated by the Ministry of
Education and Sports [now, Ministry of Education] reporting to municipalities on
performance, functioning of the information system and the existence of school board
manuals and municipal education governance guidelines ­ and this outcome indicator
was substantially achieved as evidenced by progress made against the following
indicators:

    (a) Substantially achieving output indicator 3: Institution for monitoring and
         evaluation of education quality has been established on a sustainable basis and
         capacity for student/pupil achievement monitoring and evaluation has been




7In principal, there is an overlap between "(iii) decentralizing education responsibilities and financing" and
"empowering local communities to take responsibility of their schools" since the latter usually implies
some element of decentralizing. However, "decentralizing education financing" is a particular objective
which is not covered by "empowering local communities...". Therefore, this ICR will treat the two as
separate objectives.

8As the figure shows, given the overlap between some of the outcome indicators (e.g. both outcome
indicators 1 and 2 relate to the development of better information), some of the output indicators were used
twice to provide evidence for the achievement of different outcomes. Below, each of the project's five
objectives is assessed against their outcome indicator(s)




                                                      12

       improved. While the initial reports on the 4th grade results are of a very high
       quality, it still seems premature to conclude that capacity has been built to carry
       out in-depth analysis on a regular basis. Moreover, during the period where the
        initial center was closed down (July-Sep 2004), wages were not paid and this
        resulted in a number of specialists, previously trained for the job who decided to
        quit, though new staff were subsequently recruited and trained.
    (b) Substantially achieving output indicator 6: Schools which form part of the school
        database have submitted timely data to the Ministry of Education. By the project's
        completion 88 percent of all schools submit data to EIS.
    (c) Fully achieving output indicator 9: Ninety percent of school principals had
        training in school management and in using EIS for management of education.

In addition, the project supported
    (d) The production of school boards manuals and training of school board members
        in almost all of Serbia's schools. Specifically, school board manuals were
        produced and distributed during training in 1,174 schools.
    (e) Development of rulebook on professional pedagogical supervision.

By contrast
    (f) Output indicator 7 was not achieved per se: decision-making in education system
        is not yet based on data from unique EIS. But the EIS has been established and
        has become operational in the last year of the project.


Objective 2: Improving information capacity.
Achievement level: Substantially achieved.

This objective is closely related to the second and third outcome indicators ­ the second
indicator is monitoring of basic performance indicators by municipality, including share
of local funding for education, overall spending per student and student-teacher ratios
and the third is the production of standards-based information on student achievement in
primary education. As discussed below, five output indicators provide evidence on these
outcomes.

The second outcome indicator was only partially achieved because

    (a) Output indicator 6 was substantially achieved (see discussion above) but
    (b) Output indicator 7 was not achieved (see discussion above).

The third outcome indicator was substantially achieved by
    (a) Substantially achieving output indicator 3 (see discussion above).
    (b) Fully achieving output indicator 4: Empirically achievement standards have been
        produced for Serbian language and mathematics in grades 3 and 4 and for ten
        subjects for the end of compulsory education.
    (c) Substantially achieving output indicator 5: Student achievements assessed at the
        end of Grade 3 and 4 on a representative sample of 5% and 7% of students,



                                            13

        respectively. Moreover, Serbia participated in a number of international
        assessments. At the same time, a national assessment of student achievement at
        the end of compulsory education has not yet been rolled out.


Objective 3: Decentralizing education responsibility and financing.
Achievement level: Not achieved.

This objective is closely related to the fourth outcome indicator ­ use of funding formula
to monitor system efficiency and equitable per student distribution of public funding for
education in Serbia.

Two indicators provide evidence that this outcome indicator was not achieved:
    (a) Output indicator 8 was not achieved in the sense that the EIS has not yet been
        used to help rationalize financing; and
    (b) A funding formula was not introduced. However, analysis has been commissioned
       through the project which will provide useful input into a future discussion on
       how to implement a funding formula.


Objective 4: Improve teaching and learning.
Achievement level: Fully achieved.

This objective is closely related to the seventh outcome indicator ­ Teachers more able
and willing to be flexible and inventive in teaching methods­ and this outcome indicator
was fully achieved by

    (a) Fully achieving output indicator 11: Survey evidence shows that 80 percent of a
        representative sample of teachers trained for usage of modern teaching methods
        apply the skills to majority of lessons they teach. Moreover, there is evidence of
        an increased number of extra-curricula activities taking place in 10 percent of
        schools which received school development grant.


Objective 5: Empower local communities to take responsibility for their schools.
Achievement level: Fully achieved.

This objective is closely related to the fifth and sixth outcome indicators ­ the fifth
indicator is improved ability of schools to design school development plans and the sixth
is School Boards and parents more able to assist in defining school quality and providing
support to the principal and teaching staff. As discussed below, four output indicators
provide evidence on these outcomes.

The fifth outcome indicator was fully achieved by
    (a) Fully achieving output indicator 1: All primary and secondary schools (1684)
        made and adopted school development plans. In fact, the school development



                                             14

        planning process was seen as so powerful that preparing them became a legal
        obligation starting from 2006/2007 school year. The preparation was supported by
        training sessions held as part of the project. The school grant component provided
        grants for 803 schools (on the basis of the school development plans).

The sixth outcome indicator was fully achieved by
    (a) Fully achieving output indicator 2: Survey evidence shows that in 80 percent of
        representative sample of schools, members of relevant stakeholders expressed
        satisfaction with opportunity to participate in school development planning.
    (b) Fully achieving output indicator 10: Out of the fifty model schools which were
        trained in improving school performance in key areas, 45 were asked to mentor
        other "partner schools", suggesting that the training has been successful.
    (c) Fully achieving output indicator 12: A network of model schools has been
        established.


3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms,
least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)
Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return

Most objectives of the project ­ strengthening institutional capacity, decentralizing
education responsibility, empowering local communities etc ­ make a conventional
efficiency assessment impossible. The problem is that assessing efficiency involves
assessing whether an amount of money could be spent wiser to achieve the same
objective. In this case, the problem is that the objectives do not lend themselves to be
quantified and compared across countries and different project designs.

It can be noted, however, that for a relatively small amount of money (the school grant
component $5.66 million), the project demonstrated the importance of having local
communities involved in identifying problems and solutions to address them. The most
obvious evidence that this was successful is that the Serbian government decided to
introduce a law to make it a requirement for all schools to prepare school development
plans. Less clear is ­ the efficiency question ­ whether this could have been achieved for
less resources? For instance, could it have been achieved for half the resources (e.g. by
only providing the grant to half the schools?).9


Financial Rate of Return
No financial rate of return was calculated for this project.




9Investigating this would require a more rigorous analysis of how exactly the transmission mechanism
between school grants and political change works in different countries and is beyond the scope of the ICR.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory for the following reasons. First, in
terms of relevance, the project was highly relevant both in terms of the TSS/CAS and in
terms of the government's overall strategy and objectives. Second, in terms of achieving
its stated objectives, two of the objectives were fully achieved, two were substantially
achieved, and only one was not achieved. Taken together, the project achieved its
objectives with moderate shortcomings. Third, in terms of efficiency, the evidence is less
clear but the project did demonstrate that for a relatively small amount of money a lot can
be achieved. Fourth, although the project's total expenditure over four years makes up a
very small proportion of the total education budget, it affected every school in the
country (via the school development planning process and the new assessment regime).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Initially, the school grant component was not designed to target disadvantaged schools
but this changed after the mid-term review as evidence started to emerge that
disadvantaged schools had not submitted requests for assistance at the same rate as other
schools (because of poor capacity to prepare such requests). Even though this project was
not a poverty-focused project, it is crucial to include equity measures from the beginning
to ensure that disadvantaged schools and children are not unintentionally excluded. The
government and Bank teams did an effective job in using what monitoring information
was available to adjust the project design.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional
development)

As discussed above, the project had a group of components focusing on strengthening the
capacity of the MoES which were largely successful (e.g. an institute for assessment was
developed and is now fully funded from the state budget). Moreover, the school grant
component focused on strengthening the capacity of schools to identify and address
problems.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

A positive but unintended impact of the project was that the government decided to
introduce a law making it mandatory for all schools to prepare school development plans.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

None available.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

There is evidence that priorities of the project will remain government priorities in the
future. In fact, some of the key project benefits have already been mainstreamed in
legislation adopted during the project life: for instance, school development planning is
now mandatory for all schools, and is a basis for school grant support; and the Institute
for Evaluation of Quality in Education is founded and funded from the government
budget.

One indicator which suggests that risks to the sustainability of the PDOs are moderate is
that staffing of the EMIS unit continues to be inadequate. In particular, the unit within the
Ministry which houses the EMIS continues to be inadequately staffed, in terms of
numbers or their skills and knowledge. The preparation of a new education strategy
should also help create stronger demand for education statistics.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

As mentioned earlier, given the small size of the project, it was a wise and appropriate
decision by the World Bank to use the grant schemes as the main vehicle to achieve the
project's objective. While the main vehicle was appropriate, in hindsight, it is clear that
more effort should have been placed on the M&E framework to ensure that progress
towards achieving the PDOs could be tracked, problem areas easily identified, and the
achievements of the project well-documented. The initial problems with the M&E to a
large extent reflected a World Bank in which M&E were only emerging as an important
aspect of a project.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

Given the slow start in disbursements and standstill during 2004, the final achievements
of the project are impressive. Throughout the project, the Bank team was proactive in
supporting the main counterparts and the PCU in implementing the projecting. Bi-annual
supervision missions (a total of twelve) and a mid-term review (appropriately postponed



                                            17

for eight months following the change of government in 2004) helped counterparts with
the implementation, and problem areas were identified and discussed in Aide Memoires
and Implementation Status Results and Reports. When problems arose (e.g. around the
change of government in 2004), the team quickly highlighted the risks it posed to the
problem. Despite the setbacks, the funds were fully disbursed and, as discussed elsewhere,
the objectives largely achieved.

The quality of the Bank's supervision was reviewed by a World Bank internal "Quality of
Supervision Assessment" in September 2006 and rated as "Satisfactory".

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.

The Bank's overall performance is during project preparation, appraisal and supervision
is rated satisfactory. Good technical expertise was provided and the client was
appreciative of the advice and guidance. The team successfully overcame some
significant obstacles at the outset and during 2004 and provided practical solutions to
ensure that the project's objectives were largely met. The only clear drawback was the
fact that the team did not change the PDO relating to decentralization to reflect the new
focus of the component focusing on decentralization.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Overall rating of Government Performance for entire period

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The performance of the government varied widely between the early and late stages of
the project, as discussed below.

(i) Government Performance in the period 2002-early 2005
Rating: Unsatisfactory
There were significant shortcomings in the government's performance in the early stages
of the project and, in particular, following the change of government in 2004 as discussed
elsewhere. Moreover, disbursements were slow at the outset due misunderstandings
related to co-financing and lack of experience in complications related to lack of
agreement between the Federal and Republic levels of government regarding the
establishment of a Special Account. The problems related to the establishment of the
Special Account were resolved within four months of the project becoming effective.

(ii) Government Performance in the period early 2005-completion

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Following the MTR the government's performance improved substantially. A number of
steps were taken to strengthen communication and cooperation between the political
leadership and project management, including setting up a Steering Committee. One
example of the government's support for the project is visible in the financial



                                              18

contribution of the government. The Ministry of Education found resources to co-finance
the project even in situation when the Ministry of Finance cancelled provisions, as a
result of IMF requirements.

Shortcomings remained, however: staffing of the EMIS unit remained inadequate
throughout the project.




(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
PCU at Ministry of Education     Satisfactory


The performance of the implementing agency, the PCU, is rated as satisfactory by this
ICR. The PCU managed the project well and provided effective communication between
the World Bank and the project coordinators within the MoES, despite the fact that
important personnel changes occurred during the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

Overall, there was a solid improvement in the borrower's performance during this project.
Especially the government's performance improved significantly. This ICR's overall
assessment of the borrower's performance is moderately satisfactory, an assessment
which also acknowledges that the PCU performed its tasks satisfactorily.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Reflecting on the overall project, the key lessons that have been learned and/or reinforced
during project implementation are as follows:

Building institutional capacity in using student assessment data and education
information systems takes time, especially if limited data are available at the outset and
information systems have to be built from scratch. In five years, a country can reasonably
be expected to start collecting such data but getting education planners at all levels to
start using the data usually takes longer. Future projects should set more realistic
objective (e.g. if starting from a low base have as an objective to collect data but not
"built capacity") within a given timeframe. Moreover, rather than wait for perfect EMIS
to emerge, countries need to work with existing data systems and gradually improve them.

Objectives involving decentralizing financing and management of schools require strong
and broad government ownership. At the design stage, there was strong government buy-
in to decentralizing, leading the World Bank team to consider the political risk to be
negligible. Apparently, a broader political buy-in was needed, as evidenced by the virtual



                                             19

stand-still of the project (and in particular the decentralization component) following the
change of government in 2004. For future projects, it is important not only to agree that
the lack of decentralizing is a problem but also have a widely shared understanding of
and commitment to specific decentralizing reforms.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: School Improvement Grants (US$ 5.66 million)
The achievements of this component were impressive. The baseline in February 2002
was that school development plans was a completely unknown concept in Serbian
schools and parents and local communities participated only to a very limited role in
schools planning activities. Approximately half of Serbia's schools participated in this
project component by receiving training in preparing school development plans. This, in
turn enabled them to apply for the school grant which most of them received and
executed well. According to MoES documents, 80 percent of schools that received grants
are achieving goals planned by the school project (803 received grants (out of close to
1200 schools in Serbia), i.e. 63% primary and 58% gymnasiums).

MoES monitored several indicators to document the progress of this component
(including indicators which were not mentioned in the PAD or MTR). For instance, using
a representative sample of schools in the program, MoES documents that in 80 percent of
the schools, members of relevant stakeholders express satisfaction with opportunity to
participate in school development planning. Moreover, in 80 percent of the schools
receiving the grant, local community participation in goods, services and money stands at
a minimum 10 percent (of the total value of the goods, services and money).

Component 2: Standards and Assessment Development (US$ 2.15 million)
This component was to a large extent successful but faced significant problems during
implementation. As a baseline, there was no institute in charge of designing standards for
learning and measuring quality of education, and Serbia had not participated in any
international student assessments. At the end of the project, an institute has been built and
staffed which developed standards for learning and begun national testing and Serbia has
participated in international student assessments (TIMSS 2003 and PISA 2003 and
200610).

Implementing this component was not without problems and this resulted in somewhat
slower progress than envisioned. When a new minister of education was appointed in
2004, the newly established Center for Evaluation (supported under component 2 on
student assessment) was closed down, though a new institution with very similar
responsibilities was established. Apart from halting any progress towards meeting the
project's objectives, the halt of disbursements also meant that salaries to staff at the
Centre went unpaid. As a result, some staff members who had been trained as part of the
project left, though subsequently new staff were appointed and trained.




10Serbia's participation in TIMSS 2003 and PISA 2003 were as part of the Union of
Serbia and Montenegro. Serbia's participation in international assessments has been
conducted outside the assessment institute supported by the project.



                                            22

Three output indicators (3, 4 and 5 in the Data Sheet) were used to assess the
achievement level of this component. Two were assessed to have been substantially
achieved (3 and 5) while one indicator (4) was assessed to have been fully achieved.

Component 3: Education Information System (US$ 2.66 million)
In many ways this component achieved a lot but faced very ambitious output indicators
which were, essentially outcome indicators. The achievements of this component are
clear: prior to the project, the MoES did not have a unique education information system
and by the end of the project it did. However, the output/outcome indicators for this
component were more ambitious: instead of requiring an EIS to be established, they
required decision-making to be based on EIS (a much harder goal to meet), and that
MoES uses EIS for rationalization of education financing. With the system only
operational towards the end of the project, there was little time to reach these more
ambitious goals.

Three output indicators (6, 7 and 8 in the Data Sheet) were used to assess the
achievement level of this component. Two were assessed to have not been achieved (7
and 8) while one indicator (6) was assessed to have been fully substantially achieved.

Component 4: Education Decentralization (US$ 1.1 million)
The achievement level of this component is mixed: in many ways this component was the
least successful of the project because it failed to support one of the project's main
objectives (decentralizing education responsibilities and financing). It failed to do so
because the focus of the component was essentially changed at the MTR. Instead of
focusing on preparing analytical reports to support more decentralization (which is what
was implied by the PDO), it shifted towards supporting "model schools", a concept
which seem to have been largely successful. However, this shift implied a new set of
output indicators (9, 10 and 12) which were agreed upon at MTR and all fully achieved.


Component 5: Project Management (US$ 0.6 million)
A project coordination unit was established to ensure timely execution of procurement,
and coordinate between the World Bank and the MoES and component heads. Some
difficulties were encountered at the outset since this project was the first IDA-funded
education project.

The PAD's M&E framework had envisioned using two output indicators to assess the
performance of this component but the output indicators were dropped at MTR.
