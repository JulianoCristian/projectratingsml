Much is changing in\n            the small towns and villages of Serbia. From Babusnica, in\n            impoverished southeast Serbia, to Citluk in the\n            Republic's central region, to Djurdjevo in the\n            developed northern province of Vojvodina, an innovative\n            education  program is changing the lives of students and\n            teachers in some 200 schools. And, with more residents\n            eagerly getting involved, the program is rapidly turning\n            into a movement. The School Improvement Program, Started in\n            2002, aims to improve teaching and learning in village\n            schools, as well as empowering communities to take\n            responsibility for their schools. Funds are only made\n            available once plans have been drawn up for school\n            development by the local education authorities, after\n            consulting with local people."}, "docdt": "2008-06-15T08:28:02Z"}
