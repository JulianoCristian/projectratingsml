6. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

The Third Ozone Depleting Substances Phase out Project assisted Mexico in phasing out
Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS). The project financed the incremental costs of
conversion to non-ODS technology for a group of priority cost-effective sub-projects in
four industrial sectors, contributing to reduce ODS consumption in Mexico.

This project was the third Bank-implemented ODS phase out operation (ODS III) in
Mexico. The first was the Ozone Protection Pilot Recycling and Training Project (OTF
21924, or ODS I), a USD180,000 grant for a demonstration mobile air conditioning
(MAC) service recycling sub-project and aerosol sector safety training sub-project. The
OTF Grant was signed on April 16, 1992, and closed on December 31, 1995. The aerosol
safety sub-project was not carried out because of contractual difficulties.

The second operation (ODS II) was the Ozone Policy and Institutional Strengthening
Project (OTF 21920), a USD4 million OTF Grant approved on December 7, 1992,
effective on June 17, 1993, and closed on December 31, 1996. Thirteen investment sub-
projects were approved, with grants totaling USD3.98 million. The realized phase out
was approximately 210 megatonnes (MT)/year ODP, with a cumulative grant
effectiveness of USD18.95/kilograms (kg)/year.

The sub-sections below describe the country context at appraisal and the objectives,
components, and main outcomes of ODS III.

6.1 Context at Appraisal

The Montreal Protocol (MP) on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was adopted in
1987 as an international treaty to eliminate the production and consumption of ozone-
depleting chemicals including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride
(CTC), methyl chloroform (TCA), and methyl bromide (MeBr). Scientific theory and
evidence suggest that these compounds, once emitted to the atmosphere, could
significantly deplete the stratospheric ozone layer that shields the planet from damaging
UV-B radiation. Under this treaty, developed countries must phase out ODS by the year
2000 (2005 for TCA and MeBr). Developing countries, also known as Article 5 countries
in the context of the protocol, benefit from a 10-year grace period. Table 1 below shows
the phase out schedule for Article 5 countries.

Mexico signed the Montreal Protocol (MP) in 1987 and in March 1988 became the first
country to ratify it. Under the MP, the Government of Mexico (GOM) committed to a)
freezing 1999 CFC consumption at average 95-97 consumption levels, b) reducing CFC
consumption by 50 percent by 2005, c) reducing CFC consumption by an additional 35
percent by 2007, and d) phasing out CFC consumption by 2010. The country's remaining
commitments under the MP are summarized in Table 1 below.

     In the early 1990s, the GOM launched an initiative to eliminate most of the consumption
     of CFCs by the year 2000. By 2001, 85% of the ODS consumption in 1990 had been
     eliminated.1 This was a significant achievement by the country, since it was only required
     to reduce its CFC consumption by 50% in the year 2005. This large reduction was
     achieved by eliminating consumption from the largest consumers and by regulating the
     production sector. In addition, a license and quota system was established on December
     2004. Any ODS imported to Mexico must be assigned a quota and obtain an import
     license. These tight controls have allowed the country to meet its commitments under the
     Montreal Protocol. By the time the III ODS phase-out project was developed, remaining
     consumption of ODS in Mexico was only in the smallest sectors, with small consumers.
     This made these sectors very complicated and required innovative solutions to make the
     project successful.


     ODS Phase out Institutional Structure and Project Background




     1As mentioned before, developing countries had a grace period until July 1999 to freeze their CFC
     consumption. Mexico went beyond the MP commitments and


                                                        4

At the time the Third Ozone Depleting Substances Phase out Project was prepared,
Mexico's National Ecological Institute (Instituto Nacional de Ecología, or INE) was in
charge of coordinating activities to promote phase out of ODS as mandated in the
Montreal Protocol.

In 1991 the Ozone Protection Unit (OPU) was created in the INE with a 3-year grant
from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Under INE's supervision, the OPU is
made responsible for establishing and monitoring the ODS phase out program. Through
the OPU, the INE was given broad policy, regulation, and monitoring mandates and later
sub-project identification, preparation, and implementation supervision roles for the first
two Bank ODS phase out operations in Mexico (OTF 21920 and OTF 21924). INE was
also responsible for coordinating with other ministries and institutions involved in ODS
phase out, including monitoring activities of the four multilateral implementing agencies
of the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund, or MPMF. These agencies are the World
Bank, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO), and the United Nations Environmental Program
(UNEP).

World Bank MP Projects depend on OTF enterprise beneficiaries to develop their own
engineering solutions, which are then presented to counterpart executing agencies and the
Bank's Ozone Operations Resource Group (OORG) for endorsement before transmittal to
the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund (ExCom) for funding approval.
Procurement for Bank-implemented sub-projects is the responsibility of the enterprises
themselves. In Mexico, grants are disbursed to the enterprises through the National
Finance Company (Nacional Financiera S.A., or NAFIN.

Building from lessons from ODS II, and to streamline sub-project processing, NAFIN
was appointed as sole counterpart executing and financial agency for ODS III.2 INE's
role was limited to oversight and official endorsement, but without active participation in
the clearance process. INE could review sub-projects for funding eligibility, technical
soundness, and compliance with the objectives of the MPMF, but NAFIN was to be
involved in clearance of procurement and disbursement documentation, selection and
contracting of technical consultants, and signing of sub-grant agreements. The
Directorate of Ecological Ordinance and Environmental Impact (Dirección General de
Ordenamiento Ecológico e Impacto Ambiental, or DGOEIA), now merged with INE,
reviewed sub-project environmental impact and risk assessment and coordinated
ecological planning and zoning to ensure that sub-projects were in compliance with
Mexican law and Bank policies.




2ODS II executing and financing responsibilities were divided between NAFIN and INE as follows:
NAFIN was responsible for forwarding sub-project to the Bank for review and approval, reviewing
compliance and procurement procedures, disbursing funds to beneficiaries, and maintaining project
accounts, but only after INE cleared each step. This process led to much duplication of effort during ODS
II, as well as unnecessarily long lead times for final approvals and disbursement.


                                                       5

In 2001 the MPMF changed its strategic planning from an agency-driven to a country-
driven approach. The National Ozone Unit in each country (e.g., the OPU in Mexico)
thus determined which industrial sector would be assigned to each of the four
implementing agencies. By the end of 2002, the OPU -now transferred from INE to the
Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources (Secretaría de Ambiente y
Recursos Naturales, or SEMARNAT-, assigned the industrial aerosols, sterilization, and
chillers sectors to the Bank. Even though the Bank helped the country eliminate ODS
consumption in the MAC sector, this was done before the sectors were assigned to the
Implementing Agencies (IA).

11, CFC-12, CFC-113, and CFC-114) was approximately 4,858 MT in 1995 and 4157.23
in 1997. Corresponding figures for Annex A, Group II substances (halons) were 284.6
MT in 1997 and for Annex B, Group III substances (1,1,1 TCA or MCF), 1,360 MT in
1995 (equivalent to 135.83 ODP tones).4

By 1995 CFC-11, CFC-12, and HCFC-22 were produced in Mexico only by
Quimobásicos S.A. de C.V. of Monterrey. DuPont ceased production in its two plants at

exports of controlled substances.

the end of 1995. Combined production of CFC-11/12 for all plants in 1995 was 15,737
MT, of which 70 percent was exported. Quimobásicos, which was owned 51 percent by
the government and 49 percent by Allied Signal, had a combined production capacity of
CFC-11/12 of 12,000 MT. HCFC-22 was produced in a separate production line. Plans
were to continue producing for currently viable export and domestic markets while
considering applying to the MPMF for compensation for an accelerated shutdown.
However, total country consumption of ODS was reduced significantly through
regulation of the production sector in the early 1990s. Consumption of carbon
tetrachloride in 1995 was 20,000 MT, almost all as feedstock for CFC production.5
PEMEX produced 11,000 MT of the required CTC, while the remainder was imported.
All CFC-113, -114, and -115 (120 MT total in 1995) was imported.

Of the nearly 5,000 ODP tonnes consumed in 1995, 3,247 (65 percent of the total) were
consumed by the refrigeration and air conditioning sub-sector. Aerosols consumed 3
percent, foaming agents 15 percent, halons 5 percent, and solvents 10 percent.
Miscellaneous sectors used the remaining 2 percent of the total. These figures
demonstrate the progress made from factory conversions. By 1995 air conditioning and
commercial refrigeration use and servicing were the predominant remaining consumers
by sectors of application.

6.2 Original Global Environmental Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
Approved)

The objectives of ODS III, as originally approved, were (a) to support Mexico's program
to phase out ODS consumption through technical and technological assistance and (b) to
strengthen the institutional framework in Mexico to identify, prepare, evaluate, and
administer sub-projects.

The original project indicators used by the Bank to monitor performance were (a) ODP to
be phased out (b) disbursements, (c) time to signing subgrant agreement, (d) time to first
disbursement, (e) cost effectiveness, (f) time to physical completion, and (g) time to
financial completion. Information on these indicators is included in the Project
Completion Reports prepared by the Bank and the GOM and submitted to the MPMF
Secretariat after each subproject is completed. Even though information on these
indicators is monitored, the outcome indicators were modified in 2002 to resemble more
properly the changes brought about by the country-driven approach developed by the
MPMF.

6.3 Revised GEO and Key Indicators (as Approved by Original Approving
Authority) and Reasons/Justification

The original objectives were not revised, but the project closing date was extended twice
at the request of the GOM. The extensions followed the pace at which the industrial

table 2.


                                                 7

sector adopted the Montreal Protocol commitments. The first extension was from June
30, 2002, to June 30, 2004, and the second was until June 30, 2006. The first extension
was requested to implement the chillers sub-project because the ExCom did not address
the chillers sector until that time. The sub-project was carried out in two phases. The first
phase finished in February 2004, and the second one started in April 2005.

The second extension was requested to address two innovative sub-sectors, sterilization
and industrial aerosols. The MPMF approved the first of these sub-projects in July 2003
and the second in December 2003, for USD0.53 million. The implementation time frames
varied to coincide with Mexico's Law of CFC Consumption. These sub-projects were the
last consumption reduction activities of the Montreal Protocol in Mexico.

The World Bank is one of the four implementing agencies that channel funds from the
MPMF to individual countries. The other agencies are UNDP, UNIDO, and UNEP. After
2001, it became usual practice for the grant recipient country to assign the different
Montreal Protocol sectors to the different participating agencies. The Bank was assigned
projects in the sterilization, aerosols, and chillers sub-sectors in 2002. The objective was
then automatically adjusted to phase out ODS in these 3 industrial sectors.

The project's main indicators of success were (a) Mexico's overall compliance with
Montreal Protocol control measures, particularly in sectors in which the Bank is involved,
(b) implementation of a chillers sub-project, (c) zero CFC consumption in two main
industrial aerosol companies in Mexico, DIMMEX and Tecnosol, by the end of FY06,
and (d) zero CFC consumption in the sterilization sector by the end of FY06.

6.4 Main Beneficiaries, Original and Revised

The main beneficiaries of this grant were Mexican enterprises that were introducing
ODS-reducing technologies approved by the Bank's Ozone Operations Resource Group
(OORG) and the ExCom. Global benefits also resulted from the elimination of ODS, as
depletion of stratospheric ozone could lead to significant increases in UV radiation
reaching the Earth's surface. Increased UV radiation could in turn lead to adverse human
and animal health effects, as well as ecosystem impacts. The ozone layer protects the
biosphere from this type of radiation.

6.5 Original Components (as Approved)

To support Mexico's phase out schedule, a grant amount was calculated according to the
country's ODS consumption levels from 1995 to 1997 and the thresholds per sector
established by the Montreal Protocol and estimated demand growth. The OTF Grant
Agreement in Mexico was signed for USD13 million. This corresponded to an indicative
ceiling. As an implementation agency, the World Bank therefore could present individual
sub-project proposals on behalf of the GOM for a combined maximum value of USD13
million. The level of funds requested could be much lower if ODS reduction was more
effective than originally planned, for example, because of Montreal Protocol policies,




                                              8

government regulations, market conditions, or new cost-effective technologies. This
indeed happened, as will be discussed below.

The project had two components: (a) an investment component to provide grants to
private or public firms to help them switch from ODS to non-ODS technologies and (b) a
technical assistance component to supplement NAFIN's technical capabilities in ODS-
related sub-project technical review and supervision. Project preparation resources were
to be requested by and channeled to NAFIN. International technical consultants for sub-
project preparation were contracted directly by the Bank, in consultation with NAFIN,
and financed through the Montreal Protocol Mexico project preparation budget.

The Grant Agreement did not specify which sectors the World Bank should be involved
in. It specified only that a maximum of USD13 million could be used for the project.

6.6 Revised Components

Component design was not changed, but allocations by component were adjusted after
MPMF's approval as follows:

  Component                                                                   grant allocated
                                                                                       (USD)
  1. Goods, works, and services                                                    5,487,282
  2. Technical assistance/recipient's fee and travel                                 231,442
  Total funds approved by MPMF                                                     5,728,724


Therefore, the total funds approved by MPMF for the country totaled USD5.7 million.
This became the final project cost, replacing the indicative USD13 million from above.
Approximately USD6.3 million of the notional allocation were not requested to the
MPMF because, first, the portfolio of projects initially identified was strongly linked to
final users in the refrigeration sector. By 2001 this sector was still not eligible for funding
under the MPMF and many companies had already switched to ODS-free technologies on
their own. Second, there are four implementing agencies preparing projects in Mexico



                                                9

and competing for MPMF resources. The NOU was in charge of coordinating activities
among the different agencies. Finally, after 2002, the Bank was assigned to work in the
sterilization, solvents, and chillers sectors. These three sectors were relatively small in
terms of ODS consumption as well as very difficult to deal with due to the number of
existing companies within each sector. The Bank succeeded in helping the country
eliminate consumption of ODS in all of these sectors by developing innovative solutions
that are currently being used wordwide.

6.6.1. Component 1 ­ Goods, works and services
As part of the investment component (component 1 in table 4 above), the MPMF
approved five projects in four sub-sectors. These projects were (a) technology conversion
in two MAC companies, Airtemp and Climas de México, (b) the sterilization group
project to replace CFC-12 technology-based sterilization equipment with alternative
technologies in the hospital medical sterilization sector, (c) industrial solvents, and (d) the
Mexico chiller concessional lending pilot project (two phases).

Table 5 shows the funds approved by the MPMF for each of these industrial sectors. The
only sector with less than 100% disbursement is sterilization. This was because the non-
ODS sterilization machines purchased cost slightly less than estimated. The US$ 22,568
undisbursed were returned to the MPMF.

Notes:
(1)The chillers project as approved by the MPMF Secretariat has an approved phase out of 5.0 ODP tonnes.
The initial target was to replace 20 chillers in two phases. Because a revolving fund was created using the
funds approved by the MPMF plus another USD0.7 million from the counterpart, the project surpassed its
expectations. By the end of 2004, the date of the PCR for Phase I, 13 chillers had been replaced, with a
combined phase out of 7.8 ODP tonnes and 100 percent recovery rate of the fund. By the end of 2005, 19
chillers had been replaced with a combined phase out of 12.1 ODP tons. Phase II started in early 2006.

A detailed description of each of these industrial sectors follows below.

MAC Sub-sector

The MPMF approved two sub-projects in this sub-sector, Climas de México and Airtemp,
for a total amount of USD4 million. The combined phase out estimated for this sub-sector
was 172.52 ODP tonnes, as shown in table 6 below.

Notes:
(1)ODS phase out for MAC projects is calculated indirectly. The ODP phase out for this project was
estimated as an average charge of 1.1 kg of CFC-12 per condenser, plus 2 kg of servicing in an
automobile's life. This methodology estimated that 110.5 ODP tonnes of CFC-12 would be eliminated,
based on an expected production of 35,650 condensers in 1997.
(2)Cost effectiveness is calculated based on the indirect ODP phase out.
(3)In the 3 years prior to the project, an average of 54,647 condenser units were produced at Airtemp.
Assuming an average consumption of 1.1 kg of CFC-12 per unit, the indirect phase out of CFC-12 is 60.1
ODP tonnes. The project initially presented to the MPMF assumed 3.1 kg of CFC-12 per unit, for an
estimated phase out of 162 ODP tonnes. The former phase out number was the one approved.
(4)Cost effectiveness is calculated based on the indirect 60 ODP tonnes phased out.

Climas de México. The project at Climas de México, the largest MAC producer in the
country, was approved in March 1998 during the 24th meeting of the ExCom. The
objective of this project was to convert the process of producing CFC-12 air conditioning
units. This included converting condensers, hoses, fittings, and assembly lines to HFC-
134a-compatible technologies such as the manufacture of parallel flow condensers, hoses
and specific fittings. The project was completed in 20 months.

The project consisted of changing the tube and fin condenser to a parallel flow design
that would require (a) a new multi-flow-tube cutting system and a fin machine for
manufacturing the corrugated fins, (b) a Nocolok furnace brazing process, in which
nitrogen gas is applied continuously and a non corrosive flux is utilized to effect proper
brazing, (c) an aqueous spray washer and drier system and a waste water treatment
system, and (d) technology transfer and assistance, product performance testing, training,
and consultant services.

Even though the project successfully replaced CFC-12 tube and fin condensers with R-
134a parallel flow technology, a problem arose that should be studied closely for future
MAC projects. Funding constraints forced the company to make business decisions based
strictly on the lowest cost and acquire equipment from different suppliers according to
the lowest quotations. Two different suppliers were selected for the fin machine and the
assembly machine. Integrating the two machines proved less effective than acquiring
both machines from the same supplier. Although the machine is now functioning
properly, it is not performing at 100 percent. Therefore, it is recommended that funding
for parallel flow technology be allocated not only on the basis of cost, but also on the
basis of technological factors that ensure the most effective production of R-134a MAC
units in a particular enterprise.

On completion of the Climas de México project, almost all MAC manufacturing
companies in Mexico had adopted R-134a technology. Only Airtemp in Mérida



                                                       11

continued to produce condensers that are used with CFC-12. The World Bank submitted
a project to the MPMF in 2001 to eliminate the use of ODS in Airtemp to ensure the
entire sector phased out the use of CFCs.

Airtemp. The project at Airtemp was approved in October 2000, during the 34th meeting
of the ExCom. The objective of this project was to assist the company in acquiring all
necessary equipment to convert its production of R-134a and completely phase out CFC-
12 from its MAC units. This project was very important in Mexico for the following
reasons:

    a. It ensured complete transformation of the MAC sector. Because Climas de
        México and Armas have already acquired R-134a technology, Airtemp was the
        only significant domestic MAC manufacturing firm left in Mexico that produced
        CFC-12 MAC systems and condensers. By acquiring the Cab (Nocolok)
        technology proposed in the project document, the MPMF ensured that the
        company switched its entire production of MAC units away from CFC-12. Upon
        receiving the grant, the company committed itself to producing only R-134a
        condensers. All CFC-12-based equipment was dismantled and destroyed.

    b. It ensured equity in the MAC sector. As mentioned before, Climas de México
        and Airtemp are the two largest national producers of MAC units. Existing data
        indicated that Airtemp produced about 5 times as many MAC units as Climas de
        México in 1999. Climas received about USD2.3 million from the MPMF to
        acquire R-134a parallel flow technology. Airtemp demonstrated the same
        commitment as Climas de México to phase out CFC-12 and sought funding to
        remain competitive in the market.

The Airtemp project was completed successfully on time. In addition to technology
conversions in the MAC sector, the project supported the preparation and approval of a
norm which, banned the production of CFC-based MAC compressors. This norm entered
into force in May 2004.

Sterilization Sub-sector

The sterilization group project was approved during the 40th meeting of the ExCom, with
the objective of providing incentives for hospitals in Mexico to replace their CFC-12/EtO
machines. The project was designed as a Terminal Umbrella Project, and an MPMF grant
in the amount of USD886,600 was initially requested to replace all existing CFC-12 EtO
machines in the country at a cost effectiveness of USD60.15 per kg ODP. The MPMF
approved USD288,700 to replace 14.5 ODP tonnes at a cost effectiveness of USD19.95
per kg ODP.

The GOM was given the flexibility to implement the project using the technology of its
choice and to meet any additional costs involved. No further funding would be requested
for the sterilant sector on the understanding that this would represent the total CFC phase
out in the sector.

Although the project initially aimed to replace sterilizers in hospitals, two industrial
sterilizers were included as the project advanced. Most of the hospitals initially identified
as potential beneficiaries replaced their equipment on their own. Other sectors were
explored because the project was a Terminal Umbrella Project, and no more funds would
be available for the sterilant sector. Table 7 shows the beneficiaries of the project,
including the ODP tonnes phased out.

Notes:
(1)This project initially had an approved ODP phase out of 14.74 ODP tonnes and targeted 17 hospitals
around the country. The funds were released late by the MPMF, and by the time they were available, all
of the original hospitals had replaced their equipment on their own. The companies and hospitals included
as beneficiaries of the donation were identified at a later stage, once the funds were available.
(2)The original phase out, as approved by the MPMF, was 14.74 ODP tonnes. The actual phase out was
19.94 ODP tonnes, showing that the project performed better than expected.
(3)The original cost effectiveness used to estimate the funds available for the sector was USD19.95 per kg
ODS. The actual cost effectiveness was USD13.35 per kg ODS. The higher cost effectiveness was a result
of the higher-than-expected ODS phase out.
(4)The MPMF initially approved USD288,700, but only USD266,132 was disbursed. The difference of
USD22,568

As mentioned before, the MPMF approved USD288,700 for this. Because not all funds
were used, USD22,567 was returned to the MPMF (USD18,354 from the ISSSTE sub-
project and USD4,213 from CEMEV). This difference was a result of the ISSSTE
purchasing less expensive equipment than initially estimated6.




6In the case of ISSSTE (six hospitals), the chosen technology was low-temperature steam formaldehyde
sterilization.


                                                      14

The project was completed on time with no significant problems because all equipment
purchased was off the shelf. The technology most often chosen was 100 percent ethylene
oxide (EtO). Following Montreal Protocol rules, baseline equipment was destroyed in all
cases. This project eliminated consumption of ODS in the sterilization sector in Mexico.

Industrial Aerosols Sub-sector

The industrial aerosols project covered the replacement of CFC-11, -12, and -113 used as
propellants and solvents for technical aerosols by non-ODS substances at the companies
DIMMEX and TECNOSOL. The objective of the project was to eliminate the
consumption of 26.81 MT of CFC-11, 4 MT of CFC-12, and 33.17 MT of CFC-113.
These two enterprises were the remaining eligible companies identified in the sub-sector
that still consumed ODS. The project was submitted as a Terminal Umbrella Project,
which meant that no additional funds would be requested for this sub-sector. Moreover,
the GOM committed to enact a regulation banning the use of CFCs in this sub-sector
once the project was completed. The project was required to assist Mexico in complying
with the 2005 and 2007 reductions control measures of the Montreal Protocol.

The project was approved by the MPMF during its 41st meeting in November 2003. Table
8 shows the funds and ODP phase out approved by the MPMF.

The project was completed ahead of schedule. The original closing date was June 2006,
but TECNOSOL was completed in May 2005 and DIMMEX in April 2006. With this
project, consumption of ODS was eliminated in the industrial aerosol sector in Mexico

Chillers Concessional Lending Pilot Project

The objective of the chillers concessional lending pilot project was to promote the
replacement of ODS-based chillers with newer ODS-free units that would be more
efficient in electricity consumption terms. The project design was a win-win situation, as
it brought about not only the elimination of CFCs, but also savings in energy
consumption. The pilot project aimed to replace 20 chillers in Mexico in two phases, with
10 chillers replaced in each phase. This sub-project was carried out by the Trust Fund for
Electrical Energy Savings (Fideicomiso para el Ahorro de Energía Eléctrica, or FIDE).
The MPMF approved USD500,000 per phase. FIDE more than doubled the funds for the
first phase, contributing USD700,000. Available funds were used to create a revolving
fund from which chiller owners could borrow money to replace their ODS-based
equipment. Energy efficiency gains from the new equipment allowed chiller owners to



                                            15

repay the loan in less than 2 years using only the savings from electricity consumption.
The innovative chillers replacement project established a robust methodology for chiller
replacement projects that can be applied easily worldwide

As mentioned before, 10 chillers were scheduled to be replaced during the first phase,
which concluded in February 2004.7 Instead, replacement of 13 chillers was financed
with the same level of MPMF resources as a result of increased building owner
contributions. ODP eliminated during the first phase were 56 percent greater than
expected: 7.8 tonnes instead of 5 tonnes. By the closing date of the first phase, the 13
sub-projects had been concluded. Chillers were replaced, baseline equipment was
destroyed, and 100 percent of the loans were recovered.

Project design. Overall, the project design proved very successful, as there was great
interest from chillers owners in participating and loans for the first phase were fully
recovered. The main components of the project design are listed below.

     a. Revolving fund. A central part of this project was the design of a revolving fund
         for long-term chiller substitution. Funding from the Multilateral Fund was applied
         on a 50 percent basis to the cost of chillers below USD100,000. When the chiller
         cost exceeded USD100,000, the excess was financed entirely by the chiller
         owners. Chiller owners were offered the following financial conditions:

              (i) Fixed repayment period of 3 years
              (ii) Loans either in USD or units of investment (UDI), inflation-adjusted
                  monetary units updated daily based on the consumer price index. Loans in
                  USD were either at 0 percent interest for chillers up to 20 years old or 2
                  percent interest for chillers over 20 years old. Loans in UDI were at 0
                  percent interest.

         FIDE developed evaluation and qualification criteria to prioritize the most cost-
         effective and efficient proposals and to share risks with chiller suppliers and
         owners. FIDE received 18 bids and pre-selected the 12 best projects. These 12
         projects were further assessed based on verification of potential energy savings
         using a proven methodology and a financial evaluation of the building owners.

         Repayment rates were highly satisfactory, with delays in only one case. All the
         funds were recovered by the close of the first phase.

     b. Verification measurements. To verify the initial energy savings estimates
         provided by the bidders, the performance levels of the existing chillers were
         measured. An international auditing company verified potential energy savings.
         In-situ measurements were taken both before and after chiller replacement to



7Although the project was considered completed by February 2004, the funds used to replace the initial 10
chillers were fully recovered and FIDE is still using these funds to replace additional chillers. By July 2006
19 chillers had been replaced in Mexico using these funds.


                                                      16

       assess the estimated energy savings. Bidding procedures stipulated that when the
       predicted energy savings for a project were more than 15 percent greater than the
       actual savings, a penalty should be incurred on the remaining 15 percent of the
       contract value.

       Measurements were made using the well-established temperature-dependent
       model developed by the Joint Center for Energy Management of the University of
       Colorado. Based on the results of the in-situ performance tests, the bidders
       adjusted the potential energy savings on the chillers to reflect the verified levels.
       Similar in-situ verification measurements were carried out on 10 new replacement
       Chillers using the same methodology.

       The results of the in-situ tests on the new chillers indicated that the actual savings
       on all 12 projects evaluated were within 15 percent of the predicted savings or
       higher than the predicted savings. Overall, estimated energy savings were 5.4
       million kilowatt-hours (kWh)/year, while verified energy savings were 8.0 million
       kWh/year.

   c. Owner contribution. According to the project design, the costs of freight and
       installation of the new chillers would amount to 13 percent of the total project
       costs and be provided by the building owner. Because the building owners'
       counterpart contribution was included as one of the evaluation and qualifying
       criteria in the bidding process, it was increased from 13 percent to 34.8 percent of
       the original project costs

Lessons learned. The main lesson learned from the chillers project is that it is feasible to
design a revolving fund that is sustainable over time and that can help speed the
replacement of chillers. Other lessons learned are listed below.

   a. The revolving fund design is easy to implement and can be easily replicated in
       other countries. It efficiently replaced a significant number of chillers with a
       relatively small budget.

   b. The procedures developed to measure and verify electricity savings was a key
       element to guarantee that chiller producers offered the best products and stood
       behind them.

   c. Loan conditions both in units of investment (i.e., an inflation-adjusted monetary
       unit updated daily based on the consumer price index) and USD were attractive to
       building owners, proving that a credit program in this sector is feasible.

   d. CFC losses (leaks) were much higher than anticipated. In one extreme case, the
       old chiller was supposed to contain 240 kg of R-11, but only 40 kg were
       recovered.

6.6.2. Technical assistance component

Regarding the technical assistance component, expected funds at the beginning of the
project were USD430,000, but only USD231,442 were approved by the MPMF. This
difference occurs since funds for technical assistance were approved pari passu to the
funds approved per subproject under the investment component. Since the Bank's
participation in this project was restricted to four industrial subsectors, the funds for
technical assistance were lower than expected. Nonetheless, the project effectively
contributed to the institutional strengthening of SEMARNAT and NAFIN. While
SEMARNAT gained considerable experience in negotiation techniques at the
international level and a better understanding of the mechanisms of several agencies of
the United Nations, NAFIN gained extensive capacity on project management and the
Bank's procurement and financial management procedures


 6.7 Other Significant Changes

Not applicable


7. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

7.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable

Building on lessons from ODS II, and to streamline sub-project processing, NAFIN was
appointed as sole counterpart executing and financial agency for ODS III. During ODS
II, NAFIN was responsible for sub-project preparation, procurement, and financial
management of the project, but INE's clearance was needed at each step of the process.
This process led to much duplication of effort and unnecessarily long lead times. During
ODS III, the arrangement of appointing NAFIN as sole executing and financial agency
worked better as a level of bureaucracy was removed. Capacity was built within NAFIN
to support the identification, preparation and supervision of projects.

To support Mexico's phase out schedule, a grant amount was calculated according to the
country's ODS baseline consumption levels and the thresholds per sector established by
the Montreal Protocol. The OTF Grant Agreement with Mexico was signed for USD13
million, which corresponded to an indicative ceiling. This is common practice for
Montreal Protocol operations. In 2002, following a worldwide policy from MPMF, GOM
clearly defined which industrial sectors to assign to the different Implementing Agencies.
The Bank worked on the sterilant and industrial aerosols sectors. In addition, the Bank
was assigned to work in the chillers sub-sector, an important component of the
refrigeration sector. This approach proved very successful and ODS phase out was
achieved at lower cost efficiencies than expected. Five projects in four different industrial
sectors for a total amount of USD5.5 million were approved by the MPMF.



                                             18

7.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at risk status, and
actions taken, as applicable)

The GOM has shown a strong commitment to adhere to its Montreal Protocol phase out
schedule. The GOM carried out different activities in connection with the diffusion of
ozone layer depletion issues. Additionally, the GOM complied with the revised Montreal
Protocol by committing to (a) freezing 1999 CFC consumption at 1996 consumption
levels, (b) reducing CFC consumption by 50 percent by 2005, (c) reducing CFC
consumption by an additional 35 percent by 2007, and (d) phasing out CFC consumption
by 2010.

The mid-term review (MTR) carried out on May 2001 concluded that, with regard to the
investment component, the project had not performed as expected mainly because the
portfolio of projects initially identified was strongly linked to final users in the
refrigeration sector. By 2001 this sector was still not eligible for funding under the
MPMF and, in addition, many companies switched to ODS-free technologies on their
own. By MTR, the MPMF had approved a total of USD2.8 million for this component.
Finally, the projects developed by MTR (i.e. chillers, sterilants) were in non-traditional
sectors and have included innovative schemes such as soft loans and financing by
equipment providers. These schemes had no precedent internationally and proved that the
ODS III operation had significant contributions that can be applied in other MO
operations. Regarding the technical assistance component, see section 6.6.2

Despite the issues related to the total funds approved for investment subprojects, by the
end the project, the total funds approved had doubled to USD5.7 million. Most of the
funds approved by the MPMF were used, as discussed in section 6.6 above.

7.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

Performance indicators as originally designed, included ODP to be phased out,
disbursement, cost effectiveness, and time needed to complete activities (signing sub-
grant agreements, physical completion, and financial completion). Information on these
indicators is included in the Project Completion Reports prepared by the Bank and the
GOM and submitted to the MPMF Secretariat after each subproject is completed.

Because the individual sub-projects were not known at the time of project preparation
and grant signing and the performance indicators were linked to the outcome ("ensure
that Mexico meets its commitments with the MP"), the selected performance indicators
were the approved and actual ODP phased out by each sub-project. Annex 1 lists these
indicators and shows that targets were achieved ahead of time. In addition, Table 5 shows
that the ODP phase out achieved was higher than the approved ODP phase out. With
fewer resources used than originally approved, the project was more efficient than
expected.

7.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance



                                            19

(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

ODPIII was rated as category B because no major environmental impacts or resettlement
were expected. The only safeguard triggered was OD 4.01­Environmental Assessment.
According to the Environmental Data Sheet for this project, sponsoring enterprises were
responsible for meeting emission standards, preparing environmental impact assessments,
(EIA) and obtaining environmental clearances as required by Mexican law and World
Bank environmental guidelines. The OPU ensured that the sub-projects complied with
these environmental requirements before they were officially submitted to the Bank for
Ozone Operations Resource Group (OORG) approval. Because of the nature of these
sub-projects, the impact was so negligible that only environmental data sheets, but no
EIA, were required.

Grant funding was extended under the project to sub-projects to phase out ODS in all
sectors for which the ExCom approved sector guidelines. Under these guidelines, the
ExCom evaluates and approves replacement substances. All expected environmental
impacts therefore were positive. The project dealt with existing enterprises and relatively
small quantities of ODS. Safety issues that might have been associated with some of the
substitute chemicals were addressed project by project.

Fiduciary compliance was ensured by working with a reputable government Financial
Intermediary (NAFIN) that was in charge of all disbursements made under this project.
NAFIN staff working on the project was trained both on Bank regulations and on the
specific requirements associated with MP projects (eligibility and fiduciary issues).
NAFIN staff was for instance invited to come to Washington once a year, to participate in
annual FI workshops that are conducted by ENVGC. NAFIN also worked in close
coordination with the project team, which included Procurement and Financial
Management Specialists. Procurement and FM reviews were conducted on a periodic
basis.

7.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed
by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The MPMF finances incremental operational and capital costs for sub-projects. All
equipment purchased was fully paid for each company (in some cases, firms had to
contribute their own resources). Because incremental operational costs were covered
during a transitional period, sustainability should not be an issue for any of the sub-
projects. Sustainability of the project as a whole was also guaranteed by establishing a
national legal framework (a law prohibiting the consumption of ODS) together with
economic resources. Companies were given incentives to phase out ODS, and when ODS
sectors were clear of ODS consumption, a norm prohibiting the consumption of these
chemicals was passed to prevent new companies from coming into the market and
resuming the use of these substances. Finally, regarding institutional capacity,
SEMARNAT had strong ownership of the country program to eliminate CFCs. The fact



                                             20

that Mexico has been in compliance with the Montreal Protocol is a good indicator that
capacity is adequate at SEMARNAT.


8. Assessment of Outcomes

8.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The ODSIII objectives were in line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). Most
important, the project was developed at a time when Mexico needed the most assistance
to meet its commitments to the Montreal Protocol. Under the Protocol, developing
countries were expected to reduce their consumption of CFCs by 50 percent by 2005 and
85 percent by 2007. The project helped Mexico meet the 2005 quota by completely
eliminating ODS consumption in three key sectors (aerosols, MAC, and sterilization).
Mexico is now on its way to meeting the 2007 target, as described in the following
section.

8.2 Achievement of Global Environment Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details
on outputs in Annex 4)

Project success is deemed satisfactory, as measured by three main indicators. First, the
fundamental objective of the project was to ensure that Mexico could meet its Montreal
Protocol targets to phase out ODS by 2010. The OTF Grant was established to ensure that
Mexico's CFC consumption decreased from a baseline of 4,624.89 tonnes to less than
2,312.44 tonnes by 2005, a 50 percent drop in CFC consumption, and this target was met.
Second, the results of the individual sub-projects targeted by the World Bank were highly
satisfactory. Third, the project built institutional capacity to bring long-term benefits to
Mexico, guaranteeing sustainability.

Mexico and its Montreal Protocol Obligations

Data on ODS consumption in Mexico have been very encouraging since 1994 as a result
of the government's commitment to comply with the Montreal Protocol. Consumption of
ODS has decreased consistently over time, as seen in table 9 below. The Montreal
Protocol called for consumption of CFCs not to exceed 2,312.44 MT in 2005. In that
year, CFC consumption in Mexico was 30 percent below this quota, at 1,604.02 MT.

The Montreal Protocol phase out commitment established three main reduction targets:
the 1999 ODS consumption freeze (national average consumption 1995­1997), a 50
percent reduction in ODS consumption from a 1999 freeze level by 2005, and a complete
phase out by 2010. Mexico went beyond simply freezing its level of ODS consumption
by 1999. Consumption that year was significantly lower than the 1996 consumption level,
close to the 50 percent reduction required by 2005.

Note:
(*)There is no consumption of Annex C Groups II and III ODS in Mexico. Annex B, Group I was phased out in
1998.

   Under the agreement with the Montreal Protocol, in 2005 Mexico's consumption of
   CFCs was not to exceed 2,312.44 ODP tonnes, consumption of halons was not to exceed
   62.28 ODP tonnes, consumption of TCA was not to exceed 39.48 ODP tonnes, and
   consumption of methyl bromide was not to exceed 904.64 ODP tonnes. Table 10 shows
   that Mexico met all these quotas.

   The projects in which the World Bank was involved have been successful in contributing
   to this ODS phase out targets. While market forces and government intervention have
   also determined this trend, the projects implemented by the World Bank and other
   agencies ensured that the conversion to non-ODS technologies was sustainable and
   prevented a recurrence of ODS use over the long term. Even though the Bank helped the
   country eliminate 252.12 ODP tonnes (5% of the baseline consumption), this was done in
   non-traditional sectors, where innovative solutions had to be developed to guarantee the
   success of the project. The schemes developed had no precedent at the international level
   and are currently being applied worldwide in other MP operations.

Success of Sub-projects

The Ozone Projects Trust Fund Grant was successful in contributing to the elimination of
ODS use in Mexico. The four sectors in which the Bank participated met their
expectations regarding ODS phase out. In particular, ODS consumption was completely
eliminated from the aerosols, sterilization, and MAC sub-sectors. Table 11 shows the
combined impact of the Bank's intervention in the four sectors.

8.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms,
least cost and comparisons. and Financial Rate of Return)

Montreal Protocol projects do not require a net present value (NPV) or economic rate of
return (ERR) calculation. The main criterion that determines the level of eligible funding
for these projects is the estimated ODS reduction expressed in kilograms multiplied by
pre-determined thresholds for each sector. Rigid foam projects, for example, are eligible
for USD7.83 per kg of ODP phased out. In the MAC sub-sector, thresholds do not apply
because all ODS phase out is indirect. Table 12 shows the final indicative cost
effectiveness.

   Notes:
   (1)The cost effectiveness for the chillers project does not apply because the funds from the first
   phase are still being used in the revolving fund and the second phase of the project started recently.

8.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of GEO, and efficiency)

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall performance of ODS III is rated satisfactory for five reasons. First, the GEO
was achieved because the country has been meeting its consumption reduction
commitments under the Montreal Protocol through a series of activities including the
projects mentioned above in which the Bank was involved. Second, the project
eliminated the consumption of ODS in the MAC, aerosols, and sterilization sectors.
Third, the aerosols sub-project was useful in developing a law prohibiting the
consumption of ODS in Mexico. Fourth, approved ODS phase out was achieved, and in
the chillers and sterilization projects, exceeded. Finally, the chillers sub-component
proved that it is feasible to design a revolving fund that is sustainable over time and that
can speed the replacement of chillers. This innovative sub-project is being used as an
example for all other operations worldwide.


9. Assessment of Risk to Global Environment Outcome

Rating: Low or negligible

The risk to the global environmental outcome is minimum; project sustainability is rated
as likely. Mexico has shown a strong commitment to adhering to its Montreal Protocol
obligations and should completely phase out ODS by 2010. The 2005 data show that the
country has been meeting its obligations and is well on its way to meeting the 2010
deadline. The closing of the Quimobásicos CFC production plant in 2005 (with the
technical support of UNIDO) is a strong indication that Mexico will meet its
commitments. The terminal projects implemented by the World Bank (sterilants,
aerosols, and MAC), by UNIDO (National CFC phase out plan and production closure),



                                                      24

and by UNDP (foams) addressed the remaining consumption in the country. In addition,
the GOM has raised public awareness of the need to protect the ozone layer, and
consumers are interested in purchasing non-ODS products. Companies that received
MPMF funding had to dispose of their CFC equipment, and NAFIN and SEMARNAT
supervised the destruction of that equipment. Finally, norms were passed prohibiting the
consumption of ODS in the MAC and aerosols sectors.

10. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues

10.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Satisfactory

Throughout the project life, Bank staff worked closely with NAFIN and SEMARNAT to
ensure proper identification, preparation, and implementation of sub-projects. Local
consultants were hired for project preparation and implementation. The Bank also
provided valuable support to the GOM in the strategic policy design and during its
negotiations at the ExCom meetings and hired highly specialized consultants to support
the GOM in key sectors.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision was adequate, as Bank staff worked closely with NAFIN and SEMARNAT
to conduct periodic supervision missions during the project. The Bank visited the
companies with projects under implementation and provided guidance and technical
support. At the same time, NAFIN supervised and assisted the companies throughout
implementation. Continual reports, including Business Plans, Progress Reports, and
Project Completion Reports, were prepared and submitted to the Bank and the MPMF
Secretariat. The MTR was carried out on May 2001, slightly over one year before the
initial closing date of the project (June 30, 2002). The MTR was carried out relatively
late because, first, the Grant Agreement became effective on August 1998, 5 months after
its signature, and second, because it was common practice to extend MP operations for
which there were subprojects still active. The main results from the MTR are described in
section 7.2 above.

To mainstream Montreal Protocol operations, Project Supervision Reports (PSR), which
were not required earlier, were introduced in FY00. Moreover, during the first phase of
the project, it was not mandatory to elaborate aides mémoire after preparation and
supervision missions, but this was done.



                                            25

With regard to safeguard policies, the MOD points out that "sponsoring enterprises are
responsible for meeting emissions standards, preparing impact statements, and obtaining
environmental clearances as required by Mexico law, and consistent with World Bank
environmental guidelines." Environmental screenings were always included in project
documents sent to the MPMF for approval. Because project documents were typically
prepared in collaboration between NAFIN, SEMARNAT, and the Bank, they had to
comply with Mexican laws and Bank environmental guidelines before being sent to the
MPMF.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The project helped Mexico meet its ODS consumption commitments under the Montreal
Protocol. ODS consumption was eliminated from the sub-sectors assigned to the Bank by
the NOU, namely refrigeration (chillers and MAC), sterilization, and industrial aerosols.
Innovative schemes, such as soft loans and financing by equipment providers, were
developed to eliminate ODS in these sectors. These schemes had no precedent
internationally and proved that the ODS III operation had significant contributions that
can be applied in other MP operations. Supervision was adequate, with periodic
supervision missions during the lifespan of the project--at least two supervision missions
were carried out each year.

Finally, in terms of project specific activities, the chillers sub-project developed a robust
methodology that is applicable worldwide. The objectives of the project were met in a
timely manner.

10.2 Borrower
(Check here if the Government and Implementation Agency were the same or
indistinguishable)

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The GOM was responsible for identifying the sub-projects and industrial sectors that
would request funding from the MPMF. With the support of the World Bank, UNDP, and
other international agencies, the government established a clear strategy to create
awareness of ozone depletion and prepare sub-projects in different industrial sectors. The
GOM's leadership and vision ensured that the program developed was appropriate to
adhere to the ODS phase out schedule of the Montreal Protocol. Hence its performance is
assessed as satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory



                                              26

Implementing Agency: Nacional Financiera
NAFIN's role as implementing agency was satisfactory as the project documents
prepared were done on time and were of high quality. In addition, supervision reports for
ongoing projects were also of high quality and always submitted on time to the World
Bank. The team at NAFIN worked very closely with the World Bank during the whole
project. The logistics for Bank missions were prepared ahead of time by NAFIN for the
World Bank, which made supervision easier.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall performance of the government during the project is assessed as satisfactory
for the reasons mentioned above. The objectives of the grant were met, and Mexico is
well on its way to phase out ODS completely by 2010.

11. Lessons Learned
(Both project-specific and wide general application)

The project was successful because of the following main reasons:

    a. Mexico reduced it's consumption of ODS by about 53% from 1998 to 2005.
       Consumption of ODS during 2005 was 30% below the allowed quota. These
       reductions exceeded the objectives of the Grant Agreement and have ensured that
       Mexico will adhere to its MP phase-out commitments.
    b. The World Bank implemented projects in Mexico phased out about 252 ODP
       tonnes. Consumption of ODS was eliminated from three key sectors: industrial
       aerosols, MAC, and sterilants.


The main lessons that can be drawn from this project are:

Sectoral Approach
The project successfully contributed to eliminate consumption of ODS from four key
sub-sectors: industrial aerosols, MAC, chillers, and sterilization. The sterilization and
industrial aerosols sub-projects were designed as Terminal Umbrella Projects, and as
such they were aimed at completely phasing out consumption of ODS in both these
sectors. This approach proved very successful because it gave the country the flexibility
to implement the project using the technology of its choice and the responsibility to meet
any additional costs involved. As a result, the costs of eliminating ODS were lower than
expected, making the cost effectiveness higher than initially estimated.

In addition, by enacting regulations prohibiting the consumption of ODS once these
substances were phased out from a specific sector guarantees the sustainability of the
project.




                                            27

Institutional strengthening
The project effectively contributed to the institutional strengthening of SEMARNAT and
NAFIN. While the ozone unit gained considerable experience in negotiation techniques at
the international level and a better understanding of the mechanisms of several agencies
of the United Nations, NAFIN's gained extensive capacity on project management and
the Bank's procurement and financial management procedures.

Revolving fund, chillers sub-project
The main lesson learned from the chillers project is that it is feasible to design a
revolving fund that is sustainable over time and that can help speed the replacement of
chillers. Other lessons learned are listed below.

        a. The revolving fund design is easy to implement and can be easily replicated in
            other countries. It efficiently replaced a significant number of chillers with a
            relatively small budget.

        b. The procedures developed to measure and verify electricity savings was a key
            element to guarantee that chiller producers offered the best products and stood
            behind them.

        c. Loan conditions both in units of investment (i.e., an inflation-adjusted
            monetary unit updated daily based on the consumer price index) and USD
            were attractive to building owners, proving that a credit program in this sector
            is feasible.

        d. CFC losses (leaks) were much higher than anticipated. In one extreme case,
            the old chiller was supposed to contain 240 kg of R-11, but only 40 kg were
            recovered.

MAC subsector
A problem arose while replacing tube and fin condensers for parallel flow techonology
that should be studied closely for future MAC projects. Funding constraints forced the
company to make business decisions based strictly on the lowest cost and acquire
equipment from different suppliers according to the lowest quotations. Two different
suppliers were selected for the fin machine and the assembly machine. Integrating the
two machines proved less effective than acquiring both machines from the same supplier.
Although the machine is now functioning properly, it is not performing at 100 percent.
Therefore, it is recommended that funding for parallel flow technology be allocated not

most effective production of R-134a MAC units in a particular enterprise.

12. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

Comments from NAFIN
Taking into consideration that the objective of the Grant was to support Mexico in its
transition to non-ozone depleting technologies, it is safe to say the objective was
achieved. The objective was met by providing funding to previously identified
subprojects.

Funding was provided to four subprojects: elimination of ODS consumption in the
production of air conditioning, industrial aerosols, sterilants sector, and cooling systems
(chillers). These four subprojects were completed successfully.

Regarding the "elimination of ODS consumption in air conditioning sector" subproject,
all funds were disbursed by May 2000. All funds available for this subproject were
disbursed. The industrial aerosols subproject not only eliminated the amount of ODS
established in the project report, but it completed the elimination ahead of schedule. All
funds were also disbursed in this subproject. With respect to the sterilants subproject,
new beneficiaries (different to the initially selected) were identified. Even with this
change the project eliminated the consumption of ODS initially expected. Execution of
the sterilant subproject was slower than expected, but the objectives of the subproject
were still met on schedule. A total of 76% of the funds assigned to the sterilants
subproject were disbursed. The funds not used were due to the fact that ISSSTE
purchased equipment that was less expensive than initially estimated. This equipment
was also eligible under the grant agreement. Finally, the first phase of the chillers
subproject was finished before the project closing date. The second phase was recently
started, but will remain active until the point that there are no companies available to
replace equipment.

Regarding disbursements, NAFIN considers that all of them were carried on time, except
tose delays that may have existed due to the nature of the execution of the subproject.
Finally, the funds approved by the ExCom were disbursed.

Taking into consideration the description above, it is clear that both the ICR and the
project's audit show that the execution, management, and financial aspects of the Grant
were handled with high quality standards. This helped achieve the objectives and results
expected from the implementation of the project.

Comments from SEMARNAT
In our opinion, the ICR is complete and it includes all the information of the execution of
the projects carried out in Mexico. The project can be satisfactorily closed with this
report.

The lessons learned of the project are:

1- Strategic planning of the execution of subprojects: Projects were correctly executed,
without delays, providing appropriate engineering solutions, and without major mishaps
thanks to the clear definition of objectives, time scales, and responsibilities in each stage
of the project.

2- Supervision of subprojects: The key to successful implementation of the objectives of
the project was the continuous monitoring of the status of subprojects.

3- Efficient and effective management of the projects resources: By managing resources
effectively and efficiently once the subprojects were defined, the project was executed on
schedule and without cost overruns.

The project faced the following difficulties:

1- Lack of inter-institutional agreements: Even though these were not the responsibility
of the executing and implementing agencies, they translated into small delays in the
execution of the project. These delays were solved by adopting a proactive attitude and
by monitoring subprojects permanently in order to return to the original schedule.

2- Delay in the assignment of resources for the chillers project: This problem was solved
thanks to the political will of the authorities at SEMARNAT, as well as the adjustments
in the World Bank Work Plan submitted to the Montreal Protocol. These actions allowed
the second stage of the chillers project to take place.

Annex 1. Results Framework Analysis

Global Environment Objectives

The objectives of ODS III, as originally approved, were (a) to support Mexico's program
to phase out ODS consumption through technical and technological assistance and (b) to
strengthen the institutional framework in Mexico to identify, prepare, evaluate, and
administer sub-projects.

The original project indicators used by the Bank to monitor performance were (a) ODP to
be phased out (b) disbursements, (c) time to signing subgrant agreement, (d) time to first
disbursement, (e) cost effectiveness, (f) time to physical completion, and (g) time to
financial completion. Information on these indicators is included in the Project
Completion Reports prepared by the Bank and the GOM and submitted to the MPMF
Secretariat after each subproject is completed. Even though information on these
indicators is monitored, the outcome indicators were modified in 2002 to resemble more
properly the changes brought about by the country-driven approach developed by the
MPMF.

Revised Global Environment Objectives
The original objectives were not revised, but the project closing date was extended twice
at the request of the GOM. The extensions followed the pace at which the industrial
sector adopted the Montreal Protocol commitments. The first extension was from June
30, 2002, to June 30, 2004, and the second was until June 30, 2006. The first extension
was requested to implement the chillers sub-project because the ExCom did not address
the chillers sector until that time. The sub-project was carried out in two phases. The first
phase finished in February 2004, and the second one started in April 2005.

The second extension was requested to address two innovative sub-sectors, sterilization
and industrial aerosols. The MPMF approved the first of these sub-projects in July 2003
and the second in December 2003, for USD0.53 million. The implementation time
frames varied to coincide with Mexico's Law of CFC Consumption. These sub-projects
were the last consumption reduction activities of the Montreal Protocol in Mexico.

The World Bank is one of the four implementing agencies that channel funds from the
MPMF to individual countries. The other agencies are UNDP, UNIDO, and UNEP. After
2001, it became usual practice for the grant recipient country to assign the different
Montreal Protocol sectors to the different participating agencies. The Bank was assigned
projects in the sterilization, aerosols, and chillers sub-sectors in 2002. The objective was
then automatically adjusted to phase out ODS in these 3 industrial sectors.

The project's main indicators of success were (a) Mexico's overall compliance with
Montreal Protocol control measures, particularly in sectors in which the Bank is
involved, (b) implementation of a chillers sub-project, (c) zero CFC consumption in two
main industrial aerosol companies in Mexico, DIMMEX and Tecnosol, by the end of

Annex 8. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Comments by NAFIN

The ICR has been reviewed and we consider it contains all information related with the execution
of the project. Additionally, it provides a clear synthesis about the project's background and
achievements.

It is important to point out that NAFIN, as the Financial and Executing Agency for the project, is
fully satisfied with the project achievements. The ICR shows that, not only the environmental
targets were met, but in some cases these were surpassed. This can be translated into and efficient
use of the resources, in particular in NAFIN's role as Financial and Executing Agency.

In addition, NAFIN considers that the ICR contains the data necessary to evaluate objectively
each of the components of the Project, from planning to implementation to achievements. These
data will allow future work to analyze the implementation mechanism, and if necessary, to
replicate it in the planning structure of other projects in the same sector.

Finally, the Project shows, in a very general way but without losing the important details, the
entire process followed to execute the project. In this sense, the ICR is a valuable resource to
keep in the Grant's file.
