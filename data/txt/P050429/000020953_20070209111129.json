Project\n            in Mexico were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk\n            to global environment outcome was low or negligible, and\n            both the Bank and Borrower performances were satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned included: (a) the project successfully\n            contributed to eliminate consumption of Ozone Depleting\n            Substances (ODS) from four key sub-sectors: industrial\n            aerosols, mobile air conditioning (MAC), chillers, and\n            sterilization; (b) the project effectively contributed to\n            the institutional strengthening of Secretaria de Ambiente y\n            Recursos Naturales and Nacional Financiera (NAFIN); (c) the\n            main lesson learned from the chillers project is that it is\n            feasible to design a revolving fund that is sustainable over\n            time and that can help speed the replacement of chillers;\n            (d) a problem arose while replacing tube and fin condensers\n            for parallel flow technology that should be studied closely\n            for future MAC projects. It is recommended that funding for\n            parallel flow technology be allocated not only on the basis\n            of cost, but also on the basis of technological factors that\n            ensure the most effective production of R-134a MAC units in\n            a particular enterprise."}, "docdt": "2006-10-10T00:00:00Z"}
