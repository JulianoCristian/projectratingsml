A report prepared\n            by the World Bank on El Salvador's education sector\n            reveals many related education policy implications,\n            including the need for: (i) increasing access to education\n            (especially at the secondary level where low enrollment and\n            completion rates persist); (ii) ensuring that disadvantaged\n            students can enroll and excel in school; (iii) improving the\n            quality of education at all levels; and (iv) strengthening\n            public-private links in education to guarantee that students\n            have the appropriate skills to succeed in the work place.\n            The El Salvador Government is implementing a long-term\n            educational development plan (2005-2021) called plan 2021.\n            This plan focuses on strategies to improve the quality,\n            access, and relevance of secondary and primary education\n            through three main components: (i) flexible delivery\n            modalities for secondary and primary education (for working\n            and or rural youth); (ii) programs to improve the\n            competitiveness of secondary students; and (iii) educational\n            networks (between secondary schools, vocational schools, and\n            universities) linked to a program that strengthens\n            vocational education both at secondary and college levels\n            while promoting the country's industrial development.\n            The World Bank loan seeks to speed up the fulfillment of\n            secondary education development goals. This new project aims\n            at closing the access and equity gap and delivering\n            secondary education for all Salvadorans. It will also aid in\n            improving the country's productivity, international\n            competitiveness, and social development."}, "docdt": "2007-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
