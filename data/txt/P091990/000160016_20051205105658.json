Representatives of local communities of Kisangani\n            in the Orientale Province, of Beni and Butembo in the\n            Nord-Kivu Province, of Kinshasha/Mbandaka and Lokolama in\n            the Equateur Province, of Inongo in the Bandundu Province,\n            of Kindu in the Maniema Province, and of Bukavu in the\n            Sud-Kivu Province, are signatories to the Request. The\n            Request for Inspection includes 32 annexes. The Requesters\n            claim that they have been harmed and will be harmed by the\n            forestry sector reform activities supported by the Projects,\n            which includes a plan for zoning the forests and, they fear,\n            the implementation of a new commercial forest concession\n            system. They note that the Project includes the preparation\n            of \"a forest zoning plan,\" for the forests of the\n            Equateur and Orientale Provinces, where they have lived for\n            centuries, even millennia. The Requesters claim that if the\n            zoning of the forests occurs without consulting the\n            indigenous peoples and considering their interests and if\n            new forest concessions are assigned, the International\n            Development Association (the \"Bank\") will be\n            violating indigenous peoples' rights and harming their\n            interests. They claim it will lead to violating their right\n            to occupy their ancestral lands, to maintaining the\n            integrity of their traditional lands, to accessing their\n            traditional lands and existing resources, to managing their\n            forests and resources according to traditional knowledge and\n            practices, and to protecting their cultural and spiritual\n            values. They claim this would then lead to the destruction\n            or loss of their natural living environment and their means\n            of subsistence, impose or force change in their way of life,\n            and cause serious social conflict. The Requesters assert\n            that their grievances result from omissions and failures of\n            the Bank regarding its policies and procedures. The Request\n            has been assigned IPN Request Number RQ05/2."}, "docdt": "2005-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
