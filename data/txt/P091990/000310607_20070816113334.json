the Democratic Republic of\n            the Congo Transitional Support for Economic Recovery\n            Operation were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high, the\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) By providing a framework for a\n            policy dialogue not only with individual sector ministries\n            but also with the Government as a whole (including key\n            ministries such as the Ministry of Finance), a development\n            policy lending/loan (DPL) operation provides increased\n            leverage for a number of improvements in each sector which\n            may not have been achieved through specific sectoral\n            programs or projects; 2) a DPL operation with a single\n            tranche disbursement for prior actions and progress\n            indicators for future reforms is sensible only if there is a\n            follow-up operation when the progress indicators are being\n            achieved; and 3) in post conflict countries, it is important\n            to strike the right balance between insisting on solid,\n            immediate reforms and not jeopardizing the fragile peace."}, "docdt": "2007-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
