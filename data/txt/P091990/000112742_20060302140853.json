The Grant\n            is designed to support key policy measures aiming at: (1) in\n            creasing the impact on the poor o f public spending in key\n            priority areas, education and health; (2) strengthening\n            public expenditure and civil service management; and (3)\n            improving governance in forestry and mining sectors. The\n            project addresses poverty reduction in two important ways at\n            a critical time in the country's transition from\n            post-conflict phase to peaceful elections. First, the Grant\n            directly contributes to maintaining a stable macroeconomic\n            framework conducive to economic growth by helping to bridge\n            the financing gap associated with implementing the\n            Government's Economic Program. Second, reforms which\n            the Grant is designed to support will have positive impacts\n            on poverty reduction. Improved efficiency and transparency\n            in public expenditure management will ensure that the\n            Government's budget priorities are increasingly in line\n            with the priorities defined in the Interim Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Paper, and result in actual releases of resources\n            to public service providers. In particular, better budget\n            execution of health and education ministries will help\n            improve access by the poor to public services provided by\n            these ministries, by reducing user fees which are currently\n            collected. Strengthening civil service management will help\n            restore motivations for civil servants to provide quality\n            public service on which the poor depends. Finally, improving\n            governance in two of the key productive sectors, forestry\n            and mining, will help the population share the\n            country's natural resources in a more equitable manner\n            and enhance sustainability of policies governing the sectors."}, "docdt": "2005-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
