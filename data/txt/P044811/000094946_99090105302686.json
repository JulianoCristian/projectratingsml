Financial Institutions Development\n            Project (FIDP) will promote the development of non-bank\n            financial institutions (NBFIs) in particular, and,\n            investments as a whole. Since the potential for NBFIs risk\n            of contagion exists, rigorous measures will be applied. The\n            project consists of two main components: 1) The resource\n            mobilization component will aim at simplifying market\n            regulations to facilitate bond and security issues, creating\n            and developing market oriented mechanisms. Rules and\n            procedures for bonds/debentures will be developed and\n            implemented, raising funds and strengthening marketing of\n            government treasury bonds. Both the Bank of Bangladesh and\n            the Securities Exchange Commission will receive training on\n            debt instruments, and, reforms will be implemented on the\n            government's national saving schemes. Furthermore, this\n            component will develop procedures for a secondary treasury\n            bond/bill market. 2) The component to strengthen financial\n            institutions will create the Credit, Bridge and Standby\n            Facility (CBSF), to encourage term financing, through a more\n            efficient financial system. The CBSF will, not only\n            facilitate funding to NBFIs, and financial institutions, but\n            will be institutionally strengthened through management and\n            financial technical assistance. The financial\n            institutions' capacity, will be enhanced through\n            business planning, and resource management. This component\n            will also revise CBSFs mechanisms."}, "docdt": "1999-08-24T00:00:00Z"}
