                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation progress has improved consistently over the past 12 months, in part, due to the recruitment of key technical consultants to address identified fiduciary and technical
                         gaps by the National AIDS Coordinating Agency (NACA). The next phase of the operation will intensify focus on the delivery of behavior change interventions, based on the National
                         Strategic Framework and sector plans, specifically to reduce multiple concurrent partnerships, support advocacy and delivery of safe male circumcision, and delivery of interventions
                         more strongly focused on the prevention needs of women 15-34 years.
